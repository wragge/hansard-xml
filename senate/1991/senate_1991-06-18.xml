<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday questions were asked of me about the right of Senator McMullan, as a Parliamentary Secretary, to take certain steps in Senate proceedings, and I undertook to make a statement on the matter. When Senator McMullan was appointed as a Parliamentary Secretary, a paper was prepared, and was made available to honourable senators who inquired about the matter, setting out the procedural steps which Senator McMullan could not in his own right take because he is not a Minister. With the concurrence of the Senate I will incorporate the paper in Hansard at the end of this statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from answering questions, which Senator McMullan has not attempted to do, the following are the procedural actions which, under the Standing Orders, only Ministers can take: moving the adjournment of the Senate; moving a motion without notice to rearrange the business on the Notice Paper; and tabling any document without leave. Whenever Senator McMullan has taken any of these actions, it has been assumed that he is acting on behalf of a Minister, although he has not always so indicated.</PARA>
<PARA> The ability of an honourable senator to act on behalf of another is recognised in the Standing Orders, and whenever a senator indicates that he or she is acting on behalf of another senator, that is invariably accepted by the Senate. I should point out that senators of all parties take advantage of this practice and that senators frequently act on behalf of other senators. If Senator McMullan indicates that he is acting on behalf of a Minister, therefore, the Chair will accept his right to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> The paper read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Procedures and Parliamentary Secretaries</PARA>
<PARA>The appointment of parliamentary secretaries under the Parliamentary Secretaries Act 1980 has raised the question of the exercise and performance by Senators appointed to such offices of the powers and functions conferred upon ministers by the procedures of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>This question was raised on previous occasions when parliamentary secretaries or assistant ministers were appointed. Prior to the passage of the 1980 Act, these office-holders were appointed on various and doubtful bases, but the issues of principle are the same. The advice now given reflects in substance the past practices of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate's procedures as they affect ministers may be considered in relation to questions, legislation, other procedures and Estimates Committees.</PARA>
<PARA>Questions</PARA>
<PARA>The relevant Senate standing order (SO 72) provides for questions to be put to ministers relating to public affairs and to other Senators relating only to matters connected with the business on the Notice Paper of which such Senators have charge. There is also provision (SO 72(2)) for questions to chairmen of committees. Most of the questions which are put to ministers, therefore, cannot be put to other Senators.</PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary secretaries could perhaps answer questions on behalf of ministers (see the discussion below on Senators acting on behalf of others), but the answering of questions involves significant principles of ministerial responsibility. The Senate has insisted on ministers accepting full personal responsibility for answers given on behalf of others, and ministers have been censured by the Senate on this basis. It would be necessary for the government to clarify the matter of responsibility if parliamentary secretaries are to answer questions.</PARA>
<PARA>It is suggested, therefore, that, if parliamentary secretaries are to answer questions, it would be best for the Senate to explicitly empower them to do so with the understanding that they are to be treated as ministers for the purposes of the Senate's procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>Legislation</PARA>
<PARA>The new procedures which were adopted by the Senate on 13 May 1987, and which are now contained in the new standing orders, draw no distinction between government bills and private Senators' bills; the same procedures apply to all legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>There is therefore no barrier to parliamentary secretaries introducing and conducting through the Senate any government bills.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact that parliamentary secretaries are office-holders of the executive government, although not ministers, is sufficient to place bills introduced by them on the Notice Paper as government business.</PARA>
<PARA>Other procedures</PARA>
<PARA>The standing orders confer upon ministers certain powers not possessed by other Senators, including:</PARA>
<PARA> * the ability to move the adjournment of the Senate at any time (SO 53(2))</PARA>
<PARA> * the ability to move a motion connected with the conduct of the business of the Senate at any time without notice (SO 56)</PARA>
<PARA> * the ability to table any document without order or leave (SOs 61 and 166).</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to these and other procedures, however, any Senator may act on behalf of another. The ability of a Senator to act on behalf of another is explicitly provided in relation to the moving of the adjournment of the Senate by a minister (SO 53(2)), the giving of notice (SO 76(4)), the moving of motions (SO 83(1)) and the moving or postponing of orders of the day (SO 97(3)).</PARA>
<PARA>If a Senator indicates that he or she is acting on behalf of another Senator, that statement is always accepted by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no necessity, therefore, for any further authorisation of parliamentary secretaries to exercise and perform the powers and functions of ministers in relation to ordinary procedures. A parliamentary secretary need only indicate that he or she acts on behalf of a minister.</PARA>
<PARA>Estimates Committees</PARA>
<PARA>The relevant standing order relating to Estimates Committees (SO 26(13)) refers to the committees seeking explanations from ministers of state in the Senate, and the practice has been for a Senate minister to be in attendance except on rare occasions of unavoidable absence. It has always been regarded as desirable for a minister to be present to ensure that questions which appropriately should be answered by a minister are so answered.</PARA>
<PARA>When there was an assistant minister in 1971, however, that assistant minister acted for a minister at meetings of an Estimates Committee. Presumably this was on the basis of the general rule relating to a Senator acting for another. Such a procedure would have to be acceptable to the committee in the first instance and to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed order</PARA>
<PARA>If it is proposed to have parliamentary secretaries answer questions, it is suggested that any doubt about their participation in other proceedings also be resolved by the adoption of an order in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>That any Senator appointed a parliamentary secretary under the Parliamentary Secretaries Act 1980 may exercise the powers and perform the functions conferred upon ministers by the procedures of the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Six sets of amendments are proposed by the Australian Democrats. The first set concerns the mandatory national code. The Democrat amendments that are numbered 1, 8, 9 and 11 are part of a set which is directed to the mandatory national code.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first amendment states that the registration of providers should be subject to compliance with a code of conduct at a national minimum standard. That code should be contained in a schedule to the legislation. This code is supplied by the Australian Education Council (AEC), which comprises Commonwealth, State and Territory education Ministers. It is the current definitive statement on national conduct and standards and was agreed to by all governments in July 1990. The status of the code, however, is one of agreement only; it is not mandatory. If Australia is to recover its reputation in this area, the Democrats believe that national standards must be mandatory and they must be vigorously maintained. Our amendment is supported by students and providers. It is beyond my understanding why the Government and the other contributors in the Committee failed to recognise the importance of this. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment there are two sets of national standards. The Australian Education Council and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee have each developed a code of conduct with set standards for providers of education services for overseas students. It has been agreed by the States and Territories that the first code will apply to all providers. The latter code, which is now being revised, applies to higher education institutions only. Obviously that is the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee's code. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only logical that a national code of conduct and minimum standards are enshrined in legislation. The Australian Democrats tried to achieve this position earlier through the committee process. The problem there was that the Department of Employment, Education and Training responded to the suggestion by saying that, apparently, all States and Territories had already agreed to the AEC code, so this type of provision was unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales has legislated to require compliance with minimum standards. Such a thing requires national parallel legislation. If New South Wales has seen that it is necessary to do this, obviously its experience has pointed to that. The New South Wales code of practice became operational from 25 January 1990 and was a regulation under the New South Wales Fair Trading Act 1987. As such, it provides a perfect model, which illustrates the need to have such a code legislated. The code was developed after consultation with industry providers. It is a mandatory code of practice which requires providers to give an undertaking to uphold and comply with that code of practice. </PARA>

<PARA>``SCHEDULE</PARA>
<PARA>Section 5a</PARA>
<PARA>CODE OF CONDUCT AND NATIONAL MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE APPROVAL OF COMMONWEALTH, STATE AND TERRITORY INSTITUTIONS PROVIDING COURSES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS</PARA>
<PARA>All Commonwealth, State and Territory institutions providing courses for overseas students in accordance with the Education Services (Export Regulation) Act 1990 must comply with the following minimum standards to obtain and maintain registration under the Act:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) the institution must demonstrate that it is financially viable and has the necessary physical and human resources to ensure continuing provision of courses;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) the institution must have adequate indemnity procedures or meet appropriate fiduciary standards which ensure protection of fees and provision of services for which students have paid;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) the facilities of the institution must be adequate;</PARA>

<PARA>(h) institutions must comply with nationally consistent course nomenclature and standards.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I have moved the amendments together because they are part of a set and are relevant to each other. As such, rather than waste the time of the Committee in having to deal with them separately, I thought it sensible to move them together. I have referred to the legislation in New South Wales, how it works and why it has been found necessary. I will describe what happens if an institution fails to comply with the mandatory code of practice. The institution will not be included on the register of approved full-fee studies, which is a prerequisite to obtaining a Commonwealth issued student visa. As such, the compulsion to comply with that code is well observed. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Australian Education Council's code already has common agreement supports the requirement that this code should be adhered to, rather than being something new which is imposed. This is the code which should be adhered to by the providers. The Department of Employment, Education and Training put the position that it need not be mandatory, but the difficulty with that position is that members of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training were presented with not one document but three separate documents which apparently contained that code. In other words, there was confusion about what the code was. It was very difficult, therefore, to have a sensible conversation or even a sensible set of submissions with regard to that. There was no single set of AEC rules, so which document was the Department referring to when it gave us its answer?</PARA>
<PARA> That was a problem we encountered throughout the Committee's deliberations. It has been referred to already by both the coalition and the Government sides. We found it another difficulty with this particular consideration of the code. There had been no one set of codes, yet the Department was responding as if there were one. The Democrats have now obtained the definitive document. It provides standards agreed to by Commonwealth, State and Territory education Ministers at a meeting in Canberra in June 1990. That is the code which we propose to include in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, with regard to the need for national standards, we should note the comments made by Senator Bolkus, representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), in this chamber on 4 June 1991. In rejecting the thrust of the Industry Commission's draft report, which is entitled Exports of Education and which was released that day, Senator Bolkus stated on page 4211 of the Senate Hansard that the Minister is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . concerned that the international education community is particularly sensitive about quality assurance matters and would reject Australia as a study destination were we to appear less than interested in accreditation and other educational quality issues. </PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that that justifies the inclusion of an agreed national code of practice for education providers. I fail to see why there is any reticence to include this. It is a genuine national code which should be mandatory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to indicate that the Opposition will be opposing all of the Democrat amendments. I do not profess to be an expert in the field, but just by having a quick glance at what is being proposed I note that the Minister may direct compliance with the code. That would seem immediately to introduce differential standards whereby some service providers have to comply with the code and others do not. The fatal vice of this whole approach is that, whilst they are noble aspirations and no doubt a worthy set of objectives, they would enable a government simply to tie up any institution with red tape in such a way that it could not move without ministerial approval.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply cannot accept the proposition that to have a requirement that the facilities of the institution must be adequate somehow constitutes a code of conduct. Normally there is a set of standards by which someone is aware of the obligations and then ensures that they comply. In a situation like this it would be impossible to make an honest self-assessment as to whether the facilities of the institution were adequate. One person might think they are, someone else may not think they are and there is endless disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not regard this as a true code of conduct. It might be a set of objectives. We may well use those objectives as a guide to the approach that we take. To enshrine them in legislation in the way that the Democrats propose is simply a recipe for tying up the whole system in such a way that it would probably be strangled in due course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the Government does not support these amendments. In the Government's view, the code is not necessary, given the roles of the States and Territories in the accreditation or registration process for the institutions offering courses to overseas students.

<PARA> It seems to me that, in endeavouring to do something super well, we may do it less well than is currently envisaged. Trying to discharge the same process twice at different levels of government does not necessarily mean that the process will be done better. It may mean that one gets conflict about the conduct of that process and it will be done less well. The proposed amendments seem to have no significant potential to enhance the operation of the Act and some potential to make it less effective. Therefore, as it is not necessary, the Government does not support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have here an example of the sort of confusion that is brought about when people do not understand what this is all about. On the one hand we have the Opposition claiming that parts of the code cannot honestly stand up to scrutiny when, in fact, the Minister has reminded us that all State and Territory Ministers have agreed to comply with the code. If the Opposition's position is true, one wonders why there is such unanimity of agreement with the code. If the Government's position is true-that is, that it is unnecessary-one wonders why the Ministers have agreed with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One wonders also what would happen if those providers chose to dismiss it and not comply, as there are no sanctions. It may be a gentleperson's agreement between Ministers of the States, but the simple scene could be set where one State suddenly decides, with a change of government, to take itself off and to the disadvantage of its neighbour States operate outside the previously agreed code. That, of course, may attract considerable business to that State. That is the basic commercial strategy that could be followed. We have no constraints to apply if that were to happen. We have this gentleperson's agreement and we have one State-New South Wales-seeing the need to make compliance mandatory, yet we sit here and pontificate about its not being necessary. I think we are just ignoring the reality that the States have already recognised. </PARA>

<PARA>Subclause 6(3) provides for moneys to be withdrawn from a special account. This may be for the purposes of health payments under subclause 6(3) (b) or for course fees under subclause 6(3) (c). Subclause 6(3) (a) refers to the third situation of withdrawal with the written authority of the person. The only acceptable basis for withdrawal under this provision is to access pre-paid accommodation and living allowances. It is therefore logical and correct to ensure that this withdrawal is with the authority and for the benefit of the person. Living expenses should not be used for other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment is concerned not so much with the risk of duress, which we recognise as well, as the basic uneven bargaining power in the relationship. That is something which is not recognised sufficiently in the rules, regulations and legislation that we devise in this place. Somebody who is perhaps unsure of English to start with is certainly not likely to be well-informed about consumer rights or the opportunities for other sorts of negotiations to take place. It is an uneven bargaining situation and, therefore, we think the person at the short end of the stick would be well served if these words were included in the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA> 3. Clause 6, page 4, paragraph (4) (b), line 35, after ``course'' (first occurring), insert ``or is unable to continue the course''. </PARA>
<PARA>Minister Dawkins has acknowledged that further institutional collapses could occur, yet refunds are limited under subclause 6(4) to the situation where a student is unable to commence, or voluntarily withdraws from, a course. That is the only situation where refunds are able to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> This covers the situation where a change in government policy prevents students from coming to Australia and, therefore, tries to prevent a repeat of the current taxpayer payout of over $50m to students left stranded at home after the tightening of these rules. The provision also means that a student who decides to drop out and work full time illegally, or a student who is perhaps poached by another provider, may claim a refund. However, the obvious and common situation where a student who has been attending an institution which then collapses is not covered. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of `withdrawal' in the draft regulations clarifies the fact that withdrawal under subclause 6(4) is voluntary only: it is where a student states in writing that he or she wishes to withdraw. It is ludicrous that a student who decides to withdraw may seek a refund, yet a student who is stranded because of an institution's failure has no such right. It is a major omission and fundamental flaw that has to be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> Subclause 6(4) serves to reinforce the obligation of providers to meet any refund. If it were extended to include the term `involuntary termination of studies', it could be construed as an acknowledgment of the government liability for all students who are currently stranded in Australia. I suspect that that is the danger. The Industry Commission suggested strongly-and we accept the suggestion-in a draft report released recently that this responsibility should be met by the Government. That is the report which causes Senator Tierney concern in that it is being considered concurrently with the legislation reaching this place, and I share his confusion about why we should be so dealing with this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission also recommends that students should no longer be required by the Government to prepay funds and that institutions should not be government accredited. I am not so sure about that, but I can see why the report states that the required prepayment misleads students as to the safety of their prepaid funds and also leads to pressure on the Government to guarantee those funds. With accreditation, that is an assumption which could be easily understood. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's current refund commitment extends to students who were attending institutions which collapsed, provided the students paid their money before-and this is a strange thing to understand-the Government's arbitrary cutoff date of 24 August 1990. The Government has decided to wash its hands of a further 4,000-plus overseas students who are also the victims of institutional collapses. Of course, none of these students were withdrawing voluntarily. That is why the Australian Democrats propose this amendment. The Democrats believe that the Government's responsibility to pay refunds should not be pinned on an arbitrary date. Looking ahead, the Government would best avoid liability by the logical extension of subclause 6(4) to students who are forced to discontinue their studies in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>4. Clause 6, page 4, subclause (4), line 38, after ``repay'', insert ``within 30 days after that non-commencement or withdrawal''. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 4 would place a time limit on refunds under subclause 6(4) and we seek to insert the words `within 30 days'. This subclause provides an obligation to repay and that obligation must be within a set time frame; if not, why bother repaying? That obligation can be extended forever. So we cannot see any reason why a time limit should not be placed on it. </PARA>
<PARA> An earlier statement by the Department of Employment, Education and Training in response to this was that the inclusion of a time limit was quite possible, although it raised three issues. First, a time limit would be interpreted as a maximum time available to defer a refund. That is fair enough. Some operators often see that; it applies to all sorts of limits that are seen as the maximum. I suggest that that is not a sufficient reason not to apply a limit. Secondly, the Department suggested that the time limit would have to vary according to course length and money owing. Thirdly, a penalty would be required removing the issue of non-compliance from State consumer affairs offices. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that this time limit sets a normal commercial time period. It is not an excessive period and according to legal advice the same time limit should apply once any course is terminated. With respect to the third concern of the Department, I point out that the provision already contains a penalty of $5,000. None of those, as far as I am concerned, provides a reason for not establishing a normal commercial time limit. Without that time limit this aspect of the legislation is as vague as the rest of the legislation. There is very little reason for compliance with it. I suggest that this sort of limitation should be applied just to bring it within normal commercial practice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is what it is all about; this is why we sought to have the code of conduct included. It may well be that some institutions see fit to engage in a contract which includes normal commercial practice. It may also well be that some institutions seek to exploit students or that some institutions decide to venture into an area which cannot be sustained commercially and they collapse. Many of them have collapsed because they have made promises that they have been unable to sustain. Rather than presume, as the Minister has, that the sorts of contracts which will be entered into are, in fact, normal commercial practice, we would like to take the track record of this industry and say that a great number of the contracts that have been entered into have failed because either the institution has failed or the contracts have not been up to scratch as far as what is normally considered commercially honourable.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a classic halfway position which, in our belief, is the right position. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the export education sector's record of and reputation for problems-its reputation has travelled overseas, where it is doing damage-whether of fraud, dishonesty or just institutional collapses for other reasons, the provision of six-monthly biannual returns would appear to strike an effective and logical compromise between the Government and the coalition's proposals. </PARA>

Under subclause 8 (4) the Minister may require information on the activities of the provider in connection with the recruitment and enrolment of intending overseas students and the provision of courses to those overseas students. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition proposes, as I understand it, to delete subclause 8(4). Instead, it suggests a new subclause 8(2a) which would limit the Minister's discretion to further information in three cases: first, where a provider fails to provide even an annual return; secondly, where the Minister believes that an annual return contains misleading or deceptive information; and, thirdly, where the provider is a private provider who fails to comply with the financial requirements under clause 6. </PARA>
<PARA> Even with the requirement of quarterly returns, the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training noted that problems can always occur in between periods. The Minister may receive information about allegedly serious misbehaviour which does not involve the financial arrangements as described in clause 6. But according to the coalition's amendment, the Minister must sit on his hands and wait for an annual return. As far as I am concerned, that is not a satisfactory proposition. We propose quite simply that we attempt this compromise. Associated with that, our amendment No. 6 is to do with the review of the operation of the Act before January 1993. </PARA>

<PARA> 10. After clause 18, page 9, add the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> Review of operation of Act</PARA>
<PARA>``19. (1) Before 1 January 1993, the Secretary shall review, and report to the Minister on, the operation of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) The report to the Minister must deal with:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) whether the Act has been effective in eliminating abuses and malpractices in the provision of education services, including the financial dealings of providers and recruitment and enrolment practices covered by the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) whether the Act has been effective in securing a uniform and high standard of courses for overseas students;</PARA>

<PARA> (3) For the purposes of the review the Secretary must seek submissions on the operation of the Act from persons in all States and Territories, and any such submissions must be attached to the report. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) The report to the Minister may include suggestions for amendment of the Act to solve problems identified in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the report is received by the Minister.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The final amendment provides for a review of the operation of the Act before 1 January 1993. We have serious contention with what is proposed by the coalition. A review of this Act, including public comment, is particularly important given the history of this sector and the need to develop an appropriate system of regulation. It is preferable to a sunset clause, which could also force a review but does involve the risk of a period of non-regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> As we understand it, a sunset clause could leave a situation where there is no regulation of providers in any particular State or Territory. Such a sunset clause could mean that any misbehaviour which occurs after the relevant date-that is, 1 January 1994-could quite easily go unchecked without any recourse and, as unsatisfactory as this legislation may be in providing for any recourse or any regulation, to remove it certainly provides no threat whatsoever. In the words of one provider, a sunset provision would mean that the industry would start to get on edge, because if legislation is not prepared in time, the whole thing disappears down a black hole-a black hole of ignorance about what might happen in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition argues that a sunset clause would encourage the States to hurry up with their own legislation. I fail to see how. I fail to see what sort of sanction is provided by the threat that the legislation before us now will be removed. It is hardly a threat in my understanding of what is going on. Indeed, the date for cessation of operation of the Act has been extended one year from the coalition's earlier proposed date and the argument is that this would give the States even more time to bring in their own legislation. But where is the compulsion? The compulsion seems to rest on the fact that we would withdraw this legislation, unsatisfactory as it is. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in amongst all this, the Department of Employment, Education and Training reports that all States are in the process of doing this anyway. Only the two Territories are yet to make any sort of commitment. They seem to be doing this in blind ignorance-I say this with some degree of irony-of the supposedly terrible threat of a sunset clause proposed by the coalition. In fact, I am sure they do not even know about it. To be able not only to do that, but to agree on their code of conduct without reference to what is going on here, shows me the very limits of what we are doing. Rather than propose a clause which removes the legislation, we propose a clause which certainly compels review of it, because that is certainly necessary. I suggest that a review of it would be necessary tomorrow. A review at some stage of where it is going and what it has achieved would make some commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be wrong and foolish, as I have already argued, for the Federal Government to continue to promote the development of totally disparate systems of regulation, which is something that we could have to a considerable degree without some sort of nationally agreed, regulatory standard of conduct. Australia cannot afford to operate any longer on the international market with several different sets of regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training had enough trouble as it was trying to find a nationally agreed code. We had the departmental advisers unsure about what the code was, and it was only when the Australian Education Committee's code came up that we were able to point to something which had some degree of consensus about it. But that was not generated from the Department's understandings. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation as it stands leaves so many holes and so little regulation that the States may be in the situation where they can create disparate and separate sets of regulations. What we ought to be looking for is the development of something from the Federal scene with the cooperation of and in conjunction with the States and Territories. That should occur as soon as possible after the release of the Industry Commission's report, which is still officially expected by the end of July, and then after broad public consultation of that report and the Government's intentions. </PARA>
<PARA> We are refusing to amend patently inadequate legislation which will achieve none of the objectives set out by the Government. The objectives have not been canvassed by the Industry Commission or the providers, nor has it been established that they are required by the students. What we propose to do with the legislation is to sunset it. Big threat! What we should be proposing to do is to at least review it in time to take into account the concerns of the Industry Commission, the providers, the State Ministers and the students. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in support of this amendment it must be noted that there are no guarantees that any or all of the States and Territories will legislate, let alone include and enforce minimum standards of performance or codes of behaviour or conduct. According to Minister Dawkins's senior adviser during the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training hearing on 12 April 1991, the scheme under this Bill is `very much the minimum standard the industry should be observing'. Another adviser from the Department of Employment, Education and Training stated that any institution operating within the bounds of this legislation will be subject to an extraordinarily limited range of regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, self-regulation has not worked. A few unscrupulous providers and erratic changes in government regulation have ruined things for the legitimate majority of students, providers and their staff. The Federal Government now must be seen to be making a genuine effort to clean up the sector. It would be worth considering an individual apology to each student and each country affected by what has gone on before. That is the sort of good manners that might enable us to restore our reputation in this area. That is the sort of genuine concern and respect which we really need to consider if we are genuine in our efforts to re-establish our reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as minimum standards of performance, all providers should be required-as is already done in New South Wales under its new registration system-to undergo a regular and full review. A regular and full review would not be a bad idea for this legislation, and that is really what we are proposing with this amendment. It is with a great deal of regret that I see that it has not inspired the interest of either the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer or the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(2) The provider will make available to the Secretary details of those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(3) The regulations may make provision for or in relation to the exemption of a specified provider or a specified class of providers from the requirements of subsection (1).''. </PARA>
<PARA>The original clause 7 was intended to ensure protection of the trust funds through insurance or other agreed arrangements, and non-compliance would invoke a penalty. The amendment of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training to this clause changes the provision for an undefined insurance to insurance or bond arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> My amendment is based on a suggestion put to the Senate Standing Committee by Mr Jack Evans of the Australian Council for Private Education and Training. It has the effect of allowing the provider to make whatever arrangements are the most convenient for the provider as long as they comply with clause 6(4). Clause 7 in its original form, or in the Senate Standing Committee amended form, imposes yet another cost on the industry which is rapidly losing its competitive edge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission in its draft report has provided clear advice to the Government on the added costs to both institutions and students caused by the proposed insurance provisions. During the examination of the Bill by the Senate Standing Committee, we asked officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training for information on the cost of insurance or bond arrangements. They were not able to provide any satisfactory or precise information. They could only guess that half to one per cent of the amount insured would be the amount to add to those costs, but no-one really knows what will be incurred by clause 7 if we retain the compulsory insurance or bond arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> New providers to the industry are likely to be particularly disadvantaged as the risk will be higher in the initial stages of their enterprise. Therefore their premium rates will be even higher than those paid by established providers. There are already complaints from overseas students that Australian costs are too high. Added costs, because of government regulation, will have to be passed on to the students in the form of even higher fees, which will be very much to the disadvantage of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission in its draft report takes a very different approach to that suggested by the Bill. It suggests that students should be informed of their rights and status of their fees in the event of the collapse of an institution. It further indicates that one approach might be for institutions or industrial bodies to establish some form of insurance scheme. There is already a penalty to a provider who fails to comply with clause 6(4), so that it is only necessary in clause 7 to insist that providers have some arrangement in place to ensure that they do not fail to comply with clause 6(4). On page 99 the draft report states:</PARA>
<PARA>A preferred approach is to provide institutions with more incentive to make sure that students are better informed about the status of their fees and their legal rights in the event of a collapse.</PARA>
<PARA>The key recommendation on this matter is made by the Industry Commission on pages 10 and 11 of its draft report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs should develop techniques to help reduce infringements of visa conditions and to check bona fides of student visa applications. The Department should also provide student visa applicants with explanatory material, which should emphasise the need for care in choosing where to study. Information on students' rights under Australian consumer protection law might also be included. </PARA>
<PARA>This seems to be a better way to go, to follow the Industry Commission findings and to tighten up the main provisions in the Bill, rather than to have large amounts of money for fees and living expenses held in trust, which then have to be protected by expensive insurance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment will still ensure that some arrangement is made to ensure compliance with clause 6(4), but it will be up to the provider to find an arrangement that is convenient and at the lowest cost to the institution and subsequently to the student. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment is just a continuation of the type of confusion we have had since the introduction of this legislation and during the committee stage. This is a continuation of that confusion. We have already had the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training proposing an amendment which received support from all parties in that Committee. Now we have the Opposition proposing to amend that again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can understand the reason for that because, as Senator Tierney has just mentioned, the Industry Commission report has brought a different perspective to this discussion. That report was not available to the Committee when it was considering what amendments might be appropriate. Nor was it available to the Government when it was drafting this legislation. The Industry Commission report is in draft form. The consideration which has been given to it so far has been limited by the very fact it became available only recently and in draft form. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion by the Industry Commission, as expressed just now by Senator Tierney, that students be better informed about their rights and the status of their fees in the case of a collapse, is certainly a worthy suggestion and is one which I and the Democrats would endorse. But it does not mean that the passage of this coalition amendment gives rise to that information and to the status of students being better explained. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment adds to the confusion. It leaves a situation which is more vague than that which was suggested and amended by the Committee. The coalition amendment to omit and substitute a new clause 7 suggests that providers should be required to make and maintain such arrangements which will ensure that the provider can at all times comply with the requirements of subsection 6(4). There is no direction, no suggestion, no compulsion and no regulation. Details of the arrangement must be made available to the Secretary. There is no guidance-and this is an area which requires guidance. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to clause 7 as it is presently drafted, the Senate Committee's proposal is quite stark. The Senate Committee at least said that this would require arrangements by way of insurance-bond arrangements-so that other arrangements could be made and were still available to the satisfaction of the Secretary. At least there was a direction about the sorts of arrangements, such as insurance bonds. We had an explanation for it in the Committee's amendment. It was for the purpose of ensuring that no person suffers a loss if the provider fails to comply with the requirements of proposed subsection 6(4). There was also a penalty of $3,000, which has disappeared under the coalition's vague and meaningless version. </PARA>
<PARA> After considerable discussion, the Senate Committee amended the clause by inserting the term `bond arrangement' to provide some clue as to what it meant. But we have no idea what the coalition is talking about, because it has left in the words `such arrangements'. They can be any arrangements; there is no guidance given. It is meaningless, because it could refer to some personal indemnity-and that is only as good as the provider's trustworthiness. </PARA>
<PARA> If a provider mismanages or misappropriates students' funds, currently there is no provision to safeguard their educational financial investment by insurance, et cetera. Refund, including repayment of living expenses and/or the option of transfer to another institution, is not guaranteed. The option to transfer it to another similar institution or course should be guaranteed. We need to be specific. I would like to have seen the Committee's amendment go further and be more specific; but, as is the nature with committee deliberations, we reached a compromise. I was satisfied with the position we reached. But now to alter that and retain the highly instructive-I say that ironically-phrase `such arrangements' is not providing any guidance whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> We are left in an unforgivable position. We could have achieved something. The Committee agreed on a form of words. For the coalition now to remove that completely is taking all meaning out of the legislation. In the view of the Minister, does the coalition amendment stand or not?</PARA>
<PARA> The present situation is that those English language intensive courses for overseas students (ELICOS) colleges which have attempted to obtain insurance in anticipation of this legislation being passed have not been successful with insurance providers. What is going to happen when the ELICOS colleges are unable to obtain commercial insurance at any price? This legislation, whether or not it is amended in this way, will require some arrangement to be made. The onus is not on the ELICOS colleges to provide individual bonds or cooperative industrial based bonds. They are asked in this amendment to make such arrangements, but with the Committee's previous amendments it became instructive and directive. But what happens if those instructions and directions, or such arrangements, cannot be met? How can we ensure that these students are not left in a destitute situation? What will the Government do about this?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not rise simply to speak in response to Senator Bell; but, in responding to the Opposition amendment, I will respond to his remarks as well. As I indicated earlier in more general remarks, the Government has no objection to this amendment. It has to be seen in the context that, wherever one is proposing government regulation, a variety of things need to be looked at-not merely the benefit that is hoped might flow from the regulation but also the cost of the regulation to the taxpayers in supervising, monitoring and ensuring compliance with the regulation, and the cost imposed on citizens in complying with the requirements set down by the Parliament. There must always be a cost benefit. This amendment clearly is seeking to change the balance of that cost benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there is a downside risk in losing the benefit, the Government proposes to refer the operations of this Act straight back to the Committee. The terms of the amendment as outlined are satisfactory to protect the interests of the students, about whom we are all concerned. But even if that proved not to be the case, the downside risk is very low and it is appropriate to look at the costs of regulation as well as the potential benefits. Therefore, the Government is quite prepared to accept the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the question concerning the apparent or alleged difficulty of colleges in achieving adequate insurance arrangements which may be necessary to comply with these requirements, or to achieve the objectives, I think all honourable senators share my understanding of the Government's expectation: there will not be such a problem and when the insurance requirements on the colleges are properly understood there will be-there already is-available appropriate insurance arrangements which will enable them reasonably to be able to discharge their obligations under the Act. </PARA>

<PARA> 9. After clause 18, page 9, line 2, add the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> Cessation of Operation of Act</PARA>
<PARA> ``19. This Act, unless sooner repealed, shall cease to be in force on 1 January 1994.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to insert a sunset clause providing for the Act to cease on 1 January 1994. In September 1990 Tony Harris, the special adviser to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), submitted the report Future Operations of the Non-Formal Export Education Industry. This report indicated a great concern about regulation. It pointed out that regulatory activities were very costly and interfered with the marketplace. In addition, the Commonwealth had not been previously involved in regulation of the export of educational services. </PARA>
<PARA> The report noted that government regulation in educational services of overseas students was complicated by the overlapping role of the Commonwealth Government and the State or Territory governments. The Commonwealth is responsible for exports and relations with foreign states. The States and Territories are responsible for education. These overlapping roles have caused concern, and some of the amendments moved by Senator McMullan on behalf of Senator Aulich and the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training have addressed this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I share with Mr Harris a grave concern about the cost of regulation. There is no doubt that regulation of this industry will be a considerable cost to the taxpayer and to the provider institutions. These costs will, of course, be reflected in fees. Australia is already regarded overseas as a high cost country for education. The Harris report notes that there has been a loss of faith in the Australian education industry and that it is becoming an enormous problem for those institutions that are proven providers of excellent courses.</PARA>
<PARA> Regulation can be an inhibiting factor for the industry in its growth, competition and scope for innovation. However, it has to be recognised that Australia is in a difficult and recessive economic period. Small businesses are facing enormous problems, and there probably has to be some protection for students who elect to study at a small private institution at this time. The Commonwealth Government faces a large expenditure to reimburse overseas students if the provider institutions fail and are not in a position to reimburse students themselves. The Harris report reluctantly admits that the Commonwealth regulatory scheme will be useful for a short period while the industry becomes more firmly established and while Australia faces a more than ordinarily difficult economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Harris report also predicts that the adjustment process should be complete by the end of 1992 and that after that the Commonwealth should withdraw from its regulatory role. By then all States and Territories should have set up their own regulatory regimes and they should be a sufficient adjunct to normal market forces. Self-regulation mechanisms should then be firmly in place and providers and users should be familiar with these mechanisms by that time and be able to take full advantage of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Harris report spoke very highly of the self-regulation scheme developed by the Association of Recognised ELICOS Centres and recommended that it should be encouraged to maintain and to refine that scheme. The Harris report emphasises the importance of the Commonwealth acknowledging now that the industry should be deregulated over the next few years in order to encourage those States that have not already done so to establish their own regulations for the industry; to encourage industry to promote self-regulation and competition; and to allow the market to operate in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the findings of the Harris report. To that end, I consider it essential that this Bill should include a sunset clause that will enable this country to achieve the basic objectives of the Bill, which is a healthy education export industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats cannot support this amendment. The clues to that statement are contained within Senator Tierney's earlier remarks, when he cited the report to indicate that the Commonwealth had not previously been involved in the regulation of export education services. That is the problem. The fact that the Commonwealth had not been involved meant that the cavalier, carefree, exploitative cowboys were ripping people off. That is what it was all about and that is why this legislation was brought forward. The threat of removal of the legislation in a couple of years is hardly a threat that will terrify those who may wish to continue as rip-off merchants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The suggestion that such regulation would be useful for a short period, with later reduced effectiveness, is perhaps understandable. The suggestion that after 1992 the States would have in place sufficient regulation to be able to control the industry may be accurate, but it may not. Why put an arbitrary time on this? It may be based on some calculations or guesstimates as to when the States could have active legislation. But rather than having a time limit, why not set as a goal that, if and when the States achieve parallel, relevant, useful, sufficient-whatever qualifier one might like to use-legislation in this area, that would be the trigger for the sunsetting of this legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> I can imagine the ridiculous situation of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) travelling overseas promoting our wonderful education provision and having to say, `Well, yes, you are guaranteed a certain standard and code of behaviour, or at least you are guaranteed that your fees will be safe and the provider will be an honourable fellow, but only for a couple of years. We will then pull off any sort of legislation that governs this'. It would be ridiculous to have to make that sort of statement. If there were a requirement that this legislation would stay in place until the States came up with their own legislation, I could see a reason for sunsetting it. But the date should not be chosen out of the blue. That date terrifies nobody; it does not force the States into anything. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of this legislation, weak as it is, would threaten nobody with fear of non-compliance. People would say, `Well, we can wait for a while before we can start our shonky business again. After a few years there will be no Commonwealth legislation, so we can get back into the game'. I am sure that that is not a guarantee for anybody overseas. The only justification for sunsetting the legislation would be the achievement of parallel legislation in the States. But the insertion of this date, which might as well be Christmas year XXXX, really has no relevance. I cannot see any justification for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly to the motion for the third reading of the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill. This Bill was very badly drafted and rushed through the House of Representatives with unseemly haste. There was an attempt to rush the Bill through the Senate with the same haste, but fortunately there was the opportunity to have this Bill referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for investigation and report. It is just over 20 years since the first legislative and general purpose standing committees were established in the Senate. This move was the most fundamental change to the Parliament since Federation. It strengthened the Australian parliamentary system of government and made it possible for the Senate to take on its proper role as a house of review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a bi-annual complaint in this Parliament that legislation is rushed through at the end of each half-yearly session without proper scrutiny and without proper debate. That might have happened to this Bill. It was only a short Bill, but it had to be drastically amended, as was seen today, before it became in any way an acceptable Bill or even achieved the purpose that the Government intended for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Although we have had Senate committees for over 20 years, it was relatively rare, until last year, for committees to perform their legislative role as opposed to their general purpose role. Last year the Senate procedures were restructured to allow easier referral of Bills to the appropriate Senate standing committee. This was how this Bill came before the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the efforts of the Committee, which first met to consider this Bill on 12 April and reported on 7 May, the Bill was comprehensively amended by the Government, by the Committee and by the Opposition. In less than a month the Committee had made the Government change its mind on a number of issues within the Bill. I will not repeat all the changes that have been made to the Bill, but I will remind the Senate that, had it not been for the Committee and for the opportunity to take advice and conduct public hearings relating to the export of education services, this would not only have been an ineffective Bill, but a Bill that would have done much towards destroying a very valuable industry rather than helping it. The work of the Senate Standing Committee and the persistence of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats have made the Government back down and accept every single one of our amendments in order to have a reasonable Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I still have one final concern. The Bill has been rushed through in the final stages of this session, yet the Treasurer-now the ex-Treasurer-had authorised the Industry Commission to inquire into and report on the whole of the exports of education services industry. So far it has had no public hearings on the matter and will not do so until next month. Its final report is not expected until the end of July. My final comment is that it is an extraordinary situation where one Minister rushes a Bill through and another authorises an inquiry into the very same matter which the Bill is meant to cover. I say to the Government: learn a lesson from the Senate Standing Committee. Inquire first, and then get the legislation right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 was considered in the Senate, as honourable senators will recall, on 6 June. It was amended in two ways and returned to the House of Representatives. The first of the two amendments related to the Senate inclusion of a clause in the Bill designed to provide a grant to Victoria to minimise transitional pressures on gas prices. It read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There is payable to the State of Victoria, out of monies appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose, an amount of $30m in respect of each of the 2 years after 1 July 1990, in order to minimise transitional pressure on gas prices on an equitable basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The second amendment sought and passed by the Senate was to insert an additional part VII in the Act requiring the Minister for Resources by 30 November 1992 to report to both Houses of the Parliament on the operation of the Act, that report to include, firstly, whether the Act has been effective in achieving its objectives; secondly, the impact on prices and on industry; and, thirdly, the impact on the development of new offshore petroleum projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted the second of those amendments, namely, the reporting requirement amendment, and on behalf of the Opposition I welcome that. The Government did indicate its acceptance of that amendment in this chamber when it was debated on 6 June, and indeed earlier when it was considered by the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. It is pleasing that the House of Representatives has also accepted that amendment. It is the key amendment that the Opposition was seeking because it requires the Government to report back to the Parliament within a period of five months after the completion of the first two years of the new arrangements for the application of the resource rent tax to Bass Strait oil and gas, and that is what this Bill is all about. It requires the Government to report back on the impact of those measures given the uncertainty at this stage as to just what that impact will be. The impact can be in various directions. There will certainly be an impact on gas users in Victoria. There will be an impact on gas producers in the Bass Strait field, Esso-BHP, and it is simply not possible at this time to be able to predict with any great confidence what that impact will be. We welcome the House's acceptance of that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that the Government has not accepted the first amendment, namely, to write into the Bill a clause to pick up what the Government has announced in its second reading speech will be an integral part of the whole package involving the application of the resource rent tax to Bass Strait oil and gas, being a grant to Victoria of $60m-$30m a year for each of the first two years after the commencement of the application of this resource rent tax to Bass Strait oil and gas. The effective date of commencement is 1 July 1990; in other words, this legislation is retrospective. The decision was announced in the Budget last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not provide specifically for this grant to ease the initial impact on Victorian gas prices. This is not in the legislation; it is simply in the Minister's second reading speech. The actions of the Victorian Government have bankrupted the State of Victoria over recent years. There is no more classic example of that than the disclosure in this place yesterday that the Victorian Government has had to come cap in hand to the Federal Government to get a loan for just a few thousand dollars to help it meet its superannuation and other pay-out obligations to 10 retrenched Victorian meat industry inspectors. That it had to come to the Commonwealth to get a loan for an amount like that is the clearest, most stark example of just how bankrupt the State of Victoria is under the Kirner Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, we do not trust the Victorian Government to act in the way that this Parliament might wish and expect it to do so. Therefore, this amendment seeks to insert a clause in the Act which would ensure that the purposes for which this grant was being paid, namely, to minimise the transitional pressure on gas prices to Victorian users, would be achieved. We have had considerable debate on this matter both in the committee stage through the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration and in this chamber when the Bill was debated on 6 June. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the Government's explanation of the strength of its opposition to this amendment, I still do not accept the reasons that have been given. But the situation has changed, at least to some extent, since our intention to insert this clause in the Bill was first brought forward to the Senate. Since then there have been changes. I refer the honourable senators to page 134 of the Hansard of the Finance and Public Administration Committee, in which Senator McMullan said that this grant was not necessarily going to be an untied grant and that this is not a matter about which a final decision has been made. In other words, at that stage the question of the conditionality that we wanted attached to the grant was left pretty well up in the air. That raised our concerns even more. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the changes that have occurred since then, we still do not accept as sufficient the Government's stated objections to the Senate amendment. Having said that, we are pleased to note the Government's assurances that what we are seeking to achieve by this amendment will in fact be achieved. In that context, I refer particularly to the statement by the Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, in the other place on 6 June when the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill was returned to the House of Representatives from the Senate. At page 5031 of Hansard, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is on the public record-and I will now put it on the public record again-that the $60m is being provided to the Victorian Government to minimise any transitional pressures on gas. The payment to Victoria will be made on the condition that $60m is to be used to minimise any transitional pressure on gas. </PARA>
<PARA>Then I note particularly that the Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has the Government's assurance that such a condition will be stipulated in the exchange of letters which will occur, as is normal for the special once-off appropriations to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is a degree of tying and conditionality attaching to the grant, which was not obvious when the Bill was debated in the Committee of this place. Indeed, the House of Representatives has repeated much the same assurance in the official list of reasons that it has prepared and transmitted to the Senate disagreeing with this amendment of the Senate. Of the three reasons given, the second reason is the important one in this context. The reason states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's decision to provide a special grant of $30m for each of the first two years of application of Resource Rent Tax, will be made through an Appropriation to be brought before the Parliament in the Budget Session. The safeguards provided by the standard provisions of the Appropriation process deal appropriately with any concerns related to the disbursement of the special grant. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition will not again press its amendment. Nevertheless, we still believe that the Bill would be, from the point of view of Victorian users of gas in particular, a better Bill if the clause that we have been seeking were included. Nevertheless, at the same time I acknowledge the completely unequivocal assurances given by the Government that this grant will be made conditional on its use by the Victorian Government for the purposes for which this Parliament will be appropriating it, namely, specifically and entirely to help minimise the impact on gas prices of the application of the resource rent tax to Bass Strait gas. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, on that basis, on behalf of the Opposition I note the reasons of the House of Representatives for disagreeing with that amendment. I welcome the acceptance of the other House of the key Opposition amendment. We will not divide again on this issue, given what is now on the public record on both sides. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In looking at this situation, it is useful to return to the context in which this amendment, which has been rejected by the House of Representatives, arose. Both the Government and the LiberalNational Party coalition opposed an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats which would have ensured that increases in gas prices would have been carried totally, without any pass-on effect, by the producers. It would have enabled contractual arrangements which provided otherwise to be interpreted in a way which would have made it impossible for that pass-on to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats' amendment was put forward in the knowledge and the full consciousness of the difficult economic situation in Victoria for domestic gas users and, perhaps equally importantly, for our Victorian business community, which is struggling to maintain employment. We know that the Victorian economy is in a parlous state. We have had representations, as indeed has the coalition, from companies which are unable to bear the additional cost impost without laying off workers. That applies in particular to cement companies situated primarily in Geelong, which is one of the hardest hit areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we have had representations from companies using ethane, which is one of the raw materials that goes into the production of plastics. These companies operate in the international market and thereby have an opportunity to contribute to our export income, but they felt strongly that their competitiveness would be severely damaged. It is to be noted too that, in the proposed distribution of the $30m per annum compensation to Victoria, apparently the users of ethane were not going to be considered. So it was in this context that the Democrats moved the amendment. It was rejected by the Opposition-it decided to desert the business community in Victoria by opposing our amendment-and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As a very much second-rate and threadbare alternative, we then supported the amendment put forward by the Opposition, which sought to ensure that the $30m per annum for two years was in fact applied in compensation for the price increases, thereby halving notionally the price increase on gas. We do not accept the Government's arguments that this particular provision has nothing to do with the Bill before the Senate and as it went to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with some amusement that, on this occasion, the Opposition is prepared to trust two socialist governments and their assurances that they will apply funds in a particular manner. We are not quite as trusting. We believe that it would have been better to pursue this amendment and to ensure that this grant becomes a tied grant. This is what the amendment sought to do. There is ample time for the House of Representatives to accept yet another amendment from the Senate, but unfortunately the Opposition has gone to water and it is not prepared to press the point. It is prepared to trust two socialist governments. I trust that Senator Kemp, in particular, takes note of the fact that he is prepared to trust them; the Australian Democrats are not. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the numbers are on the other side, I will not waste the Committee's time by pushing this to a division, but I wish to put on record very strongly the position of the Australian Democrats on this issue. We continue to support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague Senator Short, the Liberal Party senator from Victoria, has given a very wide and adequate coverage of the issues involved in relation to the petroleum resource rent tax (RRT). I will do no more than highlight a few outstanding issues that I would like the Government to acknowledge in preparing its safeguard statement, which is to be built into the appropriate appropriation processes during the Budget session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Liberal-National Party coalition rejects reasons (1) and (3) given by the House of Representatives for opposing Senate amendment No. 1 to the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. However, we take heart at the assurances given in reason (2), namely:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to provide a special grant of $30 million for each of the first two years of application of the Resource Rent Tax, will be made through an Appropriation to be brought in during the Budget Session. The safeguards provided by the standard provisions of the Appropriate process deal appropriately with any concerns related to the disbursement of the special grant. </PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal-National Party coalition has sent very direct and clear signals to the Government of the need to ensure that those safeguards are adequate and will cover all users. We do not accept the reason that the amendment was superfluous, because its main purpose was to provide that signal to ensure the adequacy of the processes that will be applied in the August Budget. If we have done no more than that, we will have achieved our purpose. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the support of the Australian Democrats. However, I draw the attention of the Government to the need to ensure that within those safeguards an acknowledgment is made of the problem of what we refer to as the joint costs, particularly as the RRT can be passed on, which the Government now acknowledges. There seemed to be some doubt earlier on in Government circles as to whether it could be passed on. In the committee stage we examined the consequences of that passing on. Those consequences will be quite detrimental to many significant industries in Victoria. We regret that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But, as part of the safety mechanisms, we point out the difficulty in the apportionment of what is known as joint costs between oil and gas. We ask the Government to ensure that the producers allocate their costs so as not to maximise the pass-on effects of the RRT, which they might otherwise do for the producers' benefit and to the detriment of the end users. If there is a failure to acknowledge that, a situation could arise whereby there is an increase in the proportion of the tax paid by customers relative to the proportion that the producers would bear themselves to the detriment of those users. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention again-and I think it is worth repeating-that there was a strong view within relevant industry circles that the Government had not understood the potential pass-on effects of the RRT. We condemn the Government's inadequate consultation, both with the users and with the Victorian Government. This is an important matter which affects the tariff regime because it is an add-on cost to industry. This is at a time when tariffs are coming down, particularly for users. They are faced with increasing costs as a result of an RRT. We do not have an appropriate or full RRT; in fact, we have a sham of an RRT where not all costs are acknowledged, where the tax rate is artificially high and higher than the alleged amount because of the multiplier effect, which has now been acknowledged, again in hindsight. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Government's attention further to the effects that the RRT will have because of the cost impact on certain industries, particularly some environment and pollution related industries. Members of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration were most disturbed to hear that a paper recycling operation in Victoria now may become so marginal as to warrant closure. There were also suggestions that a major cement producer might substitute coal for gas with adverse environmental effects. We hope that the Government will ensure that some of the $60m will be applied so that the detrimental consequences in these particular industries do not arise. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Campbell, Senator Kemp and I, supported by Senator Short, mentioned in our minority report that, when setting secondary taxes, governments must be very conscious of the need to avoid losses of competitive advantage in the secondary and tertiary sectors, particularly for those industries where Australia should have a natural advantage-and that applies to natural gas, oil, iron ore and so on. If we allow an inappropriate design, as we have in the circumstances of the resource rent tax, we may find a bias in the pass-on cost to the producers which is created in favour of the export industries rather than further processing within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the central concern of our minority report. That was the amendment, initiated by the concern of my colleague Senator Short, which went down to the House of Representatives and was rejected. As a Senate we now have limited powers. However, we are putting great reliance on the strength of the safeguards that we trust will be built into the provisions within the appropriation process to ensure that the concerns relating to disbursement of the special grant are brought in adequately and that that grant is distributed fairly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add to the comments which have been made by my colleagues Senator Short and Senator Watson, and to make a brief comment on some of the matters which were raised by Senator Spindler. First, I strongly endorse the view put forward by Senator Short that the Government-and we are pleased to see this-has agreed to a very important amendment which will require it at the end of 1992 to come back and report to this chamber on just how this very complex and rushed legislation will work out in practice. We have received many assurances from the Government about the consequences of this and about their alleged minimal impact on gas prices in Victoria. This report will allow us to see just how effective the Bill has been in meeting the Government's stated objective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Short was quite right to stress the importance of this amendment. It is also important because the arrangements, and particularly the compensation arrangement that the Government has made, apply only for two years-up to the end of 1991-92. As a consequence, after that period we then have to look at the compensation which will be given to Victoria through the general purpose revenue sharing grants with the States. Whereas the debate has concentrated particularly on the effects of the resource rent tax over the next two years, I think that in the longer context this resource rent tax could have very profound effects, especially if it is used as a method by the Commonwealth Government to further squeeze Victoria. As a Victorian senator-and I am sure my colleagues will also be very concerned about this-I will be very interested in any comments Senator McMullan can make on what happens post 1991-92 on this very important issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to Senator Spindler in a moment. Secondly, it was a great pity that our proposed amendment was not carried. That would have tied into the Bill the $30m a year compensation which was promised by the Government and would have given at least some assurances to the gas users in Victoria that that money would be used for the purpose previously stated. I underline Senator Short's comments about this matter: this Government has a very big credibility problem. The problem in Victoria is that the State Government there, as Senator Short said, is virtually bankrupt-a government which Senator Spindler, I am pleased to record in the Senate, used to boast was elected on the preferences of the Australian Democrats. I notice that Senator Spindler was very loath today to acknowledge his role in getting the Cain-Kirner Government into office.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman. There was clearly no point of order, as Senator Spindler knew, but he chose to make a rather cheap political shot in a matter which, I might say, is directly related to this Bill. Senator Spindler is the man who, even more so than this Government-and this is saying something-has proposed a massive tax package which would have major consequences on people in Victoria and elsewhere. I am coming to Senator Spindler soon. But the point I was trying to make before Senator Spindler made his spurious point of order was that this Government does have a major credibility problem. It has that because of the endless broken promises which this Government has made on major election matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter is not a major election matter, although, if the Bill does have some of the serious consequences that some people have projected, it may well become a major election matter. The Government does have serious problems and those problems have been even more underlined in the way some Ministers have twisted and turned when asked whether they could endorse Mr Hawke's view that promises made in an election are quite disposable, and that the means justify the ends. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short has also drawn attention not only to the Commonwealth Government's problems but also the Victorian Government's problems in relation to the parlous state of the Victorian economy. So, I record those two points and I think it is a pity that the amendment we proposed was not accepted by the Government because I believe, in view of the record of both the Commonwealth Government and the Victorian Government, it would have provided at least some further assurances to gas users in Victoria that the compensation money would have been used for its stated purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I wish to make relates to Senator Spindler. Senator Spindler gets up in this Parliament, as he did today, and tries to pretend in some ways that the Democrats are the friends of business, particularly small business. Senator Spindler in his alternative tax package proposed additional taxes of some $7 billion on top of the Government's already high taxing policies. How on earth does he expect the vast variety of additional taxes that he has proposed to impact on business, small and big, and on Australian families, particularly those in Victoria?</PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that he has shown not the slightest bit of concern for those people when he has proposed this very large tax package which invites this Government, which is strapped for revenue, to bring in a wide range of new taxes. As he and his colleagues will be held in part responsible for the performance of the Cain-Kirner Government in Victoria, I can well believe that if the people are socked with a whole range of new taxes he and his colleagues will also be blamed for that because of the way in which they have invited the Government to bring in new taxes. Let me underline the hypocrisy of their proposal, in their alternative Budget, for an additional tax on petrol--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is, as Senator Macdonald says, great for small business. The Democrats have proposed an additional tax on road transport; again, great for small business, great for people in rural areas. They have proposed additional company taxes. For Senator Spindler to come into this Parliament and talk about his concerns about the pass-on effects of the resource rent tax (RRT)-we have concerns too, but it is astonishing coming from him when he has proposed a vast range of new taxes which will directly impact on Victorian industry-is the greatest act of hypocrisy that I have seen in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Senator Spindler looked at his polls, he would find that the rating of the Australian Democrats has fallen from 11 per cent at the last election to 7 per cent today, and I believe that he, with Senator McLean, must take a major responsibility for that because Victorians, and Australians generally, are worried about the policies the Democrats are pursuing-particularly Senator Spindler's very high tax policies which will have a major impact on business. I wish to conclude these comments by again drawing the Minister's attention to the period after 1991-92, and I wonder whether he could give us some assurances on that matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a matter on which we are all about to agree, this has been a rather remarkable debate. Nevertheless, I appreciate the consideration that this Bill has been given. This is the third time we have dealt with it, and the honourable senators who have spoken today have all been part of those three deliberations. I have appreciated the manner in which the debate has been conducted overall. We have had our disagreements from time to time, but I think it has been a constructive consideration. With regard to the matter we have before us at the moment concerning the amendment with which the Government did not agree in the House of Representatives, with which I am proposing the Senate should not persist and in which I note the agreement of the other senators, I think there has been a common objective and a disagreement about process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that this process-which has now been made more explicit by me and, more importantly, by the responsible Minister in the House of Representatives-was always the best process. To the extent that people are satisfied that it is now more certain and more clear to them, and therefore to others who may be affected by the legislation, I am happy that more clear assurances have been given. I welcome the fact that the legislation is now going to be passed in the manner as agreed by the House of Representatives in response to our amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the comments that have been made by honourable senators. I want to respond to a particular question asked by Senator Kemp, although matters were raised at various times which people have asked the Government to take into consideration. I note those remarks and will ensure that they are considered. Senator Kemp asked me a question, to which I cannot give a broad and detailed answer, about post 1991-92 revenue sharing. </PARA>
<PARA> The public record on this matter contains a joint statement by the then Treasurer and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) of 21 August 1990 indicating that revenue sharing beyond that time will be considered in the context of the general resource rent tax revenue sharing discussions. Those negotiations obviously have not started because the legislation has not passed yet, but I expect that over the next few months-we have got quite a bit of time because it is not a pressing timetable-we will be taking steps to initiate those discussions. Of course, I cannot give any indication about their outcome but, as indicated by Mr Keating and Mr Griffiths, the negotiations will be undertaken within a reasonable timeframe to ensure that we can get an outcome well before the deadline. I cannot say any more than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on this occasion to debate the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 concurrently with the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1991. Once again, we are debating a multifaceted Bill covering a wide range of taxation issues such as an extension of the normal Australian taxation requirements to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and also amendments, firstly, to previously enacted foreign income legislation; secondly, to the method of taxation of income derived overseas by Australian residents; thirdly, to thin capitalisation requirements-by that we mean the gearing arrangements between capital and equity-and, finally, by allowing primary producers a deduction for capital expenditure on fences used primarily to prevent land degradation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are, of course, other changes in the Bill, some of which relate to the tax file number rules, accession arrangements for certain law enforcement agencies and the self assessment provisions for company and superannuation funds. In addition, amendments have been made to the securities lending arrangements. I shall be dealing with each of these changes in the course of my evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> Before discussing the various components of this Bill, I would like to congratulate the Government on its new format of the explanatory memorandum. This is a significant reform and a significant change. I am pleased to say that the Opposition has been very much at the forefront of encouraging the changes that have taken place in this updated and new explanatory memorandum. The new simplified version is a great advancement on the previous format. Originally, I was very critical of the large number of both editing and presentation errors in the document before us. In fact, five or six pages of my original notes on this debate detailed those errors. I note that the latest corrigendum tabled by Senator Tate acknowledges those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> However, full marks must go to the Government and the Australian Taxation Office for their preparedness to discuss these problems and to issue a corrigendum alerting this chamber to the difficulties. May I say, though, that a great number of the problems would have been avoided if more time had been given to the original drafting of the legislation. I understand that the Australian Taxation Office is carrying out an ongoing project to improve the quality of its explanatory memoranda to ensure that they meet the needs of the target audience. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the courtesy of the Treasurer's office, I have had the opportunity to talk with the taxation officers involved in the project. They tell me that one of their objectives has been to produce explanatory memoranda which are more readable, more certain and easier to understand. I believe that with this explanatory memorandum they have achieved their objective, although there are inevitably going to be some teething problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand also that the Taxation Office is undertaking another project designed to improve the way that it goes about developing its new tax legislation. I welcome that because it is an issue that I have been harping on, if I can use that word, for almost 12 months. In particular, the Taxation Office will be reviewing the existing working relationship with other government agencies involved in this process. The Opposition endorses this initiative taken by the Taxation Office. However, as with so many previous taxation Bills that have come before the chamber, the time given for consultation with industry-which is another issue concerning the drafted legislation-is unfortunately very short. The House of Representatives was given a little over two weeks while the Senate had about twice that time. </PARA>
<PARA> While I have drawn attention to the need for a consultative committee, perhaps there should also be a fourth person added to this task force in drafting taxation legislation. To that team-which includes the Treasury people who are involved in developing the concept, the taxation officers who have to put it into a practical form and the parliamentary draftsman-should be added a fourth person who has the facility of drafting legislation in plain English. Although the first three mentioned officers understand the technical implications of the legislation, given the wide application of taxation law, it is necessary to ensure that the law is expressed in the simplest language and in a non-technical fashion wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be an attitude of rush prevailing, from the original drafting of the Bill to having it passed by the Parliament. That is always regrettable. I am thankful that this country, therefore, has a Senate, a House of review, with the possibility of deferral to a committee, where both the technical and industrial hazards of the legislation can be highlighted and hopefully corrected. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government at this point for its cooperative attitude and willingness to discuss the problems the Opposition has seen. That is one of the more constructive features that has developed since the appointment of Senator McMullan to this office. However, I feel strongly that more time should be given from the date the legislation is tabled until it is fully debated and passed. In this democratic country industry organisations and people who will be affected should be allowed time to reflect and then to raise their concerns. Trust in a government is destroyed when delay in terms of the operative date of a Bill appears to prevail. In the past, that situation has occurred all too frequently. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, I think it is of interest to note that many of the proposed amendments were contemplated and pre-empted by the previous Treasurer as long ago as August last year. The foreign income legislation had a series of proposed changes foreshadowed by the former Treasurer on 30 December last. Let me take these proposed amendments as an example. When the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990 was debated last October the coalition made it abundantly clear that further changes were required. Today we have the first of those changes, seven months after it was announced, with only four weeks to examine the legislation and to check that it corresponds to the original intent. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that in setting out the counter schemes or devices to get around the intention stated last year involving transfer arrangements, there has been created a possible and presumably unintended distortion. Indeed, the practice that it is sought to circumvent might well have been successfully tackled under part IVa of the principal Act. All too frequently we are finding technical corrections where greater reliance should be placed by the Government on the application of part IVa. It is surprising that so few cases involving part IVa have come before the courts. That might be a reflection of the degree of its success. I signal to those listening to this debate that part IVa was an initiative of the Liberal-National Party coalition when in office. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, a more specific amendment could be proposed to avoid taxing ineffective transactions, as will flow from the amendments proposed. All too frequently, this Government goes to inordinate lengths to collect the last few cents in every dollar. In so doing, it fails to recognise the huge costs involved in setting up what I might term `sham' or `anti-avoidance' transactions. If it was content to collect perhaps 98 per cent of the revenue then some of the technical detail could be eliminated from income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> One outcome of the problems involved with foreign income is that more power inevitably tends to be given to the Commissioner. Once again, we find that the Commissioner is issuing rulings to clarify obscurities in the drafting of legislation. I refer the chamber to an article in the June issue of Charter Magazine, the official journal of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, entitled `The Commissioner Rules, OK', which outlines the results of that rushed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the major changes proposed in this Bill are welcomed, so long as they correspond to the original intent. Including the citizens of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands into the mainstream of Australian taxpayers is a case in point. I will leave the detailing of this change to my colleague Senator Tambling, who has a close interest in these islands as part of his constituency of the Northern Territory. Further, the tax concessions applying to other Australians living in remote Australia and its Territories will apply to relevant income and consequential taxes. The coalition also welcomes the move not to tax termination payments retrospectively. This Government has not always been so fair in its views regarding retrospectivity. I welcome the change and I hope it continues. </PARA>
<PARA> The thin capitalisation amendments are also welcome as far as they go. However, because of the haste involved in the original drafting of the Bill, the coalition had a number of concerns. I am pleased to say that the Government has heeded these in our negotiations and discussions outside this chamber and is introducing a number of amendments. One of these amendments will affect the securities lending arrangements and another will affect the deductibility that will now be allowed for expenses incurred in new fencing undertaken to prevent land degradation. I take this opportunity of congratulating, in particular, Peter Cochrane from John Kerin's office. He was particularly helpful in acknowledging and rectifying a number of the difficulties that were outlined in the negotiations in relation to the land degradation issues. I believe that this spirit of cooperation leads to far better goodwill and much better legislation as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> I hear another whisper-I would like to have it confirmed-that there will be another amendment affecting mine site rehabilitation. I have been informed that this could possibly be ready for the Budget session. With regard to the amendment being proposed on the securities issue, the coalition welcomes this because it picks up perhaps 90 per cent of our concerns. I point out the fundamental weaknesses as they stand at present, despite the amendment the Government intends to introduce during the committee stage of this debate to pick up an earlier weakness relating to a still earlier problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There appears to be a fundamental deficiency in the proposed new section 26bc (3) (c) in that it is a requirement that the specified events occur during the borrowing period in order for a lender to obtain relief under the section. In practice, this often will not be the case as distributions are often made some time after the closing date of the books. If the delivery of the security takes place before the relevant distribution is actually paid or made, then the requirements of the section unfortunately will not be met. It should be sufficient that the distribution, the issue, et cetera, is received by the borrower by reason of his being the holder of the security on the day the books are closed in respect of the payment of the distribution issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed subsections 26bc (9c), (9d) and (9e) are also affected by the fundamental problem with proposed new section 26bc (3) (c) in that the conditions of these proposed subsections are impossible to satisfy where the borrowing period is brought to an end before the time for exercising the right or option of issuing the bonus share arises. Also, given that the maximum period of borrowing is now to be extended by this Bill, and there is a requirement that the replacement securities be identical securities, there is now a greater probability that the section cannot be complied with as a result of circumstances such as reductions of capital, calls on shares and conversions of convertible notes into shares during the lending period, resulting in an impossibility of replacing the security with an identical security. This is what these amendments fail to pick up. It would appear that in these circumstances an equivalent security should be acceptable. That would solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I also have in my possession a detailed list of some of the fundamental weaknesses we perceive in the revised amendments affecting security funding and cum dividends. Because of the length of these and the shortness of time for debate, I have negotiated with Senator McMullan for these to be incorporated in Hansard. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard these concerns regarding securities lending and cum dividend sale arrangements-matters of concern for which we will not be pressing for amendments but which we believe deserve the Government's attention at a subsequent time. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>Re: (1) Securities Lending; and</PARA>
<PARA>Re: (2) ``Cum dividend'' sale amendments</PARA>
<PARA>1. Introductory Comments</PARA>
<PARA>1.1 The amendments upon which I would like to comment under this heading are outlined in the Explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill in Chapter 16, which is headed ``Securities Lending Arrangements''. </PARA>
<PARA>1.2 The stated purpose of the amendments is ``to extend the taxation relief available for securities lending arrangements''. </PARA>
<PARA>1.3 If that was the effect of the amendments originally proposed by the Government, then it would have been a commendable result, notwithstanding that the introduction of the amendments was not foreshadowed by any Government announcement or preceded by any consultation with industry experts. </PARA>
<PARA>1.4 However, the amendments in question purport to do much more than their stated purpose in 2 respects:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) First, they are intended to transfer shareholder status in a securities lending arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Secondly, and perhaps more significantly they are also intended to transfer shareholder status when shares or units listed on the Stock Exchange are sold ``cum dividend'' and the purchaser is not registered as the shareholder or unitholder in sufficient time to receive the dividend or distribution. These sales have nothing whatsoever to do with securities lending arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>1.5 In both cases, dividend statements in the approved form are to be given and there are penalties if a person gives incorrect information in a statement required to be given under the proposed new provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>1.6 In addition, the transfer of shareholder status has certain consequences under the tax file number provisions, as they are to be amended by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>1.7 It appears that the proposed amendments have not been the subject of widespread informed public comment or analysis. However, detailed comments provided to the Government by two industry experts indicated the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) First, that there were a large number of major flaws in the drafting of the proposed amendments to section 26bc, which unwittingly would completely defeat the Government's stated intention of extending the taxation relief available for securities lending. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) Secondly, that, in addition, those amendments failed to deal at all (or at least dealt inadequately) with a number of situations which commonly arise. </PARA>

<PARA> (d) Fourthly, that there might also be a number of serious deficiencies in the drafting of those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) Fifthly, that the ``cum dividend'' contract amendments might be incapable of working smoothly in practice and that this could be demonstrated by a number of practical examples. </PARA>
<PARA>1.8 Notwithstanding the seriousness of these concerns, the Government brought down the guillotine in the Lower House. </PARA>
<PARA>1.9 I will now comment on the Transfer of Shareholder Status provisions, before briefly turning to the amendments to the securities lending provisions contained in section 26bc. </PARA>
<PARA>2. ``Transfer of Shareholder Status'' amendments</PARA>
<PARA>2.1 One industry expert has expressed 2 paramount concerns regarding the ``Transfer of Shareholder Status'' provisions:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) First, that the Government has not articulated any policy reason for implementing the intended changes. For example:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) is the existing law inadequate or uncertain in its operation as regards the entitlement to dividends and franking credits?</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Alternatively, does the way the existing law operates open up opportunities for tax avoidance or minimisation and, if so, could the Government explain what the perceived abuses are perceived to be, as is customary when anti-avoidance legislation is introduced into the Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Alternatively, is the existing position perceived as unsatisfactory in some way or other by institutional investors or individual investors who deal in the ordinary course on the stock exchange or by borrowers or lenders in securities lending arrangements and, if so, what are those perceived unsatisfactory results?</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Alternatively, will the amendments assist the Stock Exchange in its quite proper moves to speed up the settlement of stock exchange transactions?</PARA>
<PARA> The bland statements in the Explanatory memorandum are singularly unhelpful in stating any policy reason for introducing the amendments. This is particularly lamentable in the light of the fact that they will impose increased paper work obligations on brokers and clients, will operate arbitrarily and capriciously and (as will become apparent in a moment) have unfair consequences as far as the quoting of tax file numbers is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Secondly, the expert has stated, in a written opinion provided to the Government before the Bill was passed by the Lower House, that in his opinion the purported statement of relevant principles in the Explanatory Memorandum, upon which the specific amending provisions are based, is plainly wrong and misconceived. While the Government has acted on certain comments contained in the expert opinions provided to it, it has not seen fit either to address this fundamental concern nor to explain to this House why it believes that the expert concern is misplaced. Surely, in the interests of the orderly conduct of the stock market, an issue of such fundamental importance ought to be capable of achieving almost uniform professional and industry acceptance before it becomes the lynch pin of provisions which purport to have the far reaching effect of the Transfer of Shareholder Status provisions contained in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>2.2 I will now be more specific. Perhaps the fundamental concern expressed in one expert opinion provided to the Government is that a vendor of shares in a stock market transaction would not normally be under an obligation to transfer to the purchaser any particular shares which the vendor holds. In the case of shares in listed companies, damages for breach of contract would normally be regarded as an adequate remedy and therefore the remedy of specific performance would not be available. If that expert opinion provided to the Taxation Office is correct, then section 160aqua would not normally apply to a ``cum dividend contract'', which is completely at odds with the intention of the Government. I suggest that this possible deficiency might be able to be cured by the addition in proposed section 160aqua(1) (b) (i) of the words ``or an identical share'' after the words ``the share'' where they first appear. </PARA>
<PARA>2.3 In addition, the provisions also do not deal with short sales, which are permitted by law under certain circumstances. A short sale is one where, at the time of contracting to sell certain shares, the vendor doesn't own any of the share contracted to be sold. A purchaser may now know whether or not the contract of sale to him is a short sale, and yet even the intended result under the provisions would be different, depending upon whether or not a short sale is involved. </PARA>
<PARA>2.4 A similar fundamental concern exists in relation to the drafting of section 160aqua(1) (b) (ii), as it is proposed to be amended by the Government. The wording of the new provision assumes that a borrower under a securities lending arrangement can be under a legal obligation to pay a particular dividend to the lender. This assumption is completely at odds with the normal right of the borrower under such arrangements to deal with the borrowed securities in any way it wishes, including by disposing of them to a third party. Again, if the professional opinion regarding this provision is correct, the amending provisions will have no application to the transactions which they intend to embrace. I suggest that this possible deficiency might be able to be cured by the addition in proposed section 160aqu(1) (b) (ii) (a) of the words ``an amount equal to the amount of'' before the words ``the dividend''. </PARA>
<PARA>2.5 Perhaps the only explanation for the continued existence of these uncertainties, despite the fact that they are fundamental to the whole of the transfer of shareholder status provisions, is that the Government and its advisers are unable to come up with a workable set of legislative criteria for specifying the circumstances in which the provisions are to apply. For example, does the Government intend that a tracing test apply, so that you look to individual shares and see what happens to them, or is a numerical test sufficient, in that one should only look to the number of shares held by the vendor under a cum dividend sale or the borrower under a securities lending arrangement?</PARA>
<PARA>2.6 The submissions to Government have also raised the prospect that the provisions could theoretically require a person to give 2 dividend statements to different parties in respect of the same dividend. The proposed amendments give no guidance as to how this potential double jeopardy is to be resolved. Yet at the same time, the failure by a taxpayer to give the correct information constitutes an offence, which is punishable by a monetary penalty.</PARA>
<PARA>2.7 It is completely unacceptable for the Government to leave the resolution of all these matters to be determined in practice by the arbitrary rules of the stock exchange, which neither the Government nor this House has an opportunity to review. </PARA>
<PARA>2.8 But that is not the end of the possible deficiencies in these provisions:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) First, one of the expert opinions provided to the Government also pointed out that the provisions would not apply at all in the normal situation which commonly occurs where a vendor under a ``cum dividend'' sale has not provided the relevant scrip to his broker before the book's closing date and the broker has to borrow shares from a third party in order to complete the sale contract before the book's closing date. Professional opinion provided to the Opposition is that the further amendments proposed by the Government may not overcome this result, notwithstanding that they are apparently intended to do so. According to a leading text in this area, ``Stock Markets and the Securities Industry: Law and Practice'' by Professor Robert Baxt and others, 3rd edition 1988 at paragraph 806, conventional legal analysis of stock exchange transactions distinguishes four different contracts involved in a normal stock exchange transaction. The contract between the vendor and its broker is separate from the contract between the brokers themselves and from any contract between the vendor and the buyer. The doubt as to the operation of proposed section 160aqua(1) (b) (i) arises primarily because, once the stock exchange contract is completed, by the selling broker delivering scrip to the buying broker, which is then registered in the name of the buyer, the obligation of the vendor to its broker arises under the broker's right of indemnity, which is an incident of the separate contract between the vendor and its broker, and not under the contract for the sale of the share, entered into between the two brokers as agents for their respective undisclosed principals, which is the contract which most closely fits the description in proposed section 160aqua(1) (b) (i). The submissions originally provided to the Government also indicated that the provisions would not apply in a number of other situations which could be engineered by relevant parties, for example by transferring scrip to affiliates and so on. Professional opinion provided to the Opposition is that these methods of avoiding the operation of the provisions entirely remain unaffected. Is there any logical reason for permitting the application of the provisions to be avoided in this way or is it to be left to the ASX to provide in its business rules as to what the consequences of such avoidance are to be?</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Secondly, proposed section 160aquc also appears superfluous. It assumes that there was a ``cum dividend'' contract entered into in the ordinary course of trading on the stock exchange but one party to the contract did not have a securities dealer acting for him or her. I understand that these 2 propositions are inconsistent with one another in that the only transactions which can be said to be entered into in the ordinary course of trading on the stock exchange are so-called on market transactions in which each party to the transaction must have a broker acting for it. This irregularity was also appointed out to the Government and yet the Government has chosen to ignore it. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Thirdly, proposed new subsection 221yhzk(5), which is the one situation in the draft Bill where the Government has seen fit to deny the stock exchange the power to regulate matters, is capable of operating quite unfairly in practice. This unfairness can affect the ordinary individual investor as much as the institutional investor who might be thought to be more capable of looking after its own interests. In essence, the provisions can compel a purchaser under a ``cum dividend'' contract and a lender under a securities lending arrangement to accept a lesser dividend or monetary adjustment than they might reasonably have expected, in circumstances where they have no means of knowing whether or not the vendor under the contract or the borrower has provided a tax file number to the Taxation Office. In other words, the purchaser or the lender, as the case may be, is entirely at the mercy of the other party to the relevant transaction. It is arbitrary and capricious to penalise the purchaser or the lender in a situation such as this where the result is entirely outside his control, particularly where the purchaser or the lender is an existing shareholder in the relevant company and has previously provided its own tax file number to the company. A much fairer result would be to compel the vendor/purchaser to pay or adjust on the basis of the gross dividend payable by the company and to retain any tax credit arising out of the fact that the vendor/borrower had failed to provide its tax file number to the company. This result would also be consistent with the ASX business rules and current market practice for similar situations, such as where withholding tax would be applicable. This has also been drawn this to Government's attention, but to no avail. The Government has failed to articulate any reason whatsoever, let alone a plausible or justifiable one, for such heavy handed, arbitrary and capricious interference in the normal contractual position between a vendor and purchaser or a lender and a borrower. </PARA>
<PARA>2.9 In summary then, the Government has not articulated any reason why the transfer of shareholder status provisions are an integral part of the amendments intended to extend the taxation relief available for securities lending arrangements or are otherwise desirable from a revenue standpoint. </PARA>
<PARA>2.10 Further, some serious concerns have been expressed by industry experts, which have not been addressed in the further amendments proposed by the Government in this House. </PARA>
<PARA>2.11 Further, the proposed amendments will apply, if at all, in an arbitrary and capricious way. </PARA>
<PARA>2.12 For all these reasons these provisions in the Bill should not be proclaimed until there has been a closer study of their potential impact and consultation with the stock exchange and any other industry experts or professional associations which might wish to put in a submission to the Government, directed at ensuring that any amendments of this kind:</PARA>
<PARA> * recognise the range of circumstances which can occur,</PARA>
<PARA> * are capable of implementation in practice, and</PARA>
<PARA> * operate fairly as between all the different parties involved in each transaction at which the provisions are aimed. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Securities Lending Amendments</PARA>
<PARA>3.1 I will now turn to the securities lending amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>3.2 The amendments introduced in the Senate to the securities lending provisions indicate that, on reflection, the Government accepts that much of the criticism directed at the original drafting of those provisions was well founded. </PARA>
<PARA>3.3 The orderly conduct of the stock market requires that there be liquidity in terms of the availability of scrip. This is in order that transactions entered into in the ordinary course of the stock market can be settled quickly. In addition, the options market, which provides a facility to institutional investors to effectively hedge their portfolios, depends to a large extent on liquidity being available in the market place. The need for this liquidity has been recognised by the revenue authorities in both the United States and the United Kingdom and is now the subject of specific legislative relief in both jurisdictions. In this Bill the Government has attempted to extend similar relief in Australia. However, were it not for the initiative taken by industry experts, the result could have been exactly the opposite to that intended by the Government, with the result that, once the impact of the new provisions became widely known, there would be insufficient liquidity in the market for the orderly conduct of the stock market, the settlement of stock exchange transactions could take longer and the options market could have come to a standstill. </PARA>
<PARA>3.4 Fortunately, the further amendments now proposed go a long way towards achieving the stated effect of the proposed amendments, which is to extend the taxation relief available for securities lending arrangements, despite the fact that the amendments originally proposed would not have achieved any such effect. </PARA>
<PARA>3.5 Probably the major practical situation which is not dealt with by the Bill is the situation where a security is lent under a securities lending arrangement, a right or option in respect of that security arises while the loan is still on foot and the lender directs the borrower to exercise the right or option. In that situation, there seems to be no logical reason why the return of a security identical to that the subject of the exercise of the right or option or an identical right or option should not qualify for the relief. </PARA>
<PARA>3.6 Splits and consolidations of shares, as well as partly paid shares, are also not covered by the relief, though each of these situations could occur in practice. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. These issues are of particular concern to the operations of the Stock Exchange, and rightly so. The Stock Exchange, unfortunately, has not consulted with the Opposition on this issue as it prefers to deal with government. However, on advice received by the Government, it concerns me that the Stock Exchange may not be following a strictly legalistic approach to what it believes to be a more efficient movement of documents and entitlements. The Liberal-National Party coalition is of the view, based on legal advice, that this procedure may not be in accordance with the Bill as it has been debated today, plus the amendments. However, given the volume and technical nature of the concerns, I have sought the leave of the Senate for those sorts of issues to be evaluated by the authorities at a subsequent time. Unless some technical changes are made to the legislation, I believe that in future a court challenge could well occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now come to another important part of the Bill, which sets out the arrangements for capital expenditure on land degradation measures. Specifically, the Bill proposes to allow primary producers and rural businesses-and that is the extension, which we on this side welcome-to deduct the expenses involved in erecting fences separating different classes of land, thereby preventing land degradation by livestock. Unfortunately, the Bill does not give an explanation of what `other' businesses are; they could be all sorts of businesses. I think my colleague in the other place Mr Ian McLachlan indicated one sort of unsavoury business that could erect a fence and claim a deduction. However, I believe that this provision is far too open-ended, despite the substantiation requirements, because it tends to give very much a free kick to the big entrepreneurs in land-such as the Kerry Packers, who have cash-in the bigger States to erect a lot of internal fencing at the cost of the taxpayers, whereas primary producers and others on smaller allotments, certainly in the more built-up areas, do not have the same freedom in terms of their ability to write off such expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> Because it is necessary to have a land management plan-and we acknowledge that as a significant improvement to a whole farm plan-in providing a substantiation, it is necessary to be able to claim 100 per cent deductibility for erecting fences that separate different classes of land and so prevent land degradation by livestock. A farmer can now prepare his own plan, but it must be approved by an appropriate authority which has the skills required to undertake that exercise. In order to be eligible for deductibility, the land management plan, with the principle purpose of preventing degradation of land, may be prepared by the farmer but must be authorised by an authorised body. The Government has introduced this change since the Bill was brought on in the lower House, and the coalition again thanks the Government for listening to the majority of its requests in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a dilemma has been raised. The Bill introduces what I refer to as direct cross-compliance arrangements. The Government believes that these are necessary to ensure that deductible expenditure is being used for the purpose for which it was intended. At the same time, the direct cross-compliance arrangements introduce significant compliance costs, but these have been minimised as a result of the Government amendment to be moved later concerning the administration of the new tax regime. One of the difficulties that I see about these cross-compliance arrangements is that they tend to run somewhat counter to the self-assessment concept of putting the onus of proof for adequate substantiation on the taxpayer. I am very much in favour of ensuring a high degree of adequacy and compliance in terms of the necessary documentation to support substantiation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have often cautioned senators not to get too excited about counting chickens before they are hatched and so on. I do so again because the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission has just been released. The Government will need to study it. On a preliminary reading of the decision, there have to be mixed feelings about the outcome. For example, the Government regrets that the Commission has decided not to endorse at this point the second and third tranches of the 6.12 per cent increase in the waterfront reform package which would underpin productivity increases of a very much greater order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is obvious that there now needs to be further consultation between employers and unions in relation to the complexities of the decision and to examine what future steps may be necessary to meet the needs of all parties for waterfront reform.

What is the assessment of the Australian Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been widely expected and foreshadowed, the South African Parliament voted yesterday to repeal at last the Population Registration Act. While no further classifications will be made on the basis of race, the existing population register, which does assign all South Africans to one of four main groups, will remain in force until the Constitution has been replaced. Until such time, it cannot be entirely removed for electoral and other reasons and that, I think, is well understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other so-called pillars of apartheid-the Separate Amenities Act, the Group Areas Act and the land Acts-have now all been repealed. But, of course, it is the case that until such time as there is a new Constitution in place giving the vote to all South Africans, apartheid will remain in place and the battle against it will not have been won.</PARA>
<PARA> That is not to belittle the actions that have already been taken by the South African Government which, as I and the Prime Minister have made clear on a number of occasions, the Australian Government very much applauds. In meetings with President de Klerk and others during my visit to South Africa I certainly made it very clear that Australia is fully supportive of the course of action that the Government has embarked upon to dismantle apartheid. I also urged the South African Government to take quick and effective action to overcome the remaining problems or obstacles standing in the way of the formal commencement of negotiations including, in particular, the full and final release of all political prisoners, the indemnification-in order to enable them to return-of all remaining exiles, and the addressing of the appalling problem of internecine violence in the townships.</PARA>
<PARA> Those obstacles are, in my judgment, on their way to being cleared, but they must be cleared before the first phase of sanctions can be lifted in accordance with present Commonwealth and Australian policy. I certainly hope, expect and continue to urge that significant progress will continue to be made thereafter to ensure that the process does not stop with the removal simply of these pieces of legislation-important as that achievement is-but does genuinely result in the final destruction of the abhorrent regime of apartheid.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce may be aware of a decentralised manufacturing operation of McMillan Pty Ltd in the city of Echuca, in my home State of Victoria, which produces gas cylinders in a modern and efficient, purpose-built facility that was officially opened, I believe on his behalf, some six months ago by Minister Blewett. Is he aware that this Echuca operation is now at risk because of imports of competing products from Thailand? I remind the Minister that, in accordance with Australian standards, every portable liquid petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder manufactured in Australia is subjected to rigorous individual and group inspection by means of pressure testing, radiography and random destructive testing, and that materials and personnel used in fabrication must be certificated and qualified. Full type testing of all designs is also required. Can he give absolute assurance that all portable LPG cylinders imported into Australia have been subjected to the same inspection and control regime, and can he verify that every such cylinder fully conforms with the relevant Australian standards? How does he defend the Government's industry and trade policies when they put at risk small decentralised operations like this in which local people have invested alongside the manufacturer to support growth in their community and more balanced development for the country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were a number of questions which Senator Powell asked me. She ended by asking me to defend policies which really are not related to the question. I will give her an answer to the substance of her question, and I think she will see that. I am not directly aware of the problems of the company to which she refers, but it is alleged by her in her question that those problems stem from LPG cylinders imported from Thailand. Certainly, I will ask my Department to make some inquiries of the company immediately to see what its position is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All portable LPG cylinders are subjected to the same testing procedures, irrespective of whether they are manufactured in Australia or elsewhere and are imported. Responsibility for testing LPG cylinders rests with the State and Territory governments and is covered by the dangerous goods regulations of each of those jurisdictions. I can read out the relevant Australian standards, but I do not think I need to. I have those standards here, and I can provide them to Senator Powell later.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of imported LPG cylinders, design approval to Australian standards, or an equivalent international standard, has to be sought from the relevant State government authority under which the cylinders are imported and sold. If a design is improved, the imported cylinders are required to be examined and tested as required by Australian standards at a test station. Testing includes a prescribed number from each consignment being selected at random by the testing authority. That is the same as for locally produced cylinders. They are also subjected to destructive testing at a National Australia Testing Authority registered laboratory.</PARA>
<PARA> In light of this, I do not believe there is unfair competition from imported LPG cylinders due to differential testing and inspection requirements. There may be other aspects of alleged unfair competition which the company may address to my Department when it gets in touch with it about this issue; but it is not on the basis of testing. I add the general warning that sometimes companies faced with competition find reasons for their loss of market share which are not related only to competition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did the Minister for Social Security see a report on 12 June 1991 in the Australian alleging that unemployment beneficiaries employed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in the forthcoming census would lose their unemployment benefit? What does the Minister propose to do about the situation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4817" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think something needs to be done about the situation, but I am not certain that it ought to occur at the social security end. The Social Security Act requires that any income earned by beneficiaries be taken into account in the payment period in which it is earned, irrespective of when it is received. That is done to minimise the loss of unemployment benefit, particularly for those who earn small amounts in casual employment from time to time. It enables them to take full advantage of the income test free area and, at the same time, protects taxpayers and makes sure that full account is taken of substantial casual earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To illustrate that point, it is worth noting two examples. If a single adult beneficiary obtains a part time job paying $50 a week for six weeks, under current legislation that beneficiary would lose $60 for the whole period. To go to the alternative suggested in that same article, taking that into account at the time it is paid, the beneficiary would lose a total of $200. That is obviously not in the interests of either taxpayers or the beneficiary in that we are urging that people maintain periods of work whenever possible.</PARA>
<PARA> At the other end of the scale, if a person were to earn substantial amounts of money from casual work the loss can vary dramatically. For example, if a person were to work in full time casual work for three weeks earning $300 a week, that person would lose $477. If that individual were paid $900 one-off at the end of three weeks he or she would lose only $277, and that would leave open a very big area for unscrupulous people to exploit to their benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, obviously I am of the view that there should be no change in the way the Social Security Act treats the money that is earned. But it is obvious that some employers, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) included, have to take into account those arrangements. We have been urging it to do so for several years. Each time a census approaches there is the same argument about the way in which census collections are made.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that, as a result of discussions with my Department, the ABS has come to an alternative payment arrangement for those who will be conducting the census that will, I hope, remove the kind of controversy we have seen in the last few days. Certainly the way in which Social Security treats earned income will remain the same. It is fair and just both to benefit recipients and to taxpayers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Until the holding of a free and fair election in South Africa it will not be possible to determine with any certainty the popularity of the various political groups in South Africa, but most political commentators in South Africa, on the basis of previous polling evidence, anecdotal material and analytical research, have taken the view that the ANC is by far the most representative black organisation. That view is endorsed and reinforced by the most recent published poll on the subject, which just happened to come out a couple of days ago, over the weekend, by the well-respected market research company Markinor. According to the Markinor poll, 71 per cent of urban black South Africans would vote for the ANC; 3 per cent for Inkatha; 4 per cent for the National Party; and 4 per cent for the Pan-Africanist Congress, the PAC. For choice of leader, Nelson Mandela was first preference for 65 per cent of urban blacks. De Klerk received 13 per cent; PAC leader Makwetu received 4 per cent and Inkatha's Chief Buthelezi 3 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will describe the nature of the Markinor poll. It included 1,300 blacks and 800 whites in the predominantly urban areas of Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Port Elizabeth, East London and Cape Town. Unlike most previous polls, respondents were given a secret ballot, which is clearly a far superior method to previous methods used. Of course, it is the case that it cannot be assumed that those statistics would be repeated if rural blacks were taken into account, and in particular it is obviously the case that Inkatha has almost saturation support as far as blacks in rural Natal are concerned. Equally clearly, on analytical and other evidence, that is not so for the other provinces of South Africa. Given the concentration of black people in those urban metropoles that were the subject of this survey, this clearly amounts to compelling recent further evidence for the view that the ANC is the most widespread supported black organisation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an answer available for Senator Zakharov. Based on preliminary results from the national residue survey for 1990, the percentage of animals tested in which the residues of DDT and dieldrin were found was extremely low at less than one per cent. Of these samples, only five in 10,000 showed levels in excess of the relevant food standard. For dairy products, 1.76 per cent of samples showed residues of DDT and 2.03 per cent of samples showed residues of dieldrin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> About 0.25 per cent of samples showed residues in excess of maximum residue limits. For grains, 0.46 per cent of samples showed residues of DDT and 0.15 per cent of samples showed residues of dieldrin. Some 0.15 per cent of these samples are above the maximum residue limit. Also for fresh fruit and vegetables, 5.83 per cent of samples showed residues of DDT and 0.97 per cent of samples showed residues of dieldrin. Of these samples, less than 0.1 per cent were above the maximum residue limit.</PARA>
<PARA> The second part of Senator Zakharov's question goes to what action the Government has been taking to ensure that food is safe. Since the 1960s, the Commonwealth Government's national residue survey has tested a variety of foods for chemical residues. In response to the detection of residues of organochlorin chemicals in meat shipped to the United States of America in 1987, the survey was intensified. As well as that, a market basket survey is also conducted by the Department of Community Services and Health which focuses on the food obtainable at the retail level.</PARA>
<PARA> I would also note that the use of DDT has been prohibited and the use of dieldrin for agricultural purposes has been banned in Australia. An additional extensive testing program for organochlorins was implemented by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS). This program covers all meat species and has the objective of progressively establishing that individual properties throughout Australia are cleared of organochlorin residue problems.</PARA>
<PARA> More than one million tests have been performed to date. Some 4,000 properties out of 140,000 tested still require further testing. These properties are mainly those where previous agricultural and other practices have left residues in the general environment. The AQIS program has resulted in the residue violation rate in meat reducing from 0.4 per cent to less than 0.1 per cent. This rate is one of the lowest in the world. The AQIS also conducts other testing programs to identify and eliminate potential problems with chemical and other residues in food products. The national antibacterial residue minimisation program, for example, is an AQIS State program designed to heighten awareness among producers in the antibacterial residue issue by a system of abattoir and laboratory testing and the trace back of positive results to the property of origin.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said in respect to this last program, but it can be said in respect to others, many of them are run in conjunction with State authorities and include extension to education for primary producers, suppliers and users on correct chemical application and withholding periods. It is fair to say from this information, and from the information that the Government has available to it, that food produced in Australia-not just Victoria-is amongst the safest in the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The deregulation of the banking industry has certainly brought many lending practices into the spotlight. As the recession has been having some effect in the community, it is quite true that the practice of lending bodies to seek guarantors for loans granted to other borrowers is tending to increase. There is no doubt that there is sometimes too much of an emphasis on the part of those banks and lending institutions on getting security for the loan rather than explaining the effect of obtaining the guarantee from those persons who are under the influence, in many instances, of the borrower and who, to their own disadvantage, agree to act as guarantors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many examples of those who, by reason of their age, business inexperience, lack of facility in English or close personal relationship with the borrower, find themselves under some sort of pressure to act as guarantors in these situations. There is much evidence in the community that this unconscionable practice of obtaining such guarantees has been leading to great distress in many instances. In the early 1980s the High Court of Australia developed an equitable principle to relieve an aged immigrant couple of their guarantee obligations to a bank because they were at a disadvantage and the bank had taken no steps to make sure that they were properly informed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Panizza is referring to when the National Australia Bank was involved in a case where an invalid pensioner couple provided a guarantee on behalf of their son. In fact, the bank moved in to take their home as security against the non-payment of the loan by the son. The Trade Practices Commission has come to a settlement with the National Australia Bank in that case. The settlement terms involve the Trade Practices Commission assisting the National Australia Bank to review its procedures for obtaining loan guarantees. A more general inquiry into these matters is also being conducted by the Trade Practices Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, through the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs, is also working on a number of related fronts in relation to this issue: for example, by seeking protection for co-borrowers and guarantors in State credit legislation, by providing assistance to a law reform inquiry on personal property securities and by, of course, keeping some monitoring eye on the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as the banking ombudsman scheme provides. The banking ombudsman has recently signalled an intention to work with the banks on a broader exercise to the same effect. I hope that the whole lending industry can be involved in such a project.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the principle that lenders should not act in an unconscionable manner and take advantage of those who act as guarantors who may be lacking in a complete understanding of the sort of commitment they are making is a matter that ought to be of concern in the community. I believe that the Trade Practices Commission is taking a very good stand and role in relation to lending institutions that are involved in seeking such guarantees. I certainly hope that the financial community, as I believe is the case, reforms its practices and ensures that its personnel have sufficient training to enable them to use the guarantee system in a fair manner.</PARA>

The National Food Authority will have regard to the following criteria: the protection of public health and safety as an absolute first priority; the provision of adequate information to enable consumers to make informed choices; the promotion of fair trading in food; promotion of trade and commerce in the food industry; and the promotion of consistency with international food standards.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In looking at the schedule of special purpose flights for July to December 1990, my attention was drawn particularly to some flights which took place in October last year. They were duplicate flights-that is, two on each occasion-for Mr Mandela, who is described as the Deputy President of the African National Congress (ANC), and his party. I draw honourable senators' attention to the fact that these flights included a flight by two aeroplanes from Canberra to Darwin to Canberra on 22 October; a flight on 24 October from Canberra to Sydney by two aeroplanes; a flight on 25 October from Canberra to Sydney to Melbourne to Canberra by two aeroplanes; and a flight on 26 October, from Canberra to Melbourne to Sydney to Canberra, again, by two aeroplanes. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about aircraft which cost the Royal Australian Air Force at least $1,500 per hour to operate. According to the report, these flights were authorised by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). One questions the use of these flights when one recognises that this was not in fact a head of state who was being so honoured; it was the deputy head of a political party in a country with which we have maintained merely an arms-length arrangement for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a policy of only selectively allowing people from South Africa to come to this country and those we do allow in obviously are treated like royalty. One questions the justification for the Prime Minister's authorisation of those flights. In the short time that I have had to examine this schedule, it would seem that, at a very minimum, those flights have cost the Australian taxpayer $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA> That may seem to be just chickenfeed to the Government because we have been looking at millions of dollars being handed to the ANC over the last few years. The Opposition is particularly concerned-as it has demonstrated in Question Time today and again yesterday-about the expenditure of taxpayers' money in this carefree and careless fashion. The answers of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to us today clearly have not satisfied the Opposition in terms of the accountability, the manner in which the decisions were taken and the supervision or otherwise of the expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> This Minister-he is an emotional, ill-disciplined Minister-went to that country and undid any good his visit might have achieved had he been of a different personality. He came back here and tried to convince us that he has suddenly seen the desperation of the situation in South Africa. Some of us on this side have visited that country and know full well the degradation in which many Africans live. We condemn that. We do not see any justification for the conditions under which one part of that sad country lives. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Minister might do well to visit other African countries to see that South Africa is not alone in the dreadful conditions under which black Africans live. He has a very selective emotion or reaction. If he has taxpayers' money to be spreading around Africa, perhaps he should look in a very much more careful way at how it is spent. There are other countries which need it just as desperately as the black Africans in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is very concerned at the manner in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of a country in deep recession has gone to South Africa and handed around money which has not been decided upon by the Cabinet. There has clearly been a deal done between the Minister and the Prime Minister. Once again the Prime Minister has authorised expenditure of Australian taxpayers' dollars for no just and proper reason. Yet the Minister went there selectively handing out money and has exacerbated the political situation in that country. The political situation in South Africa has caused horrors and countless numbers of deaths of black Africans, one against the other. By their very actions-the handing over of $17m in the last couple of years-the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister of this country are meddling in the internal affairs of another country in a way which could never be countenanced in our own country. It is appalling that they could find any justification whatsoever for the selective use of Australian money in the internal affairs of another country. Many of my colleagues have drawn attention to this matter over recent days, and I add my voice to theirs. These aircraft flights are yet another example. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be boring, but it is taxpayers' money and that is important. Senator Ray acknowledged at the time that in the four-month period over $100,000 of taxpayers' funds were expended on four flights and on only one occasion was Mr Snowdon accompanied. It is blatant arrogance and hypocrisy for anyone to argue that taxpayers' money should be used in this area, where a Parliamentary Secretary can run around with an open chequebook and obviously an open travel warrant. It highlights a number of the guidelines that need to be reviewed, particularly the use of VIP aircraft. As I said, Mr Snowdon used the jet for transport on at least four occasions, but in the same period I note that he also used VIP flights on at least five other occasions when he was accompanied by other Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently in this Parliament we have also seen tabled the estimates of the Department of Administrative Services, which showed that for the period of the full year of 1990-91 Mr Snowdon spent $40,491 on phone calls from his electorate office and that in the nine months subsequent to that, to March 1991, he spent a further $43,762. The overtime in his office for the same period for the full year was $54,021, and for the subsequent nine months into this year it was $47,903. </PARA>
<PARA> The extravagance of this type of expenditure on phone calls and overtime of the order of $500 per working day in an electorate office-particularly during the period of a Federal election campaign in early 1990, and in a Northern Territory election campaign in September-October 1990, when the Northern Territory President of the Australian Labor Party was on the personal staff of Mr Snowdon in the Darwin office- highlights the arrogance, extravagance and hypocrisy to which this Government is prepared to resort to secure its own election. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is going to talk about disclosure with regard to Federal election campaigns, the disclosure of members, Ministers and senators must also be out in the open. We cannot allow this type of hypocrisy to continue. The matter was highlighted, particularly with regard to the special purpose flights, in the editorial of the Australian at the same time. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the rules covering the expenditure of public funds by MPs are not tight enough to keep members of Parliament on a short lead, they should be redrafted. </PARA>
<PARA> As a backbencher, Mr Snowdon is not entitled to use a VIP jet. But he is also the Secretary of Transport and Communications in the super-ministry controlled by the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley. In that second role he is entitled to use a VIP jet while on official business. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Secretary of the Tennant Creek Show Society has said Mr Snowdon was invited to the show in his capacity as a Territory dignitary and not as a ministerial secretary. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems MPs need a more effective watchdog, capable of sinking its fangs into their self-importance. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, attending dog shows at taxpayers' expense ought not to be a prerogative available to any Federal member of parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish also to draw attention to the Schedule of Special Purpose Flights. I particularly draw the attention of the Senate to the flights of Mr Keating, the former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister. He has made an average of one return flight a week out of Canberra using the VIP service. I was under the impression that there was a fairly frequent airline service out of Canberra; obviously, that is inappropriate for a backbencher of Mr Keating's status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note also that on six of those occasions Mr Keating decided that he would like to have leading members of the Canberra press gallery as his accompanying passengers. I have no complaint about Ministers regarding it as useful or sensible to offer opportunities for the press gallery to travel with them. As I understand, there is recompense from the proprietors of those media organisations to the Government for the cost of those seats. However, it does seem curious to note that Mr Keating seems to use this facility more than his predecessor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the interjection from Senator Crichton-Browne says, it does seem to have worked. Maybe the reason for the extraordinarily strong support from the media for Mr Keating's recent unsuccessful bid to dethrone Mr Hawke has emerged from the close and personal relationships no doubt built up on these numerous flights between Canberra and other capital cities that Mr Keating has provided for members of the press gallery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One would expect that after the Budget there may be a couple of occasions on which the Gallery may find a great deal of merit in travelling interstate with the Treasurer in order to judge the response to the speeches that the former Treasurer gave-particularly last year-indicating that there would not be a recession and that there would be a soft landing. No doubt there was a requirement for the Treasurer to spread that kind of sweetness and light-which turned out to be totally false, of course-to members of the Press Gallery, and this gave him adequate opportunity for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that a large number of these trips do not appear to have any relationship with Budget time. For example, on 4 October Mr Keating and various members of the Press Gallery flew to Sydney and back. </PARA>

Might I say that, now that Mr Keating no longer has access to these special purpose flights, it will be interesting to see whether he moves his home base back to Sydney so that his future travel will no longer be covered by the fiddle that was done by this Government to allow him to get living-away-from-home expenses while living at home in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's Report No. 30 of 1990-91 entitled, Department of Social Security-Age Pension Sub-program-Income and Assets Testing-Real Estate, has only been available to us in our offices for an hour or two, but I could not resist the opportunity to speak on it. It is an indictment, yet again, of the running of the Department of Social Security (DSS), and especially of Senator Richardson's claims that there is no fat left in the system. This Auditor-General's report illustrates, yet again-as did the Auditor-General's report on the Telecom concessions-that, in fact, there is fat in the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The report's summary of findings indicates that the total value of pensioner real estate, excluding the principal home, exceeds $3.9 billion, of which 49 per cent by number and 39 per cent by value was valued by the pensioner and accepted by Social Security. The Australian Valuation Office values real estate if the pensioner's total assets are within $20,000 of or exceed the assets test threshold, or if the Department of Social Security believes the pensioner's own estimate to be significantly understated. Valuation reviews occur only if the total assets come within $20,000 of the assets threshold or when an annual review of the Australian Valuation Office's original valuation is undertaken. In 1990, a joint DSS audit office study found that 85 per cent of pensioner valued real estate was understated. The average undervaluation was $61,224. We are not talking about small amounts of money. Senator Button looked across the chamber: 85 per cent of pensioner valued real estate was understated by, on average, $61,224. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You said that. The Australian National Audit Office estimates that, by reviewing those pensioners whose assets were valued within $40,000 of the assets test threshold, potential net annual savings of $6.8m would be achieved. This is in a section where Senator Richardson tells us there is no fat. I am sure Senator Walsh will be interested in these figures; I wish he was there on the Expenditure Review Committee (ERC) to do something about it. The Audit Office found that, on average, it takes between 90 and 120 days to get an Australian Valuation Office valuation undertaken. The report indicated that there was considerable scope for improvement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no cross-matching of property value and property rental disclosures to DSS. The Audit Office's review found that many rental disclosures did not reflect the value of these properties. The Audit Office found that many properties identified by the evaluation by DSS were not evaluated by the Australian Valuation Office due to the pressures within DSS offices. Given the Government's policies and given our level of unemployment, I presume those pressures will increase even more. It does not give me much hope that that problem will be alleviated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General recommended that the DSS should adopt more efficient real estate valuation review procedures, including a more effective valuation review algorithm that would take into account significant undervaluation of real estate by pensioners. The Auditor-General also recommended that DSS should make a special effort to review the large number of pensioner cases with non-recorded real estate values; that the Department should amend procedures to require staff to seek further information from pensioners disclosing real estate values of less than $10,000; that the DSS should adopt performance standards for obtaining Australian Valuation Office valuations, monitor and follow up outstanding valuations; and that, in consultation with the Australian Valuation Office, the DSS should conduct a pilot study to assess the adequacy of rental disclosures relative to property values. </PARA>
<PARA> In responding, the Department of Social Security claimed that it is in the process of reviewing the assets test valuation process with a view to providing advice to the Government in the near future. The DSS claims that it is the Government's role to amend the assets tests algorithm. The Department of Social Security claims that assessing the adequacy of rental disclosures relative to property values is not relevant to the current provisions of the Social Security Act. It contends that its responsibilities under the Act extend no further than getting rental income information from its clients. The Department also advised that it is in the process of introducing electronic data transfer of valuation requests and results with the Australian Valuation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that that is an area where reform could take place. The Department says that it is not its responsibility, but the Government ought to be looking into the issues-and they are very serious issues-that the Auditor-General has related here. I would not want to see pensioners deprived of any benefits to which they are rightly due. If a large number of pensioners are receiving benefits at the expense of others, that should be considered very carefully as well as the fact that taxpayers' money is going into an area where the Government could tighten up. </PARA>
<PARA> If it were possible, I would derive great satisfaction by clipping this audit report to the submission from the Minister for Social Security to the Expenditure Review Committee. I think it would be quite good reading for the ERC. In the same vein as DSS's highly inefficient telephone rental concessional scheme, which I mentioned earlier, this is yet another example of the excess fat that still needs to be cut from Senator Richardson's portfolio. Despite our urgings, the Minister has not had the courage to recognise the existence of these inefficiencies. Thankfully, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has had the commonsense to reject Senator Richardson's fairly pathetic pleas that there is no fat left in his portfolio and that he should be exempted from expenditure cuts. I think this report demonstrates quite clearly that some measures can still be taken in this Department. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I have not had time to go through the Auditor-General's report on the Department of Community Services and Health entitled Nursing Homes Payment System thoroughly. It is quite a technical report. My attention has been drawn to page 8 of the report where security and access is referred to. In December last year, we had presented in this place a resident rights' agreement, which was an appallingly drafted document, with some tens of amendments from this side of the chamber, amendments from the Australian Democrats and 40 or 50 amendments from the Government before it even saw the light of day, before it even arrived in the Senate. We addressed those issues. We were told that there was a great deal of urgency about addressing the rights of residents in nursing homes-and we all agreed with that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen this matter languishing, and we have yet to see its implementation. Although Minister Staples was talking about residents' rights, about putting enormous pressures on the proprietors of nursing homes, we have seen that he does not have his own house in order. We have seen the rights of residents infringed from the point of view of the Department of Community Services and Health. It is all very well to throw stones, but one should not live in a glasshouse if one does it. Minister Staples' Department has been guilty of not respecting the rights of individuals. I do not care how old or how frail a citizen is, his or her rights are as important as those of every other citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's report refers to the Australian National Audit Office observing a number of deficiencies related to the security aspects of computer operations of the nursing homes payment system (NHPS). These included: lack of restrictions on user access to parts of the database and specific functions of the NHPS which contains information on all residents in all nursing homes in all States. Every resident of every nursing home in every State of Australia is on this computer, and we are told there is a lack of restriction on users. In addition, procedures to ensure that users who leave the Department or cease to work in the nursing homes area have access rights removed were not being observed and required some modification; and procedures for changing and verifying new pass words required some enhancement to improve security. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that we ought to get our own house in order before we cast aspersions on others. It would have paid the Minister to have looked very carefully at this when he was advocating so strongly-and we all supported them-the rights of nursing home residents in their residential accommodation. Their rights should also be preserved in terms of the information that is kept on them by government departments. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In continuation of my earlier remarks in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, I signal that there are likely to be further changes to allow tax deductibility of expenses incurred in the rehabilitation of exploration, mining and quarrying operations. I certainly hope that this is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I point out that the present Bill insists that the site be restored to the condition it was in before mining commenced. The Bill does not allow, for example, for an improvement to occur to the site, and I believe that this point does need addressing. A quarry should not necessarily be refilled. For example, it would be more environmentally viable as a landscaped, man-made lake. The Bill as it stands unfortunately does not allow this. I ask Senator Button, through his Australian Taxation Office responsibilities, to address this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that it is only the mining industry that has received this incentive to protect the environment. Many other industries have occasion to abuse the environment, yet these industries will not be treated in the same manner. Thus, in the introduction of these tax incentives to the mining and quarrying industries we have introduced a major anomaly to the taxation laws or, in common parlance, we no longer have a level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we should note that Australia's record in providing tax incentives to promote sensible behaviour towards the environment is not good and we are at a competitive disadvantage when compared to the rest of the world. Therefore, I again urge Senator Button, through his tax responsibilities in this chamber, to examine this matter a little more closely. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, I point out to the Government that the legislation as presently drafted does not adequately cover the situation of offshore platform decommissioning activities and, as a consequence, does not truly reflect the announcements made in the Budget statements of August 1990. The Australian Petroleum Exploration Association pointed out that it also has concerns with the definition of `site' for the purposes of division 10ab deductions; the priority for deductions under division 10ab; the eligibility of the taxpayer for division 10ab deductions; and restrictions on section 51 deductibility. Unfortunately, time does not allow me to detail those concerns. However, during the committee stage I hope that there will be some more time to explore these matters at length. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one final section of the Bill about which I have some concerns. Section 23af has been altered to recognise some of the problems highlighted by the industries concerned, particularly volunteers abroad, and I welcome the changes made. I acknowledge that the legislation originally gave tax exemption to approved overseas projects so that firms could be more competitive for projects in markets where tax was not paid by local firms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's legislation extends a full exemption from projects of 12 months or longer to projects of 91 days or longer. I understand that the industry welcomes this extension, but it should be pointed out that most projects now typically require very short inputs from consultants because of the world recession. Hence, on projects under 91 days there is still no tax relief because firms and individuals cannot take advantage of section 23af to extend our key competitors' benefit from similar schemes in their countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, I have been informed that, with regard to section 23ag and the extensions of exemption that apply here, it has become apparent that at least one government agency proposes effectively to remove the tax component from the billing rate paid. In other words, the agency proposed to act as a de facto tax office and deny consulting firms and their individual employees the benefits that would otherwise accrue from this legislation. Here we have a classic case of one department not talking to the other, of one department taking advantage of a tax recognition that is appropriately given by this Government. An example of this is the exemption from tax in both countries. The Tax Office knows that this is going on, but it is unable or unwilling to do anything about it. I again ask the Minister to address this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of vital concern that we have a viable and vibrant consulting industry working in the growing Pacific Basin area, where Australia's influence can be acknowledged. I believe that the tax laws of this country need to change to recognise our responsible involvement in areas outside this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 also extends access to tax information provided by the Australian Taxation Office. I remind the Government that care needs to be exercised when widening the scope for access to this type of information by Federal and State bodies. The coalition is not entirely satisfied that due caution has been exercised in deciding on this measure because both the second reading speech of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) and the explanatory memorandum to this Bill are quite silent in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Allied with this Bill is the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1991, which provides legislative authority for the entry into force of a comprehensive double taxation agreement between Australia and the Republic of Hungary and Australia and the Republic of Kiribati. Australia already has comprehensive double taxation agreements with 27 other countries. The addition of the republics of Hungary and Kiribati will take the number to 29. </PARA>
<PARA> As the name suggests, double taxation agreements are designed to avoid double taxation of income tax flowing between Australia and the respective treaty partners to prevent fiscal evasion of the tax covered by the agreements. Under the terms of the agreement, income from real property may be taxed in full by the country in which the property is situated. Business profits are be taxed only in the country of residence of the recipient country unless they are derived by a resident of one country through a branch or permanent establishment in the other country. Profits from the international operations of ships and aircraft are generally taxed only on the country of residence of the operator. Dividends, interest and royalties may be taxed in the country of source, but there are generally limits to tax that the source country may charge on such income flowing to residents of the other country. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that one of the three major recommendations of a House of Representatives committee examining the question of withholding taxes was to refer the withholding tax system and our international tax treaties to the Industry Commission for a comprehensive review. I await the outcome of that review before commenting further. Australia's agreement with Kiribati provides for tax-sparing credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax foregone by Kiribati under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment. This means that, where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from one of the nominated development incentives and is subject to Australian tax, a tax credit is to be allowed by Australia as if the Kiribati foregone tax had been paid. Therefore, in conclusion, the coalition welcomes these Bills, particularly the changes that the Government has proposed and has undertaken to execute. At the same time we urge the Government to examine closely the other matters we have raised during this important debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 cognately with the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1991. The latter Bill deals with the comprehensive double tax agreements which have been signed with the Republic of Hungary and the Republic of Kiribati. The Australian Democrats welcome these double tax agreements and will support the Bill without amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The measures in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) are varied and numerous. It is the first omnibus income tax Bill of the year. It contains measures to extend the income tax to the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands; further modifications to the foreign income tax rules, including the treatment of foreign employment income; further adjustments to the thin capitalisation rules; environmental expenditure on land degradation and mine site rehabilitation; the tax file number requirements for investments; the taxation implications of securities lending arrangements; the simplification of social security legislation; company and superannuation fund self-assessment; the provision of secret information to various crime detection bodies; and a minor amendment to the gift provisions, changing retrospectively the reference to the Royal College of Nursing Australia and reflecting that body's change of name. Following the recent and welcome transitional arrangements applying to small business for the payment of income tax instalments, there are also some technical amendments relating to the payment by instalment of tax by companies and superannuation funds with income exceeding $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the tax deductibility provisions for expenditure on measures to combat land degradation. The Government announced in last year's Budget that the existing tax concessions dealing with land degradation will be improved as from that time, namely, 21 August 1990. The old provision in section 75d had two problems: it applied only to primary producers, hence not covering all rural land, and it applied only to fencing which was directed to preventing further deterioration of land which had already suffered some degradation. The proposed new provision will extend the tax deduction to any taxpayer earning an income from rural land, excluding from mining or quarrying operations, and will thereby include enterprises such as sawmills, riding schools, abattoirs and so on. Furthermore, preventative fencing will be deductible after 21 August 1990 if it is erected pursuant to an approved land management plan. An approved plan is one prepared by an officer of a land conservation agency or by an approved farm consultant. The Government has made some recent adjustments to this legislation following negotiations, and my colleague Senator Robert Bell will deal with this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to certain mine site rehabilitation expenses which will also qualify for tax deductibility where they are incurred on or after 1 July 1991. Most of the expenditure is capital in nature and hence is not deductible under the general deduction provisions. The second difficulty with the current legislation is that, where expenditure is not related to producing assessable income, it is consequently not deductible under the general deduction provisions. The third difficulty is the special concessional deduction provision, which does apply to capital expenditure but is limited to expenses connected with the process of extracting minerals. Thus post-mining rehabilitation expenses do not qualify at this stage. Basically the Bill proposes to remedy the existing situation by treating rehabilitation as an integral part of the mining process. This is, of course, a correct assumption, because in many cases the miner must agree to undertake such rehabilitation to obtain the mining right in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> An outright deduction will be allowed on rehabilitation-related activities incurred after 1 July 1991. The deduction will apply only to expenditure to return the site to the pre-mining condition, not to all and any improvements. Generally this limitation is reasonable. However, a total exclusion may be inappropriate in some situations. An example would be a situation where a quarry has been excavated but cannot be returned to its previous state but rather turned into a lake. Where that facility is established with related amenities, such work and such expenditure should be allowable. We will not be moving any amendments to vary the Bill at this stage, as we understand that the Minister may be making an announcement during this debate about the Government's intention to further review this particular matter, but we feel that this should be addressed in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> The new provisions will not alter the deductibility provisions which currently operate, and the concession is limited to rehabilitating the mine site only. Thus the costs of rehabilitating an area which is connected with the mining operation but is not on site will not qualify. We have some concern that this limitation will provide an incentive for mining companies not to repair areas damaged by mining activities which are not on-site. Should any serious examples come to light, we intend to take some action later in the year on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the taxation of pensions, benefits and allowances paid under social security and veterans legislation, which is now being totally rewritten to simplify the legislation and to align the tax legislation to the new format of the benefit-providing legislation. This is, of course, extremely welcome. No substantive changes are being made to the taxation of any of the pensions and benefits. However, the new provisions run to more than 20 pages of legislation, even though the provision being replaced is only a couple of pages in length. This is an interesting comment when the objective is to simplify and clarify legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the extension of the tax regime to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Currently residents of these islands are subject to Australian income tax only on income derived from sources in mainland Australia or Christmas Island. The Cocos Malay people have voted to integrate fully with Australia, and this involves assuming responsibility under our taxation system and obtaining rights under the social security and Medicare systems. From 1 July 1991 all income and capital gains will be subject to tax. However, to phase in the impact of entry to the tax system, a rebate will apply to individuals which will ensure that previously exempt income will be subject to only 50 per cent of the normal tax burden for the 1991-92 year. </PARA>
<PARA> Fringe benefits will also be brought into the tax system and a 50 per cent exemption will apply for the 1991-92 year to ease the transition. The Medicare levy will apply at the full rate from 1 July 1991. The precedent for a Territory entering the taxation system in this manner is Christmas Island. The individuals there were subject to a four-year phasing-in, whereas companies were immediately liable to full company taxation. The Democrats welcome this gradual phasing-in of tax liabilities, which seems a constructive way to go about the task. We note that there is still no wholesale sales tax on either Christmas or the Cocos Islands but apparently that is a matter which is currently under review. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the security lending arrangements which occur when a person lends securities to another person-the borrower-under an agreement which requires the borrower to return either the borrowed security or identical securities. In the absence of special provisions, such a transaction would trigger the capital gains tax provisions. But the Bill and previous provisions ensure that this is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes to broaden the current exemption in a number of respects: firstly, to increase the eligible borrowing period from less than three months to less than 12 months; secondly, to extend the coverage from securities issued only by listed companies to those issued by all public companies; thirdly, the lender will be entitled to the indexation benefits which accrue on the securities which are the subject of the arrangement, and that seems only fair; and, fourthly, the concession will now be available where distributions, either monetary or scrip, are paid during the period of the loan-in other words, where there is only a part-lending arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> Why was it necessary to extend the lending period from three months to 12 months? I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, to explain during the committee stage, or earlier, why the Government is proposing to lengthen this borrowing period in this way. On the face of it, this is a very long period to temporarily lend securities, and I would be interested in the reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the provision to extend the existing range of bodies to which the Commissioner of Taxation may disclose otherwise secret information. The disclosure is only allowed where the Commissioner is satisfied that the information is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has been or is being committed, or to the making of a proceeds of crime order. The three additional bodies in this legislation are: the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales and the New South Wales Crimes Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing agencies which can receive information include all police forces, the National Crime Authority, the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions. While being extremely conscious of the civil liberties of Australian citizens and the need for privacy, I believe that in these particular circumstances-provided the safeguards remain in place-the extension to provide information to these bodies is fully justified. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the tax file number system which was introduced to limit the amount of tax evasion which occurs. The system has been extended to the social security system and to other income support systems. The Bill makes a number of provisions. The main alteration will ensure that the correct tax file number is quoted where investments are made via one or more interposed entities, such as through trust arrangements. We have no problem with the Government's proposals in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The current system of multiple quotation of tax file numbers where investments are made by interposed entities, such as solicitors, gives rise to double counting of income and consequent assessing errors. The avoidance of these errors is a sound objective and the Government's proposed system of investment body remitter numbers appears to be a workable system to overcome these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The explanatory memorandum detailing these provisions is, however, deficient in a number of respects. We support the laudable inclusion of flow charts to assist in the understanding of legislation. However, all three diagrams explaining these amendments contain errors. On page 129 the interposed entity is shown as having to quote a tax file number to the investor instead of the reverse. The diagrams on pages 131 and 135 also contain errors concerning which bodies must quote tax file numbers or investment body remitter numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> Given their potential legal status, these documents must be absolutely accurate and these mistakes are unfortunate. Having said that, I acknowledge that the Government is trying to make explanatory memoranda more accessible to the lay person as part of the simplification of the legislation process. The new format, by not concentrating on clause by clause analysis, is definitely easier for the non-expert to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes to delete the tax file number requirements from deferred interest investments. The second reading speech states that it is proposed that new rules will be introduced in the Budget Session to deal with these deferred interest securities, and these are certainly required. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to some matters related to the withholding tax. The recent report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration-the Martin committee- entitled Follow the Yellow Brick Road dealt with another problem concerning tax file numbers and the withholding tax. Recommendation 8 of the report suggests that the tax file number system be modified to incorporate non-resident verification procedures, which should require persons depositing funds in Australian financial institutions to provide proof that they are non-residents before they are eligible to have tax deducted at the interest withholding tax rate of 10 per cent. If adequate proof is not provided, tax should be withheld at the top marginal rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem identified is where a genuine non-resident establishes an account in a financial institution but deposits are made and controlled by residents, or where the non-resident is operating as a secret trustee for a resident. The Government must act to implement this and other anti-avoidance recommendations made by the Committee. As I have indicated by press release, the Government will have the full support of the Australian Democrats in these matters. I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment during the committee stage on one of the main provisions recommended by the Martin committee. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with that later. The Bill also proposes to amend the thin capitalisation provisions. These provisions exist to limit the possibility of shifting Australian source income overseas by converting the income into interest by over-gearing the foreign controlled business. Excess interest is precluded from tax deductibility, thereby preserving the Australian company tax base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is proposed to amend retrospectively the provisions from 1 July 1987 by excluding certain types of debt from the definition of foreign debt. The debt instruments to be excluded are debentures which benefit from the section 128f withholding tax exemption where the debentures are purchased by a foreign controller for the purpose of overseas distribution. They may only be retained for 30 days. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate is aware, the Australian Democrats do not support the section 128f exemption as we consider it to be an incentive for Australian businesses to borrow offshore. Consequently, we are critical of this decision which further promotes offshore borrowing by Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the treatment of foreign employment income and fringe benefits, which is also altered under this Bill. Under the current law, an Australian resident working overseas on certain approved projects, either as an employee or as a contractor, may be entitled to a full exemption from Australian tax where the foreign service is 12 months old or longer, or a partial exemption for periods between three months and 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognition of shortcomings led to the Government's announcement last year of proposed reform of these provisions in the context of income tax simplification. The anomaly, which meant that the meagre allowance paid to missionaries and aid workers could be liable to Australian taxation, was brought to the attention of the Senate some time ago, and I commend the Government for finally addressing the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments propose to relax retrospectively-that is, from 1 July 1990-the exemption criteria in two respects. They will reduce from 12 months to three months the length of time foreign service must be performed to qualify for an exemption and extend the exemption to foreign earnings which are currently exempt in the country of source except in specified circumstances. This will assist foreign aid workers and missionaries, but will not allow double taxation treaties to be abused by people performing duties in foreign jurisdictions and avoiding tax when in a position to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I have received a representation to the effect that at least one government agency is proposing to negate, at least partially, the effect of this exemption on Australian residents' income by reducing the payments made to professionals consulting on foreign aid projects-that is, the tax exemption for the consulting engineer, which will be clawed back by lower contract payments. If so, this may tend to discourage Australian firms from competing for these contracts, which is presumably not the Government's aim, and may require some further attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The foreign source income provisions are also amended by the Bill in a number of respects. Firstly, the Government has decided to weaken further the accruals regime by exempting from the tax any dividends paid out of profits which have been subject to an accruals tax by another listed country. The move is consistent with the earlier decision to take into account whether or not foreign income of a controlled foreign entity has been subject to a foreign accruals tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that this unilateral concession granted by the Australian Government should have been considered on a case by case approach, possibly through renegotiation of appropriate double taxation agreements. The issue should be one of tax sharing between the Australian Government and foreign governments concerned-this is, quite often, the United States and the United Kingdom-and not a total abdication of Australia's rights, as has occurred in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Government is proposing to remove the interest charge on distributions which qualify for concessional tax treatment, pursuant to the rebate available under section 102aan. The interest charge is a measure to deny the taxpayer any advantage which would arise from a delayed trust distribution. Section 102aan is a concessional provision which limits tax payable to 10 per cent in the case of distributions made to wind up non-resident trusts. In this case the Government has decided that, in order to maximise the winding-up of non-resident trusts, it is worth while to grant an exemption from the interest charge. It is understandable that the Government wishes to end the use of foreign trusts by Australian residents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats agree with this aim. However the granting of a concessional rate of tax of only 10 per cent is surely enough of an incentive to attract these supposedly legitimate investments back into the Australian tax net. Why should we also remove the interest charge? The Government claims that the interest charge was never meant to apply to these concessional arrangements and only arises because of the delay in the implementation of the accrual system. Perhaps we should look around for other incentives, such as the Order of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the provisions of the Bill. Further amendments are made to tax benefits provided by a controlled foreign company (CFC) to a shareholder through a third party. They are basically of an anti-avoidance nature and are supported. Similarly, the proposal to require record-keeping in circumstances where sections 457 or 459a apply is reasonable and is not opposed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also two different amendments affecting the bad debt provisions. The first involves a technical problem in the structure of section 63d (1), which refers to the amount calculated pursuant to a formula when the formula only provides a proportion. The reference is being made compatible by the substitution of the word `proportion' for `amount'. The second amendment in this area concerns bad debts incurred by a CFC engaged in the business of moneylending. Where the bad debts are attributable to business carried on through listed country branches, a deduction will not be allowed where the debt is written off and an apportionment procedure will be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another matter which I believe the Government should seriously consider rectifying. If necessary, I believe that it could also be dealt with by the Select Committee on Superannuation, which has just been established. I have had representations from a Mr Williams in Queensland detailing the problem he is experiencing with superannuation funds that are not prepared to assist him in receiving the tax exemption on deposits which consist of interest-bearing deposits to the extent of 90 per cent. This provision was obtained by the Democrats as an exemption from the superannuation tax of 15 per cent on amounts deposited as at 25 May 1988 in those funds where income consists of at least 90 per cent interest. The exemption is granted by section 290a of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationale was that the imputation system cannot benefit these funds, and hence they should be exempted from income tax. Mr Williams has been involved in a long and largely unsuccessful battle with one of his superannuation funds, which to this day has refused to claim this particular exemption, which the fund is obliged to pass on to the depositor under the terms of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently, one of these funds, the Five Arrows approved deposit fund, which is administered by Rothschild Australia, has agreed to examine the matter and to take some action to rectify the situation. However, the other fund, the Colonial Mutual approved deposit fund, has so far refused to carry out what I believe is its obligation on behalf of depositors. If funds are negligent in this manner, I believe that the Government should take some action to provide relief. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to a matter on which I will be moving a second reading amendment-that is, tax exemption for progress associations. Attention has been drawn to this matter by the Valentine Progress Association, which is providing community facilities at the expense of members of its community. The Association's Treasurer, Mr Lyn Godfrey, has provided financial statements substantiating that the work done by the Progress Association benefits the community activities of a large number of organisations and individuals of that community. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is a worthwhile network in our community. This Association happens to be in New South Wales and is near Newcastle. I think the Government should seriously look at the definition applied to progress associations and, to the extent that they are providing valuable community services, it should look at tax exemption. In respect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that the decision of the Commissioner of Taxation to not extend income tax exemption to progress associations will have a severe effect on many rural local communities where progress associations provide low-cost community facilities, and calls on the Government to legislate to exempt such associations from income tax''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The omnibus Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 is composed mostly of proposed amendments that were contemplated by the former Treasurer, Mr Keating, as long ago as August last year. The Bill contains a very wide range of amendments to taxation laws. The particular interest to me involves the extension of normal mainland taxation arrangements to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. These provisions implement the memorandum of understanding signed between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the island community on 7 March 1991 and is part of the process of integrating the Cocos community with mainland Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Late last year, I had occasion to receive representations from a number of people who were concerned about the changes being imposed, particularly on the Malay people, Australian residents who live on Cocos (Keeling) Islands. At that time I received representation, in particular, from an educator and lady with anthropological interests, Ms Pauline Bunce. At the time I made that information freely available to the appropriate portfolio Minister-the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Simmons. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may recall that at the time the implementation of the memorandum of understanding was delayed from signature from December last year until March of this year. I am now well aware that Ms Bunce, who has recently been back to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, still shares the concerns that she made at that particular time about the process of consultation between Australia and the Malay community on the islands. In fact, I will quote in part from a letter that Ms Bunce wrote to the Minister dated 27 April 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>It is my personal opinion, based on a long-standing close relationship with these people that there are serious and recurring signs of social disintegration within the community and that grave fears are held for their future. </PARA>
<PARA>Further in the same letter in talking about the process and the memorandum Ms Bunce says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . despite the public distribution of Malay and English versions of this document through people's post office boxes, I found widespread ignorance of the document's very existence, let alone the nature of its contents. Apart from your speech given at a social gathering earlier this year, there has been no other public discussion of this document. There has been no open question-and-answer meeting, no house-to-house visiting and only vague responses to questions asked of Council members. There has been no meaningful ``consultation'' with the wider community at all. </PARA>
<PARA>The overwhelming majority of the ninety-six Home Island households are non-literate and non-English-speaking. As far as I could ascertain, most have discarded their copies of the Memorandum as ``just another bundle of paper'' in their postbox. They cannot remember ever receiving it-although I have been assured by the Council Secretary that they did. </PARA>
<PARA>People are now discovering the ramifications of this agreement one at a time, as and when they happen. People say that so many things are happening ``without warning''. </PARA>
<PARA>Most villagers did not know that their leaders had even gone to Canberra to sign this life-changing document. The first that many of them knew was when they saw these men on television ``signing something with Bob Hawke.'' One of the leaders had told some friends that he was going to Canberra to ``sign a contract''. They had interpreted his comment to mean a work-contract. The other told people he was going ``to sign'' . . . without any further details. </PARA>
<PARA>I spoke with several Council and Cooperative committee members as well as the Council Secretary, and it is my firmly-held belief that even these people do not fully understand the ramifications of this document in terms of their own families' future circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter raises some very serious issues that must be of continuing concern to this Parliament and particularly to the Government. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands have been tax-free since their acquisition by Australia in 1985. At the time of the Act of Self-Determination in 1984, the Commonwealth indicated it would review their tax-free status and the Cocos Malay community has always accepted this position. Under the changeover to mainland standards, the Cocos Malay will receive full mainland wages, as well as the full range of government services, benefits and grants assistance. Accordingly, the community has agreed that it should pay the same taxes and charges as mainland communities taking account of the remote area rebates, et cetera, as currently allowed on the mainland. Although wages have commenced incrementing towards mainland rates from 1 July 1990, it has been agreed that Commonwealth taxes will not commence phasing in until 1991. This will assist the community to maintain full employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cocos (Keeling) Islands will remain excise and duty free for the time being, which may also assist tourism development. For residents of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, this will mean that they will no longer qualify for exemption from tax on income derived in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Norfolk Island or from sources outside Australia. The transitional arrangements for the phasing in of personal income tax will see the tax liability of individuals and certain trustees on income that was previously exempt from tax, reduced by 50 per cent during the 1991-92 income year. </PARA>
<PARA> Full tax will first apply to such income from the commencement of the 1992-93 income year. Full rates of company taxation will also apply to previously exempted income and capital gains of Cocos (Keeling) resident companies in the 1991-92 financial year. Capital gains tax rules will now apply to all assets disposed of on or after 1 July 1991 by residents of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. However, in respect of previously exempt assets, only the gain which has accrued on or after 1 July 1991 will be subject to capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> A consequential effect of the proposed amendment is that in 1991-92 and in later income years residents of Norfolk Island will be liable to tax on income or capital gains derived from sources in the territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the same way as they are presently liable to tax on income gains from sources in mainland Australia. That may not mean a lot to many people but I am sure that it will to tax accountants and to people who have used these facilities in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Fringe benefit taxation rules already apply to benefits provided to employees in the territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. However, fringe benefits tax is not payable where the employee's salary or wage is exempt from taxation. Accordingly, under the existing law, few fringe benefits paid to employees in the territory are subject to fringe benefit taxation because the remuneration received by employees is usually exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> To be consistent with the proposed introduction of new arrangements for taxation of income derived by genuine residents of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Bill proposes measures which will phase in the imposition of fringe benefit provided from 1 July 1991 to employees in the territory. The introduction of fringe benefit taxation will be phased in over a period which will largely mirror the changes for personal income tax. Considering the fact that the normal fringe benefits year runs from 1 April to 31 March, the Bill proposes that the fringe benefits tax be phased in over the period 1 July 1991 to 31 March 1992, with full fringe benefits to apply from 1 April 1992 onwards. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue, according to the Minister, Senator Button, is estimated at $260,000 in 1991-92 and $750,000 in 1992-93. It must be remembered that this will be offset by the introduction of the full range of assistance and welfare measures available on the mainland. The move is welcomed by the Opposition and we will not be opposing these provisions. However, I would also draw to the Senate's attention an important report tabled recently in the House of Representatives entitled Islands in the Sun which addresses many of the issues of legal regimes in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean and also Norfolk Island in the Pacific Ocean. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the potential and the future of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, we need to be aware that these islands will, because of the taxation measures in the explanatory memorandum, undergo very considerable sociological change in the next few years. To a large extent, the community is dependant at the moment on welfare and government provisions. It will be necessary to ensure that work is created in those communities. Probably the only way in which this will adequately happen and come into effect will be through the development of tourism and environmental projects, creating jobs in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. </PARA>
<PARA> The report Islands in the Sun recommends that a number of government services ought in future to be provided from Western Australia, particularly in the fields of education and health. As those changes take place, it will be important to watch the changes that will happen in the sociology of the largely Malay community on Cocos and Christmas Islands. I believe that is the very point that Pauline Bunce is making and the concerns that she has and that she has put to me and to the Minister, Mr Simmons, in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as Australia is concerned, the infrastructure which we provide on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is most important, particularly in the areas of defence and quarantine. We must acknowledge that the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are Australia's defence carrier in the Indian Ocean. We ought not to walk away from the important defence and strategic implications that the Cocos (Keeling) Islands have for all of us. At the same time, the quarantine facilities on the islands are an important primary industry facility. As I said earlier, we must ensure that the community on the islands receive meaningful work and investment opportunities, whether it is in tourism or in the government infrastructure projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important aspect that we should be looking at is that there are people living on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. It is our responsibility to ensure that the impositions that we impose on their lifestyle and on their economy are properly under surveillance and under consideration at all times by this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. I would like to deal with clause 30 of the Bill, which refers to the changes in land degradation. In doing so, I read from the explanatory memorandum to highlight what is happening in this particular area:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the tax laws in two ways. Firstly, a deduction for these capital expenditures is also to be available to all taxpayers who carry on a business using rural land in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the Bill also provides a deduction for expenses to both primary producers and taxpayers who carry on business using rural land in Australia, where fences are erected primarily and principally to prevent degradation of the land whether or not that particular area is already degraded. </PARA>
<PARA>Currently, the law only allows the capital cost of fences where they are erected primarily and principally to prevent further land degradation in already degraded areas.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Bill is saying that there will be deductions of expenditure on prevention of land degradation for all rural businesses. The Bill also says that the business must derive its income from the land but that the business does not have to own the land. </PARA>
<PARA> A point that I wish to raise in this debate-I will be pursuing it in the committee stage; this decision was made last August and we now have the legislation before us-concerns what happens on those particular properties where work has been carried out in terms of land degradation without having the definition which was required in front of them for the approval of whole farm plans. Of course, that is to be amended now-I will speak on that in a moment-to a land management plan. I believe that there should be some mechanism put in place which will allow those rural businesses or farmers who are operating on the land to be able to make the claim for the work that has gone in during that period. It is virtually close to one year in practical working terms-it would be one year for most of the businesses-since this change to the taxation system has been in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to the amendments which I, along with my colleague Senator Watson will pursue-the honourable member for Barker, Mr McLachlan, has pursued them also-concerning the changes from a whole farm plan to a land management plan. We welcome this change because the whole arrangements are made much more practical and will lead to a much better utilisation of this particular amendment to the taxation law. The reason it improves the situation significantly is primarily that putting together a farm plan is a very costly and expensive business. In many instances, one does not need a whole farm plan to tackle the problem of land degradation. It also allows for the larger holdings, in particular, to be carried out in stages. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important point with regard to this amendment relates to the approval of those plans. It has now been extended to go beyond the landcare consultancy agencies to include farm consultants. While this is welcomed for those people who will be able to approve land management plans, one must ask the question: why is it necessary to put this red tape in place? I believe it will be far more effective if it is done by the farmer himself. In most instances-I will not claim all-farmers have a much greater and intricate knowledge of the detail of the land types, water flows, wind directions and all the things that are important in combating land degradation. I pose the question: why could this not have been dealt with through self-assessment?</PARA>
<PARA> In the couple of minutes remaining, I would like to highlight the importance of this particular area in my own State and outline what has occurred there in the last 12 months. If we compare the national soil conservation report of 1989-90 to the situation we find ourselves in now, we find that at the end of 1989-90, 70 per cent of land users were involved in landcare district programs, or soil conservation committees as they are called in Western Australia. Today, close to 80 per cent of land users are involved. In June of last year there were 109 landcare district committees (LCDCs); today, there are 130. Seventy-five per cent of the agricultural land was covered by committees at 30 June last year; today, over 85 per cent of agricultural land is covered. </PARA>
<PARA> On 30 June, 80 per cent of the pastoral lands were covered with landcare districts. Today, almost 100 per cent of the lands are covered. In other words, Western Australia has a very small way to go towards putting the land care infrastructure of the people necessary in place for total conservation management of rural land use. It has been estimated that the $350,000 of funding from the Federal Government spent in this area, with the community contribution that has gone into that through self-help programs, is worth in excess of $1m. It has been a very effective investment in terms of conservation. </PARA>
<PARA> I touch on a couple of other points relating to the landcare committees. Over 1,500 people are now involved in the committees, 89 of those committees having women actively participating as committee members. A total of 120 women are involved in the LCDCs. Four women chair the committees. There are 46 secretaries, seven shire representatives, including three from the Western Australian Farmers Federation and three from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association. Fifty of the women involved are land users and 11 are Department of Agriculture officers. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome these amendments because I believe that they will give much greater scope and incentive to tackling land degradation problems. However, I re-emphasise my concern, firstly, that virtually 12 months have slipped past since the decision was made, and I believe that those people who have continued to carry on with soil conservation measures aimed at reducing land degradation should not be disadvantaged because the mechanism for approving farm plans has only now been put in place. Secondly, I am concerned about the red tape that has been put around this subject. I believe that in the vast majority of cases-I am talking in excess of 95 per cent-the land users, particularly the pastoralists and farmers, would have a much more intricate knowledge than others of the land degradation problems and would know more about fence positioning, tree planting, drainage and so on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 gives effect to a number of changes to taxation laws. I do not intend to canvass all these changes but rather to address some remarks to clause 30 of the Bill, which will change section 75d of the principal Act. Anyone with rural property would be familiar with this section, which deals with allowable deductions for expenditure on the prevention of land degradation. Taxation deductions for farmers can hardly be said to have been consistent over the past few years. In fact, it seems that in just about every Budget-depending on whether an election is waxing or waning-successive governments either give or take away deductions for various farming activities. Perhaps because this is the Decade of Landcare or perhaps because it is a relatively cheap offering to the rural sector, the Government has decided to give something back to the farmers of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will summarise briefly the proposed changes in the part of the Bill I am most interested in at this stage. Under the existing law, a deduction is available for certain capital expenditures that prevent or combat land degradation. This deduction is limited to taxpayers who carry on a business of primary production using land in Australia. However, this Bill proposes to amend the taxation laws in two ways. First, a deduction for those capital expenses will also be available to all taxpayers who carry on a business on rural land in Australia. Secondly, a deduction will be provided for the expenses of both primary producers and taxpayers who carry on a business using rural land in Australia where fences are erected primarily and principally to prevent-that is the operative word-degradation of the land, whether or not an area is already degraded. Currently the law allows a deduction for the capital cost of fences only where they are erected primarily and principally to prevent further land degradation in already degraded areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition-in particular members of the National Party of Australia, who have a special interest in rural constituencies-welcomes this commitment by the Federal Government. It will cost only $2.7m in 1990-91; $4.2m in 1991-92; and about $5m in 1992-93. That is a small price to pay for protecting a vital asset-the soil and the land of Australia. Given the prevailing attitude of this Government to the rural sector, it is a pleasant change to see-at least in this legislation-that it is prepared to acknowledge that farmers ought to be encouraged and assisted in their endeavours to protect our greatest natural resource, the soil. Most things stem from the soil, and I think that has not been acknowledged as often as it should have been in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I add that the Government is now so out of touch with rural Australia that it did not bother to consult on or consider how these taxation deductions ought to be established. In the view of the Opposition and of most, if not all, rural organisations, the Government's original proposition was totally unworkable and unaffordable, especially in these impossibly bad economic times. The original legislation proposed that farmers should submit a whole farm plan, duly designed or approved by a farm consultant or other appropriately qualified person. Senator Watson, who led this debate for the Opposition, did a lot of good work behind the scenes and obviously there was some good reciprocal work by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the new Treasurer (Mr Kerin). Perhaps Senator Watson would have achieved even more had the former Minister not been shifted from that portfolio to take on the position of Treasurer. Be that as it may, I believe Senator Watson has achieved through his endeavours a lot for country people in making this Bill more workable. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Watson worked for and what he sensibly and successfully suggested was that the term `whole farm' was too wide-reaching and that a more appropriate term was `land management plan', which may or may not involve the whole farm. In the present economic climate I think it is unlikely that farmers with large holdings could afford to undertake land care programs involving their entire operations. The Government has actually accepted that change to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years the Government has acknowledged the importance of sound soil management and has promoted, if more in word than in deed, land care groups across Australia. In his speech a few moments ago Senator Crane alluded to that. I believe that my support for and interest and involvement in soil conservation are well known. For too long soil conservation has been a much neglected environmental issue. It has never attracted the media hype and passionate emotions of the tree huggers and whale watchers. In fact, it could probably be said that it is just not a sexy subject, as is hugging trees and walking through the forests. Even now, despite wide media coverage and raised public consciousness, I do not believe there is enough understanding about soil erosion. I do not believe that the average Australian appreciates the significance of what soil erosion costs in terms of lost production, lost opportunities and lost soil. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia remains dependent on the productivity of its rural sector and will do so for many decades to come, yet it continues to expect its farmers to produce export commodities in an economic climate that defies belief. This legislation will provide some little taxation relief to those farmers lucky enough to have any income whatsoever this year. I wonder whether the legislation could have gone a little further and provided tax credits, if you like, for soil conservation works, whether fencing or other works, that could have been carried forward for future years when people in the rural communities might have had a taxable income and would have received the benefit of doing that work to protect our soil and our country. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this year the impact for many will be minimal or non-existent. Given that so many of our wheat and wool farmers are being forced out of those industries, there will be few farmers in these commodities purchasing fencing or other materials or undertaking earthworks to contain the land degradation problems. For those farmers tax deductibility is irrelevant. The reality of eligibility for tax deductions is that one has to be able to afford to spend the money in the first place in order to attract the tax benefit. For the thousands of farmers with negative incomes this year, tax deductibility for any expenditure is not a consideration. At the moment no money is available to buy fertiliser, to replace stock, or even to provide for pasture regeneration. Certainly there is no money for frills such as planting trees, gully erosion control and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Land management, while an essential element of any sound farming enterprise, has become an expendable luxury. So while the intentions of the Bill are sound, in reality the Bill is quite meaningless and of little consequence in this year. What it gives in the form of a very small inducement the Government has already taken away in crippling interest rates, lost export markets, nil to slow labour market reform, no impression whatsoever on waterfront reform, and soaring cost structures that have seen the decimation of our rural towns and communities. Indeed, this Government will be remembered in history as the most destructive of rural Australia. Today we can acknowledge, however, the very small plus made by this Bill, but in a long list of things that the Federal Labor Government has taken from Australia it is a very small reversal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a few brief remarks to make on two aspects of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. Firstly, I agree with Senator Crane, who spoke earlier, that where possible farmers themselves should be encouraged and should be able to prepare whole farm plans, or plans of any nature to do with the management of their property. The principles of substantiation rules should apply here as they apply for other taxation measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Experts in this area of land management agree with this principle and support the development of those skills by the land managers concerned, but it seems to me that this principle is made difficult to follow by the way this legislation has now developed-in particular, by the amendments to be moved by the Government which omit the reference to the term `whole farm'. If that term had remained and if that amendment had not achieved the deletion of the words `whole farm management', it would have been possible to move a series of amendments which accommodated both aspects-both the possibility of the farmer or the land manager preparing his or her own whole farm plan for taxation deductibility and the lesser proposition that it too could have been made tax deductible. As things have transpired, I see little point in pursuing that and it is with some disappointment that I have reached that position. However, that is as it may be. Perhaps it can be done on a future day. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I wish briefly to indicate that during the committee stage I will be moving on behalf of the Australian Democrats some other amendments to enable the employer liability for the higher education contribution scheme under the training guarantee scheme to be altered to become tax deductible. I will speak further on that during the committee stage. It is an anomaly which exists at the moment and which can be rectified by moving amendments in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been monitoring the contributions of honourable senators to this debate. I thank them for their contributions and for their essentially positive remarks. It is a little disappointing that a couple of the later speakers in the debate were seeking to open up a discussion about economic policy and rural policy in general instead of continuing with the more positive tone we had earlier welcoming the improvements in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the amendments which will be moved in the committee stage to improve it further. I thank those who have been involved in the negotiations with regard to these amendments because they have been positive negotiations, and I welcome that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To continue that positive note, I also welcome the comments that have been made by Senator Watson, my counterpart in so many of these debates, who has correctly made some positive remarks about the explanatory memorandum. I do not want to go on about this too long, but I think it is something that the Senate ought generally to welcome. The other thing that Senator Watson commented on to which I wish to refer related to the plain English section in this Bill, which is, in a sense, a flow-on from some changes in other legislation. It is a sign of what can be done and, I hope, a sign of what might more effectively be done in the future. It is an example of the way in which the existing arrangements, given the proper opportunity, can deliver positive results in the area of plain English. I would like to see that continued and enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that some comments were made by both the Opposition and the Democrats concerning mine site rehabilitation. They wanted some clarification of the Government's intentions in relation to some concerns expressed by the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association. In responding to that, I refer to a letter which I sent to that Association earlier this week, which read in part:</PARA>
<PARA>It was, of course, indicated in the 1990-91 Budget announcement that the removal of oil platforms would be covered by this amendment and the Government considers it sufficiently clear that such outlays are encompassed by the general understanding of mine site rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA>References to `restoration of a site . . . to, or to a reasonable approximation of, the pre-mining condition of the site' are intended to limit the application of the provisions to rehabilitation ensuring they do not apply to improvements. It is not intended that the provisions only apply where the mine site is fully or largely rehabilitated. Thus expenditures that only partly restore the site will not be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the concerns you and others have expressed, the Government will amend the legislation in the Budget Sittings to make this totally clear. </PARA>

I do say that expenditures that only partly restore the site will not be excluded. Other matters were raised in the letter by Mr Orchison, and the Government is giving some further consideration to those. But I think those paragraphs cover most of the concerns raised by honourable senators. Some general philosophical points were made about the tax system, which time will not permit me to deal with, in terms of expediting efficient handling of the whole of the legislative program before us. Some other more technical points were raised, which we can deal with in the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that Senator Watson has incorporated some further matters on securities lending and I thank him for discussing that with me earlier. All I can say about that at the moment is that we will consider these comments during our further deliberations on the legislation. I do not want to respond specifically at the moment. I think I have addressed the priority points that I wanted to raise in the time available. If there are some matters of particular detail to which honourable senators wish to have a second reading response, I will deal with them at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about the question raised by Senator Spindler concerning the tax status of progress associations. I do not want to get into a situation with regard to this matter-any more than I did with regard to mine site rehabilitation-of becoming a court of appeal for individual taxpayers. I will not attempt to give interpretations of circumstances when I do not know all the facts relating to individual taxpayers. But in the Newcastle region, particularly, there has been some misunderstanding of the situation with regard to bodies such as progress associations. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put these points clearly: various non-profit community organisations-sometimes described as progress associations-generally are exempt from income tax under the Income Tax Assessment Act. These are organisations which conduct activities such as maintaining local sports grounds, school of arts halls and so on. The exemption would not apply to bodies which conduct significant political or lobbying activities. </PARA>
<PARA> `Progress association' is a phrase which covers a multitude of different organisations and I, of course, do not know the circumstance of the one referred to. But in general, what we would normally call `progress associations'-those of which I am aware, such as community associations-would be exempt as a result of recent amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that there has been some misunderstanding because of the wording of a pamphlet which was distributed by the Newcastle branch of the Tax Office, but that has been withdrawn. It was substantially over-general. The points I have made on this matter can be applied generally. Their application in every circumstance will depend on the facts of the case but a more comprehensive explanatory document will be emerging from the national office shortly. I can assure the Senate that, in general, bodies which we normally call `progress associations'-those non-profit community organisations-would be exempt from income tax under the Income Tax Assessment Act unless there are particular and special circumstances with regard to any particular association. With those comments, I thank the Senate for its general support for the legislation and I commend it to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA>``Repeal of Section 64a</PARA>
<PARA> `4a. Section 64a of the Principal Act is repealed.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Essentially, the purpose of the amendment is to insert after clause 4 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 a clause, the purpose of which is to repeal section 64a of the principal Act. According to the training guarantee legislation, employers would not be liable to pay the higher education contribution scheme (HECS) charge in relation to persons attending institutions for training purposes under that scheme. However, an anomaly exists because under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 there is no exemption from that charge. </PARA>
<PARA> This anomaly was raised by the Australian Democrats in the committee stage during the debate on the Training Guarantee Bill 1990. At that time the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) gave the Democrats his assurance that this anomaly would be corrected. He said that it could not be done in the context of the present training legislation but would have to be done as an amendment to a taxation law. Hence, we are discussing this change now. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation anomaly also means that HECS fees paid for public courses are not deductible compared with charges for private courses. Therefore, this component of training expenditure represents a disincentive for employers to seek out training in public institutions compared with private providers. In this chamber on 31 May 1990, Senator Bolkus said that the Government was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . prepared to look at the tax treatment of employer payments to HECS to ensure that public institutions are not put at a disadvantage. </PARA>

<PARA>8. C is a non-taxable company incurring a private expense. </PARA>
<PARA>9. D is a non-taxable company incurring a HEC's expense. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA> There is an after tax advantage to both taxable and non-taxable employers if they send their employees to non HECS institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> For taxable companies the difference arises because of subsection 51 (6) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which denies a tax deduction for any HEC's payment. </PARA>
<PARA>This reduces the distributable income of the HECS paying company by HECS x CTR = $1,800 x .39 = $702. </PARA>
<PARA> This can only be altered by an amendment repealing subsection 51 (6). </PARA>
<PARA> For non-taxable companies the difference arises because of subsection 64a of the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 which excludes all taxable companies from Fringe Benefit Tax in respect of HECS payments but does not operate where employers are exempt from income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This reduces the distributable income of the HECS paying company by HECS x FBTR = $1,800 x .47 = $846. </PARA>
<PARA> This view of the operation of section 64A was given by the Commissioner of Taxation in Income Tax Ruling MT2046. Although of no legal effect the Ruling is, in my opinion, correct and definitely indicates the Commissioner's practice on this matter. Withdrawal of the Ruling is a possibility-this recently occurred with former Ruling MT2035 however this occurred after a conflicting Court decision and a concerted campaign for its withdrawal. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently amendment of the Fringe Benefit Tax Assessment Act seems the only viable option. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will read briefly from page 1 of a document prepared by the Parliamentary Research Service which refers to this matter. I think it may illuminate the issue for those who are trying to understand what I am on about. The document states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Higher Education Contribution (HECS) payable under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 is not an allowable deduction for income tax purposes under section 51 (6) of the Assessment Act . . . The non-deductibility applies even to an employer in respect of HECS paid on behalf of an employee. HECS also do not form part of expenses of self-education under section 82a (2) . . . Thus HECS cannot form part of self-education expenses under section 51 or expenses of self-education under section 82a. </PARA>
<PARA> Under section 26(1) (d) of the Training Guarantee Act 1990 payment of fees, HECs and payments in reduction of HECs debts in relation to eligible training programs would be eligible training expenditure if paid by an employer. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, they are tax deductible. It is immediately apparent that that is an anomaly which can be removed by the amendment we are now proposing. Under section 51(7) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the training guarantee charge is not an allowable deduction for income tax purposes. The law requires an amendment to allow HECs paid by an employer in relation to an eligible training program as a deduction for income tax purposes. That is essentially the nature of the amendment we are proposing. </PARA>
<PARA> To facilitate that amendment and also to make sure it does not bring about a complication with fringe benefits tax, I refer to clause 28, and I will speak for another 60 or 70 words on that. I mention clause 28 as it deals with fringe benefits. We would amend section 51(6) with the effect that it applies except to the extent that the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) are paid by an employer in relation to an eligible training program to qualify as eligible training expenditure for the purposes of the Training Guarantee Act. That would follow through. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment would also be necessary to section 64a of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 so that the deduction allowed under the proposed proviso of the Income Tax Assessment Act is not treated as a fringe benefit for the purposes of that Act. I think it would be fairly straightforward, when the next clause comes through, to insert that provision. I will leave it at that. The chart which has been incorporated explains the differences. It does not have a lot to do with the actual principle which I think is straightforward. There is an anomaly in an employer or an employee seeking to obtain taxation deductibility for the expenses of the higher education contribution scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the Committee's attention to clause 18 of the Bill which is referred to on pages 86 and 91 of the explanatory memorandum. I thank the Australian Taxation Office for this new expanded explanatory memorandum because not only do we have the clause before us but also we have the section to be amended or repealed, the subject matter and the particular page reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 18 effects an amendment in respect of overseas income, which I believe needs some clarification. Proposed new section 23a has been altered to correspond with the problem highlighted by a number of the consulting industries concerned and also by Australian students working on projects overseas. I commend the Government for the amendments which pick up the problems being faced by many Australian volunteers working abroad who were in receipt of fairly nominal salaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The three major changes in that case are welcomed by these institutions and by the very willing Australians who are prepared to give up part of their lives to leave Australian shores and to work under some fairly difficult circumstances for minimum reward. The income tax changes will undoubtedly bring about some great relief. In addition, the legislation will give tax exemption to approved overseas projects so that firms can bid more competitively for projects in markets where tax was not paid by the local firms. We welcome that. The Government's legislation extends a full exemption for projects of 12 months or longer to projects of 91 days or longer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, the volunteers abroad industry and the consulting industry all welcome these changes. I believe it should be pointed out, not grudgingly, but in a helpful way, that most projects typically require short inputs from consultants because of the recessionary conditions applying here and elsewhere. Hence on projects under 91 days there is still no tax relief. Firms and individuals cannot take advantage of proposed new section 23af to the extent that our key competitors benefit from similar schemes in their countries. I therefore use this occasion of the debate on clause 18 to ask whether the Government could reconsider the 91 days situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter was raised with me on several occasions by organisations seeking the sort of modification that we have now made. It is my understanding that for the moment it is likely to meet most of the concerns that the industry raised with me in advance. After 91 days there will be a full exemption. At the moment I do not think there is anything before me that makes me consider that we will have to do more than that. But if subsequent information comes forward from experience gained from this that indicates it is not discharging the intention of the Government, obviously we will look at the legislation, because it is not the words that we are concerned about, it is the outcome. I think this will achieve our desired outcome; but if it does not, I certainly will look at it when any subsequent information arises.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for that assurance. Undoubtedly, the reduction from 12 months to 91 days goes a long way to meeting the concerns-it is a significant reduction. The economic conditions around the world now are not quite what they were when the matter was considered; therefore, the time that consultants, particularly, can spend in overseas countries has been severely diminished. With that in mind, perhaps we will have further consultations with the Government to see whether circumstances do exist to warrant a further reduction from 91 days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to section 23a (g) and the extensions of exemption that apply, is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that at least one Government agency proposes effectively to remove the tax component from the billing rate paid? In other words, does the agency propose to act as a de facto tax office and to deny consulting firms and their individual employees benefits which would otherwise accrue under the legislation-that is, the exemption from tax in both countries? The matter has been drawn to the attention of some taxation offices; whether to the central office, I do not know. What can be done about this situation? Can the Parliamentary Secretary investigate this situation and ensure that the problem does not continue, particularly with Commonwealth agencies?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that at least one Government agency has given some consideration to making modifications to allowances-if that is the appropriate phrase-to pick up the impact of these changes. That is not a cause of concern from a tax policy point of view; but if we find in other areas of policy that it is cutting across the public policy objectives, we will look at it from that point of view.

They are the result of further representations to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments were developed in consultation with the Australian Stock Exchange. They do not change the substance of the Bill and have no effect on the revenue. The Stock Exchange is satisfied that the proposed amendments deal with the concerns that it expressed about the practical operations of some of the provisions relating to securities lending arrangements and that they will facilitate the implementation of an improved settlement system. The transfer of franked dividends provisions will not take effect until at least 1 August 1991. This will allow the Stock Exchange more time to put new rules and procedures in place. Full details of the amendments are contained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators. I commend the amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the opportunity of incorporating into my speech during the second reading debate a large number of technical concerns about scrip lending and the status provisions of shareholders. I also take this opportunity of drawing the Government's attention to the related provisions in section 160aqa to ensure that the Government is aware of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is incumbent on me to signal that the Opposition believes there is still a fundamental deficiency in proposed new section 160b (3) (c); that is, a requirement that the specified events occur during the borrowing period in order for a lender to obtain relief under the section. In practice, this will often not be the case, as distributions are often made some time after the books' closing date. But the Opposition, after consultation with legal authority, believes that there can be complications in certain limited areas-they will not be the norm-particularly, if delivery of the securities takes place before the relevant distribution is actually paid, then the requirements of the section could not be met. I would like that clarified, if possible; if it cannot be, it does not really matter. I would be happy about a subsequent explanation. It is a fairly technical feature. It should be sufficient that the distribution issue, et cetera, is received by the borrower by reason of his being the holder of the security on the day of the books closing in respect of the payment of the distribution. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to 9c, 9d and 9e, I believe that there is a fundamental problem with section 26bc (3) (c), in that the conditions of the proposed sections are impossible to satisfy when the borrowing period is brought to an end before the time of exercising the right or option of the issuing of bonus shares. Again, it is a fairly limited circumstance, but it can arise. As I indicated in my speech during the second reading debate, I believe that at some time, providing the transfer and the borrowing being of sufficient quantity, a court case could arise. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Stock Exchange rules will be amended and that there is a possibility of a taxation ruling on this. But it does concern me that in both circumstances technically both will not comply with the law. I believe that when institutions, for very good and practical reasons, organise rules to expedite the transfer of securities and other arrangements that are not 100 per cent within the law, it is incumbent on the Opposition to indicate the possibility of legal challenge because of that deficiency. I do not think we should be encouraging institutions such as the Stock Exchange, for purposes of convenience, to write rules around legislation which technically do not comply 100 per cent with the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the maximum borrowing period is now to be extended to 12 months by the Bill, and that the replacement securities are to be identical securities, there is now a greater probability that the section cannot be complied with as a result of the circumstances, such as reduction of capital, call-on shares, conversion of convertible notes during the letting period, resulting in impossibility of replacing the security with an identical security. I think this is a practical problem that the legislation has not addressed, but I understand the reasons why the accommodation has been made. </PARA>

<PARA> ``26a. After subsection 31(1) of the Principal Act, the following subsections are inserted:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(1a) In spite of subsection (1), the value of each article of prescribed trading stock on hand at 31 December 1990 shall be taken into account at its cost price. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment is to be inserted after clause 26. My attention has been drawn to two typographical errors in the circulated document. It should read `After clause 26, page 38' rather than 28; and it should read `add the following clause: 26a' instead of 27a. In moving this amendment, I return to 1988 when the Government, with the assistance of the Australian Democrats, passed the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988 which, amongst other things, imposed a tax on the income from gold mining. The previous exemption had existed since the 1920s--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza-1924. It had been a distortion in the tax system for decades after the initial reason for its inception-the exchange rate policy of the United Kingdom-had ceased to be relevant. The tax exemption was to be ended only for income derived after 1 January 1991. It was mainly to honour the commitment made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) before the 1987 election that the exemption should remain for the whole of the next term of Government. The grubby story of political donations connected with the gold mining exemption, both to the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Labor Party, has now been revealed-and it will be interesting to see where the revelations end. This delay is estimated by Treasury to have cost approximately $300m per annum. In fact, a new gold rush started as miners sought to take advantage of the window of opportunity which the continued exemption provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One matter which was not mentioned in the debate on the legislation in either House was the question of the valuation of transitional stocks. Under ordinary income tax law, taxpayers have the option of valuing their trading stock at the end of each year by any one of three methods: cost, market price or replacement value. To ensure that unfair manipulation does not occur, the value chosen at the end of one year must also be used at the beginning of the subsequent year. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation with respect to stocks of gold is quite unique. The gold companies have the choice to value stock under the three methods I have mentioned, although tax is only payable in the subsequent period; that is, from 1 January 1991 and not in the previous period up to 31 December 1990. Consequently, there is an incentive to value stocks held at 31 December 1990 at as high a value as possible, as this then maximises the amount of the income arising from transitional stocks which benefit from the exemption. Clearly, this has provided an incentive to extract as much as possible before 1 January 1991, and the figures available attest to the fact that this has occurred. As I said, there has been a veritable gold rush to extract and stockpile as much gold ore as possible. The value of gold produced in the March 1991 quarter, the first tax- able quarter, fell 15 per cent from the last exempt quarter and this decline in production was worth $145m. </PARA>
<PARA> My amendment seeks to tax the value of the transitional stocks which would otherwise escape income tax by limiting the valuation of transitional stocks held on 31 December 1990 to the cost formula of the gold producer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not be agreeing to this Australian Democrats amendment moved by Senator Spindler. The process of tacking unrelated measures onto an omnibus tax Bill is not an unfamiliar device in the Senate; it is frequently used by the Australian Democrats. It is not a device that as an Opposition the Liberal and National parties welcome. Changes of this nature are best brought about by private members' Bills with the proper explanatory memorandum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, we have seen today the hurried introduction of an amendment resulting in a great deal of confusion with a number of errors. Clause 26 of course is not a related provision; it is an interpretation provision concerning eligible termination payments and annuities. The Australian Democrats incorrectly put page 28 when it should have been page 38. Clause 27a should have been clause 26a. To expect parliamentarians to accept changes of this nature involving inaccuracies of this sort of magnitude is just not acceptable. It is an issue that should have been raised by way of a private members' Bill or it was an oversight on the part of the Democrats in examining, I think, tax Bill No. 5. Proposed subsection 31 on page 28, for example, refers to payments to veterans. No wonder the honourable senator is confused because this makes very little reference to veterans and the transitional provisions relating to payments to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, this amendment is about denying an option that is acknowledged income tax law for valuation of trading stock. What this amendment seeks to do is to limit the ability of the gold mining industry, an industry whose income tax status has changed, and to deny it the opportunity of applying a valuation other than cost price. It is a measure that brings about an uneven playing field to transitory provisions. It is certainly not a provision that the Opposition welcomes. It is a direct attack on the mining industry, at a time of economic recession. Already, we are finding enough problems with the Australian Taxation Office's ability to change the basis of valuations. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a question directed to Senator Button. The Australian Taxation Office, in the prevailing recessed conditions, is now denying primary producers the right to change the basis of valuation of livestock from cost to market price under a section 33 discretion. Yet here we are introducing a further limitation by virtue of a new clause 26a when we already have a problem under section 33 of the Income Tax Assessment Tax. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purpose of pursuing this line, this extraordinary refusal, which impacts most severely on the sheep and wool producers of this country, is based on the grounds that a general fluctuation in livestock prices where the market movement is occasioned by widely prevailing economic circumstances is not sufficient to warrant a change in the manner in which the taxation of livestock is assessed. I submit that such a decision is uncaring, unreasonable and destructive and will have a deleterious effect at a time when the wool and sheep industry is in such a depressed condition. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this because, in circumstances where we are having trouble with section 33a, the Democrats have the temerity to attack another very vital industry-one which was a prime income earner in terms of the balance of payments. There is a further attack on its viability and cash flow by virtue of the unnatural clause 26a to be introduced into the Income Tax Assessment Act. On behalf of the Opposition, we will not be agreeing to this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> The coalition has continually denied that it had any dirty deals going in the last Federal election. I am on public record about this matter, as are my colleagues in the House of Representatives. As I said, members of the Government can speak for themselves.

Senator Spindler carried on with the usual jealousy amendment to whip up some sympathy around Australia for the Democrats lost cause. It is going down and down in the ballot box. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Watson has pointed out, this amendment would take away the option of the gold industry-which has already had a changed taxation regime-to value its stock, as any other industry can do. I will not go into the gold tax debate, but I will say that I have never changed my stance on gold tax. The gold industry is one of the most vital industries Australia has ever had and will continue to have for the next thousand years, irrespective of whether this Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or Caucus let mining at Coronation Hill go ahead. To seek to deny the industry the right that any normal industry has to use appropriate tax and accounting practices shows the idiocy of the honourable senator in moving such an amendment.

One firm, Plutonic Gold Project, has been reported by the Kalgoorlie Miner newspaper to have stockpiled about 70,000 ounces of gold. Tax on that amount is estimated to be approximately $8m. Similarly, Samantha Exploration NL has an ore stockpile of one quarter of a million tonnes, which the company's managing director has confirmed had been extracted to take advantage of the tax exemption. No doubt other examples exist. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of record that the Opposition, by supporting the deferral of the tax, has cost the taxpayer $300m per annum. I do not object to being called names if I can stand up for the Australian community and for the Australian consumer in the face of such actions by the Opposition. </PARA>

Dealing with the stockpile figures Senator Spindler mentioned-one company has 70,000 ounces of gold and another has one million tonnes of ore stockpiled, I think he said-as a representative of the mining industry and one who was brought up in the goldfields, which is also an agricultural area, I would be happy if there were 10 times this amount of ore in the stockpile because we would be getting 10 times that amount in foreign income in the next few months. I would be very proud if the town of Southern Cross had 10 times the amount it now has. If Senator Spindler and the other Democrats think that this $300m that they believe the gold mining industry is dodging will create further employment, he should go to those goldmining towns and see what employment those companies are providing, in spite of what this Government has done to Australia to cause record unemployment. That is why we need more resources to create more employment. Before the honourable senator talks any further on that point, I suggest that he visit those goldfield towns, which provide so much for the welfare of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pity that this little conflagration may in some marginal way distort public perception of what I believe is a major and proper reform of the tax system-that is, the introduction of provisions to ensure that income from the mining of gold is taxed in the same manner as other income on the fairly fundamental principle that income is income and ought to be taxed accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will say a couple of things about the amendment before indicating why I am opposed to it. Firstly, we need to reject these sorts of tawdry little allegations of deals. They are easy to throw around. They do not enhance the debate about issues on their merits; they merely reinforce the perceptions that, firstly, debate in this place sometimes is not what it ought to be and, secondly, if anybody were to believe them, it would lower that person's assessment of the political process in a manner that is not helpful. I have to reject it absolutely. It is entirely contrary to the evidence, and it seems remarkable to me that anybody would suggest that the government that remedied a longstanding anomaly was a government that did a deal with the gold industry. That seems to me to be absurd. I am not making the reverse allegation about the Opposition; I am simply saying that it is a remarkable allegation. It is not unique; it has been made before, but repetition does not make something which is remarkable acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish briefly to talk about the reason why I oppose this amendment, and why the Government will be opposing it. It is simply that in dealing with a longstanding anomaly reasonable transitional arrangements had to be introduced. As I understand it, those reasonable transitional arrangements were similar to those which applied in the past when moves were made to tax previously exempt activities-for example, the changes with regard to superannuation and with regard to the foreign tax credit system. When we are establishing that income previously exempt is to become taxable we need to make arrangements which are firstly predictable so that people can make arrangements and, secondly, equitable, so that income is taxed as far as possible in the same manner as the income of other taxpayers is taxed. That is what these transitional arrangements provide. I can understand people saying that we should have made different transitional arrangements several years ago. I do not agree with that, but I can understand it. That would be a debate which could reasonably have been had at the time. But having established these arrangements appropriately-that is, on the same basis as in other industries-and even if they were not, although I believe they are, it is now not the time to be disrupting them for a very important industry which is going through a transition which in my view it should have, but which nevertheless it needs time to adjust to. These transitional arrangements are appropriate and I therefore oppose the amendment. </PARA>

Under the old Act one could get an outright deduction for the erection of fences including any alteration, extension or addition to fences on the land to exclude livestock from areas already affected by land degradation in order to prevent any aggravation or degradation in those areas and to assist in their reclamation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's amendments seem to be seeking to prevent further land degradation and provide a limit to the aggravation. Am I to take it that we are to go completely onto the last one, whereas we had a full deduction before without a full farm plan-which I now understand to be a farm management plan? In the past a full deduction for erecting a fence to prevent further degradation or to keep out stock which was degrading it was allowed in the year it was done, and we could do that without a farm management plan. Does that management plan go back to what we used to be able to do before?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back to Senator Panizza's question about costs in a moment. On the substantial question concerning the need for a plan, when we are extending this opportunity for deductibility it is reasonable for the Government to require that, where such a claim is made, some plan be available which indicates to the government, the Tax Office and the other taxpayers, who are in effect offering this deduction, that the fencing is going to be for the purpose for which the deduction was intended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Senator Panizza is saying to me that we are not being sufficiently rigorous about the other section, he might want to make a submission to me afterwards. However, we have a fairly objective criterion that enables one, if one wanted to, to assess the existing provision-one can see the land that is intended to be protected. There is an objective criterion now that someone, if need be, could go out and check. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if Senator Panizza is saying, `We want a plan so that future degradation does not occur', we need some other objective criterion against which it can be measured. It seems to the Government that the farm plan provision is appropriate. I do not have to hand any information about the costing of farm plans but I am not in the slightest doubt that efficient consultants will be providing competitive farm plans in a manner that is cost efficient to the taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Until the last successful interjection by Senator Watson to assist Senator Panizza in respect of the definition of what we are talking about, I was somewhat confused. Senator Panizza was asking the Parliamentary Secretary why there was a need to prepare a whole farm plan if one wanted to engage in some minor works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was under the impression that the amendments moved on behalf of the Government delete reference to `whole farm plan' and substitute `land management plan'. I know that Senator Watson well understands that. But the questions that Senator Panizza was asking the Minister were not well directed because, having deleted reference to `whole farm plan', it is my understanding that there is no requirement to prepare a whole farm plan. </PARA>
<PARA> In one respect I am disappointed because here was an opportunity, with a sensitive and proper definition of `whole farm plan', to encourage the development of a whole farm plan. That concept requires definition. Farmers could have been provided with an opportunity to make that preparation for the benefit of their whole farm. However, now that this concept has been deleted, we are left with something else which also requires very careful definition. What land management plan, and what parts of a land management plan, will be acceptable for the purposes of tax deductibility?. </PARA>
<PARA> I saw an opportunity in the previous legislation to move-and I understand and agree with Senator Watson's concerns-to a situation where substantiation and self-assessment would apply in this area as it does in the rest of the taxation law. I also saw an opportunity for a whole farm plan or part of a whole farm plan to be instituted. But that opportunity has now faded. The concept of a whole farm plan, as it could be defined by groups such as Greening Australia, is now lost to us. We have substituted the land management plan, which may not be such a good opportunity. It is regrettable to see that happening but there is little we can do about it here. </PARA>

<PARA> Given the nature of these amendments, it does not seem to me that there will be transitional problems for individuals who have made arrangements on the basis of the understanding declared in August as a result of any of the detail finally in the legislation. To the extent that we are amending the legislation, everything that fitted the category `whole farm plan' must, by definition, meet the category of `land management plan' because `whole farm plan' is the greater and `land management plan' the lesser.

<PARA> (a) is of the opinion that interest derived by a non-resident (herein described as relevant interest) is part of a designated arrangement; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) has served upon the relevant agent notice in writing of that opinion,</PARA>
<PARA>then the relevant interest shall be deemed to be interest payable on a Bearer Debenture and the relevant agent shall deduct withholding tax at the rate specified in paragraph 6 (b) of the Income Tax (Bearer Debentures) Act 1971. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) In this section:</PARA>
<PARA> `Designated arrangement' means circumstances which lead the Commissioner to reasonably believe that interest derived by a non-resident from an Australian source is the subject of a scheme to avoid or otherwise minimise tax;</PARA>
<PARA> `relevant agent' means the person specified in a notice issued pursuant to paragraph (1) (b), where either section 255 or 257 apply to that person.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment relates to yet another of the perpetual problems of tax avoidance that the Committee and the Australian community have to cope with. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, chaired by Mr Stephen Martin, has released its final report on international profit shifting entitled Follow the Yellow Brick Road. The report is comprehensive and attacks many roads most prominent in the system of converting Australian source income into an interest stream paid to non-residents, and Australian income tax is thereby limited to the withholding tax rate of 10 per cent. Even the gold miners would welcome that, I am sure. </PARA>
<PARA> I have pursued this matter in the Senate before, and it has been vigorously pursued by others in the community, such as Melbourne tax academic Barbara Smith. I believe that the most important recommendation of the report is recommendation No. 2, which proposes that the Commissioner of Taxation be provided with a discretionary power to impose the top marginal rate of tax on interest income earned by non-residents instead of the 10 per cent interest withholding tax rate in cases where the Commissioner is of the opinion, and has reason to believe, that the interest income derived by a non-resident from an Australian source relates to an artificial arrangement established by an Australian interest for tax avoidance purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased rate shall apply until the non-resident who derives the interest income is able to verify that the interest payment is not related to a tax avoidance arrangement-that is, the Martin Committee is recommending a system of tax payment at the time of derivation of the interest to ensure that avoidance arrangements are stopped as they occur. This is the current system which applies to bearer bonds held by people who are not known to the Tax Office. Tax is deducted from the interest payments on these bonds at the maximum marginal rate. However, to be fair to the taxpayer, this deduction does not constitute a final liability. The tax may be credited against the income of the recipient of the interest, and any overpayment is refundable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that this is a good model to use to implement recommendation No. 2 of the Martin Committee report. This foreign loans rort is widespread and would be largely nullified by this amendment if it is passed today. The structure of the amendment is simple. Where the Commissioner of Taxation is of the opinion that there is a tax avoidance arrangement operating, he or she may instruct the person paying the interest that he or she must deduct withholding tax at the rate which is applicable as though the interest paid were paid in respect of a bearer bond to a person unknown to the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure is urgent in order to plug an acknowledged loophole, which even the Tax Office admits is costing hundreds of millions of dollars per year. I repeat again that it does not impose a final taxation liability, but effects an efficient method of tax collection to enable avoidance schemes to be foiled as they occur-not after the horse has bolted. I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) whether he could clarify the following concerns in article 2 (1) (b) of the schedule which refers to profit taxes in Hungary. The meaning of the term is far from clear, given other definitions in the schedule. For example, article 2 (1) (a) stipulates the inclusion of both income tax and petroleum resource rent tax for these purposes. This is a new concept. Article 13 refers to gains from the alienation of property, which presumably is just another way of describing capital gains tax. The terms `income tax' and `capital gains tax' strike me as being mutually exclusive, if only because all over the world such taxes are separate and separable. It seems that where article 23 refers to income, profits or gains, capital gains tax could be included twice. Because it appears in the agreement with Hungary and includes more than just income tax, some further explanations are required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, what about the taxes that are levied in Hungary and not in Australia, and vice versa? Hungary imposes a tax on assets of the individual where the value of assets exceeds a stipulated threshold, irrespective of whether those assets earn income. Is such a tax embraced in this Bill?</PARA>
<PARA> What about death duties? Hungary levies death duties. Are only taxes required by central governments of each country affected by the measures we have under discussion? For example, municipal taxes in Hungary raise revenue to finance some services which in Australia are financed from Canberra. Are these to be included? I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to put on the record that there is no reciprocity for state and municipal taxes. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I can do it now. I will try to respond to them concisely and as best as I can. If there is some part I have not covered, we may deal with that subsequently. Firstly, there was the question about profit taxes. Hungary has a uniform profits tax which is levied on everyone carrying on business activities in Hungary. It is similar to the tax paid by business enterprises and companies in Australia. The Hungarian branch of a foreign entrepreneur is also subject to this tax. The agreement applies to all substantially identical taxes in each country. The name of the taxes vary from one country to another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Watson also referred to alienation of profit, property and capital gains tax. The term `alienation of property' in article 13 refers to capital gains resulting from the sale or exchange of property. Most countries which tax capital gains do so when an alienation takes place. This article allocates the taxing rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson then talked about article 23. Article 23 simply allocates the source for the purpose of the other articles mentioned in it. This is necessary for the purpose of Australian law because Australian tax law does not contain statutory source rules. Australia gives effect to the agreement through its domestic legislation. For a non-resident to be taxable in Australia, the non-resident must have income profits or gains from an Australian source. This article deems that income to have an Australian source. It precludes any conflict arising for domestic purposes and preserves our right to tax that income. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson also referred to taxes which exist in Hungary and not in Australia, or vice versa-specifically, death duties and the assets tax. These and other taxes are not income taxes; therefore, they are not the subject of this agreement. It is specifically stated in article 2 of this Bill and all Australia's double tax agreements that the agreement applies only to taxes imposed under the Federal laws of Australia. This is to ensure that an agreement does not bind the States. The agreement applies only to Federal taxes and the corresponding taxes in the treaty partner country which are mentioned in the agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for that very comprehensive answer. Therefore, the reciprocity is that only federal taxes in Hungary apply rather than the equivalent state taxes, even though some of those taxes fund federally the sorts of things that they fund here in Australia. In relation to article 23, can we have an assurance that under that formula mechanism there will be no situation where it is included twice as a result of capital gains?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak tonight in the first reading debate of Supply Bill (No. 1) 1991-92. This gives me the opportunity to speak on any issue that concerns me, as the Senate would be aware.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Senate knows, for at least the past seven years-and many years before that-I have had a major concern regarding the amount of violence and pornography allowed in videos. I have always believed that the two cannot be divorced from each other. As a result, in November 1988 I presented a private member's Bill to the Senate which was aimed at reducing the amount of violence and pornography allowed in videos. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to read parts of a judgment of a case-the Crown v. Darryl John Phillips-which was brought down by Judge Mathews on 21 May this year. I would like to read parts of that judgment into the Hansard record and bring to the Senate's attention my concerns in this area. Judge Mathews said:</PARA>
<PARA>On 24 April 1991 Darryl John Phillips was convicted by a jury of murdering Irene Julie Glanville at The Rock near Wagga on 27 February 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>It was an appallingly violent, tragic and above all senseless killing. Indeed the background circumstances when they unfolded at the trial were as sad as any I have ever encountered. </PARA>
<PARA>The prisoner had never met Mrs Glanville before. She had lived for a number of years with her husband and young children at a property called ``Timbarra'' just out of The Rock. Mr Glanville was a school teacher and was thus away from home during the day. By 1990 their two oldest children were of school age and also went into town each week day with their father. Thus it was that Mrs Glanville was at home alone with her two youngest children on 27 February. Those children were aged three and a half and twenty months respectively. </PARA>
<PARA>About eighteen months before 27 February the prisoner's father, Trevor Phillips, had bought another property at The Rock called ``Pleasant View'' which adjoined the Glanville property. He moved down there with his son, Darryl, who was then sixteen years old, and his daughter, Michelle who was two years younger. Mr Phillips was employed as a boilermaker and Michelle was still at school. The prisoner had left school but had been able to gain only sporadic employment in the Wagga area; accordingly he also was alone at the property most week days. </PARA>
<PARA>The prisoner, as I say, had never met Mrs Glanville before. He had met her husband on two or three occasions over the previous months when he had called at the Glanville home apparently for the purpose of discussing some straying sheep. There was some suggestion in the Crown case that the straying sheep were only a pretext, and that these visits were in fact designed to try and find Mrs Glanville at home alone. However, in my view there is insufficient material to support this proposition. </PARA>
<PARA>27 February 1990, a Tuesday, commenced like any other week day on both properties. Mr Phillips and Michelle left in the morning, as did Mr Glanville and the two older Glanville children. At about 9.30 that morning the prisoner watched a video he had hired from a Wagga Wagga video shop. It was called ``Nightmare at Shadow Woods''. I shall say something more about this video shortly: it was shown in court during the course of the trial. Suffice it to say for the moment that it was an unpleasant, violent film in which the major character was a psychopath who roamed the area with a large knife killing a number of people in extremely ghoulish circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Having watched this film the prisoner took a knife, known as a butterfly knife, and walked across the paddocks to the Glanville home. He went to the front door and spoke to Mrs Glanville about some stray sheep which he said he had penned. She wrote a note to her husband telling him to ring the Phillips home after 7pm. This note was later found by Mr Glanville and given to the police. </PARA>
<PARA> The prisoner and Mrs Glanville had a short further conversation and then parted on friendly terms. The prisoner apparently left but did not return home. Instead he waited outside the Glanville home and about five minutes later removed the flyscreen from a bedroom window and climbed in. He encountered Mrs Glanville in a hallway. She ran towards the kitchen in an unsuccessful attempt to reach the telephone. It was later found dangling off its hook. She was clearly no match for the frenzied strength of the prisoner. He stabbed her again and again. Even when she was on the ground he continued stabbing her. She was later found to have sustained eighteen stab wounds. A number of them according to the medical evidence must have been inflicted with very considerable force. One of the wounds had passed through the right ventricle of Mrs Glanville's heart. That alone would have been sufficient to kill her. Nevertheless, according to the medical evidence there was probably a lapse of some fifteen to thirty minutes before she died. </PARA>
<PARA> Her two young children were sitting at the kitchen table watching it all and screaming. They were still sitting [in] the same place in the presence of their dead mother when Mr Glanville arrived home with the two older children about four hours later. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime the prisoner had walked back across the paddock to the Phillips home. There he had showered and put all his clothes, including his shoes, into the washing machine. He cut the knife into small pieces using a chisel and hammer, and then concealed the pieces in mice holes in a shed on the property. In other words he took a number of very precise steps in order to obliterate any sign of involvement in Mrs Glanville's killing. </PARA>
<PARA>The judge's report goes on at some length to deal with the evidence taken. She refers to the disturbed state of mind of the prisoner and the evidence given by both the Crown and the defence and says:</PARA>
<PARA> In the result I am compelled to find that the prisoner was significantly more disturbed than Dr Milton's assessment would indicate.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Milton was a witness for the Crown. The judge goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly he was not so disturbed as to reduce his culpability from murder to manslaughter under s 23A. I must also conclude, in accordance with the jury's verdict, that there was probably no organic basis for his disturbance. Nevertheless, the evidence given at the trial clearly indicates to me that the prisoner was a very disturbed young man, both before and after he committed this offence. </PARA>
<PARA>The judge then goes on to talk about the video that the young man had watched just before committing the crime. She says:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not so easy to absolve a system which allows for such a violent and unmeritorious film as ``Nightmare at Shadow Woods'' to be viewed indiscriminately by members of the community regardless of their underlying problems or susceptibilities. It was a film with no discernible artistic material at all. As far as I could see it was nothing more than a vehicle for depicting gratuitous, mindless and ghoulish violence.</PARA>
<PARA>That video is rated `M'. She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Milton considered that the film acted as a trigger for the prisoner, transforming fantasies about violence into an intention to inflict actual violence. Dr Westmore-</PARA>
<PARA>for the defence-</PARA>
<PARA>also thought that the film acted as a trigger in that it was a disturbing agent in the prisoner's already disturbed brain. So that whichever version one were to accept, the viewing of this film had a real part to play in the tragedy which followed. Certainly the prisoner was already a vulnerable and disturbed person, but it is precisely such a person which is likely to be adversely affected by watching a film such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not in a position to suggest any measures which might have been taken to prevent this tragedy, or which might be taken to prevent a similar one in the future. Clearly, a free and open society requires that there be freedom of communication. On the other hand, I cannot help wondering what benefits society can derive from having such a mindlessly violent film as this generally available to be viewed by anyone, no matter how disturbed he or she may be. The potentially devastating effects can be seen in the events of 27 February. </PARA>
<PARA>I read that into the Hansard because we are told so often-and I was told during the debate on my private member's Bill-that the judgments that have been brought down and the police evidence we have been given are just circumstantial. They are excuses for crimes that have been committed. That is not how Judge Mathews has seen it. The Crown, the defence, the judge herself and the jury felt that that video, which is M-rated and available to all those aged 15 years and over, played a part in that very tragic crime-a crime that has destroyed the lives of a whole family. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken in this place so often regarding this sort of thing that people have become sick of hearing me. People have said that I am too tied up with this issue and too involved. I plead with honourable senators to read the judge's verdict for themselves. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) is in the chamber because I appeal to him, too, to let us do something-to play just a small part in something that so many of us believe may stop such a mindless and senseless crime being committed again. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, together with its companion bills, Supply Bill (No 2) 1991-92 and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1991-92, is a routine machinery measure. It seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing services of the Government during the period 1 July 1991 to 30 November 1991, by which date it is expected that the appropriation Bills, which will form part of the Budget for 1991-92, will have been enacted. </PARA>
<PARA>Supply Bill (No 1) seeks appropriations totalling some $12,062 million for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $1,364 million, or about 12.75 per cent, greater than the equivalent amounts provided in the Supply Act (No 1) 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>This increase reflects a combination of factors including:</PARA>
<PARA> * price and cost increases and the impact of exchange rate variations;</PARA>
<PARA> * the inclusion of those ordinary annual services of government items which appeared in Supply Bill (No. 2) in 1990-91 because they had not previously been included in the annual Appropriation Bills; and</PARA>
<PARA> * the full year effect of new and enhanced programs which have commenced since the introduction of the previous Supply Bill (No. 1). </PARA>
<PARA>Examples of these increases include :</PARA>
<PARA>Attorney-Generals</PARA>
<PARA>* $26 million for the first full year of operations of the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Community Services and Health</PARA>
<PARA>* $33 million for Residential Care for Older People principally from an increase in construction activity reflecting increased approvals on previous years of capital grants for construction of Aged Person Nursing Homes and Hostels. </PARA>
<PARA>* $120 million for Services for Families with Children as a result of 1990-91 Budget Policy changes, enhancements to child care relief and changes to the payment cycle. </PARA>
<PARA>Veterans' Affairs</PARA>
<PARA>* $38 million for Other Services reflecting a large increase in the demand for medical and hospital services for veterans. </PARA>
<PARA>Defence</PARA>
<PARA>* $288 million for Equipment and Stores flowing from increased payments for approved projects coming on stream and greater activity levels for existing equipment projects. </PARA>
<PARA>Employment, Education and Training</PARA>
<PARA>* $107 million for Special Employment, Education and Income Support reflecting Growth in Student Assistance programs (including Student Numbers, indexation of benefits and an additional payment in the Supply period in 1991-92 compared to 1990-91) as well as new measures (namely implementation of the Active Employment Strategy in JOBTRAIN and the March 12 initiatives in the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>* $28 million to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission largely reflecting the significant growth in Aboriginal programs between 1989-90 and 1990-91 on which the Supply estimates for the two years were based. </PARA>
<PARA>Industry Technology and Commerce</PARA>
<PARA>* $142 million for Other Services with the $143 million increased provision for National Interest payments by the Australian Trade Commission to the Australian Wheat Board in respect of Iraqi wheat debt default partially offset by net reductions in other items. </PARA>
<PARA>Social Security</PARA>
<PARA>* $69 million for Running Costs which includes provision for payments to the Australian Valuations Office and the Australian Government Health Service for which there was no Supply provision in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Treasury</PARA>
<PARA>* $56 million for Australian Bureau of Statistics Running Costs largely as a supplementation to take account of the peak in outlays in August 1991 associated with the 1991 census of Population and Housing</PARA>
<PARA>* $47 million for Australian Taxation Office Running Costs largely reflecting anticipated expenditure on the modernisation project, increased funding for the Child Support Agency and some `one-off' payments anticipated in the first half of the year. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to emphasise that this Bill seeks interim provision only for approved ongoing policies of the Government. It does not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 1991-92 Budget context, for which provision will be sought in the Appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Supply Bill (No. 1) 1991-92, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1991-92 and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1991-92 are essentially routine machinery Bills. They seek interim appropriations to enable the Government, in terms of its ongoing services as well as its expenditure on capital works and services and the continued operation of the parliamentary departments, to be funded during the period from 1 July 1991 to 30 November 1991, by which date it is expected that the Appropriation Bills that form part of the Budget for 1991-92 will have been enacted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Supply Bill (No. 1) seeks appropriations totalling some $12.1 billion for the ordinary annual services of the Government. Supply Bill (No. 2) seeks interim appropriations totalling $3.4 billion for expenditure on capital works and services, payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory and certain other services for the period 1 July 1991 to 30 November 1991, and the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing requirements of the parliamentary departments during the same five-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> As pointed out in the second reading speech, these Bills seek interim provision only for approved ongoing policies of the Government. They do not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 1991-92 Budget context, for which provision will be sought in the Appropriation Bills. In other words, these are Bills to guarantee or to provide funding, or supply in the technical jargon, for the continued operation of the Government for the first five months of the next financial year until the Budget Bills, which contain the appropriations for the whole of the financial year, are passed. They then subsume these Supply Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that these Supply Bills are being debated, and the forthcoming Budget will be debated, in a period during which Australia is facing the most severe and protracted recession in the last 60 years. There is no doubt that this recession has been deliberately engineered, to use the words of the former discredited Treasurer, by the Government. There is no doubt at all that the Government has failed the people of Australia in its management of this nation, and particularly the economy. By any test it has made a mess of the economy and of countless thousands of people's lives. What we cannot be sure of is whether the Government knew what it was doing and simply lied about it or whether it was so incompetent that it lost control of economic management and just stood back and let the disaster happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year when for month after month I and my colleagues on this side of the chamber pointed out the errors of policy being committed by the Government, the Government, with the ignorance and arrogance personified in the former Treasurer, Mr Keating, denied that anything was wrong or even could go wrong. Remember the self-justification, the superior knowledge and the scoffing at any question of the direction of economic policy. Remember the then Treasurer's assurance at the time of the 1989 Budget when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of the Government's economic policies Australia will emerge from the recent level of spending without a recession and with its economy and social structure improving. </PARA>
<PARA>How wrong he was then; how deluded the Government was. On the other hand, was it all a big cover-up? Did the Government know precisely what was going to happen? We now know that, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) lied to the people of Australia about the succession to the Prime Ministership, so the Government lied to the people of Australia about the recession. On 22 March last year, two days before the 1990 election, the Prime Minister said, `There is no need to fear a recession in any sense'. On precisely the same day, the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, told the people of Australia that there would not be a recession because the Government would not let the recession happen. </PARA>
<PARA> If anyone should be in any doubt about the integrity of the Labor so-called leader- ship team, the erstwhile Treasurer followed that lie with the shameful admission on 30 November last, `I knew there had to be one'-that is, a recession- `but I didn't want to tell you'. He is the sort of person and that is the sort of approach that, regrettably, gives politicians in this nation a very bad name. </PARA>
<PARA> Having denied the clearly looming recession for so long, when reality eventually overtook the Government and it knew it could not deceive the people of Australia any longer-at least on that point-the discredited former Treasurer continued the lie with the line that this was the recession that we had to have. He was wrong then, and the Government was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> We did not have to face this recession; it was avoidable. The fact is that the Government engineered the recession because it was incapable of moving on a number of policy fronts. To do so would have involved offending the trade union bosses and other vested interest groups to which this leaderless Government is beholden. In fear of doing anything of which its bagmen may disapprove, the Government is neutered now in what it can say and do. It is not allowed to admit that the overriding and fundamental economic problem faced by Australia is low growth due to poor productivity and that that in turn is an inevitable outcome of massive and excessive constraints on the freedom of individuals and companies to invest and contract according to their commercial judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than engineer a recession to choke off demand-and that is what the Government did-it would have been far better simply to adopt the policies of the Opposition and actually do something effective about the underlying causes of the economic malaise. Those underlying causes have prevented the productivity of this country from growing in the way that our skills and resources should allow us to do. </PARA>
<PARA> That option is still available but only if the Government can jettison its ideological baggage and escape from the influence of union bosses and selected mates. The required changes in policy include scrapping the accord and allowing employers and employees to reach genuine agreements in each enterprise without outside interference-something which is impossible under the present regime. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be allowing open competition, thereby achieving real and lasting reform in telecommunications, the waterfront, shipping and other transport areas. We should be reforming the tax system so as to reduce business costs and encourage savings and investment through the effects of a broad-based goods and services tax and through lower income tax rates, particularly on middle income earners who have been taxed out of existence by this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> We should be implementing real reform and enduring efficiencies in Federal-State relations. We should be demonstrating our commitment to investment, growth and employment. In this context, nothing could provide a clearer signal of intent than approval of exploration and mining at Coronation Hill. There is a total in- ability on the part of the Government to take a decision. The Government has been locked in all day on this matter-I understand that it is still locked in. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes have to be made if Australia is ever going to recover and achieve the rates of economic growth which are necessary to avoid the cruel wastage due to unemployment and to generate the income required to climb out of the mountain of debt into which this irresponsible Government, through its policies, has plunged us. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is instructive for all, including members of the Government, who thus far have proved themselves incapable of learning, to look at the results of the discredited attempt to rein back demand and suppress growth by imposing excessively high interest rates and throwing people out of work. The data speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Company profits collapsed by a massive 29 per cent in the March quarter of this year. The profit share of gross domestic product now stands at the lowest rate for any quarter since September 1986. The situation there is even worse than the statistics suggest, because companies with fewer than 30 employees are not reported upon in the company profit survey. </PARA>
<PARA> As most of us know, many small businesses are in a disastrous loss situation. There are 53 per cent more bankruptcies than a year ago. The household savings ratio, a major source of investment funds, has collapsed to a record low of 4 per cent. As a result of the drop in profits, dried up savings and lack of investor confidence in the Hawke Government, new capital expenditure has crashed to a level 12 per cent lower than a year ago, and the expectation is for worse to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics survey of the outlook for new capital expenditure in 1991-92 shows that a further fall of 16 per cent is anticipated. Building approvals in April were 26 per cent lower than the year before. Motor vehicle registrations collapsed by 24 per cent in the year to April. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the mess that the Government has made of the economy, gross domestic product is flat or negative depending on the measure used. Taking account of movements in the terms of trade, the March quarter gross domestic product was down 0.5 per cent, and that was the fifth quarter of nil or negative growth in the last six quarters. As I said at the outset, that is the most protracted period of recession that this country has had in 60 years. Gross national spending in the March quarter was 5 per cent less in real terms than a year ago. That is a clear indication of the extent to which confidence has been eroded. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the cruel hard figures of employment and unemployment. Unemployment has increased by 258,600 people or 47 per cent in the year to May. On the trend estimate, which puts the data in their longer term perspective, a total of 818,800 people are now out of work and the trend unemployment rate stands at a record 9.6 per cent. There could be no clearer indictment of the Government's failed policies than that. The scandal of youth unemployment is even worse. The Government is mesmerised with more important issues in its view, such as the ongoing leadership crisis. The trend series shows youth unemployment at a catastrophic 27 per cent. In many areas of Australia the youth unemployment rate is up around the 40 per cent mark, but for Australia as a whole the average is 27 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The record is the same when one looks at the number of people on unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefit recipients increased by 31,000 in May to a total of 647,414. The number of people on unemployment benefit in Australia at present is 242,000 higher than a year ago-an increase of 60 per cent. What a monument to this so-called Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the human tragedy of this engineered recession, which is the real tragedy, the human tragedy, the Government has created massive problems for itself in framing the coming Budget. The massive fall in company profits in 1990-91 will be reflected in a corresponding fall in company tax payments in the forthcoming year, 1991-92. That significant fall in revenue will be exacerbated by lower personal income tax receipts as an outcome of reduced employment; lower sales tax and other indirect tax receipts because of depressed domestic demand; increased expenditure arising from the blow-out in unemployment; and growing but nonetheless absurd demands from Labor's left for new ways to spend money. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Government faces an extremely difficult task in formulating a responsible Budget. The economic climate substantially limits the Government's options and it now has to take account of the greatly increased influence of its left wing and, in particular, the existence of a left wing Deputy Prime Minister who delights in spending up big with other people's money. In this year alone the Budget surplus has slipped from the original forecast of $8.1 billion to an estimated $2 billion, and that could well still prove to be conservative. </PARA>
<PARA> The demand for public sector borrowings on capital markets in this year, 1991, now looks set to be $7.2 billion, which is $5 billion or thereabouts more than the figure in 1989-90. For 1991-92, the forthcoming year, estimates by the very respected economics consultancy, Access Economics Pty Ltd, have put the public sector borrowing requirement as likely to be some $14.6 billion. That is 3 1/2 per cent or thereabouts of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> So the outlook is therefore one of a return to the large public sector borrowings of the mid-1980s and the high interest rates which come as a result of the competition for funds. If there is any recovery in the private sector of the economy in the course of the forthcoming financial year, 1991-92, the increased demand for funds by the private sector will run slap bang into this massive borrowing requirement that the public sector is almost certain to impose on the market. There is only one way that that leads in terms of interest rate direction, and that is further upwards, adding to a real interest rate in Australia which is still extremely high by world standards. So the outlook on the fiscal front for the Government over the next 12 months is extremely difficult. The implications of that for the private sector are increasingly serious. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, this situation has been deliberately created by grossly incompetent mismanagement on the part of the Government over several years. If one looks at the fundamentals of the Australian economy and compares today with the situation that the Government inherited in 1983-and it was a very difficult situation then because of the world recession that had occurred at that time; bearing in mind that the slump in the Australian economy in the last couple of years has been at a time of continuing world increase in economic activity-on virtually every fundamental, the Australian economy is in disastrously worse shape now than it was then. </PARA>
<PARA> Many things can, should and need to be done to correct that situation. The worst thing that can happen in this country is that we come to believe that the problems we have today are so entrenched that we cannot do anything about them. That is the whole spirit of defeatism. As soon as we have a spirit of defeatism, that becomes self-feeding. We are a very resourceful and a very rich, skilled and talented nation. We have fantastic opportunities for the future, but the question of whether those opportunities will be grasped is entirely in our own hands. The longer it takes us to start on the path of putting into place the basic policies needed to correct the existing situation and put Australia on to a dynamic, sustainable growth path, the more difficult it will be to ever get back onto that path. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many things we can and should be doing. The first thing we should be doing is genuinely committing ourselves to price stability. The Government talks about near enough being good enough-that if we get 3, 4 or 5 per cent inflation, that is okay. The whole impression the Government gives us is that if we can get down to 4 per cent that is pretty good. Four per cent is still very high by international standards over time. We should be prepared to commit ourselves as a nation to genuine price stability. That means an inflation rate of something of the order of zero to 2 per cent. The Treasurer has ridiculed the Opposition for claiming that that is a reasonable goal to aim for. If the Government will not aim at a goal like that, it will never get the price stability that this nation needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area of a structural type we need to address is Commonwealth-State financial relations. We have to rebuild the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. It is a very difficult area. It also involves delegating functions or dividing up the functions between all three levels of government-Commonwealth, State and local-and ensuring that at each level there are the appropriate taxing powers to fund the expenditures those governments are expected to meet. This is a very difficult task. We have now had this imbalance for 50 years plus between the spending and revenue raising responsibilities and capacities of the Commonwealth on the one hand and the State and local governments on the other. It is a task which ought to be occupying our time and which will occupy our time inevitably during the 1990s. It is probably the most important source of micro-economic reform that we could possibly embark upon, and I think that the 1990s is, and certainly should be, the decade of meaningful and lasting reform of Commonwealth-State relations. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be looking much more at decisive action in the area of labour market reform. There is no alternative but to move to workplace agreements, to look at the possibility of enterprise-based agreements at each workplace. To do that, we have to change the law. The Government is totally unprepared to change the law in that area. The Opposition is committed to doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to look at a major reform of the taxation system-again, an area which will not be easy to tackle but an area where reform must be tackled head on. An essential part of the tax reform package which has to be put into place is the introduction of a broad-based goods and services tax. We must also have lower personal tax rates, significant cuts in personal tax, and increased incentives to save as well as to work. It can be done, and under a coalition government it will be done. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to look at the whole of the so-called infrastructure area-that is, looking at all the cost disadvantages to business, whether it is the waterfront, shipping, land transport, air transport, telecommunications, power generation or the like. That is what infrastructure means. Reform in that area means making those industries more efficient, more competitive and less costly. Those industries are the backbone of, and the wheels which turn, all other productive activities. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to cut back on the continuing growth in government expenditure. We need to look realistically and full-bloodedly at the area of privatisation of government enterprises-not just the 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank, a bit here and a bit there, which seems to be this Government's program of privatisation. That is mickey mouse privatisation in every sense of the word. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the sorts of things we have to tackle in this country. They are very important issues-vitally important in the context of looking at Bills such as the Supply Bills that are with us today. Even though they are essentially only machinery Bills, they are all about the process of government and economic planning and economic policy. As we move from now through to the next Budget and to the consideration of economic policy in the build-up to the Budget and its aftermath, as I said earlier, we need to be concentrating all our efforts and all our activities on getting the fundamentals right in this country. Economic policy is a fundamental part and Budget policy is an essential element of doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not opposing these Bills-they are traditional machinery Bills-but in considering them the Government does deserve, quite rightly, to stand indicted for the dreadful economic mess and the enormous human hardship that its failed policies have caused. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This second reading debate on Supply Bill (No. 1) 1991-92, Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1991-92 and Supply Bill (No. 2) 1991-92 in the Senate provides me with an opportunity to consider at some length alternative regimes of taxing and spending in Australia. If we were to look at the way in which taxation totally permeates the economy, we would find that virtually every economic decision, including options to produce, consume, save and invest, is influenced by income tax and expenditure taxes. Taxation impacts upon incentives of all households and firms-large and small alike-and is a dominant influence on national production and income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is sobering indeed to consider that total taxation receipts are equivalent to almost one-third of national income. The threshold question, therefore, is a simple one: what, if anything, is wrong with the current level and mix of taxation? The answer is that the highly distorting set of incentives that flow from the current taxation arrangements is a significant source of foregone national productivity and income, so much so that genuine taxation reform has the capacity to increase national income to ordinary Australians by the equivalent of several percentage points of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> Income tax accounts for 70 per cent of Commonwealth taxation receipts. Underlying the current income tax arrangements are a number of distorting effects on incentives due to differences in the specific form of taxation, the measurement of taxable income and the tax rates themselves. We are said to have a mongrel income tax system, given that it is neither homogenous nor consistent. Taxes on goods and services amount to less than 30 per cent of Commonwealth taxation. The broad range of taxes includes the ramshackle wholesale sales tax, excise taxes and import duties. It is my intention to focus on the shortcomings of the wholesale sales tax, in particular, and to indicate some of the alternatives that are offered by the coalition to produce a better taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is stout in its resolve to introduce a broad-based goods and services tax. I say this as one who has not come as a latter day convert to the concept. It is a concept that I have believed in and one that has needed to be implemented for over a decade. But let us be intellectually honest about the taxation debate in this country. It is not simply about whether we should have a consumption tax, because we already have a consumption tax and it is the Government's own secret tax-the GST or goods and services tax, otherwise known as the wholesale sales tax. Let us have no more scaremongering from the Government about the introduction of a consumption tax because we already have one. It is unfair, unbalanced and mindless in its application, and it distorts income investment and the way that people decide to spend their after-tax dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact remains that we have an expenditure tax in the form of the wholesale sales tax and it remains for the Government to try to argue for its retention, as distinct from our abolishing it and implementing a system of tax reform which will bring about a better and fairer form of taxation. Rarely have I heard a government senator in this place rise to defend the wholesale sales tax. That is because the Government knows just as well as we do that a significant loss of national income is brought about by the uneven pattern of effective rates of taxation levied by that wholesale sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA> By artificially distorting production and consumption there is a misallocation of resources to less than optimal production use. It has been estimated by the Business Council of Australia that replacing the wholesale sales tax with a broad-based consumption tax would generate productivity gains exceeding the equivalent of half a percentage point of gross domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the weaknesses of the tax that I am attacking. The wholesale sales tax base is a very narrow one, and in many cases it is ill-defined. There is a most arbitrary pattern of exemptions and an ambiguity in the definition of the point and value of sale in assessing the tax liability. But, most importantly, the relative incidence of the wholesale sales tax falls quite unfairly on business. Only 37 per cent of the total incidence of the tax falls upon the final consumer, while the remainder falls upon the purchase of business inputs or investment goods. As a consequence of this, the tax acts as a tax on exports and on the production of import substitutes. </PARA>
<PARA> The most obvious drawback of the tax is brought about by the multiple tax rates. In addition to the different tax rates, there are many more categories of different effective rates of tax due not only to the exemption of services but also to the input taxing component and the associated transfer of the tax forward to buyers. These different effective rates greatly distort household purchasing decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Consider, for instance, the final consumption expenditure of an ordinary household: housing, furniture and appliances are taxed at an effective rate more than double that of the tax on recreational items. The result is relative overconsumption of recreation items as compared with goods such as housing and those other items I mentioned. But, even more importantly, it acts as an incentive to spend and not to save. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard the examples of the in- equities, if not absurdities, that have been brought about by the different rates of wholesale sales tax. I think it is well to re-examine some of those absurdities. For instance, caviar and oysters are tax-free, but chocolate biscuits and ice cream have a tax of 10 per cent. On mineral water no tax is paid, but if one's taste is for Coca-Cola 10 per cent is paid. Aeroplane flights are exempt, but a poor family, in comparative terms, wanting to have a holiday in a caravan pays 20 per cent tax. No tax is paid on a taxi ride, but a person who wants to ride a bicycle to save some money will pay a 20 per cent tax. A piece of art is tax-free, while photographic equipment carries a 30 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> So no matter how the Government attempts to tamper with the wholesale sales tax, as it did in the 12 March statement, the tax is fundamentally flawed. Inevitably, such a tax will either involve some inflation of business inputs or will be imposed on a very narrow base. So long as there remains some taxation of business inputs, there will remain distortions to production decisions. The alternative is to throw out the current wholesale sales tax and introduce a broad-based consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The replacement of the wholesale sales tax with a goods and services tax will be advantageous in a number of ways, but honourable senators should remember that our proposition is to introduce the tax as part of overall tax reform-other elements will be considered as well. It is certainly not the imposition of a new tax: it is part of an overall reform which will result in the lessening of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a reduction in the distorting effects of taxing business inputs, leading to greater neutrality in the choices of production methods and product mixes ultimately leading to greater productivity. There will be a more neutral and less distorting pattern of effective tax rates on the goods and services consumed by households. Again this would lead to more neutral consumption decisions, thus increasing household welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of perhaps a once-off price shock, which has been the experience in other countries, there will be little effect on the underlying inflation rate. Looking at the New Zealand experience, the initial inflationary impact disappeared in four quarters. Importantly, there would be a reduction in the complexity of indirect tax, which would engender greater certainty into the decision making process of households and firms. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of a goods and services tax on aggregated savings, as I mentioned before, is an important consideration. Consider the coalition package, which entails lower income tax rates, reduced government expenditure, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, which is the Government's own GST-the Government's secret tax-and the introduction of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a change in the tax mix will increase the incentive to allocate income to saving and future consumption rather than current consumption. There is an unambiguous substitution effect away from consumption and towards saving. In addition, there is an added incentive to save which is brought about by increasing the after-tax return on savings due to lower income tax rates. This in turn will reduce the cost of future consumption relative to that of current consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind those who choose to scaremonger about the introduction of a goods and services tax of the coalition's commitment to introduce an explicit compensation package. We have never sought to deny that a tax mix change, as I have outlined, will cause some households to experience a loss of real disposable income and real purchasing power. The notion of a compensation package is intended to offset the loss of real purchasing power associated with a net increase in the taxation of goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not seek to provide answers at this time to the details of that package, which will be put forward by the Opposition at the time chosen by Mr Peter Reith, but it is relevant to examine the suggestions put forward by the Business Council of Australia, which has done a splendid analysis that is worth looking at. In general terms, the Business Council of Australia proposed that the three adjustments to be made were as follows: firstly, an increase in social security rates by the one-off increase in price multiplied by a scaling factor which recognises consumption outlays as a percentage of social security receipts; secondly, an increase in the tax-free threshold such that disposable income is increased to maintain real purchasing power of income at the new threshold level; and, thirdly, reductions in marginal tax rates to maintain the real purchasing power of consumption outlays from income in each tax bracket. </PARA>
<PARA> `The choice of which type of broad-based consumption tax is an important one for the Opposition to consider', wrote the Business Council of Australia, and indeed it is. It is relatively simple to dismiss out of hand wholesale sales taxes, turnover taxes and manufacturers taxes due to relative inefficiency and administrative flaws. The choice, therefore, is between a retail sales tax on the one hand-as used in the United States-and on the other hand a value-added or goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas experience strongly favours a multistage goods and services tax above a retail sales tax. The reasons for that are that, firstly, the tax base for a GST is much larger than the retail sales tax. The importance of this is that a broad base means that one is given an aggregate revenue that can be collected at a lower tax rate than would be the case with a narrow base. Secondly, the goods and services tax is more successful in exempting business inputs from the indirect tax than is the retail sales tax. Similarly, the goods and services tax causes less distortion to production and consumption decisions. Lastly, the goods and services tax is a superior weapon against tax evasion and avoidance. This again has been borne out by the New Zealand experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the 24 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, 21 have a multistage broad-based consumption tax. The New Zealand goods and services tax provides a worthy model for Australia to consider. Indeed, I had the recent fortune, as did several of my colleagues, to visit New Zealand to investigate its goods and services tax in operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Without providing any detail of how the coalition's goods and services tax will operate after the next election, it is worthwhile having a look at how the New Zealand GST would apply in Australia. Firstly, all business enterprises above a minimum size could be registered with the Australian Taxation Office and provided with a GST number. The tax could be calculated using a credit offset system which would take a measure of taxable sales, less credits for tax paid on purchase inputs, with exports being rated as exempt or, indeed, zero rated. </PARA>
<PARA> Net tax could then be remitted to the Government at different periods, depending upon the size of the business, so as not to disadvantage small firms. In this way, smaller businesses could be compensated for the higher per dollar compliance costs. A hybrid system of allowing both methods was introduced by New Zealand in its review process. In implementing the tax, it is important to announce the broad parameters of that tax in advance and to provide consultative mechanisms to establish and develop details within the constraints of those parameters. Certainty is important. In New Zealand I was impressed to see material used in the community education and promotion campaign for the tax, which would be essential in minimising uncertainty and transition costs while the tax was being introduced. I cannot stress enough how important certainty and predictability are. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not seek to make any predictions as to the breadth of the base which will be caught by the GST under a Hewson government, except to make the in-principle comment that, the broader the base and the fewer the exemptions, the more efficient and relatively less distortional the tax will be. The benefits of replacing the current wholesale sales tax with a broad-based goods and services tax are considerable and could increase national income by 0.5 per cent. This puts this reform in the league of the potential benefits to the national income brought about by the micro-economic reform of transport and communications. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worthy to consider the comments of Prime Minister in waiting Mr Keating on the necessity to introduce that broad-based sales tax which he believed in in 1985. At the tax summit he said:</PARA>
<PARA>If we fail to approach tax reform constructively we have failed not just ourselves, but the nation generally. The spoilers in any such process will have much to answer for in condemning this and the next generation of Australians to the blight-the latent unfairness and gross inefficiency-of our current tax regime.</PARA>
<PARA>I thus ask the question: what has changed since 1985? The answer is that the boom times have gone. In the depths of recession we are now in far greater need of tax reform than existed at the time of the tax summit. Just as the former Treasurer recognised the requirement to introduce a broad-based consumption tax in 1985, that same need remains with us today. The Opposition is committed to taxation reform; it is the Government which will have to argue the case for the retention of the current unfair, unjust and inequitable system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating nine separate pieces of legislation within the wool package, including the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill 1991, the Australian Wool Corporation Bill 1991, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 1991, the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1991 and the Australian Wool Industry Council Bill 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This package of Bills restructures the wool industry following the removal of the reserve price scheme and the tabling in April 1991 of the report of the Vines Committee of Inquiry into the Wool Industry and the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council. Tonight I intend to debate the technicalities of the legislation. I will leave the industry perspective to my Opposition colleagues, Senators Archer, Bjelke-Petersen, Brownhill, Boswell, Chapman, Crane, Knowles, Panizza and Walters. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the collapse of the reserve price scheme, the Government enacted legislation to take the industry through to 30 June this year and until it received the Vines report on the future marketing of wool. Following the Vines report, the Government decided to establish the following bodies: the Wool Realisation Commission, which will be responsible for the disposal of the wool stockpile and the assets of the Australian Wool Corporation; a restructured Australian Wool Corporation, which will be responsible for promotion, standards and industry training; the Wool Industry Research and Development Corporation, which will be responsible for research and development; and the Wool Industry Council, which will consist of all sectors of the industry and which will be used by Government as its advisory body rather than the Wool Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to reflect on the present situation. Since the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, released the debt repayment schedule on 30 April, the wool market has improved, less wool than predicted has been offered for sale in the latter part of this season and interest rates have fallen. All of this has resulted in the debt being reduced to $2.63 billion, almost the $2.559 billion that the Government expected at the end of 1992-93. Importantly, the Minister admitted in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a 15 per cent . . . significant numbers of specialist wool growers will have no farm cash operating surplus in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>He said further:</PARA>
<PARA>In practice, the effect of the difference on farm cash operating surplus for the average grower is in the order of hundreds of dollars, not thousands. </PARA>
<PARA>However, when farmers are facing negative incomes, hundreds of dollars are important and the actual difference is actually in thousands of dollars. The Minister's arithmetic is shonky. For example, a producer with 5,000 sheep selling wool at 450c a kilogram will pay $10,125 with a 15 per cent tax but only $6,750 on a 10 per cent wool tax. That is a difference of $3,375, which is enough at least to put food on the table for a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the negative cash flows expected by growers, they need the lowest possible levy which can be sustained in a disciplined repayment schedule by the maximum amount of growers to ensure full payment of the debt. The Wool Corporation has the ability to borrow at lower rates of interest than the woolgrower. For example, the Australian Wool Corporation borrows at interest rates of 10.75 per cent, while the farmers are borrowing at interest rates of 18 per cent. Therefore, it is better to maintain a lower levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation figures treat the asset sales inadequately. A $120m transfer to debt servicing would almost cover the five per cent difference between the so-called need for a 15 per cent levy and a more appropriate 10 per cent levy. With this in mind, the Opposition will certainly not be supporting a 15 per cent levy. A 10 per cent levy is clearly all that is necessary. I seek leave to incorporate a soundly based economic table of options in Hansard to substantiate our position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This table is based on general assumptions. They are, firstly, that the Australian Wool Corporation can borrow at the long term bond rate of 10.75 per cent; secondly, 25 million kilograms can be released from the stockpile next year without a significant impact on price; thirdly, the cost of storing the stockpile and of running the Australian Wool Corporation or its replacement organisations is $45m a year; fourthly, the Australian Wool Corporation or its replacement organisation is committed to expenditure in 1991-92 of $187m on promotion and $54m on research and development; and, fifthly, unless otherwise noted, the average price to prevail in 1991-92 is 295c per kilogram or 447c per kilogram clean, the bottom of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics range of price forecasts of 450c to 550c clean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A significant point for woolgrowers centres on asset sales. It is the crux of the 10 per cent levy versus the 15 per cent levy. It is a question of what level of asset sales are reasonable from the Wool Corporation and where receipts from those sales should be applied. In supporting the unsustainable and unnecessarily high figure of 15 per cent, the Government is claiming that it can only sell $40m of the $280m to $300m of assets of the Wool Corporation in the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> We have repeated indications that $120m is a quite reasonable figure in the first year and in the second year. If the Government wants to maintain that sort of situation on the basis on which it is operating, it should be honest and state how many years it will take for the whole debt to be removed. Will it be four or five years? It will certainly be far shorter than the seven years which the Government originally proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is once again showing its lack of sympathy and lack of understanding for the problems facing woolgrowers. What does it matter if it takes one or two years more to pay the whole debt off if the viability of Australia's woolgrowers is maintained? If there were a maximum levy of 10 per cent, I believe that it would put sensible pressure on the Wool Corporation and the Wool Realisation Commission to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation should be selling off its assets-in particular, those assets, stores and warehouses that are not currently holding any wool. Those premises would certainly be serving commercial purposes with good returns. It would therefore be a good time to sell them. If there are no returns, the loss to the wool industry from selling $120m worth of assets at the present time, as against what could be obtained on a maximum market, is minimal compared with the far greater capital and farm losses for thousands of Australian farmers who would be sold up because of that significant difference between the 10 per cent and 15 per cent cost levy. The Government's heartlessness is transparent. </PARA>
<PARA> If we compare the choice of selling the Wool Corporation assets with farmers selling their hard-earned assets in the form of individual farms, anyone with any sympathy at all for this great Australian industry will realise the implications for the Australian economy. As more people enter the unemployment queues there will be a greater burden on ordinary Australian taxpayers and it will do nothing to aid the industry to get back on its feet-to say nothing of the family tragedy. There must be a greater sale of assets from the Wool Corporation than the assets sales of farmers' individual properties. With this in mind, I wish to move a second reading amendment to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill 1991. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) regrets the Government's unnecessary decision to create a Wool Realisation Commission separate from the Australian Wool Corporation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) regrets the Government's failure to provide some certainty in the wool market by not implementing an orderly schedule, with appropriate legislative authority, for releasing specified quantities of wool from the Australian Wool Corporation's stockpile; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) calls on the Government to support a properly managed industry funded flock reduction scheme to be introduced if and when the industry agrees such a scheme is necessary''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment reaffirms the Opposition policy towards a predictable and accountable release from the stockpile on a predetermined volume basis which we believe is the best method. We believe it was unnecessary to create another body by separating the Australian Wool Corporation from the wool realisation aspects. I also seek leave to move a further amendment to the Australian Wool Corporation Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate calls on the Government to have the Industry Commission conduct a full and comprehensive inquiry into the level and methods of wool promotion, so as to help ensure that Australian wool growers are receiving full value for their contributions''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition intends to move further technical amendments during other stages of this package of Bills. The amendments to be moved in relation to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill 1991 and the Australian Wool Corporation Bill involve a number of amendments to the audit provisions of both the Realisation Commission and the Wool Corporation. I will quote from the Auditor-General's Report No. 35 1990-91 concerning the potential erosion of accountability to the Parliament which was tabled yesterday in the Senate. In it the Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA>I am very concerned that a continuing effort to weaken the Parliament's role in the scrutiny and reporting on the activities of all public-sector entities appears to be gaining strength. </PARA>
<PARA>In the early hours of 31 May 1991, without consultation with the ANAO, the above Bills were introduced into the House of Representatives which I believe could tilt the balance against Parliamentary scrutiny of public-sector entities. </PARA>
<PARA>This action was despite the Government's decision that the Auditor-General should be the sole external auditor for all Commonwealth owned or controlled entities announced in a statement by the Government on 6 December 1990 in response to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts' examination of the ANAO and the Sheridan Review. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is surprising that a Bill such as that proposing the creation of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, with its significant cost implications for the taxpayer, should even be contemplated as suitable for potential choice of private auditor because of `special circumstances'. </PARA>
<PARA>Further to this, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>If parliamentary democracy is to have any meaning, no `special circumstances dictate' any further erosion from Parliament's right to be informed. Parliament (and the public) have a right to know what has been done with power and/or taxpayers' resources granted or guaranteed to any group. This right will be undermined if the current attempt to weaken the audit mandate of the Auditor-General succeeds. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter has already attracted the attention yesterday of my colleagues Senator Crane, Senator Bishop, Senator Short and Senator Watson. The key to whether the decision represents a real restoration of mandate to the Auditor-General depends on the exemptions allowed. These Bills do nothing to reassure the Parliament in this regard if the potential is seen by the Government for an exemption in a Bill dealing with $2.7 billion of debt and a 4.7 billion bale stockpile shouldered by the taxpayer. The Opposition strongly supports the Auditor-General's most valuable and valid contribution to the debate on this legislation and, therefore, will be moving amendments at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I mention some points regarding the Australian Wool Industry Council Bill 1991, which was introduced into the Senate only yesterday afternoon. This Bill in its original form attracted a number of reservations, made clear to the Opposition by the Cattle Council of Australia, the Australian Dairy Industry Council and the National Farmers Federation, regarding the effect on their respective commodity groups, which were not under consideration or debated in this wool industry package. Their concern centred on the fact that the original legislation-then entitled the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill 1991-was an umbrella piece of legislation which set up industry councils by regulation rather than by legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is pleased that the Government has taken up the concerns of the Opposition and industry in relation to this matter and has introduced the Australian Wool Industry Council Bill 1991 for the wool industry specifically. For this reason, the Opposition will be supporting this Bill with, again, a minor technical amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate to the Senate that the package of amendments proposed by the Opposition will contain approximately 23 or 24 amendments. It is indicative that in legislation of this nature we have to again do the Government's work in so many areas that are of a technical-and should be-professional and political expertise area. It is indeed unfortunate, even given the haste with which we are being asked to consider this legislation, that it is incumbent upon the Opposition to pick up and do the Government's dirty work.</PARA>
<PARA> I also note with some considerable concern that the list of speakers on this particular package of legislation, other than the Minister who will obviously speak in reply at the end, includes only one other senator from the Government-from the Australian Labor Party. I pay credit to the fact that Senator West will be speaking on behalf of the Government. It will be very interesting to listen to her comments and to fathom the depth of understanding and, hopefully, the reasons why her colleagues are not backing her up with their support in this chamber. It is very patronising that we can expect only a nominal reply from the Minister at the end of such an important piece of legislation that requires such extensive amendment and consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that on our side of the chamber there will be some 13 speakers, many of whom have a very close personal involvement in the issue. They will obviously be reflecting the important values, important concerns and compassion of the people of Australia who are so closely aligned to this tragedy which the Labor Government has induced for so many of us. Therefore, it will be very interesting to listen to the debate and also to participate in the debate on the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA> The saga that has been the history of the wool industry in this country over the past few years is a sorry one. The saga of legislation and its passage through this Parliament is no less shameful. Wool has long been recognised as this country's single most important product. The one commodity that we can produce better than anyone else in the world has been treated like an old dog.</PARA>
<PARA> We are debating a package of no fewer than nine Bills, eight of which the House of Representatives debated under the threat of guillotine. The legislation has, quite rightly, been called `last minute'. Given that changes to the industry must take effect on 1 July, we are once again experiencing this last, mad dash to the line-just as we did last year. It is legislation by intimidation. It is no way for this Parliament in this country to be treating our single most important industry. </PARA>
<PARA> For all our haste last year, the wool industry was no better off. When are we going to learn that legislation written and debated in haste will be repented at leisure-except that it will not be we who directly suffer the consequences of this Government getting it wrong yet again, it is the woolgrowers who suffer directly and immediately. They suffered when the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy interfered in their industry last year. They were told that they had to make tough decisions, accept the umpire's ruling, shoot their sheep, reduce their flock numbers and adjust to the fact that overnight their income was to be halved. </PARA>
<PARA> To the industry's credit, it bit the bullet. Woolgrowers lost the floor price, shot their sheep and got on with the business of making a living without street marches and without going on strike. That is very different from the other side of industry and some people in the trade union movement where the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) comes from. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a great pity that the Opposition's proposals for a properly organised slaughter scheme were not adopted. I believe that the industry today would be in a far stronger position had those proposals been accepted some time ago. But retrospective navel gazing is of no value to anyone, especially at the moment. Having said that, I do not in any way wish to underplay the very serious situation of the wool industry and the very difficult decisions that must be made in the future. Not only are there problems of disposal of the stockpile and repayment of the $2.63 billion debt, there is also the future marketing of wool to consider. The Government now is proposing that the industry be taxed to a level of 15 per cent to assist in that debt recovery. That is fine. But have the people on the Government side bothered to consult the industry as to its ability to pay that tax? I think not. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the whole of this debate on the wool industry woolgrowers have been the last to be considered. If the Labor Government could prise itself away from playing follow the leader for five minutes and concentrate on the real problems-and I include the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, and his departmental minions-it would come to the realisation that when it reduces people's incomes by 30 to 50 per cent, increases their costs and restricts their production, it also reduces their ability to pay those taxes. Nowhere has the Government satisfactorily explained how growers will be able to afford to pay the 15 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy admitted in his second reading speech that at 15 per cent a significant number of specialist woolgrowers will have no farm cash operating surplus in 1991-92. He further said that, in practice, the effect of the difference on farm cash operating surplus for the average grower is in the order of hundreds of dollars and not thousands. However, I ask my fellow senators: when farmers are facing negative incomes, hundreds of dollars are important-and the actual difference is in the thousands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Walters. She understands the problem. I am afraid people on the other side of the House do not. For example, a producer with 5,000 sheep, selling wool at 450c a kilogram, will pay $10,125 with a 15 per cent tax but only $6,750 with a 10 per cent wool tax. That is a difference of $3,375-enough at least to put food on the table for quite some time. A 10,000-sheep farmer would pay $20,250 with a 15 per cent tax and only $13,500 with a 10 per cent tax. At 500c a kilogram, the tax on 5,000 sheep would be $11,250 at 15 per cent but only $7,500 on 10 per cent-a difference of $3,750. For 10,000 sheep the difference would be $7,500. I believe that this has to be taken into account when we are looking at the tax people can afford to pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This period in Australia's history has been the most painful for rural Australia. For those of us in the Opposition, particularly those who have been here for a few years, this debacle has brought home clearly the frustration of being in opposition. I believe that we are not going to be here much longer; we are going to be on the Government side. We have had to observe the destruction of an industry by this Government that we have been powerless to stop. We cannot, and this time will not, sit impotent and helpless while the Government attempts to get the proverbial blood out of a stone. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry is bankrupt. It cannot pay 15 per cent tax. What is more, it need not have to pay that higher tax. The Opposition's proposals for a maximum of 10 per cent are valid and sustainable. They are also not negotiable. I have just done a tour of the western regions of New South Wales, visiting woolgrowers in different places. They cannot afford to pay any more than 10 per cent in tax. If any people from the Department, the Government or anywhere else wants to see how people are battling, let them go out and see the people who are running sheep in the western districts of New South Wales. I am quite sure that it would be no different in a lot of parts from South Australia, Western Australia-where Senator Panizza comes from-or Tasmania. Too much tax is just very difficult-in fact, impossible-to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> We have done our figures, which is more than can be said for either the Government or some groups advising the industry. During the debate in the other place, several Opposition speakers incorporated figures prepared by the Opposition on options for the industry. Senator Tambling has done the same here tonight, so I will not have them incorporated in Hansard again. Where are the figures and the options of the Government? On what is its judgment for 15 per cent based? What about the Wool Council of Australia? What figures has it produced for its members? What sort of industry group that purports to represent the best interests of woolgrowers would recommend support for a 15 per cent tax, as the Wool Council did originally, and only latterly come to realise the sustainability of a 10 per cent tax?</PARA>
<PARA> Only yesterday I received a piece of paper that was written on Wool Council of Australia letterhead. The letter was written by Alan Bowman, the President, and was dated 7 June 1991. After having talked about the 12 per cent tax and the 15 per cent tax, it went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This is not to say a lower tax would not be equally prudent if property sales could generate more than $40 million in 1991/92. Therefore, the Opposition's policy to set the wool tax in 1991/92 at 10% is a feasible alternative. </PARA>
<PARA>What sort of honest brokers are the Democrats if they are prepared to push their 12 per cent barrow just so they can claim credit for saving the industry 3 per cent? On what basis was the 12 per cent arrived at? Do we know, or do they know?</PARA>
<PARA> One needs only to look at how this mess first started. Let us take as an example the former primary industry Minister when he embarked on what is now regarded as the beginning of the end of the reserve price scheme. In 1987, in introducing changes to the operation of the wool industry, Mr Kerin suggested that the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . seeks to place the Australian Wool Corporation on a sound commercial footing . . . equipped to respond now and into the future to the pressures of the market place. </PARA>
<PARA>One could not be much further off the mark than that. One can only pray that this man, now the nation's Treasurer, will not make as big a mistake in his new portfolio. What of his departmental advisers, his experts in the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and the Corporation itself, who projected figures and futures so unrelated to the reality of today that one has to ask on what basis their judgment was made? Is it any wonder that, with that track record, the industry is in the predicament it is? The wonder of it is that it is not even worse off than it is at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of marketing wool, I have received a great many suggestions. Growers, housewives and marketing experts have come up with ways of promoting wool-wool blends, cool wool and greasy wool. It seems that there is no shortage of ideas. Consumers, if asked, say that they prefer woollens to synthetics, but somewhere along the chain there is a marketing breakdown and wool sales are not meeting the expectations. One of the greatest disincentives is price and, at some stages last year, the fact of supply through the pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumers read that woolgrowers are shooting sheep and that the price of wool has fallen through the floor, but they cannot buy a decent wool jumper for under $60 and they cannot buy a skein of wool for less than $3 to $4. Preferences are all very well but only when they can be afforded. Every Australian child should own a pure wool jumper, but it is much easier and cheaper to buy a synthetic product. Patriotism is very well but it does not come before price. People regard wool as an expendable luxury fibre rather than as an essential for cold climate living. Confidence must be instilled again into the selling chain. The consumer must be respected in the wool chain. The producer must be respected so that he or she is still there in the future to produce wool and not be driven out of business. I believe that a 15 per cent tax will drive people out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry is a great industry and will remain so if we do not drive the nail into its coffin by taxing it more now than it needs to be. It is time for the administration of the industry to tighten its belt and to sell some of the corporate assets, and quickly, rather than impose a high tax which would put undue strain on the growers and force them to sell their assets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill 1991, the Australian Wool Corporation Bill 1991, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 1991, the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1991 and the Australian Wool Industry Council Bill 1991. They are the final nail in the coffin of the reserve price scheme. Let us not make the mistake tonight of setting the tax into the next 12 months and beyond for the debt realisation scheme, which will put the nail in the coffin of many woolgrowers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How things have changed. In the early 1970s I was part of a group of angry, young new land farmers who were prepared to stop all traffic from east to west, both rail and road, to try to force the government of the day to introduce a reserve price scheme. The scheme worked well until 1987 when it was turned into a market price setting mechanism. From that day it was doomed. The reserve price scheme became a dog chasing its tail in ever decreasing circles. In late January 1991 it collapsed; it was exhausted. </PARA>
<PARA> What is left? There is a debt of $2.63 billion, a stockpile of 815 million kilograms or some 4.4 million bales, and thousands and thousands of growers at risk. Before one looks to the future, one must ask: where does the ultimate responsibility for this lie? It must clearly rest with the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, who removed section 41 from the Act in 1987. That part of the Act revolved around the discipline which was required financially in an operation such as the reserve price scheme. Until that date the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) at fortnightly intervals had to make reports to the Minister and to the Treasurer as to how the reserve price scheme was travelling. That all changed and greed and misjudgment took over. </PARA>
<PARA> One must also not forget that Mr Kerin was responsible for the appointment of the Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation. He also appointed the Government's representative on the Wool Corporation. It is not good enough to claim that the Government did not know what was going on. It had the people there and they knew what was going on. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Auditor-General's report which came out yesterday entitled Potential Erosion of Accountability to the Parliament-Australian Wool Realisation Commission and Australian Wool Corporation. A number of honourable senators spoke on this matter yesterday. I will not go over that debate, other than to say that it was a grave mistake to present these Bills to this Parliament and not have the Auditor-General as the key person in terms of auditing and reporting to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Also one must not forget what has happened in the wool industry and other industries where high interest rates caused by Government monetary policy have borne down heavily not only on individual woolgrowers but also on the Wool Corporation. At the same time as wool was travelling well-and there were a couple of years when it earned $6 billion worth of export income-income equalisation deposits (IEDs) were removed. The one mechanism which people on the land had by which they could offset their high incomes and prepare themselves for a rainy day or when the cash flow was not so good was taken away. Treasurer Keating took millions and millions and millions of dollars off woolgrowers for the Treasury coffers. Had those IEDs been left in place the wool industry would be in a much better position to handle the situation which exists today. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the difference between a 15 per cent tax and a 10 per cent tax. The simplest terms that I can put it in are that at 450c clean a kilo for every 1,000 sheep shorn the difference between 10 per cent and 15 per cent is $750. We can all do our figures from there. For many that would mean the difference between viability and non-viability. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the work the Opposition has done on how we could have a significantly lower tax than that proposed by the Government in these Bills. Since the Vines Committee report was brought down, there has been a lower debt than anticipated. Prices have been much better than anticipated. There are lower interest rates in servicing that debt. There can be a much greater emphasis on the disposal of the Wool Corporation assets and a significantly lower production figure than initially anticipated. That has come down from an anticipated figure, some three or four months ago, of 914 million kilograms per annum to about 880 million to 881 million kilograms today officially. But independent research that I have commissioned would suggest, at least in Western Australia, that it is even more than that. The figure could well be down somewhere around 850 million kilograms. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some other potential mechanisms by which the tax could be kept down so that as many growers as possible could survive and the hardship that will occur over the next year or two could be minimised. When I talk about hardship, I do not talk only about the farmers on the land but also about those people who service the industry, and they are a very important component of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the current situation with the Wool Corporation, we find that it has reserves of some $200m in general promotion and research and development. That begs the question: why would the Corporation in the situation it found itself last October-November, particularly with regard to promotion, have those sorts of reserves tucked away in its hip pocket? Today they can be used to lower the tax that has to be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also look at the $290m worth of AWC assets. Some of those assets are not even being used in the wool industry; they are being leased out to store motor cars and a number of other things. I cannot in all honesty stand here and suggest that those stores should remain in preference to producers being sold off. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking firstly at the figures, one must challenge the Government-as was done in the other place-on why it has not put its figures on the table on how it comes to its conclusions. Looking at the figures across the board, one can see that there is a potential for significant asset sales and there is a potential, with the drop in production, for some sales from the stockpile. There is an ability to use the promotion reserves and run them down. There is no reason why we should keep millions and millions of dollars tucked away in that cosy little pouch. </PARA>
<PARA> When we analyse all these figures-these figures have been tested by a number of people and nobody has found any holes in them-we find that the level required to finance the shortfall on the operating costs of the Corporation is about 5.1 per cent. So it is not necessary, as is the case with the Government, to do that with a figure of up to 11 per cent plus 4 per cent for promotion, research and development. I re-emphasise that we should sell the wool assets and run those reserves down before we start selling up growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Research and development, promotion and the future development of the International Wool Secretariat have to be looked at very carefully. We must start placing emphasis on promoting the Australian product and what Australian wool can do. We must look at whether there is a better mechanism for promoting wool on world markets. It could well be better to put wool promotion out to tender. A number of very professional world promoters might well do the same or better job for significantly less cost. This has never been reported on. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to touch on a number of other pieces of research that have been done. The ACIL Australia Pty Ltd report entitled Financing the Wool Industry's Debt, which I received yesterday from one of the members of the Wool Council of Australia-the report was brought down on 7 June, and that was the first time I saw it-showed quite clearly that, in fact, in the first year a tax of 9.25 per cent in total for promotion, research and development and the servicing of the debt could meet what was required. Further research has indicated that, if the tax were set at 10 per cent, it would take five years to service that debt realisation scheme. When Minister Kerin's plan is over a seven-year period, one asks why we need to have a tax at 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time I have remaining, I wish to acknowledge the success of the flock reduction scheme. That has put us in a position today-although many people did not like it-where we are able to produce figures of the magnitude we have talked about. I very strongly urge the Government to accept that there should be as a component of these Bills a provision, if the industry sees fit in the future, to reintroduce a flock reduction scheme. At the end of the day, there has to be a balance between supply and demand and price, and that is one way of producing that. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I touch on a very sad matter. I just hope that the importance of getting the tax down gets through to Government members on the other side of the chamber. Just before I walked into the chamber, I was informed of the third suicide of a bona fide woolgrower in the last fortnight in Western Australia. The situation is critical. It is so damn critical that it is imperative that the Government sees that, by placing a 15 per cent tax on the wool industry today, it will create a situation where a whole host of other people give up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we are, for the fourth time in two years, debating a heap of wool Bills-namely, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill, the Australian Wool Corporation Bill, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill, the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills and the Australian Wool Industry Council Bill. That alone shows what stopgap measures the Government has taken over the last two years; every time there is a problem, it comes in with a stopgap measure. The one thing I have learned since I have been in this place is that any important Bill to do with primary industry-whether it be the wheat, wool or meat industry-comes in late in the session and late at night. That reflects the importance that this Government places on primary industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have the eyes and ears of not only Australian woolgrowers, but also businessmen from large and small businesses and their employees on us to see what sort of decision we are going to make this evening, because our decision will have a bearing on whether or not we are going to have a wool industry and whether or not a lot of those people will have jobs for very long. My fears, that I have expressed in every speech that I have made on wool in this place, are seeing the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA> Going back over the history, first there was that ill-fated decision-agreed to by this Government and its then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy who is now the Treasurer (Mr Kerin)-to lift the reserve price from 670c to 870c a kilo. </PARA>

I hope that Mr Kerin makes more success of the Treasury than he has of fixing this portfolio. Senator West can stay there and listen but, if she does not want to listen to what is going on out there, she can leave the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Next was the inflexibility of the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia in refusing to submit to the folly and reduce that reserve. Even though it is short, history has shown us that the biggest single outcome of this ill-conceived system of 1986-87 was the increase in production. This was led by New South Wales where production jumped up 48 per cent and Victoria where it was up 38 per cent, and the Australian average was 33 per cent. It occurred because we were selling wool to ourselves at a price which was too high and which we could not afford. That is all that happened. </PARA>
<PARA> The real beneficiary, as Senator Crane has already pointed out, was the Australian Taxation Office, which could do what it liked. The next beneficiaries were the banks which were doing the best they could with the woolgrowers and also financing the stockpile. The greedy bigger studs, with their increased sales of higher priced rams, are just as much to blame. The stockpile was growing and growing and the Minister sat on his backside and did nothing about it. The Corporation itself stumbled from disaster to disaster, so did Mr Kerin, as attempts were made to get out of the mess and we finished up with 5.6 million bales and nearly $4m in debt. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw the levy increase to a 30 per cent maximum plus another 10 per cent levy. We saw $7m spent by the Corporation on computers to put in action quotas which never saw the light of day. I do not know what happened to the computers; they are probably still not being used. Mr Kerin made a statement that 870c was immutable and then dropped it to 600c while he gave an ironclad guarantee all over the world on 700c. Then there was total collapse and the suspension of sales. The perpetrators of this scheme-the Corporation, the Wool Council and the Minister-have certainly got a lot to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the history. Now there is damage control and, hopefully, the return of this great industry to the rightful position that it has had in Australia as a leading exporter. Only three years ago this industry was gathering more export income than coal, then we let it go wrong. Fortunately, since February when everything collapsed, there have been a few lights on the horizon but not very many. The price of wool is somewhat better than expected because of better demand. Production, because of the season and loss of confidence, has eased. The slaughter scheme had a bit to do with this, especially in the eastern States where there was probably more slaughter than anywhere else. They needed it. They are the States that had overproduced and overstocked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;New South Wales did. It then used different methods and different guns for a slaughter scheme. Unfortunately, the real problem for a high percentage of the 66,000 woolgrowers is that they are in jeopardy of having to leave their farms, and the final outcome of this Bill will have a great bearing on their future. That is why I said we are going to have to make a very big decision tonight. A 5 per cent difference in the wool tax made tonight can mean about $4,000 to the average woolgrower. If a woolgrower or anybody else has a zero income, $4,000 is a mighty lot of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage I wish to address my remarks to a group of people around Australia-some of whom came to see me yesterday-who want to abolish the wool tax altogether. I think they call themselves the Abolish Wool Tax Movement. They want to pay no tax at all, but they have to face up to their responsibilities. The woolgrowers, along with the Corporation, the Minister and the Wool Council, got themselves into this position, and they have to get themselves out of it. I will not go along with the extreme methods they propose. If the wool industry wants to retain credibility in the bush--</PARA>

As a whole, we have to get ourselves out of this situation. We have to address the problem of how we can keep most of these farmers on their farms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point of the debate is the figure we finish up with tonight. The figure for research and promotion alone is 6 per cent. Whatever figure we talk about-whether it is 4 per cent, 6 per cent or 10 per cent-is on top of that 6 per cent. No-one has yet questioned the 6 per cent promotion figure. I believe that it is too much. After all, the cotton industry does not have a promotion levy, nor does it pay for promotion. It lets the industry do that-the ones who are making the money on the way through and processing it. We should look at that approach to try to reduce the number of people the industry is carrying and cannot afford to carry any longer. That problem has to be addressed. That is not quite the problem we are addressing tonight, but I put it as an aside. We are paying out far too much. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has done its figures and published them. No-one has laid a glove on them. Not one person, newspaper or organisation in Australia has laid a glove on our figures. Where are the Australian Democrats' figures? I have never seen them published. All they can say is that our figures will not stand up. They say what the tax figures should be.

Where are the Government's figures? The Government has told us-and it will continue to tell us tonight-that our figures are wrong, but it has not produced figures of its own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic point to be considered is how we arrived at these figures, and Senator Tambling alluded to this. We can support what we say. We say that we can support 10 per cent over the next seven years. If we get into promotion and use some of the reserves Senator Crane spoke about, I believe we can get the figure down to 7 per cent or even lower. If honourable senators opposite bothered to read the figures, they would see that we could do it. </PARA>
<PARA> When earlier figures were worked out we were looking at a production of 914 million kilos a year; forward projections now show that to be 881 million kilos and dropping. A lot of sheep have died because of the unfortunate start to the season in the east and in part of the west. The projected average price was 435c per kilo at 21.5 micron clean. That figure was much lower when we debated the wool quotas; now it is projected to be 465c. Incidentally, today it is still 594c, which is 33 per cent above that estimate. That is something else we should keep in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The last time we debated the opening debt, I thought it was going to be between $3.5 billion and $3.9 billion. In March it was mooted to be $2.88 billion and now in June it is $2.660 billion. Has anyone on the Government side taken these projected figures into consideration? Obviously not. That is how the Opposition has arrived at what it reckons it can do. The Australian Democrats have not produced anything; I know they have used figures from the Wool Council. The last time I saw figures from the Wool Council, one could drive a truck through them. The Wool Council does not know what it is talking about; that is where the Australian Democrats went wrong. The Wool Council commissioned ACIL Australia Pty Ltd to give it a report. When it received that report on 6 June, as Senator Crane said, it conveniently kept it in the dark because it shows that the Council could do the whole lot at 9.25 per cent. Once again, no-one has taken notice of that. I have asked the Government where it got its figures from; I asked the same question of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final analysis the Opposition believes that the way to strike a fair tax, to keep farmers on their farms and to pay this debt off while woolgrowers keep credibility is the way in which we handle real estate. I believe that the Australian Wool Corporation is working on selling $65m-worth of real estate in the first year, and the Government is doing the same. The Opposition believes it could sell $100m in the first year and another $100m in the second year, but I believe the total assets to be in excess of $280m. I asked the Wool Corporation when it gave us a briefing why it did not sell more real estate in central business districts rather than selling farmers off their farms, and I was asked whether I would sell real estate returning 14 per cent. That real estate is full of cars; it was not built to store cars. If I wanted to sell real estate, the first I would sell would be the one returning 14 per cent because that is what it would bring me-in the present downturn, the quickest sale for the highest price. If I were to buy a building that was already tenanted, the best I could hope to get generally would be about 7 per cent, and I would hope to build it up to 10 or 11 per cent in the first rent review. No, real estate returning 14 per cent would be the first to go. The Wool Corporation should get those people out of that building in the Melbourne central business district and put them into a disused wool store or something like that for the rest of the Corporation's time and until we get rid of the stockpile. That is how we will get that figure down-by getting rid of the real estate in Melbourne and in the south of France, where the Corporation has obviously been entertaining its friends and/or customers. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the whole point: if we get rid of that real estate more quickly, we will have a chance of getting that stockpile down. At this stage I challenge the Democrats and the Government to look at the Opposition's figures because, as I said at the start of my speech, the rest of Australia has its eyes and ears on us tonight because this will be the Waterloo of whether the industry survives. We need to bring in good wool stockpile management, but that is a byplay to getting that figure down to a figure our woolgrowers can afford to pay during this downturn. I know that the wool industry will revive, as it has done on every other occasion it has been down. In my time I have seen the price of wool fall four times and I have seen it revive four times. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I ask the Democrats, the Government and the independents-mainly led by Senator Brian Harradine-to look at what we are saying, because we are making a vital decision tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The important thing about this debate is that at the end of it, we must retain an active and viable industry. The actions we take tonight will determine whether this industry survives and prospers in the year ahead. My ancestors turned up here in the 1820s. They brought with them on the ship merino sheep and they found that these sheep did very well in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As time has passed and quality has improved, Tasmania has now reached the stage of having about five million sheep, including, of course, some of the very best in Australia. Over the past 12 months, there has been an overall decline of about 10 per cent in the sheep numbers in the State, a trend that we must all hope continues, not only in Tasmania, but also throughout Australia, until the stock and the debt position are brought to manageable conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the 200 years of Australia's history, we have had a sheep's back mentality and too often we have acted as though providing we had sheep, nothing else mattered. I well remember the problems of the industry at the time when I first came into the Senate. I have followed the operation of the Australian Wool Corporation during its life and times ever since. There can be no doubt that the scheme worked very well. It did everything its originators said and hoped it would, but most of all, it took away some of the normal risks of business and provided a considerable smoothing of incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Sheep and wool increased in numbers and popularity as the risk declined. Wherever other forms of farming hit hard times, the farmers seemed to resort to sheep. Eventually, numbers alone brought about a situation where supply exceeded demand. But instead of market forces reflecting this with the lower prices, the floor price, which by then had also become a ceiling price, failed to give the signals and we developed the well-known problems of enormous magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA> Over many years it has been considered right that Australia should produce wool but let others process it and sell it back to us. I can never go along with that and I believe that even now we should be doing everything possible to remove any obstacle that would enable us to become prominent in the world of woollen processors. </PARA>
<PARA> With the appalling state of the Australian economy, employment, relative standard of living and overseas debt, we must surely all concede that our primary and mineral industries cannot produce a level of income that can get us back on the rails. Secondary manufacturing must be encouraged and fostered. Our research achievements have been tremendous in growing and in the processing of wool. It is time that we got the sorts of benefits for Australia that are available from these developments. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times, it has become clear that wool is really not one product-just wool-but at least two and probably three products. If it is two, the division would be apparel wools and non-apparel wools. If it is three, we have got fine, medium and coarse. The superfine wool, which is the flagship of the industry, does not need much more introduction at this stage. Then there is the medium wool which is the substantial majority of the total clip. This is where the major opportunities and extension of uses exist and where the work must be done in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I comment most favourably on the coarse or carpet wool and its industry. This group of growers are well organised; they know what and where their market is and they operate very efficiently. The coalition's rural committee has spent nearly all of its time this year investigating, consulting and contacting as many people as possible so that our recommendations can be of the highest possible standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to thank the members of our committee and all those people who have made their time available, either here in Canberra or in their home States. I thank all who have made suggestions, prepared submissions and spent hours and hours on the telephone with one thing and one thing only in their minds-how to get the wool industry back on the track for the good of those in it and for the country as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> One issue that has come through is the reflection of what the wool industry really is. As at 31 March 1990, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there were 63,716 rural establishments with sheep and a total of 170.297 million sheep, representing an average flock size of just 2,673. </PARA>
<PARA> For honourable senators' information, on a State by State basis flock sizes are as follows: New South Wales, 2,814; Victoria, 1,799; Queensland, 5,389; South Australia, 1,848; Western Australia, 3,805; Tasmania, 2,610; and the Australian Capital Territory, 2,033. Bearing that in mind, there are 16 flocks of over 50,000 sheep and 330 flocks of between 20,000 and 50,000 sheep; while at the other extreme there are 2,645 flocks of fewer than 100 sheep. The median flock size falls between 1,500 and 2,000 sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> All of those producers now know the situation. They are fully aware; they have learnt from the past and they understand that no industry can prosper unless it is market driven or consumer oriented. The floor price removed all of the skills of marketing and the need to produce for special needs. As the industry recovers this will, and must, be the basis of that recovery. The latest figure I have is that the stockpile totalled 4,639,123 bales as at 7 June, so there is still a very long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Out of that-as was pointed out very strenuously by one of my callers last night-there are two things to remember. The stockpile is not a liability; it is an asset and a very good one. In fact, with the increase in prices over recent weeks the potential recovery has improved by 35 per cent to 40 per cent. The other point on which an independent, arms length assessment needs to be made as soon as possible, followed by a report to the industry, the trade and the Government, is as to the quality of the holding. Should there be hundreds, or even thousands, of bales of substandard or unsaleable wool, it should be disposed of-and disposed of quickly. With the new start there should be no self-imposed handicaps. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us bear the market in mind. The buyers need to be assured that they can face an open market with complete certainty, subject to their own market judgment. Whilst it is comfortable to work within a controlled market, in the long run the free market has to be the best judge. From our Committee deliberations one thing stands out: namely, that production must be slowed down. On the best reasonable estimates we cannot expect to sell quantities vastly greater than previously established ranges of sales; nor at this juncture do we see extensive new product nor new country markets. The alternative therefore is a production reduction until the slide really takes over and holdings clear. </PARA>
<PARA> We all hope that fewer ewe lambs will be retained and fewer ewes mated. We hope that mutton sales can be expanded further and that reduced flocks will not be restocked yet. In the meantime, I believe today is the last of this year's Launceston wool sales. Of course, Launceston has been the real centre of selling for the cream of Australia's superfine wool. So much of the trade there is now personal, with regular buyers for the special lines. Year after year it produces the seasonal record prices. I, and I am sure all of the other Tasmanian senators, will be pressing for the retention of these very special sales. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted this week that certain potential buyers did not participate in a particular sale because of the tri-dumped bales. It will be sheer stupidity if we lose buyers because we fail to take into account the needs of the average regular buyers. It does not matter what suits us; it is what the buyer requires that matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The times ahead will surely be difficult for some time. The new boards will have to play a tremendously important part and we will look to them for reduction and guidance. There will be requirements on the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics for close monitoring and judgment, while matters of production techniques, handling, transporting and marketing will involve all of the resources of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other bureaus, besides every capability of the private sector in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency so that profitability may be restored as soon as possible. We all feel desperately sorry for those who have suffered, or may suffer, as a result of the combined effects of the recession and the wool collapse. </PARA>
<PARA> The flow-on effects will hurt many others; so we must ensure that we reduce the debt as fast as possible, but not by overtaking those who do not have a capacity to pay. The Opposition believes 10 per cent is quite adequate for this tax-and it has carried out hundreds of calculations to confirm this. The Wool Council's ACIL Australia Pty Ltd report would confirm that there is no justification to move to a higher figure on economic grounds and there is certainly no good reason for more than a 10 per cent tax on compassionate and humanitarian grounds as well. I support the thrust of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not learned much, but that is one thing I have learned. We have heard a number of times tonight reference to the ACIL Australia Pty Ltd report that was done for the Australian Wool Council. I do not know which ACIL report for the Wool Council has been quoted tonight. It is certainly not the one I have seen. I quote from its summary:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In summary, justifiable variation to the assumptions likely to have been used by the Government mean that no change to the wool tax is required for 1991-92. Some changes work to reduce the rate of tax while others work in the opposite direction. Overall, the changes amount to a difference of less than 0.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, fine tuning of the original assumptions used by the Government does not justify a reduction in the total wool tax rate (for 1991-92) from the 15 per cent announced. </PARA>
<PARA>To reduce the rate of tax below 15 per cent in 1991-92 would require, a combination of deferring the payment of $20 million debt, capitalising some of the debt, extending the repayment period, selling wool from the stockpile and greater sales of AWC assets.</PARA>
<PARA>The report then goes on to assess the options. If I am asked about the date, are we up to changing our assumptions, which is the usual trick of the economists? Is that how people are coming up 10 per cent and 6 and 7 per cent, as we have heard tonight? The suggestion that some people have been making is that the tax should be at 6 or 7 per cent. Are we changing our assumptions? We really need to get a level playing field. </PARA>

<PARA> I would also like to talk briefly about the wool promotion strategies that are being planned within the legislation. It is very true to say that wool promotion strategy in the past-and even now-tends to concentrate on the top quality end of the market. It is for the fine wool that has gone into these products, it is not for the wool of the lower microns--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Panizza" NAMEID="JI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator Panizza</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me tell Senator Panizza that I do not think the indicator was used in the coat that I happen to have on-it was certainly finer than that. I support, and want people to be very conscious of, the promotion of all of our wool. Wool is a wonderful product-no-one would ever argue with that-but we have to look at the proper promotion of wool in all of its micron widths. Carpet wool manufacturers have managed to do that- they have carved out a niche for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to make sure that promotion of the industry takes place in a way that does not concentrate only on the premium fine wool area. It is beautiful wool-it is without par in the world-but we have to make sure that we do not promote it to the exclusion or diminution of the promotion that has gone on in the past. People in the industry keep saying to me, `They do not promote the type of wool that I grow, and I grow good medium wool'. It is a comment that I hear all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation will also be looking to set quality standards and ensure that these standards are met. Obviously, the standards for quality and for bale cleanliness are still not being met. Every few years we have a program of promotion and work on reminding wool producers that they have to make sure that they do not put foreign matter into wool bales. This is something that we have to work on at our level-the producer level-so that we are not producing and sending overseas bales that are full of extraneous matter that is certainly going to clog and foul up the machines. That is an important thing that we must undertake to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that we must undertake to do is the testing of our wool-an objective measurement of our wool. I will quote two people within the industry who are buying Australian wool-Mr Kamei from Lachlan Industry Pty Ltd at Cowra, and Mr Ishiguro from Kanebo Ltd in Japan. In an article that has appeared in a number of papers they say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese wool processing industry has called on Australian woolgrowers to insist their clip is measured for staple length and strength. </PARA>
<PARA> Managing Director of Lachlan Industry Pty Ltd at Cowra, Mr T Kamei, has urged woolgrowers to insist their clip is tested in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, just 50 per cent of combing wools in Australia are measured for length and strength. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for this figure to increase significantly in the 1991-92 season so that processors can be certain of the specification of the greasy wool. </PARA>
<PARA> This will increase the demand for such wool. </PARA>
<PARA> Woolgrowers who do not test will be disadvantaged because there will be reduced price competition for untested lots. </PARA>
<PARA> These views were supported by Mr K. Ishiguro, manager of the Raw Wool Department of Kanebo Ltd, a major wool textile processing company in Japan . . . </PARA>
<PARA> `Kanebo is prepared to pay more for staple tested wool because we can be confident our automatic spinning and weaving machinery can operate effectively when the raw material is objectively specified,' Mr Ishiguro said. </PARA>
<PARA> `Almost all our purchase contracts stipulate wool must be 100 per cent additionally measured. </PARA>
<PARA> `Japan has a reputation for high quality wool products. </PARA>
<PARA> `This means we must ensure our raw material is supplied to our strict specifications. </PARA>
<PARA> `This can only be done if the wool is well classed and fully tested before sale,' Mr Ishiguro said. </PARA>
<PARA>These are some of the things the new Wool Corporation is going to be able to provide for the industry, and that is an extremely important point to bear in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a number of calls tonight and concerns expressed-justifiable concerns-about the fate of people in the wool industry with the downturn in the economy. They have failed to recognise that the Government has announced significant increases in the rural adjustment scheme. We are dealing with that issue and looking to that. Of course, the States also have a responsibility there. The sooner this debt is repaid the sooner the wool industry can get back to looking constructively at where it is going. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an important debate tonight. I do not intend to take up the time of the Senate much longer. I urge honourable senators to be very cautious and careful when they think about what will be happening. I urge people to be careful and cautious also when dealing with economists' work. Much criticism has been expressed about the fact that economists work upon assumptions and, having heard lots of figures bandied around tonight, I think we must go back and look very carefully at each original assumption upon which those assessments are based. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator West not for her knowledge of the wool industry but because she is the only Government speaker who is prepared to stand up for the Australian Labor Party. I would have thought Senator Walsh might have had a go tonight, but perhaps he is too embarrassed to support the 15 per cent. I suspect that is why he has not entered this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are debating tonight nine wool industry Bills that will restructure the administration of the great Australian wool industry: the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill 1991; the Australian Wool Corporation Bill 1991; the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 1991; the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1991; and the Australian Wool Industry Council Bill 1991. These nine Bills will impose on Australia's 60,000 woolgrowers a system they do not want and for which they cannot afford to pay if the 15 per cent levy is carried. I am hoping that the Australian Democrats will find it in their hearts to come across and support the 10 per cent levy that the coalition is moving for. I appeal to the Government, but it has not shown any sympathy to the rural or primary industries for as long as I have been in this Senate, so I think my appeal will once again fall on deaf ears. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I do not have to tell you about the state of the economy in the bush. Many woolgrowers are destined to go out of business because of what this legislation will do to them. It is not only a tragedy for those woolgrowers and for rural Australia as a whole but also for all Australians. The wool industry more than any other is responsible for providing prosperity to this nation. It supports indirectly and directly approximately 650,000 Australian jobs. It is up to this Senate to ensure that as many Australian woolgrowers as possible stay in business. It is in this nation's interests. Wool growing is what Australia does best. We have heard predictions around the Senate, and I agree with them, that there will be a wool shortage in three or four years time. But the immediate future for woolgrowers is fragile, and the level of taxation inflicted by this Government will take them to and beyond the breaking point. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the industry let down so many times in the last 12 months by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, who has now been elevated-I think the industry term is `laterally promoted': when people botch something up, they are pushed sideways. Mr Kerin could not have done any worse for the wool industry. He even put a new meaning into such terms as `immutable', `rock solid', `cast iron' and `guaranteed'; he put a whole new meaning into the vocabulary. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister was talking about the Vines committee of inquiry into wool marketing, he was talking about a 12 per cent tax applying after July 1991. The Vines report concluded that a 12 per cent tax was the top that the woolgrowers could support. That was a government-structured committee. Even then, the Vines committee reported that, if that tax was applied, the wool industry on average would be running at minus $620 per farm in 1991-92. The Government now ignores its own committee findings and imposes a tax of 15 per cent, which many farm bodies say will bankrupt 30 per cent of woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills replace the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) with three new bodies-the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, the new Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Research and Development Corporation. The Wool Realisation Commission is scheduled to last seven years and is to sell off the stockpile of 4.7 million bales and the non-wool assets, repay the $2.7 billion debt and wind up the supplementary payments scheme. The Government has decided that the responsibility for the debt and the stockpile must remain with the industry. This is despite the Vines committee recommending a government responsibility for a debt contribution of $500m over the next two years, representing a 60 : 40 split between the Government and the industry, and that the Government be the ultimate guarantor of the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is to determine the combination of asset sales and sales from the stockpile in accordance with guidelines drawn up by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin). The new Wool Corporation is to promote and market wool, but not in a direct way, and to oversee quality control. We have not had the Bill in here more than a day and the first thing we get is a report querying the accountability by the Auditor-General. I believe that Senator Tambling will move amendments that will pick up those points. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been disclosed that the Minister can appoint external auditors instead of the Auditor-General without justifying the decision. We do not know what the extra costs for growers involved in this will be. We do not know why the Minister has made this extraordinary situation for those two bodies without any consultation with the Auditor-General, or with the industry, for that matter. It puts into doubt what other complications will arise from the Government rushing through this legislation only days before it has to start. </PARA>
<PARA> The other bodies set up by the Bills are the Australian Wool Industry Council and the Research and Development Corporation. The splitting of the AWC into three bodies is not supported by the industry, prominent businessmen or academics. It has always believed that to separate or divide is to conquer. All this is to be financed by a tax payable in the proportion of 0.5 per cent to the Wool Research and Development Corporation, 3.5 per cent to the Wool Corporation for promotional purposes and 11 per cent to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission for debt management. Our figures, which have been researched by a number of people, show that a figure of 6 per cent to the Wool Realisation Commission would be adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his second reading speech acknowledged the importance of the correct tax rate and the rate that growers can afford. The Minister then went on to say in his second reading speech that a 15 per cent wool tax meant that significant numbers of specialist woolgrowers would have no farm cash operating surplus in 1991-92. I do not know what he thinks woolgrowers will live on. Obviously he has not been out in the bush and he does not realise the plight of the woolgrowers there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister then made an amazing discovery. He said that, whether it was 12 per cent or 15 per cent, the rate would not affect growers. In practice, he said, the effect of the difference on farm cash operating could be measured in hundreds of dollars, not thousands. I hope he does his sums a bit better now that he is the Treasurer. This is where the 30 per cent of farmers who will be put out of business by a 15 per cent tax would strongly disagree with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me enunciate a few of the differences. On 5,000 sheep, $10,125 is paid on a 15 per cent levy against only $6,750 on a 10 per cent levy-a difference of $3,375. That is a considerable amount of money. It is particularly considerable when one is on a negative income and does not know where the next quid is coming from. That is only a small flock of sheep. When we get up to 10,000 sheep the difference is $7,000-$20,000 on a 15 per cent levy compared with $13,000 on a 10 per cent levy. It can be measured at $750 per one thousand sheep. The Minister then said that an extra 5 per cent tax would not affect incomes. That is an absurd statement. A 10 per cent tax is all that is needed in the new circumstances. Our proposed levy of 10 per cent divides into 0.5 per cent for research and development, 3.5 per cent for promotion and 6 per cent for debt reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many changes since the Government first formulated its plan and which the Government should now consider. Wool prices have risen above expectations. The Government based its calculations on 435c per kilogram and the coalition's 10 per cent tax is based on 450c per kilogram. I do not have today's wool price, but I think it has gone to 594c a kilogram, a rise of something like 14c within the previous couple of days. It is a rising market. Wool is being released from the stockpile. Dry weather and stock reduction schemes have reduced production. Latest wool production estimates for the next season from the Australian wool production forecasting committee show that production will be reduced to 881 million kilograms from 914 million kilograms which was the calculation used by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to the ACIL Australia Pty Ltd report. Senator West must have been using a different report. Perhaps the one I used supersedes hers. The ACIL report to the Wool Council said that the lower level of shorn wool production projected for 1991-92 provided the industry with the opportunity to sell wool from the stockpile, and to use the proceeds for such sales to supplement income from the wool tax. Interest rates have fallen, and the wool debt has been reduced to $2.63 billion, which is almost the level at which the Government expected the debt to be at the end of 1992-93. The Government has then provided another $200m interest free loan for two years, so the amount of the debt to be serviced amounts to $2.43 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The other key factor is the level of property sales. I can never see in business why one would sustain fairly significant property when one's constituents are going out the door backwards. </PARA>
<PARA> ACIL recommended asset sales of $40m in 1991-92. It further concluded that it is not to say that a lower tax would not be equally prudent if property sales could generate more than $40m in 1991-92 and that, therefore, the Opposition's policy to set the wool tax at 10 per cent in 1991-92 is a feasible alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> The asset sales and utilisation of the AWC reserves should take priority over putting more farmers out of business because of the high tax. The AWC reserves are calculated at $30m generally, $114m in the promotion fund and $56m in the research and development fund. The real estate assets are conservatively estimated at around $290m. For every $20m sale of non-wool assets, the tax can be lowered by one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It comes down to a simple equation: the sale of assets compared to the sale of farmers' assets. When it comes to that, there is really no decision left: it is in the interests of Australia that we maintain a viable wool industry. There are so many benefits arising out of that, and they must be obvious to everyone. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not often do this, but I appeal to the Australian Democrats because it is so bad out there. The 2 per cent difference between 12 per cent and 10 per cent may not seem much money, but in many instances it could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. It may be that 2 per cent that holds so many people into this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We have done our research in a number of ways through a number of people. The Wool Council supports the 10 per cent and believes it is viable. The coalition has run this 10 per cent figure through computers-ACIL has backed it up-and we believe that figure is not only sustainable but also absolutely necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> If next year that 10 per cent is not adequate, then maybe we can look at it again. But every indication would confirm that the price is rising; less wool is going on the market; and a higher demand for wool. In the next two years the industry will really have to sort itself out. It needs help now. It may be able to pay a little more later when it can afford to, but it certainly cannot afford to pay more than 10 per cent now. So it is up to the Australian Democrats as to which way they go. It will mean a great deal to the 65,000 woolgrowers if a levy of 10 per cent is carried. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill and allied Bills represent further inadequate attempts by this Hawke Labor Government to rectify its gross mismanagement of the wool industry and, indeed, of the economy in general. The legislation is a product of procrastination, indecision and bad judgment by this Government, by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and by industry leaders, which has resulted in the wool industry having to face its most serious crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bills that we are debating this evening are designed to ice the cake of the legislation that we debated in this chamber only four months ago, which did very little to secure the long term stability of the great Australian wool industry. At that time the Government claimed that it was waiting for the report of the Vines committee of inquiry into wool marketing before it would enter into any long term restructuring of the industry. The Government has now had that report for some time. In this legislation it has adopted some of the recommendations highlighted by that report, but it has not adopted the most important of the Vines committee recommendations-the one which will hit woolgrowers hardest-and that is, the level of the wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA> What is at stake and what is at the heart of this legislation is the very survival of a large number of woolgrowers. Make no mistake, what the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has claimed is a mere 5 per cent difference between a 15 per cent and a 10 per cent levy will be enough to ruin many woolgrowers. The difference runs into thousands of dollars for the majority of woolgrowers-not just a few hundred dollars, as the former Minister claimed in his second reading speech in the other place. For a farmer running 5,000 head of sheep with wool prices at 450c a kilogram clean, the difference between a 10 per cent and a 15 per cent tax is $3,500; for a flock of 10,000 sheep, it would be $7,000. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when farm operating cash surpluses have fallen by 89 per cent and are predicted to fall a further 111 per cent, which will mean a cash operating deficit of about $626 per sheep farmer, $3,500 could well mean the difference between survival and disaster for many farmers-the difference for many families between being able to put food on the table and not eating. If there was a comparative income decline among employees represented by some trade unions in this country, there would most certainly be massive industry upheaval and disruption within the entire country. I suspect, however, that the Government would move a lot quicker to ease the situation for its union mates than it has been doing for the farmers of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> What is unforgivable is the Government's stubborn persistence in sticking with the 15 per cent tax when the current figures demonstrate that a tax of 8 per cent to 10 per cent would be sufficient to repay the debt. I will illustrate what I mean. The coalition has undertaken detailed studies and very accurate calculations. As a result of that, we have calculated that the recent improvement in the wool market and lower interest rates have reduced the wool debt to about $2.63 billion. This is almost the amount the Government had expected the debt to be by the end of 1992-93 with a 15 per cent tax. Taking into account the Government's $200m two-year interest-free loan, the amount of the loan to be serviced comes down to $2.43 billion. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables which illustrate the calculations the coalition has made on this matter. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our calculations are based on some very conservative assumptions of long term borrowing rates, wool prices, industry costings and stockpile releases. We have allowed for the fact that supply has fallen below the 900 million kilogram a year figure that the Vines Committee deemed to be the optimum amount to maintain prices. This will enable a greater amount of wool to be released from the stockpile-our figures assume 25 million kilograms for next year-and makes a flock reduction scheme unnecessary in the immediate future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition maintained for some time that a vigorous flock reduction scheme should be in place to reduce supply and allow room for the stockpile to be sold off in an orderly and predictable fashion. Indeed, the former Minister agreed with us and commenced a flock reduction scheme which eliminated 11 million sheep before it was abruptly terminated. </PARA>
<PARA> In reply to my question in Senate Estimates Committee F a month or so ago, as to why the sheep slaughter scheme had been terminated without the review the Minister had promised earlier, officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Australian Wool Corporation admitted that no proper economic analysis of the effectiveness of the scheme had been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, in its report to the Senate, Estimates Committee F expressed the view that the Department and its associated agencies should conduct such an analysis in order to ascertain the value of any future use of the flock reduction scheme. If the flock reduction scheme had been continued, as the coalition urged it should be, then more of the stockpile could have been released and the amount of debt and consequently the levy could have been even further reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> We have assumed in our calculations that the Wool Corporation can borrow for a little less than 11 per cent on the long term bond market. It would be far better for the Wool Corporation to borrow to cover the debt at these rates than for woolgrowers to have to borrow at the much higher current rates of 16 to 18 per cent, or even up to 20 per cent, applying to them, in order to pay a tax of 15 per cent. After much careful consideration and consultation, we have based our figures on operating and storage costs of about $45m per year; promotion expenditure of $187m in 1991-92; and research and development costs of $54m. We have used the lowest estimate given by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics for the average price of wool next year at 447c per kilogram clean. The current prediction for the average wool price for next year is 450c per kilogram clean. So it is obvious that our calculations are indeed erring on the side of caution. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition also believes that the sale of the Wool Corporation's non-wool assets is vital for keeping down the tax level. We believe that it is quite reasonable to anticipate that we can sell $120m worth of assets in each of the next two years, even with the current depressed economy. If we do not sell off the Wool Corporation's non-wool assets we will have to sell off the farmers' assets for next to nothing, and then there will be no hope of ever paying off the debt. It is totally foolish to suggest that the Wool Corporation should hold on to assets such as empty wool stores while the woolgrowers are forced to sell off their assets from which they earn their very livelihood. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is not alone in believing that the 15 per cent tax is too high. The Vines committee report confirmed that woolgrowers could not afford to pay a tax of more than 12 per cent. The Wool Corporation recommended a levy of 12 to 13 per cent, and that was before the price of wool improved to the extent it has. The consulting firm ACIL Australia Pty Ltd has calculated that it is possible to pay off the debt with a wool tax of only 8 per cent over seven years. In that regard I simply have to take issue with the remarks earlier in this debate by Labor Senator West. She completely misrepresented and misinterpreted the comments in the ACIL report. It is worth quoting again the statement the honourable senator made, which came from the ACIL report, and then showing the way in which it was misrepresented. The ACIL report is entitled Financing the Wool Industry's Debt. Clause 3.11 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>In summary, justifiable variation to the assumptions likely to have been used by the Government mean that no change to the wool tax is required for 1991-92. Some changes-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, since March-</PARA>
<PARA>work to reduce the rate of tax while others work in the opposite direction. Overall, the changes amount to a difference of less than 0.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the quote Senator West read to the Senate. Of course, what she ignored was the following passage from this report:</PARA>
<PARA>To reduce the rate of tax below 15 per cent in 1991-92 would require a combination of deferring the payment of $20 million debt-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator West talks about economists' assumptions, but she has not told us exactly what the Government's assumptions are. One would assume that the Government relied on some economic advice for its assumptions. The fact is that those assumptions were made some time ago and circumstances have changed significantly and, indeed, favourably for the wool industry since that time. So if any assumptions are to be questioned, it is undoubtedly the Government's assumptions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier in this report the ACIL consultants quite clearly conclude and spell out that a tax of less than 15 per cent is quite a viable option to pursue. I simply refer to issues which are raised in this report under the heading in paragraph 1.2- `Is the 15 per cent tax necessary'-whereby ACIL, the author of this report, which Senator West has quoted, concludes that a 15 per cent tax is not necessary. On page 1 it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Since the Minister's announcement of the repayment arrangements, a number of events have occurred, leading to the possibility that forecasts made at the time of the Government's decision might already be outdated. </PARA>
<PARA>Just as I said a few moments ago. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>For example, in recent weeks the wool market has been more buoyant than most observers had expected. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Higher prices have resulted in larger wool tax collections than budgeted and a faster rate of debt retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier in my remarks, the rate of debt retirement now required is lower than that which was assumed by the Government when it made the decision to impose a 15 per cent tax. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, there has been increasing discussion and anecdotal evidence that the rate of rundown in sheep numbers and the size of the clip might be more rapid than assumed by current official estimates, hence the possibility of a faster reduction in AWC stocks and, consequently, a lower debt servicing cost and wool tax necessary to cover it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, it would not hurt the Minister to listen to this very wise comment from this ACIL report, which Senator West quoted in support of the Government's position when the whole basis of the report and the conclusions of the report are that a 15 per cent tax is quite simply not necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we proceed further with this ACIL report we will see spelt out very clearly in graph 4.3 that a 15 per cent tax is not necessary and that with prices at 495c a kilogram clean a tax of 8 per cent-again, I wish that Senator West would listen to what I am saying-would quite adequately pay off the debt in some six years. Wool is currently selling at almost 100c per kilogram above that 495c a kilogram clean to which this graph refers. There can be no doubt that a tax of 8 per cent is adequate and a maximum tax of 10 per cent, which the Opposition has suggested would be appropriate, leaves a very healthy and adequate margin for any changes in conditions and changes in assumptions which might later take place. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to remember that even the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, implied in February that the tax would be only 12 per cent. The former Minister, who has supported a tax of 15 per cent in this legislation, acknowledged even at that time, before the more favourable circumstances developed, that a tax of 12 per cent would be adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all of this and all of the subsequent favourable events, Mr Kerin ignored the advice, changed his mind and said, without supporting evidence:</PARA>
<PARA>We cannot take the risk of having a tax any less than 15 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Walters and Senator Watson acknowledge that in support. If that happens, it will leave fewer woolgrowers and consequently a lesser amount of tax revenue with which to pay off the wool debt. That will mean that either the repayment term will have to be lengthened or the tax will have to be increased further. Where will that all end? We will simply have a diminishing spiral of woolgrowers paying an ever-increasing rate of tax to pay off this debt. It will result in a vicious spiral in which all players-the growers, the industry and eventually all Australians-will lose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite incomprehensible that this Government can contemplate imposing a level of tax that would in effect totally wreck Australia's greatest export industry, an industry which is the backbone of this country's economy. Already entire communities and towns have been devastated by the crisis in rural Australia and the effects are flowing on to every sector of the economy. The metropolitan areas of Australia are now starting to feel the effects of this disastrous rural recession and they will certainly feel it more as the months go by. The human element-the personal tragedy-in all of this is incalculable. We already have far too many instances of farming families losing their homes and everything they have worked for all their lives and of family breakdowns and children unable to cope with these pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> Not one honourable senator in this chamber would not have been approached by rural people desperate for some assistance and compassion, although perhaps Senator West is the exception. In my State of South Australia rural organisations such as the United Farmers and Stock Owners and the Country Women's Association have made repeated pleas to the Federal and State Labor governments for additional emergency funding for farmers and small business owners, many of whom are unable to qualify for regular social security benefits because of assets restrictions. However, assets do not put food on the table nor do they put shoes on children's feet. Some families have been forced to turn to churches and similar organisations for assistance to pay grocery bills. Others succumb to the frustrations and pressures caused by the economic situation, and there are reports of increasing levels of suicide, attempted suicide, domestic violence, abortion and stress-related illnesses in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA> It often falls to women to keep the family together but they are finding this harder to do as their traditional community support groups break down. Their sense of isolation and despair grows with the realisation that there is no immediate way out of the mess and that the Government simply does not seem to care. Mismanagement by this Labor Government has sent much of Australia to the wall, yet it remains steadfast and seemingly unwilling to face up to the drastically worsening situation. The mismanagement crisis in the Labor camp continues unabated, with individuals fighting over the spoils of leadership like dogs over a bone, insensitive to the hurt and suffering which is the reality out there in the community and which continues to deteriorate daily. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills are the major cause of concern for the coalition-and indeed for the woolgrowers-other issues in this legislation package also deserve comment. First, there is the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill, that establishes the Commission, which is to take over the debt of $2.63 billion and a stockpile of about 4.4 million bales of wool. The Commission will be given seven years in which to discharge the debt and dispose of the stockpile and other assets, using what it considers to be the best mix of sales of non-wool assets and wool from the stockpile. As I have already mentioned, the Government has provided a two-year interest-free loan of $200m against future asset sales and has set a very modest target of $20m debt reduction in the first year. I have already highlighted that with recent improvements in the wool market and lower interest rates that target has almost been reached before the scheme has started. The coalition questions whether we really need the Wool Realisation Commission at all. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will in fact mean that there will be no fewer than five institutions all concerned with administering the wool industry. They are the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, the International Wool Secretariat, the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation and the Wool Industry Council. Why do we need all these different empires? They will presumably each have boards of directors and administrative support staff, the funding of which will require a substantial percentage of the woolgrowers' tax, leaving less to pay off the debt. Such costs will be astronomical and one wonders how efficient each will be, how much responsibility will overlap the organisations and, indeed, how much empire building and self-interest inherent in such bureaucracies will emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned that having a body discrete from the Australian Wool Corporation will create uncertainty and instability in the wool industry. Another concern of ours, and, not surprisingly, a concern of the Australian Wool Council, is the lack of legislative requirement for any of these bodies to consult with the Wool Council. Considering that the woolgrowers are funding the entire operation, it is only proper that their representative body be consulted and kept advised of all actions and decisions undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Wool Realisation Commission, the Wool Council is concerned that the charter the Commission has been given to discharge the debt over the shortest possible time may not be in the best interests of the wool industry or the nation. Once the debt has been repaid and the Commission is wound up, the legislation as it currently stands does not specify that any surplus funds should be returned either to the contributors or to the industry in general. Rather, the wording of the legislation is such that the Minister can distribute any surplus funds outside the wool industry. It would seem that these institutions are being given an enormous amount of responsibility and autonomy with precious little accountability to the very people for whom they are supposed to be working. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition would also like to see an Industry Commission inquiry instituted to investigate the levels and methods of wool promotion and wool marketing, to ensure that the woolgrowers' contribution is being used effectively. There is much evidence that this has not always happened. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot just simply sit and wait for buyers to come to the market; we have to create a demand for wool. When demand outstripped supply and the price of wool soared to 1100c a kilogram back in 1988, manufacturers turned to other cheaper fibres. We not only have to attract those markets back but also have to create alternative ones and find innovative ways of using wool fibres. Let us not forget, however, that it is this Labor Government which is responsible for getting the wool industry into the mess it is in now. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Government has refused to acknowledge that the industry was in trouble back in 1989. I recall the cavalier way in which the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, reacted to the warning I gave in August of that same year of the growing stockpile of wool being purchased by the Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The grassroots growers in my own State of South Australia are entirely dissatisfied with the past performance of the wool industry statutory organisations. Many of these growers want all the old bureaucracy of the wool industry to be thrown out and they do not want any statutory government bodies running anything. They would rather see the wool industry regulating itself, with only a small statutory body to execute particular tasks, such as contracting for research and development, promotion and statistical investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Many South Australian growers are adamant that they cannot afford this proposed bureaucratic structure provided for in this legislation and they have indicated a willingness to pay a 3 per cent tax for a period of seven years, or until such time as the stockpile is disposed of, whichever is the earlier. These growers' sentiments may be unrealistic on the low side, just as the Government's requirement for a 15 per cent tax is quite unrealistic on the high side. But they are a reflection of general grower reaction across Australia and a reaction to being made responsible for a debt which in many respects was not of their making. But it will not help at this stage to throw recriminations around. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that a delicate balance must be struck to eliminate both the stockpile and the debt in the briefest possible time without bankrupting the producers and the Australian economy in the process. That is why the coalition is firm in its belief that 10 per cent is the maximum viable tax that woolgrowers can afford and which should be levied through this legislation, coupled with an option to further reduce the flock with a slaughter scheme, if that becomes necessary in the future. That is why we have moved significant second reading amendments which I strongly support and urge the Senate to adopt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rather than repeat the arguments of the previous nine speakers, at this point I will refer to some of those arguments and attempt to shed a different light on this debate. To begin with, I must say something with regard to Senator Panizza's contribution. I am disappointed he is not in the chamber to hear this because he very seldom receives congratulations from me for bringing something which I think is perfectly accurate to our attention; more often I am in the position of disagreeing with the honourable senator's contributions. But in this case I think it is the first time I have heard somebody actually go public with a list of those people to whom we can ascribe responsibility for this mess in which we now find ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Panizza's list was broad and comprehensive. He included the existing Government-I was disappointed that he did not include previous governments, but I will forgive him for that. He also apportioned some of the blame to the Australian Wool Corporation, the Wool Council of Australia, the banks and the greedy new producers, as he described them-those who had expanded into production in which they had previously not been involved. He also included-and I think wisely so-the greedy stud breeders who took advantage of the demand for extra wool production. He included the Australian Taxation Office, which I thought was most observant of him. The only thing that disappointed me about Senator Panizza's list was the fact that he did not include politicians. I ask the rhetorical question: are we to blame?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He only selectively included them. I suggest that we are all to blame and I suggest that we should put ourselves at the top of the list rather than being an errant last minute inclusion. However, in saying that, I will go on to consider some of the history of this matter. I was surprised that some of the previous speakers did not start their contributions with what I see as being essential to the situation now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not go back to where Senator Archer was-and I appreciated his short lesson about the beginnings of the industry in Tasmania in which his family has honourably and proudly been involved. The recent history is that the Vines committee report recommended earlier this year that a 12 per cent wool tax was necessary to manage the debt and stockpile and that a Government injection of $250m for each of two years was necessary to sustain that position. That second component of the Vines committee's recommendations has lost emphasis in many of the contributions we have heard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government refused to provide that injection. Therefore, in April the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, announced that 15 per cent would be necessary because the Treasury would not move to provide that additional push start in order to reduce the debt overhead and bring it into a manageable state. Of course, it was disappointing for all of those people involved in the wool industry to hear that announcement. As soon as the Australian Democrats became aware of that announcement, I challenged it, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, suggesting that Vines's recommendations had a solid basis for investigation and should be reconsidered by the Minister. But there was no reconsideration. The Government then had the temerity to appoint Vines as the Chairman of the Australian Wool Industry Council, having rejected the two key recommendations contained in his report. What an insult!</PARA>
<PARA> Since Vines's rejected recommendations, we have seen the sorts of developments indicated by Senator Crane. He was perfectly accurate and I think his omission was certainly by mistake and not by design. Senator Crane included in his list the fact that the beginning debt will be lower than anticipated by previous commentators, that there are lower interest rates applying to that debt, and that there is lower production. I know that it was by accident that Senator Crane did not include in that list the fact that there are increased average prices. I know that he is well aware of that fact, and that fact has been brought to bear on the situation since the Vines committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments lead, I believe, to the position that 12 per cent can be sustained without the $500m injection that was originally proposed by the Vines committee. That is the position of the Australian Democrats. Recent developments have reinforced it, but the Government has not budged from its original position taken at the end of April by Minister Kerin who suggested that 15 per cent would be required. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has improved on the Vines figures. The improvement has been that the Vines figure of $500m has been countervailed, counteracted or counterbalanced-whichever expression is most appropriate, but I think it has been counterbalanced-by those developments and the $500m, the second component, is the component which is not now required to substantiate 12 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made the statement just now that the Government did not budge, and I ask the question: what position did the coalition take? I quote from a press release issued by the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Bruce Lloyd, the Deputy Leader of the National Party. It is headed:</PARA>
<PARA>Opposition cannot alter wool tax legislation to 12 per cent</PARA>
<PARA>The first paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Coalition does not have the power to alter a tax bill and therefore will not be able to meet any demands from the wool industry to reduce the wool levy, according to National Party Deputy Leader . . . Shadow Minister . . . Bruce Lloyd. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The amount of levy that growers had to pay would depend on the amount of wool taken out of production and how much growers wanted to pay off the principal debt. </PARA>
<PARA>Then there is the other key, the key common element so often seen in coalition policy in this regard:</PARA>
<PARA>If 20 million sheep were slaughtered, growers could have a levy of 10 per cent and still pay the $120 million they received for the sale of assets off the debt. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walters" NAMEID="UJ4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is old. I agree with that. I am asking: what position did the coalition take? This press release is dated 1 May 1991. The reason I have read it is not to glory in how old it is but to ask what was the position that the coalition took at that time. I will develop this as I go along. I will not selectively quote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the next position taken by the coalition I will quote from Hansard of 4 June 1991, page 4679, where Mr Lloyd was speaking in the debate on the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill. Towards the end of that speech Mr Lloyd was granted leave to incorporate tables in Hansard, and I quote from those tables, not from his speech. These are tables which Senator Panizza and, I think, Senator Crane invited us to examine as containing figures which justified their position. The very first figure in that table shows the Australian Wool Corporation debt as $2.63 billion. The note to that states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's interest free loan of $200m to the AWC effectively means the AWC only has to service $2.43 billion of debt. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote that because that $200m is not available to be used to reduce the debt from the beginning. Logic also tells us that if it is used in that way it remains a debt. If it is a loan to the Australian Wool Corporation, and if it is used immediately, it remains a debt. The sum of $200m is still owed. The notion that the Wool Corporation debt can be immediately reduced by $200m by using that is a pure fallacy. That is why I am very wary of using those sorts of figures--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will listen to Senator Walters. I would like Senator Walters to explain to me, by way of interjection, how on earth I can misunderstand that. I will take a note from her, because I am very serious about this. I am not playing politics; I am playing it straight down the line. That $200m is not available to reduce the debt. Those sorts of misunderstandings make it very difficult for us to attach any credibility to the figures that follow, because the figures that follow from that very first figure are all predicated upon it. We have other figures. I have been shown spreadsheets, tallies, betting slips, all attempting to justify tax rates of everything from zero per cent to 30 per cent, covering payment periods from three years to 10 years, and suggested debt obligations from $3.5 billion to total debt write-off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ACIL report has been referred to often in this debate-and there have been many different versions. The report to which I refer was published and sent to us on 7 June. I presume it is the same one referred to by Senator West. I found a different interpretation from that of Senator West. I acknowledge that Senator Chapman quoted thoroughly from the report, but I gained another interpretation from the same report. On the overview page, numbered (i), the first column states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's analysis, based on information then available, has been demonstrated to imply a 15 per cent wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA>I will continue in the same vein that has been canvassed by all coalition speakers:</PARA>
<PARA>Recent developments-such as the release of 100,000 bales of AWC stock for sale prior to 30 June and higher than expected wool prices at auction-improve the tax arithmetic. </PARA>
<PARA>There is further discussion on that point. Then there is a discussion of varying key assumptions:</PARA>
<PARA>* assuming that wool production in 1991/92 reduces at a more rapid rate than expected;</PARA>
<PARA>* assuming higher wool prices;</PARA>
<PARA>* capitalising the first year's interest into the overall debt level;</PARA>
<PARA>* focussing on keeping within the outstanding debt schedule as against meeting minimum debt repayments;</PARA>
<PARA>* assuming some wool stockpile sales do occur in 1991-92; and</PARA>
<PARA>* re-introducing a flock reduction scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion is that scope exists to lower the rate of tax in 1991-92 if future revisions in projected wool production show a marked fall; trade clearances are able to be sustained and some stocks sold in 1991-92 or wool prices rise. A central element in this analysis is expected wool production in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> It is demonstrated that if wool production falls to 885 mkg or less in 1991-92, with assumptions on price and trade clearances holding and using a conservative $40m from the sale of assets, then the wool tax can be reduced to 12 per cent in 1991-92. At this rate the Government's debt repayment can be met. </PARA>
<PARA>I quoted extensively because nearly every sentence I read contained a qualifier such as `if' or `can' or `may'. That is the basis on which we are proceeding: there are many qualifiers in all the assumptions. Even the word `assumption' is one we should not gloss over lightly. We should not base too much upon it. Here we are dealing with the future of Australia's huge wool industry. It is not something to be based on assumptions; it is something that should be based on concrete. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as reading that sort of information, the information and the input which I have received-and I have no doubt that other senators have received similar information-is that we have been contacted by those involved in the industry. I would like to read a selection of the information which has been provided to me. I will proceed as quickly as I can through some of them. They come from throughout Australia. I received from Ravensthorpe, Western Australia, a note which says:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA>I produce 220 bales of wool. I pay no Federal income tax. The difference between 10 per cent and 15 per cent wool tax is six months' living expenses . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Another letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing to you in an attempt to get you and your Party to reconsider your stance on the tax levels to be legislated on in the proposed Wool Bills that come before the Parliament shortly. </PARA>
<PARA>A letter from the Shire of Kellerberrin says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Council of the Shire . . . encourages you to support the coalition in its efforts to have the maximum of 15 per cent tax on the Wool Industry reduced to 10 per cent as it believes that the Industry could only stand a 10 per cent impost at this stage . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I have another from Cranbrook, Western Australia. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . we urge you to do all you can to ensure that the wool tax is abolished.</PARA>
<PARA>We cannot continue to pay indirect tax through sales tax and fuel taxes, plus direct taxation, as well as a wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA>A heavy tax has already been paid on the wool in the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA>A letter from Esperance says:</PARA>
<PARA>As a woolgrower I implore you to do everything in your power to have the proposed wool tax of 15 per cent amended to as low a figure as is sustainable for the wool industry . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the fact that the Vines Committee recommended a wool tax of 12 per cent and the final AWC debt is going to be considerably less than was predicted when that report was handed down coupled with the fact that interest rates are now lower it would seem to me that a maximum tax of 12 per cent or less would be easily sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA>A letter from the Blackall branch of the Central and Northern Graziers Association states that it held a meeting on 17 May 1981 and that a resolution was passed. I will quote it only in part:</PARA>
<PARA>``That we write to relevant Federal politicians and register our strong support for a wool levy of 12 per cent or less and definitely not 15 per cent''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Western Australian Farmers Federation writes:</PARA>
<PARA>The Western Australian Farmers Federation has previously advised you of its opposition to the Government's proposal to set the wool tax . . . at 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>We have argued for some time that a range of factors are now moving in favour of the wool industry and warrant the implementation of a lower tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Wool Council has written to me saying:</PARA>
<PARA>``The Government's plan for a wool tax of 15 per cent for the next 7 years will ruin a large core of specialist woolgrowers unless prices recover markedly. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>``Woolgrowers are focusing on net returns for survival and the proposed tax rate of 15 per cent is in excess of the 12 per cent figure the Minister promoted when he suspended the Reserve Price Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a letter from the Branch President of the Apsley branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>The eighty members of the Apsley VFF overwhelmingly support a wool tax significantly below 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Many district farmers are in severe financial difficulty, some already receiving welfare benefits . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Note `receiving welfare benefits'. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore we strongly argue against the unnecessarily high rate of tax proposed and urge you to do your absolute utmost . . .</PARA>
<PARA>These notes and letters are innumerable in their mass and embarrassing in their content. It seems that they are from people who are desperate to get their opinion across and most concerned that at least somebody should listen to them. A plethora of journalists have opined on this matter. Most of them have been more concerned with the politics of the matter than with the facts, which should be guiding our political decisions. But I do respect the report on page 5 of today's New South Wales Farmers Association News by that organisation's Executive Officer, Howard Moxham. In part, Howard Moxham refers to the fact that, because of increased prices, the 25 per cent tax which is still applicable has accumulated funds more rapidly than expected, allowing the Corporation to clear approximately $310m of debt by 30 June, 1991. Here is a fact which I am sure the coalition and the Government will both find interesting: `This means that we will be opening the 1991-92 season with an accumulated debt of $2.57m as opposed to the previous $2.88m'. I respect that figure and the justification behind it more than I respect the estimate that was given in the speech I previously quoted from the lower House. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me assure those who are interested in this debate, those who are listening and those who will read about it subsequently, that the Australian Democrats have listened to all who have presented their facts, opinions and ideas to us. We have had to call in volunteers. Several volunteers in the last week have been operating from the offices of Democrat senators just to handle the extra load. We welcome the input; that is why we asked extra people to come in to help us with that. </PARA>
<PARA> I doubt whether Australia's woolgrowers could have done any more to try to bring their information to us. We have received, as I know other senators have, deputations in person, phone calls, faxes and letters. Any other means of conveying information to us has been taken advantage of. No other issue I have been associated with inside or outside politics has excited such a cross-section of input. It has not been exclusively directed at presenting what I think might be either form letters or suggestions made by members of the coalition; it has simply not had that sort of input. Input has been initiated and generated for all sorts of reasons. I respect people who have responded for whatever reason. </PARA>
<PARA> Even so, I still believe that the Government cannot justify its intransigence. So much has changed, I am amazed that no movement has been suggested by the Government. Similarly, I believe that the fundamental flaws made at the beginning of the calculations that were generated by the coalition present an overly optimistic case for the 10 per cent tax. That does frighten me. I believe that the only description for it is a gamble. My optimism is attached to the future of the wool industry and the belief that increased effort given to marketing and sales, especially internationally, will guarantee the future of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Information from Europe which was gleaned last week was given to me only last night. It suggests that European markets will be eager to buy our wool this year and next and that we will have, as has been expressed in some of the other contributions, a viable, vital industry in the future. But we must not saddle that very industry with either the Government's bludgeoning 15 per cent tax, which will kill the industry, or the coalition's risky 10 per cent, which might allow the debt to grow unmanageably. Therefore, we will propose at the committee stage an amendment to introduce a tax level of 12 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening the Senate is debating a package of wool Bills and I wish to make some comments on them. We have heard many honourable senators make excellent contributions to the debate this evening. As a National Party senator from Queensland, I have the honour of representing many Queensland woolgrowers in this place. I know of the parlous financial state in which many of those people find themselves at present. Some of their problems are due not only in part to their industry organisations but also to the many tax burdens placed on them by this Government, including the 25 per cent tax originally imposed by the Hawke Labor Government, about which we complained bitterly. Now it is proposing a 15 per cent tax, never taking into account how hard it will be for so many wool producers to meet a 15 per cent tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The wool industry over time has provided much of our export earnings. Until the troubles of recent years it had been Australia's greatest earner of export dollars. Currently, woolgrowers are facing a future of enormously depressed financial circumstances and they want and need proper assistance before they are irrevocably destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a particular obligation to help woolgrowers when one reads of the history of this crisis in the past few years. In light of that history, it is astonishing to read in the second reading speech of the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on this legislation:</PARA>
<PARA>It is now a new era. The recriminations and disappointments of the past 18 months should remain in the past, and all efforts and energy should be devoted to building a revitalised and sustainable industry. </PARA>
<PARA>If ever there was a case of trying to dissociate oneself from some of the blame for what has happened, the Minister was surely trying to do just that. The origins of this crisis can be traced back to 1987 with the introduction of the Wool Marketing Bill when, in the second reading speech, the then Minister for Science said:</PARA>
<PARA>First, the Bill seeks to place the Australian Wool Corporation on a sound commercial footing so that it is equipped to respond now and into the future to the pressures of the market-place. Secondly, the Bill is designed to introduce appropriate arrangements to ensure that the Corporation is fully accountable to industry and government without disturbing its commercial performance. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words, I am sure, must come back to haunt the Minister because, no matter how hard he tried to achieve that, he in fact failed, and failed dismally. Until recently, the industry managed to operate a market scheme, a reserve price scheme, very effectively. For 20 years the Australian wool industry benefited from unprecedented price stability. Yet the Government decided to intervene, purely because it was unhappy that money was not going quickly enough into the Treasury coffers to assist Australia's enormous balance of payments problems. </PARA>
<PARA> As I told the Senate last year in a number of debates on this issue, nowhere had it been demonstrated, as distinct from asserted, that were the offer price for Australian wool to be lowered there would be any kind of direct and significant demand response. Further, and more importantly, it had not been shown that any such response would ensure that gross income to the industry would increase or even be maintained. Our current wool stockpile is a testament to those predictions. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that interference by the Government would only ruin the reserve price scheme and ravage future orderly wool marketing. Yet in June last year the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>If there is one central message I want to convey to you today, it is the commitment of the Australian industry and the Australian Government to stand behind the decision to lower the floor price and to work to overcome the problems we confront. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to give a cast-iron guarantee that the Government would never again lower the floor price. But the Minister went and did that again in July. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government will not contemplate under any circumstances a further downward movement of the floor price. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet a few months later he acted to lower the floor price. This is just one of numerous actions for which the Government does have to be held responsible. The sad situation is that this has been a lesson for the Government, an experiment which has impacted adversely on the livelihoods of many farmers. The Government may have wanted to make the industry more commercial; it may have wanted to allow the industry to have more say; but in fact right now it has achieved the exact opposite where the industry, more than ever, has been at the mercy of government. That is probably why some of the solutions being proposed today are being imposed by a government which is really showing very little sensitivity to the problems facing individual growers. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the actual legislation, a package of nine Bills that relate to new administrative and management structures and the imposition of a wool tax at the rate of 15 per cent. My major concern with this package is with the level of the levy and the options available to manage the $2.7 billion debt and the 4.7 million bale stockpile held by the Australian Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, once again, as has been the practice over the past few years with the Government in relation to wool, we are debating legislation in the final days of a parliamentary sitting when the legislation has to be in operation by 1 July. It is a most unsatisfactory situation for this most important industry. It comes at a time of great difficulty for people engaged in the industry. All farmers are facing the worst situation since the Depression of the 1930s, and for woolgrowers the worst is still to come. </PARA>
<PARA> To give some indication of projections concerning woolgrowers' income, I want to cite some figures from the Agriculture and Resources Quarterly of March. Those figures are already out of date. When one looks at the farm cash operating surplus for the sheep industry one sees that in 1989-90 there was a cash operating surplus of $50,407 per sheep farmer; in 1990-91-the year just ending-it was down to $5,724, a reduction of 89 per cent; and for next year, 1991-92, the projection is a negative figure of minus $626, a further fall by 111 per cent. I am sure that as a woolgrower Senator Panizza would not be very happy with those figures because they are frightening statistics. They show the impact of what is still to come for the woolgrowers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This very grave financial situation confronting our woolgrowers emphasises the crucial part of all the Bills before us, that is, the tax level or the levy and the impact that a higher than necessary levy rate can have on thousands of woolgrowers. It can force them off the land by fire sales of their properties. After that, there will be fewer growers to pay out the stockpile debt for the remaining years, with even more pressure on those still remaining. </PARA>
<PARA> Large numbers of woolgrowers will have no farm cash operating surpluses in 1991-92. The report of the Vines committee of inquiry into wool marketing recommended a 12 per cent levy, acknowledging that the industry could not cope with a higher levy. Of course, Mr Kerin mislead the growers again when he wrote a letter to all woolgrowers in February implying that the tax would be 12 per cent, which he repeated on a number of occasions. He must have been tarred with the same brush as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who on so many occasions is able to change his mind like he changes his clothes and tell stories that are not true. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation discards those views and has set the tax at 15 per cent. It seems that the former Minister has managed to avoid facing up to his responsibilities since he made that announcement in February. In contrast, the proposal that the coalition has developed for a 10 per cent levy offers flexibility in its detailed analysis. It is credible and will give a lift to the level of confidence of rural communities suffering during this time of national economic depression. It also means considerable savings. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the former Minister's view that there is little difference between a 15 per cent levy and a lower tax, he is clearly wrong. A producer with 5,000 sheep, selling wool at 450c, would pay $10,125 with a 15 per cent tax levy, and $6,750 with a 10 per cent levy. With 10,000 sheep a grower would pay $20,250 with a 15 per cent levy, and $13,500 with a 10 per cent levy. Given that the industry is forecast to have negative incomes in the next season, these figures are obviously very important. They are not insignificant if someone has a negative income. They are stark figures. They may well provide the difference between maintaining viability and being able to keep children at school, which I believe is a very important matter to think about. </PARA>
<PARA> Our proposal also has the advantage of applying some discipline on the Australian Wool Corporation and its successor bodies. Also, and most significantly, it does not force growers to go further into debt to try to prop up the Corporation when clearly the Corporation can borrow at a considerably lower rate than individual growers. It is a very responsible position. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation effectively removes the 30 per cent tax on a 700c floor that has become part of the wool scheme following the abandonment of the floor price last year. As we have heard from all other speakers, the proposal from the Government is that woolgrowers around Australia should now be saddled with a 15 per cent tax. This tax could and should be lowered to 10 per cent. Once again, I ask the Government to check the figures, as everybody else in the industry has, and acknowledge that a far lower figure is credible, sustainable and sensible at this time for the future of the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating the nine wool Bills-the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill, the Australian Wool Corporation Bill, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill, the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills and the Australian Wool Industry Council Bill-eight of which were introduced by the Government into the House of Representatives and gagged through that House just a fortnight ago. It is because the Government has treated these Bills and the House of Representatives with such disdain that tonight the Opposition has to bring forward so many amendments to right the Government's shoddy legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's aim in this package of Bills is to make sure that, come hell or high water, the Government is not left with one cent to pay out of the debt incurred by its bungling and mishandling of the wool crisis. We all remember the international and domestic promises that were made by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy that the floor price would remain, and then that it would be 700c and remain at that. But we are used to the Government repeatedly telling lies. The Government has decided to set the wool levy at 15 per cent. It has done that to ensure that the debt is paid as quickly as possible, but the levy is so high that it will be the last straw that breaks the camel's back-the back of many woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the situation our woolgrowers are facing. I hope Senator West particularly will pay attention because her speech did not take any of this into consideration. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is meant to be taking this Bill, will also take notice. According to the Agriculture and Resources Quarterly for March-we know the new figures are coming out next week-the average farm cash operating surplus for the sheep industry in 1989-90 was $50,407. That is not profit; that is an exemption of the operator's wage or salary and any capital expenditure. In 1990-91 that figure dropped by 89 per cent and came down to $5,724. In 1991-92 it is expected to drop by 111 per cent and will be a minus figure-minus $626-with neither the operator nor his family drawing a salary and with no capital expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that is a very frightening prospect for all woolgrowers. Imagine what would happen if the waterfront unions were asked to drop a cent. Waterfront workers are on strike already because they are all getting a $12 increase, with a productivity allowance of 6 per cent. They are all on strike over that, not over a 111 per cent drop in their cash operating surplus. It is absolutely frightening. But it extends further because the country towns and the small businesses in those country towns will feel the crisis as the year goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a drought covering a lot of the continent, and on my island, Tasmania, it has been a disaster. Our Tasmanian farmers are presently paying $185 a tonne, plus cartage, for wheat to feed their sheep. That, plus the higher interest rates, means that in Tasmania the whole of the wool industry is a disaster. The average specialist woolgrower has 3,625 sheep to a property. What chance does the one-family farm have if the Government insists upon its 15 per cent levy? Is the Government's purpose to get rid of those one-family farms? Is it to make farmers sell up and have fire sales at their properties? It would certainly appear so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has consistently pushed the Government to lower that levy from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. There is no need for that higher figure. Our figures have never been queried. The Government has tried to fault them repeatedly. It has gone through them with a fine tooth-comb, but it has not found one error. We may have made some general assumptions on factual knowledge, and I will mention a few of them. We know that the Wool Corporation debt is $2.63 billion. This is where Senator Bell has become confused as regards the debt and the $200m that the Government has given interest free to bring that debt down to $2.43 billion for servicing purposes. There is no difference between that and what the Government actually intends to do; that is, to pay the servicing debt-the difference between the $2.63 billion and the $2.43 billion-which amounts to $22m each year for two years. I seek leave to have two pages incorporated in Hansard. I showed them to Senator Ray when he was in the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. As I say, our figures have never been queried and, given the background statistics and the general assumptions put forward, we know that our figure of 10 per cent is a very conservative one. Indeed, it comes down to 9.1 per cent because we have an additional comfort zone, if one cares to call it that, of 0.9 per cent, making the levy a total of 10 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The table covers two other scenarios. The first is with a slight increase in price. That increase was from 447c a kilogram. We say, maybe it will bring 475c a kilogram-still with the same long term interest rate of 10.75 per cent which the Wool Corporation can certainly get. With that scenario, the levy could be down as far as 8.7 per cent. But, if one takes account of the falling interest rates, and should the interest rate come down to 9.75 per cent and we go back to the very conservative price of 447c a kilogram clean, we could bring the levy down to 8.2 per cent. The table is now incorporated in Hansard and the situation will be clarified for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister in the other place has said that the difference between the 15 per cent tax and the 10 per cent tax was just `a few hundred dollars'. That is an extraordinary statement for the Minister to make because it is not accurate. We know-and it has been quoted today in this debate-that at 500c clean a kilogram, with a farm of 5,000 sheep, the tax is $11,250 at 15 per cent and $7,500 at 10 per cent, a difference of $3,750 or $72 a week. That is not much to the Minister or Senator West. They should go and tell the farmers that they do not need that $3,750 when, according to the estimate we have, their farm operating surplus is a minus figure of $626. They should go out and tell the farmers that they do not need that $3,750. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has included in its figures-and this was a controversial issue as far as Senator West was concerned-the $120m sale of the Wool Corporation's non-wool assets. The Government has refused to sell that amount of assets. In an interjection Senator West said, `What about their cash flow?'. All I can say to Senator West is that she has obviously never had that feeling of going broke. Let us not forget that the Corporation belongs to the woolgrowers, not to the Government. If the woolgrowers are going broke they start selling their non-wool assets, particularly if they are bringing in an interest rate of between 14 and 16 per cent because they know they can be sold at a good price. If one is going broke one sells one's assets; one does not just go broke because one wants to have a cash flow. I have never heard of anything quite so startling from someone who is meant to be supporting the woolgrowers in her particular State. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator West was talking about Senator Panizza referring to a 6 per cent levy. She did not understand that Senator Panizza was talking about a 6 per cent levy to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. A 6 per cent levy to the Realisation Commission excludes the 4 per cent tax on promotion and research and development which would bring the 6 per cent and 4 per cent to 10 per cent. That was exactly what Senator Panizza was talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to the various committees. The Australian Wool Realisation Commission will manage the stockpile, the Australian Wool Corporation will manage promotion, the Wool R and D Corporation will manage research and development and the Wool Industry Council will advise the Government. Why we cannot amalgamate the Realisation Commission and the Wool Corporation, I have no idea. Surely the same body could manage the stockpile and promotion. Both these corporations are funded by the woolgrowers; they are not funded by the Government. I do not understand why the Government wants two bodies to do something that one could do quite easily. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important that the body have a pre-specified volume of wool to be sold from the stockpile, otherwise no planning is possible. I hope that the Australian Democrats will support our amendments. I will be interested to see how the Government reacts to the many amendments that are being put forward by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the Labor senators who are present in the chamber and are interested in this Bill, only the Minister and Senator West have spoken on the legislation. I do not know whether honourable senators opposite have given up, knowing that the woolgrowers will not vote for them anyway, but I will be most interested to see the reaction of the Government to the amendments the shadow Minister will move on behalf of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating a package consisting of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill and eight other Bills related to the wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In dealing with the latest legislation on the wool industry, I emphasise once again my support of a consistent and responsible coalition attitude which gives priority to the welfare of the woolgrowers and the long term future of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government has displayed a careless and short-sighted attitude in its insistence on a 15 per cent wool tax, without full consideration of its necessity or its effect on woolgrowers. Sadly, only one Labor senator has contributed to the debate tonight. Unfortunately, Senator West's contribution was probably one of the most unbelievable speeches I have ever heard anyone make on such an important subject. It is sad that Senator West has been left to carry the can, because clearly she does not know anything about the wool industry. I remember making that same statement quite some time ago when dealing with the same subject. Senator West then came in and took a personal explanation, saying that her brother owned a truck or something and that she knew a lot about the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the wool industry itself will be able to draw a conclusion tonight on the sad state of intransigence now taken by the Government on this 15 per cent wool tax. As I say, the Government has not taken into consideration the effect this tax will have on the growers. The Opposition asked the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to seek from his Department and from producer organisations an estimate as to how many woolgrowers will be forced into substantial negative incomes and rendered non-viable through the imposition of a 15 per cent wool tax as opposed to a tax rate set at 10 per cent. But we cannot get an answer to that question; the Minister will not provide it because he knows, as we do, that the response to that is damning. </PARA>
<PARA> It is as if both the former Minister and his successor decided that they would impose an unnecessarily high tax in order to wash their hands of the problem in the short order and avoid detailed examination of the issue. Their only objective appears to the liquidation of the $2.4 billion debt in the shortest possible time. Regardless of whether that is practical or not, it is nonetheless their only objective. We all agree that this is an essential objective, but the coalition knows that the task of a responsible government is to avoid driving growers to the wall when this can be avoided. The Government is now seeking the repayment of the debt in five rather than seven years but is carefully concealing this fact from the growers. Surely, a seven-year repayment period is in the interests of Australia if it results in less devastation of a key industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an objective which apparently may now be shared by the purported friends of the woolgrower-the Australian Democrats-who accuse the coalition of being irresponsible. Having listened to Senator Bell's contribution tonight, I hope the Australian Democrats may now see reason and act in the best interests of the woolgrowers and the wool industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very strange objective to apply to a carefully assessed proposal for a 10 per cent wool tax from a party that last month was gung ho to spend an extra $1.2 billion on Austudy. I hope when it comes to the critical time to vote tonight that the Democrats will understand the importance of this to the wool industry. The Government knows that the report of the Vines Committee of Inquiry into the Wool Industry and the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council made it clear that any wool tax above 12 per cent would be a disastrous slug for a great many growers as they adjust to the new and inevitable discipline of a free market in wool-a reality that the coalition has supported. The former Minister made the bland statement that a 15 per cent tax would result in:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . no farm cash operating surplus in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>But he claimed that the level of the tax would make only a few hundred dollars difference. He might as well have said that if growers are going down the drain they might as well go down a bit faster for all that the Australian Labor Party cares. </PARA>
<PARA> We are trying to avoid having any of them going down the drain at the rate that they are going at the moment. If it is the Government's objective to reduce the number of woolgrowers by the 15 per cent tax rather than through market forces, let it say so, but that is not what Senator West said tonight. She has not admitted one way or the other. She has just put the Government line that a 15 per cent tax is quite appropriate, regardless of whether that sends many of the woolgrowers to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the simple arithmetic that has been mentioned here tonight by many of the Liberal-National Party speakers. A producer with 5,000 sheep selling wool at 450c a kilogram would pay $10,125 with a 15 per cent tax compared with the $6,750 under the coalition proposal of a 10 per cent tax. If this Government thinks that that $3,750 would not make a big difference to a family farm income, it really shows how out of touch it is. Once again, Senator West, as the only contributor from the Labor Party, did not address that and did not admit one way or the other that over $3,000 would be a significant saving to any wool producer. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government does not stop to consider that, if so many farm incomes are cut by several thousand dollars each, it can mean the difference between pulling through and adding to the dole queues. Lower incomes mean more expenditure on family allowance and the family allowance supplement, but has any of that been taken into consideration in tonight's debate by Senator West? No, not at all. </PARA>
<PARA> On a wider basis, the lower Great Southern region of Western Australia has over 10 million sheep producing 49 million kilograms of wool for an income of $220m at a price of 450c per kilogram. With a wool tax of 15 per cent over a year, $33m of disposable income is lost to the region, not merely to the individual grower families. Quite frankly, the state of Western Australia at the moment is so critical that it can ill afford to lose a further amount of money along those lines for particularly blinkered reasons. A 10 per cent tax would limit this to $22m-still a highly unacceptable figure in the longer term. But that is the difference-we are looking at $11m between the 15 per cent level and the 10 per cent level of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal for a 10 per cent tax is realistic when interest rates at last are falling consistently, and wool prices are rising to a level now of 580c per kilogram clean. It is realistic in the context of a reduction of supply closer to demand levels, with a likely production figure of 850 million kilograms rather than 900 million. This figure might have been further reduced in 1991-92 had not the sheep slaughter scheme been prematurely terminated, having reduced numbers by 11 million. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition figures, however, do not depend upon a revival of the slaughter scheme. It is certainly not at all the best option, and I know that there are many woolgrowers in Western Australia who are very anti the slaughter scheme. For that reason, we are certainly not looking at the revival of such a scheme. It is realistic to be advocating a 10 per cent tax of which 6 per cent will be for debt reduction when we have produced the figures that show its feasibility. It was, after all, the realism of the coalition last year that put paid to the prospect of wool quotas that would have destroyed the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is becoming more apparent that the Government is placing savage pressure on the wealth producers-the woolgrowers-rather than pushing the new wool bureaucracies to play a more positive role. Where is the requirement placed on the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) to realise more of its assets, conservatively valued at $290m? Immediately prior to my speaking, my colleague Senator Walters quite clearly made the point that if people are going broke they do not just hold on to their assets. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the point that Senator West failed to comprehend tonight, in saying that it was not important for the assets to be sold. They must sell the assets and they must do it quickly. The coalition would insist upon the sale of $120m in the non-wool assets of the AWC, 70 per cent of which are not actually used to store wool and are readily saleable. This figure amounts to a substantial part of the difference between a wool tax of 10 per cent rather than 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What this legislation offers is not real reform that would give growers a chance to compete in the world of real prices and real demand, but mere reorganisation. The coalition supports the excision of research and development from the AWC but it does not see how costs will be contained and the interests of the wool industry enhanced through creating a Wool Realisation Commission separate from the AWC. It is all very clumsy and very concerning to the woolgrowers of Australia. Growers in Western Australia are telling me that they have had enough of corporations and bureaucracies and that they want to get on with producing wool and selling it at a price that the market will bear. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if the Government and the Democrats see sense and support the coalition proposals, we would not simply believe that this solves the problem. A 10 per cent tax still represents a big slice of grower income which growers can ill spare when in March it was predicted that the farm cash operating surplus for the sheep industry would average minus $626 in 1991-92-a reduction of 111 per cent from the modest $5,724 in 1990-91. Consideration simply must be given to new initiatives in the disposal of the stockpile. The proposal of a wool zero coupon bond that would enable individual growers to share this task deserves full scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate has the responsibility of choosing the option that best allows Australian woolgrowers to survive and compete in the free market and the Liberal and National parties have economic logic on their side in urging that the wool tax be cut to 10 per cent. I am very concerned that the only contribution made by the Government tonight has been so blinkered. I hope that before this debate is concluded the Government will eventually see reason and see the economic logic behind our proposals. </PARA>

I had indicated that in order to save time I would not speak at this late hour but, if I may, I will speak for a short period. This debate has been a very interesting one. Honourable senators have made a number of extraordinarily good speeches during the second reading stage with which I have been impressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a question with which I have been struggling for some years. I have been interested to hear the tribal warfare that has been going on about this issue for several years. I have viewed with growing concern the uncertainty that has been developing in the industry. It is not entirely the fault of the Parliament but, as I think Senator Bell said, we do have to share some of the responsibility. Again, it is all very well to say this in hindsight, I guess, but, having seen what has occurred in the wool industry, I think we should be very careful when matters such as this come before us. I believe we should err on the side of caution and in favour of the woolgrowers-on the side of certainty. </PARA>
<PARA> It was summed up fairly well by Senator Bell. In a contribution that I believe was equal to the high standards of the Parliament he made the point: are we going to have a situation where we agree with the Government's 15 per cent, which would absolutely ruin thousands of woolgrowers? Are we going to have a situation where we support the Opposition amendment? If that is agreed to, Senator Bell considers it might mean an unmanageable debt situation arising. Or are we going to support the Democrats' proposition of 12 per cent? I think he put a very strong case before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to Senator Bell that he and I and others have received many submissions and representations from woolgrowers and others on the effect of 15 per cent and even of 10 per cent. It is my view that we ought to err on the side of caution on this occasion in giving the woolgrowers the benefit of the doubt. If it is found that all the factors upon which the assumption of the Opposition is based do not come about, this matter can be reconsidered by the Parliament. That is the view I have adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the second reading amendment put forward by the Opposition, I have some problem with (c), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>calls on the Government to support a properly managed industry funded flock reduction scheme to be introduced if and when the industry agrees such a scheme is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>My concern has been compounded by some of the things Opposition senators have said in the second reading debate, including the contribution of Senator Panizza, which I was interested to hear. He said, and indeed it was repeated by others, that our wool is going to be in demand in the foreseeable future. If we look at the situation now with the recent autumn drop, there is about a 20 per cent reduction, as I understand it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Harradine for a very timely and useful intervention, as most of his interventions are. I am sure that most of the points that I need to respond to now will come up in the course of amendments in the committee stage, so I do not think I need to go to those points in any great detail. A point that really needs to be gone to at this stage is the question of how we determine the most appropriate tax rate for the industry. In this respect, it is obvious that the Government had to weigh two competing objectives. The first was a need to ensure the continued viability of the Australian wool industry. That objective, of course, is of primary concern to all honourable senators. The second was a need to protect the liability of the Commonwealth-and, in turn, the contingent liability of the taxpayers-for the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tax rate is only one part of the overall stock release and debt management strategy which the Government has put in place. The strategy has had the objective of maximising the benefits to society, but most particularly to the wool industry, from the disposal of the stockpile, while limiting the liabilities faced by the general taxpayer and woolgrowers. Any change to one component of the plan would place pressure on other components and so threaten the achievement of the objective of the plan. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government has done has been based very much on the latest Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) forecasts of a reduction in the tax rate from 15 per cent to 10 per cent and the assessment by that organisation that such reduction would increase the gross returns, production-time prices, to the average specialist woolgrower by $2,480 in 1991-92. Given that farmers adjust their expenditure in response to higher returns, the corresponding increase in farm cash operating surplus is consequently $1,350. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that there have been some changes to forecasts underlying the tax rate calculations. We also recognise that there is some risk involved in adjusting these forecasts. We recognise also that additional stocks would need to be sold. This would force down wool prices for growers, consequently reducing their incomes or, alternatively, the tax rate would need to be increased in 1992-93. It has not been an easy decision. It is one where we have to balance the interests of the farming community with the liability on the community in general. In doing so, we have to take into account the longer term viability of the woolgrowing community. A continuation of market growth of recent stocks and accelerated debt repayment may enable the tax rate to be revised downwards in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of scenarios have been developed. These can be developed, and they can suggest that a lower tax rate could be applied, but these scenarios, as people should recognise, are often based on additional wool being sold from stocks in 1991-92. The trouble with these scenarios is that they often ignore the effect on prices of the release of this additional wool. Based on the analysis conducted by ABARE, farm income in the short run is lower under a low tax and high stock release strategy compared with a high tax and low stock release strategy. That is a primary consideration that we have taken into account, and we have concluded that considerable risk is associated with adopting a tax rate lower than 15 per cent in 1991-92. </PARA>

We have not gone into this without assessing that sort of situation and, in assessing it, the Government does expect that the wool store assets will be sold over the next two years-and that, I think, has been recognised in the debate. As to those particular sales and details of them, they will be very much a matter for the Commission's commercial judgment. The present AWC has estimated that, in respect of property sales, there could be of the order of $40m in 1991-92-and one cannot deny that particular assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that was worth laughing at, but I did not quite pick it up. In an uncertain property market, it is very difficult to accurately predict which wool stores might actually be sold and the timing of such sales. I am sure that other people recognise that. To rely on any particular level of sales in order to get the wool tax rate below 15 per cent is, of course, taking a considerable risk. In the Government's view, it was not appropriate to take that risk because, if the assets could not be sold in line with expectations, this would result in increased and unnecessary pressure on future property sales and wool tax rates. It is basic economics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, if the wool tax were set too low and the expected property sales did not eventuate in the first year, of course, as people should recognise, the tax would have to be increased in future years. What we are not about and what no side of this Parliament should be about is a fire sale of assets. A fire sale of assets--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the instruction from the Chair, I have decided that I will not respond to any more interjections, so Senator Crane can go on if he likes. But a fire sale of assets for the sake of getting a particular value from sales next year is not-and I underline `not'-the optimum way of disposing of the assets and is not in the best interests of the woolgrowing industry. That should be recognised. It is recognised out there. We recognise the difficulties of selling assets in the property market and, for this reason, we are facilitating a $200m interest- free loan for two years to cover expectations of property sales over the two-year period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In making our decisions we have had to balance expectations against risk and make the best judgment we can. The decision to have a 15 per cent wool tax for 1991-92 is of course the best judgment, and I am sure it stands up to sustainable scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of this debate tonight, we have heard those opposite making repeated comments on the average effect of their 10 per cent tax rate and of the Government's 15 per cent rate. It is based on an assessment of average growers and the number of sheep they have. If one goes back through the debate, it is interesting to note that there is some divergence in the average number of sheep. Senator Crane mentioned 5,000. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Crane" NAMEID="UW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator Crane</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not; I mentioned a thousand.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is good enough for me. Senator Panizza mentioned 6,000; Senator Crane's figure goes somewhere between 1,000 and 10,000. What no Opposition senators can deny is that the average number of sheep owned by woolgrowers Australia-wide is only 3,740. Those opposite can make all their assessments, but the basic problem is that by overstating the size of the average grower's stock the Opposition overstates the effect of its amendment. That does the industry and the taxpayer no good. I am sure that anyone who rationally assesses the debate tonight will come to that conclusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point those opposite make is that their figures have never been queried. They have been queried; they have been queried by the Government, the Australian Democrats and the media, condemned by ACIL, and disagreed with by the AWC and the WCA. That in itself is a fairly comprehensive list of those who disagree with their assessments. As the Government has said repeatedly, the figures Opposition senators use on which to base their assessment are quite spurious and rubbery and they are not figures that we would refer to. I will not go much further in respect of this matter, but I do make that point. </PARA>
<PARA> This Parliament should be concerned about making an assessment of the future viability of the industry. It is one that looks not to immediate political gain and populism but very much to the underlying economics of the industry and the underlying economic future viability of it. It is very easy, as we often see in this place, to run the populist line. This Government is not about that. Obviously, extremely important issues are involved here. No degree of cynicism from the other side will undermine the fact that this Government is concerned about ensuring the future economic viability of an industry which has gone through hard times. Those opposite might come in here and promise fools gold to that part of the Australian economy. For some people it may be receptive, but to those who are involved in the running of the industry and ensuring its future economic viability their arguments do not hold water. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of other points raised in this debate, it is probably best for me to tailor my responses to the amendments that are moved by both the Opposition and the Democrats in this debate. I will not go much further at this point, but I make it clear that the amendment to the second reading moved by the Opposition is one that is not supported by the Government. </PARA>

That report of the Auditor-General was entitled Potential Erosion of Accountability to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made extensive comments in my second reading contribution in this regard, and I am sure that other senators will be aware that concerns were raised on this matter yesterday in the Senate by Senator Short, Senator Bishop, Senator Crane and Senator Watson. Some very important points of principle relate to this matter, and I believe that the amendments that I have outlined would address those issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -As Senator Tambling has said, the question of the audit function in relation to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill and allied Bills has been the subject of fairly considerable debate in the chamber both yesterday and again during the second reading debate, including in particular by Senator Tambling, today. I support Senator Tambling in the amendments he has moved on behalf of the Opposition. They all relate to the question of the role of the Auditor-General as far as the audit function is concerned in relation to these Bills, but because of the way the audit function has been treated in these Bills I think the issue has a much wider implication than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Auditor-General was sufficiently concerned at the audit provisions contained in this Bill to report in great urgency to the chamber yesterday, drawing attention to the provisions in this Bill in relation to audit. The covering letter from the Auditor-General to the President and Mr Speaker states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bills proposing the creation of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>and also the Australian Wool Corporation-</PARA>
<PARA>have serious implications for accountability to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very serious concern expressed by the Auditor-General, and in his report he goes into this matter in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to summarise again the issue that concerns both the Auditor-General and the Opposition which is that this Bill makes provision for there to be other than the Auditor-General as the auditor of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. That decision, and that provision in the Bill, is contrary to the decision of the Government last year when it responded to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report on the mandate of the Australian National Audit Office. At that stage, when responding to the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Government said that the Auditor-General should be the auditor of all government-owned or controlled entities unless, in respect of statutory marketing authorities and government enterprises, there were special circumstances dictating the appointment of an external auditor. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General makes the point that there is no explanation given either in this Bill, in the second reading speech by the Minister or in the explanatory memorandum, as to what special circumstances may dictate the requirement for an external auditor other than the Auditor-General in the case of this Commission-and also in the case of the Australian Wool Corporation which is covered in the next Bill we are considering. Not only is there no explanation but also the way in which the clauses of the Bill are worded is such that in the Auditor-General's opinion-and the Opposition agrees with this-there is a bias against the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the provisions of the Bill, the Minister for Finance is not required to justify granting an exemption from audit by the Auditor-General; nor is he required, as I have said, to outline what special circumstances dictate such action. But, on the other hand, if the Minister for Finance agrees in principle to the appointment of a company or private auditor, the Minister for Finance must explain the reasons why he does not go ahead and appoint such an auditor. In other words, the onus of indication as to the reasons for not having a private auditor is quite different from the provisions relating to the appointment of the Auditor-General as the auditor. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is concerned that there is every indication in the drafting of this Bill that the Auditor-General's mandate is weakened and, therefore, the audit function in relation to the scrutiny of public moneys and the scrutiny of the audit of public moneys by this Parliament is weakened. On 14 June the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, wrote to the Auditor-General, Mr Taylor-who had raised his concerns about this matter with the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) on 6 June, following introduction of the Bills on 31 May-saying, amongst other things, that on the advice of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel it was proper to include in the Bills the processes to be followed regarding the appointment of a company auditor should such a possibility be contemplated at some future time. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> While I note your comments I consider that it is unlikely that a company auditor would be considered for the Commission or Corporation being established by these Bills. Nevertheless, I believe that the provisions of the Bills are appropriate and consistent with the Government's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the decisions in response to the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts last year. They are very weak reasons for including these clauses in the Bill. At face value, these clauses weaken very considerably the mandate of the Auditor-General. They therefore weaken very considerably the scope for parliamentary scrutiny of the expenditure of public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, on behalf of the Opposition, Senator Tambling has moved for the deletion of reference to any other auditor for the Commission's accounts other than the Auditor-General. I think that that is the right and proper way to go if we in this Parliament believe in the role of the Auditor-General and the importance of the Parliament as a scrutineer of public moneys and the expenditure of public moneys. For that reason, I very strongly support Senator Tambling's amendments. </PARA>

<PARA> As Senator Tambling will attest, I quite often go to the Northern Territory and to Darwin. The number of times I have had shoved into my face the fact that the private sector up there should be getting more and more government work from my Department and from others is immeasurable. </PARA>
<PARA> Through this proposal the Government is saying, `Yes, the Auditor-General is the primary source of advice in this area, but if the Wool Corporation chooses to go elsewhere, it can do so.

<PARA> The Government is proposing something which I would well imagine the Australian Democrats would oppose; something which a few people in the Labor Party that I am aligned to would oppose, I must admit; but it is something which I am quite stunned that the Opposition would oppose. The Opposition is being totally inconsistent and hypocritical. The AWC can choose, if it so desires-but with primary obligation to the Auditor-General-whichever auditor it likes, and that person's audits will be made public through the annual report and will come through to this Parliament, therefore providing for public accountability. The hypocrisy of Opposition senators overawes me. </PARA>

<PARA>This is an important amendment and an important principle. Due to the fact that funds remaining after the debt is paid belong to the woolgrowers, it is obvious that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy should be restricted to refunding the money either to the contributing levy payers or for the benefit of woolgrowers generally if the amount is too small to be divided equitably. I am sure the Minister for Administrative Services would be well aware of the representations in this regard received by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy from the Australian Wool Council.

<PARA> The Government is opposed to this amendment, as the Opposition and the Australian Democrats would expect.

<PARA> The Government's position is that the amendment moved by Senator Tambling is too prescriptive. In the second reading speech we made it very clear that the surplus will be disposed of in the manner which `best benefits woolgrowers'. In making that commitment, we take into account that we do not want legislation that is too prescriptive, and we also take into account the fact that to keep records to allow such redistribution to the levy payers could cost somewhere in the vicinity of $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made that commitment. It is a commitment that has been expressed in the second reading speech and it is one that we think is substantial enough in itself. I know that the Opposition is not happy with that, but the basic point is that we are committed to ensuring that the best outcome for woolgrowers is achieved and one that is not overburdened with administrative prerequisites. So we do oppose this amendment. </PARA>

I do not need to go through those arguments again, but I say that they are as relevant now as they were before. I think the fact that only one SMA so far has chosen to go to a private organisation is indicative of the inclination of statutory marketing authorities in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This amendment relates specifically to clause 42 and omits the date of 1 May and substitutes 31 May. According to the legislation, the Corporation must convene an annual general meeting of wool taxpayers by 1 May in each financial year. This is far too early for the setting of tax levels for the following year. The Minister would be well aware that he has received representations from the Wool Council specifically on this matter that recommend that the AGM be held before 31 May in each financial year. The Opposition contend that this amendment should be supported. </PARA>

If one goes to clause 6 of the Bill and looks at the functions of the Council, one sees very clearly that the function of the Council is to inquire into, keep under review and report to the Minister matters affecting the industry. The amendment moved by the Opposition basically means that the Council can and would be used as a body which would be dragged into industry politics. It does not seem to be in anyone's interest to so do, and it does not seem to be in the interests of good organisation of the industry to do it in this way. There is the risk of sections of the industry releasing an adverse report before it gets to the Minister. Opposition senators might think that that is good fun at the moment but, given the balance of probabilities, some time before the end of the century they will be in government and will have to live with that sort of effect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As foreshadowed, the Australian Democrats believe that this is the opportunity to reach a compromise on the invidious position in which the chamber finds itself. The argument for establishing a wool tax rate of 12 per cent instead of 15 per cent has been placed before this chamber. At this time I do not propose to rehash that statement. The amendment circulated in the name of the Australian Democrats reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Clause 4, page 2, paragraph (b), omit ``15%'', substitute ``12%''. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a slight amendment to be made to the text of the amendment which honourable senators have in front of them. I hasten to add that I was not responsible for the typesetting; it is a typographical error. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment to each bill:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4, page 2, paragraph (b), omit ``15%'', substitute ``12%''. </PARA>
<PARA>I have canvassed the argument, and I believe that it is well understood by those who have followed this so far. After I spoke earlier in the debate, the Opposition continued to push the case that a 10 per cent tax is the most appropriate one. Another matter was raised during that debate by various senators. It was suggested that there was some inconsistency in the Democrats' position in that we were suggesting that there was a looseness about the coalition's calculations when we ourselves stood accused of being cavalier in the amounts of money that were spent on behalf of taxpayers-that that was a contradiction. I think it was Senator Knowles who drew the attention of the chamber to that. I reject that because a major reason for our adopting the figure of 12 per cent is derived from a conservative evaluation of the situation. We were taking into account the suggestion made by Senator Tambling in a previous debate on the wool industry, when the Democrats were proposing that it was the responsibility of the Government to provide a contingency fund to ensure that supplementary payments could be made after removal of the floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Democrats argued for that contingency fund of the order of $300m at least, we were roundly criticised by all contributors from the Opposition. It was suggested that we should `exercise some financial discipline', and those are the words I found in Hansard last night. They were the very words used by Senator Tambling, and I throw them back now. We are trying to exercise what we were asked to exercise in the previous debate-some financial discipline-and I would add the word responsibility. That is the genesis of our position. There needs to be an evaluation of the optimism. The 10 per cent figure is an optimistic position to take. If everything else is fine, if the weather stays good and if everything is right it could work, but the more disciplined and responsible position is the one which I am proposing now. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other ifs, which I have canvassed and will not repeat. They are connected with things such as the availability of cash if and when the assets are sold. I noticed that in the Opposition's calculations it was assumed that cash would be available to be taken off the debt. That was in the very first column of the figures I was provided with just now. That is quite a large if. I agree that the non-wool assets of the Corporation should be sold as quickly as possible, but it is very optimistic to assume that those funds will be available to be removed from the debt immediately and in full, as depicted in the Opposition's calculations. That is the sort of optimism which I question, which I cannot endorse and which leads us to adopt the relatively conservative position of 12 per cent, which is consistent with our position throughout this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment before the Committee is important, and it has been the crux of considerable debate and discussion by a number of honourable senators today. I certainly commend the very detailed economic assessment that has been made in this area in the contributions by many honourable senators. At this stage I foreshadow that the Opposition will be moving a subsequent amendment to this one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We clearly indicated and expressed throughout the debate that we felt that in the current economic climate-noting the current state of the wool industry and in light of the very considerable economic parameters that have been presented, which do amount to a matter of judgment and credibility-the figure of 10 per cent would be important, and I believe that we have been able to sustain that. But, more importantly, it is urgent that we also have a great deal of compassion for the tragedy occurring at the moment in rural Australia, particularly as it affects woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats' amendment proposes a maximum figure of 12 per cent, and the amendment that I will subsequently move proposes a 10 per cent maximum. We have shown that this is credible, sustainable, sensible and essential if the woolgrowers of Australia are to survive. It is a question of making a choice between the sensible realisation of the Australian Wool Corporation's assets-$120m of Corporation assets equals 5 per cent of the levy-and the forced fire sale of assets and properties of woolgrowers. Such a choice should be in favour of woolgrowers for their future viability. Therefore, it is a sensible decision to require the Australian Wool Corporation's assets to be sold rather than those of woolgrowers and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures presented by the Australian Wool Corporation indicate that only $40m of assets sales in the coming year are to be used for a reduction in the principal debt and are not to be used at all in relation to the debt servicing charge. If those Wool Corporation figures are used, if $120m in assets sales is used to assist in debt servicing, we believe that a figure of 10 per cent could be sustained. Indeed, as many of the charts that were considered indicate, and as many of the discussions suggest, a figure of less than 10 per cent could perhaps be more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bell referred to whether the figure was optimistic. It is a matter of judgment and it is finetuning. At this stage it is very important that we weigh these issues carefully. I certainly invite the Senate's support of the foreshadowed amendment relating to a figure of 10 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support Senator Tambling at this point. The first year of this program will be the worst year. Sheep farmers all over Australia are having it tougher now than they have ever had it, and the situation is not likely to get any better. To put them under a 15 per cent regime would be absolute murder. It is something that I do not think any of us could justifiably live with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand the 12 per cent case that Senator Bell has put forward, but I do believe that we are in the position where we have to try to see what is the absolute minimum that we need to get in the first year. If, for any reason, the amount of money required is not adequate, it can be increased in the second year. But I believe that this figure can be sustained for the first year and that from there on there is no need for it to go any higher. </PARA>
<PARA> But we have to consider the industry as it is. The group of wool producers who will be most affected will be the younger woolgrowers, the ones newer to the industry, the ones on smaller properties and the ones on more remote properties: they are the ones we have to protect. That is the industry of the future. I think it would be criminal if we were to drive these people off their farms at a time like this by introducing a tax that we know now cannot be afforded. That is not the sort of thing that we ought to be taking too lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions have been raised about the figures that we have produced to demonstrate the 10 per cent. Not one authentic argument has been raised by anybody anywhere in Australia against those figures. Nobody has been able to demonstrate that those figures are flawed in any way. We have done this over and over again in hundreds of runs. We can vouch for those figures in every way. Nobody has come forward and demonstrated that there is any possible error.

Honourable senators must remember that that real estate, which was set up in Melbourne and in the south of France, was put there by the growers themselves-not by the Government, not by the Australian Wool Corporation and not by anybody else.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's decision on this has been very elaborately spelt out. It does stand the test of most careful analysis. I state quite emphatically that both the Opposition's and the Australian Democrats' proposals do not withstand that test. The Government's decision for a 15 per cent tax rate was based on the most careful analysis of the Australian Wool Corporation's financial position and an assessment of future market conditions. We all recognise that the latter conditions are uncertain, but our approach aims to maximise the net returns to growers from the sales of current production and the net return from the sale of stockpiled wool.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has to be recognised, and what I hope is recognised, is that the tax rate is just one part of the overall stock release and debt management strategy that the Government has put in place. A change to one component of this plan would place pressure on other components and threaten the achievement of the objective. If those opposite cannot understand that, then they are failing here as representatives of the people that they pretend to represent. If those opposite cannot understand that there is an overall strategy and that if one part of it fails that impacts on the rest of it, then they have failed in logic, in economics and as representatives; and those opposite will be exposed as such. </PARA>
<PARA> We make it clear that we are not about to change the fundamental structure of our package. Some in the Opposition have argued tonight, and at other times, that the parameters against which the Government arrived at 15 per cent are now outdated. That is not the case, because careful analysis does not substantiate this. Even the report prepared for the Wool Council of Australia by ACIL Australia Pty Ltd concluded that a change of less than 0.5 per cent downwards was all that was warranted. There is a long way between 14.5 and 10 per cent. As I say, the ACIL report was quite clear that a change of less than 0.5 per cent downward was all that was warranted. </PARA>

In terms of substantiation, our figures have been assessed and reassessed but the Opposition's have not. The Opposition has not released the basic parameters and assumptions that its figures are based on, and while Senator Bell might smirk with a big smile on his face, nor have his figures been assessed. Tonight, only one side of this Parliament has come up with figures that have been assessed as being sustainable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the figure of 9.1 per cent that was reached on 4 June, the debt start-off figure was too low-although I understand that this has now been changed-the production figure for 1991-92 is a bit lower than the recent official forecast, the debt servicing and storage costs are on the low side and the trade clearance rate is on the high side. The Opposition also assumes a significant income from assets sales of $120m in the first year. In a depressed poverty market, that sort of assumption is one which everyone would understand is totally and fundamentally flawed. What we have from the Opposition is a coincidence of optimistic assumptions. It can postulate a low rate of tax but it does not accept or acknowledge that if any one of its assumptions is out then its projected tax rate is blown. The Democrats understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Democrats do not take the analysis to its logical conclusion and come to within 0.5 per cent of what we are proposing. Like the Opposition, they are playing bingo with us. They are playing bingo with the wool industry. Fifteen per cent is the figure that is sustainable by analysis. The Opposition has put up a figure of 10 per cent-it thinks that is a fair cop and it can sell that out in its constituencies. But I am surprised by the Democrats-what was wrong with 12.5 per cent? That is midway between us and the Opposition. The Democrats are playing bingo with the future of the wool industry and that is something that this Government will not tolerate. We have an extremely serious problem here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The future of the industry is very much involved here. It is one that depends on the recipe that we put together at this particular stage. If there is a basic miscalculation at this time, if one of the factors in the formula is out, the whole result is out. As I said earlier, the Opposition has put up a coincidence of optimistic assumptions. Even ACIL's report to the Australian Wool Corporation states that, given recent developments, the best one can look for is a 0.5 per cent reduction. Our analysis stands up to scrutiny, the Opposition's does not, but that is not uncommon in this place. What is also not uncommon is that we have our friends from the Democrats steering a midway course between it all without rhyme or reason. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats can play bingo with the lives of the farmers, but we will not. We will oppose any amendments on this particular point. Our view is that it is prudent to retain the 15 per cent tax rate for 1991-92. We have no intention of amending the legislation. We also state that within the scope of the uncertainties inherent in the assessments of the wool market in the future, recent changes in market conditions do not alter the outcome sufficiently for it to be prudent for the Government to reconsider the position of the 15 per cent wool tax rate for 1991-92. If we reduce the tax now there will be more impact and more of a burden on the industry in future years. The Opposition is making some pretty basic assumptions that are wrong. As I said, the sustainable evidence is that what the Government is doing is right, or very close to right. We oppose both amendments. </PARA>

For heaven's sake, the Minister should not misquote things to us at 2.05 a.m. and expect us to be too tired to pick it up. We on this side of the chamber are not too tired: no doubt the Minister's colleagues are all sound asleep in their rooms. The Minister has no support, apart from two honourable senators presently in the chamber, and even the Government Whip is not here. If the Minister is going to quote the report, he should do it accurately. Would the Minister like me to read it to him again? It says very clearly:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . 9.25 per cent wool tax would be sufficient in 1991-92 to meet the Government's minimum debt repayment requirement. </PARA>
<PARA>Not 10 per cent, as the Opposition is going for, but 9.25 per cent. The Opposition's figures give the Government 9.1 per cent. As I said in my speech, we have a 0.9 per cent comfort zone, if that is what one likes to call it, but ACIL says 9.25 per cent. The Minister cannot find it: the public servants are trying to show the Minister where it is. I will come across and give it to the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA>In summary, justifiable variation to the assumptions likely to have been used by the Government means that no change to the wool tax is required for 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very clear. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Some changes . . . work to reduce the rate of tax while others work in the opposite direction. Overall, the changes amount to a difference of less than 0.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, fine tuning of the original assumptions used by the Government does not justify reduction in the wool tax for 1991-92 from the 15 per cent announced. The summary goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>To reduce the rate of tax below 15 per cent in 1991-92 would require some combination of deferring the payment of $20 million debt, capitalising some of the debt, extending the repayment period, selling wool from the stockpile, greater sales of AWC assets . . .

<PARA>I table this report because of the intimidation and provocation from members of the Opposition; I would not do so otherwise. I do not expect those opposite to be moved by this, because I have recognised, as have others, their incapacity to respond to rational argument. However, I now expect that the Democrats-who are much more attuned to rational argument, who are much more responsive, who can actually read, comprehend and respond to arguments such as this, who do not play the populist role that the Opposition plays continually-when confronted with this report and its conclusion will have no alternative but to support the Government on our retention of the 15 per cent tax rate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am sure you are well aware of the fact that we are in fact pursuing an Australian Democrats' request at the moment. I wonder what the histrionics concerning various calculations contrived by the Opposition are really all about. I wonder how the figures with which the Government was asked to deal impinge on our proposition. If it were not so late it would be amusing to reflect on the fact that during the debate earlier there were at least two-and I think possibly three-versions, differently dated, of the now notorious ACIL Australia Pty Ltd report which has been referred to and now tabled by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could pick one to table from any one of the half a dozen copies I have in front of me. I could table the one I have here dated 28 May, or I could table the one dated 7 June. I could dig about a little bit more and table one which agrees with neither of those. As Senator West was able to demonstrate in quoting selectively from part of the copy which she had, but which she did not date, it is possible to reach a number of conclusions. In fact, this very report has been used to substantiate a number of positions. One of those positions concerned the 12 per cent figure and we responded to that believing that the figures that were presented there had at least some possibility of being substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA> When I mentioned my reasons for not being attracted away from that position to the position adopted by the Opposition, I mentioned some of the assumptions that were made by the Opposition. I would like to refer to another document which has not yet been mentioned in this debate-that is a document prepared by the Centre for International Economics entitled Wool into the 21st Century. To spell it out a little more for those who are familiar with this debate, this document was endorsed by Jim Maple-Brown, Chairman of the Wool into the 21st Century Committee, and compiled by a well-known operator in this area, Dr Andy Stoeckel. I will quote eight or 10 lines from page 27 of that report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Attempting to show the difference in returns under different scenarios on a series of spreadsheets misses the point altogether since what should dominate the decision making is how to promote the efficient workings of a free market and the incentive to innovate. Combine all of that with the fact that we have no monopoly of power in the final marketplace into which much of our wool is going at the low prices prevailing now, it is obvious that the best policy is to offer all the stockpile to the trade at once. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an entirely different proposition based on the fact that we do not control the international market and we do not have any control over the things which influence that. That is one of the imponderables that have brought us to the situation which we are in now. We do not control the weather; we do not control the Russian market; and we do not control the Chinese market. We have no influence whatsoever over the acts of God which come to impinge on our wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that we stop the if's and but's and maybe's and look at the very few things we can see as tangibles in this area. One of them is the status of the stockpile now, which has been reduced marginally. I must say in passing that great mention has been made in the debate of the reduction of the stockpile to some 100,000 bales. As I understand it, those 100,000 bales have yet to be cleared; they have been offered. That is very much like the sort of proposition we get from the Opposition when it says in its selection of figures that $100m will be added to the calculations and reduced from the overall debt in the first year. That is a great assumption to make. That cash may or may not be available. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the sorts of vagaries that we have to take into account. In taking those vagaries into account I do not think we can tend towards the Opposition's position. The Government would do well to recognise the fact that the Opposition has just distributed an amendment which will introduce about 10 per cent. The Government should see that as a danger signal and perhaps realise that that amendment will be put. The way to prevent that amendment being put is to accept our request. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put:</PARA>
<PARA> That the request (Senator Bell's) be agreed to. </PARA>

Without elaborating the point, the proposal which we put at 12 per cent was the opportunity for the Opposition to grasp something which was realistic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Schacht is an expert in most areas, but maybe not wool. The Government opposes the further amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. Our view is probably shared by the Opposition in that, in a sense, what is happening at this late stage is somewhat of a farce. Figures are being plucked out of the air and we are not in that sort of game. We are in the business of a rational assessment of what is appropriate for the industry and for the industry's future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I do say that by moving this particular amendment, the Australian Democrats have had to do some pretty intense soul searching and, by doing so, recognise that the Government's position of 15 per cent is obviously the one that is much closer to what they are concerned about. If they move from their current amendment and adopt a 10 per cent figure, it makes a total farce of the process that has been entered into tonight. We say that 15 per cent is the figure that is sustainable by logic; we say that other figures are being plucked out of the air; and we also say that it is quite apparent that the direction of the Democrats is one close, and closer, to the Government's position on this matter. For them to be consistent, there is absolutely no logical, intellectually sustainable way that they would move from the direction in which they are heading to a 10 per cent figure.

The position was stated in April and it has consistently been that we have argued that 12 per cent is the most appropriate figure. I have argued that strongly here tonight on behalf of the Australian Democrats. As a last minute opportunity for the Government to be able to sustain a figure lower than 15, I moved the amendment that was recently dismissed.

<PARA> As I said earlier, what has been indulged in tonight has been a game of bingo with the future of the wool growing industry in Australia. To the extent that the Government opposes that, we indicate now that we will oppose the request to the Bills when they go back to the House of Representatives. I also make it very clear at this stage that, if an acceptable solution is not reached and if the Government's sustainable assessment of 15 per cent is not achieved, what stands in place legally is a tax rate of 25 per cent. I think the Opposition and the Australian Democrats should take that fully into account. If that is the legally applicable rate at the end of this parliamentary process tonight, it is very much the responsibility of the other side of this House that that rate applies. It should be taken into account. Those opposite might think it is a great joke, but the sting in this process tonight will have to be copped by the Australia woolgrowing industry. The process tonight has evolved quite irresponsibly. I hope that the Australian Democrats do not fall for this move by the Opposition. </PARA>
