<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio. That our Parliament immediately end this association between healthy sports and the deaths of 18,300 people in Australia each year from tobacco-related diseases.</PARA>

<PARA>The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:</PARA>
<PARA>WHEREAS:</PARA>
<PARA>A. The Syrian Government has adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is a signatory to the International Covenant on civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination;</PARA>
<PARA>B. In violation of Universal Declaration of Human Rights Articles 2 (Freedom of Religion), 13 (Right to leave) and 14 (Freedom to Emigrate), the Syrian Government oppresses and discriminates against certain of its citizens on account of their religion and/or ethnic identity and prohibits them from emigrating;</PARA>
<PARA>C. In further violation of its international obligations, the Syrian government punishes those of its citizens who attempt to exercise their internationally-recognised right of emigration with arbitrary imprisonment without charge or trial and with beatings and torture of the most cruel and barbaric kind; and</PARA>
<PARA>D. As a consequence of those repeated and grievous violations of international law, the Syrian government has been censured by the European Parliament and the governments of a number of democratic nations.</PARA>
<PARA>YOUR PETITIONERS THEREFORE PRAY THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESOLVE TO:</PARA>
<PARA>I. CONDEMN the government of the Arab Republic of Syria for:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Its denial of fundamental rights including the right of all its citizens to emigrate and to family reunification; the right to life, liberty and the security of the individual; protection against arbitrary arrest and detention; the right of an accused person to a fair public trial before a jury of his or her peers; the right of free expression, assembly and association.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Its use of the police, law courts and other state organs to carry out arbitrary arrests, detention, beatings and torture in respect of certain of its citizens and otherwise to exact arbitrary penalties against such citizens solely on the basis of race, religion, sex, national or ethnic origin or political belief.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Its use of government-controlled communications media to incite hatred and prejudice against its Jewish and other minorities.</PARA>
<PARA>II. RAISE the foregoing matters for public discussion in the United Nations and other international forums with a view to imposing economic sanctions upon Syria until the aforementioned abuses cease.</PARA>
<PARA>III. ENCOURAGE AND ASSIST inter-government bodies, non-government human rights organisations and International Jurists to bring political and public pressure to bear on the Syrian government to honour its international commitments to respect the human rights of all its citizens.</PARA>

I am just wondering whether Senator Baume could pull out that part of the reference in his motion. The rest of it, of course, is quite acceptable in the political context of this Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the recent few months there have been three particularly significant developments in the way in which we expect the Australian community, led by this Parliament, to join in a process of reconciliation with our original Aboriginal inhabitants. We are debating this morning a Bill for a Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody has been brought down in the last couple of months, and the Hon. Robert Tickner, MP, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation, recently made a statement to the United Nations working group on indigenous populations in which he announced that the Australian Government had agreed to accession to the first optional protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Taken together, and with the fine degree of cross-party support that we are receiving for this particular Bill, I believe that we stand on the threshold of a new era. Perhaps we will have to wait for a few years to see it come to fruition, but we have before us here a very auspicious beginning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill itself has an extremely important preface which recognises the occupation by Aboriginals of Australia for a very long time before the British settlement at Sydney Cove in 1788. It goes to the dispossession and dispersal of Aborigines from their traditional lands, acknowledges that there has been no formal process of reconciliation and says that by the year 2001, the centenary of Federation, it is most desirable that there be such reconciliation. As part of the process, the Commonwealth will seek an ongoing national commitment from governments at all levels to cooperate and coordinate with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as appropriate to address progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations in relation to land, housing, law and justice, cultural heritage, education, employment, health, infrastructure, economic development and any other relevant matters in the decade leading to the centenary of Federation in 2001. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains initiatives for promoting reconciliation by leadership and education. It fosters a national commitment to reconciliation, establishing forums for discussion of issues that are relevant, advising the Minister and leading consultation and participation. These are the objectives of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation which will be established by the carrying of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments is integral to the success of this process. Non-government organisations will be closely involved, as will communities generally. Recommendations made by the Council are to be laid before each House of Parliament within 15 days of their being made to the Minister. The powers of the Council are carefully delineated in the Bill and strategic plans are laid forth. In other words, this is a working document. As I have said, it is extremely encouraging that the document itself has the approval of all parties in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it ironic that Senator Michael Baume in his contribution to the debate yesterday suggested that this Council, of all councils, should be discriminated against in that remuneration should be only on the basis of compensation for expenses incurred by members of the Council. I cannot see why this Council should not be in the same position as every other consultative council that is established by this Government. Why, for example, should members of the National Council on Violence Against Women be remunerated on the basis of a per diem payment, or whatever the Remuneration Tribunal has determined, but not this Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, which is surely intended to overcome the discrimination against Aborigines which has occurred for a very long time?</PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which has been with us now for several months, engendered a ministerial statement in response. This statement includes a distressing picture of the lives and deaths of the 99 people whose deaths-at an average age of 32 years-were considered by the Commission. Of the 99 people who died, 43 had experienced childhood separation from their natural families through intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions. Eighty-three of the 99 were unemployed at the date of their last detention. Forty-three had been charged with an offence at or before the age of 15. Only two of the 99 had completed secondary education. Forty-three were taken into custody in the period immediately before their deaths on matters related to the overuse of alcohol. In the remaining cases, alcohol had been a contributing factor. The standard of health of the 99 varied from poor to very bad. The average age of those dying from natural causes was a little over 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Two principles which loomed large, according to the Minister, as central to change for Aboriginal people, were empowerment and self-determination. As a senior and experienced lawyer with considerable knowledge of Aboriginal issues, Commissioner Johnston referred to the `pinpricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference which confronted Aboriginal people in their everyday lives, with no personal control over their own children, their employment, personal savings or decisions as to whether to buy a car or other personal belongings. Agendas were being set elsewhere. Assumptions as to what was best for Aboriginal people were made elsewhere'. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Commissioner Johnston, the first prerequisite for the empowerment of Aboriginal society is the will for renewal and self-determination. He also stressed the important role played by Aboriginal community-based organisations. The role of these organisations is continually emphasised in the recommendations of the report. At every level control of lives and communities must be in Aboriginal hands in the same way that non-Aboriginal Australians expect to control their lives and communities. According to Commissioner Johnston, there was impressive evidence of the efforts being made all over Australia by Aboriginal organisations and communities at local and wider levels to demonstrate that this could be done, and indeed is already being done. Aboriginal people do have the determination and capacity to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The points made so emphatically and poignantly in the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody principally about the tenuous hold on life of so many young men apply with few variations to young women of the same generation. Tragically, many are not reaching middle age. These women were also separated from their families through official intervention. Few, though probably more than their brothers, have completed secondary schooling. Some, whom I have been privileged to count among my friends, have obtained tertiary training and significant positions in various bureaucracies. </PARA>
<PARA> However, many of this generation were children of poorly nourished mothers living from infancy in substandard conditions in reserves and fringe camps. Some have been exposed to radiation from the testing of atomic devices at Monte Bello and Maralinga. There is a devastating number of deaths of women in this group from medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease-stroke and heart attack-severe diabetes and its complications and diseases of that nature which in our non-Aboriginal society are associated with old age. There also is a high incidence of cancer of the breast, cervix and lungs amongst women of that generation. Alcohol abuse by the women or their partners is a contributing factor in some cases and can occur in two ways-by destroying women in their relative youth and, much more often, by making women the victims of violent abuse. Empowerment of women is a crucial element of the three developments of the last few months that I have described: this Bill; the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody; and the protocol to which we have acceded, which makes it possible for the first time for Aborigines to have access to the international structures which would allow their complaints to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The capacity of very many Aborigines to succeed, given half a chance, is graphically illustrated by the women's council of the Pitjantjatjara Council as recounted and beautifully illustrated in a publication entitled Minyma Tjuta Tjunguringkula Kunpuringanyi-Women Growing Stronger Together. The book documents 10 years of extremely productive activity by the Aboriginal women of central Australia. They first met as a council in 1980 and at that time, having established their council, chose a chairwoman from each of the three States covered by the three language groups in that area. In the Northern Territory section there are five major communities and more than 60 homelands, while in the Western Australian section there are 11 major communities and at least 45 homelands the number of which is increasing quite quickly, I suspect. In South Australia, there are 10 major groups and at least 50 homelands. </PARA>
<PARA> The document that was provided as a history of the activity of this Council over 10 years included an account of some extremely impressive major projects that have been undertaken during that time. These include assisting women to obtain funding for the establishment and upgrading of art and craft centres in the communities and to acquire funding for women's only vehicles to assist women to attend meetings, visit and care for sites, partake of ritual business, collect wood for hunting and gather art and craft materials for craft enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very liberating for women to have their own vehicles. In many communities of which I am aware the women's vehicles are for the women only-nobody else is allowed to touch them. In some cases, women have painted their own symbols on these vehicles to make certain that nobody else takes them. It also means that women in some cases are able to establish income generating activities such as catering, helping to dispose of rubbish and providing transport. </PARA>
<PARA> Other projects include assisting with the erection of women's museums for the safe storage of women's sacred objects; organising major art exhibitions highlighting the diversity of women's work; assisting women in the registering and protecting of the women's sacred sites of Uluru; organising and coordinating 45 women from 18 different communities to participate in the Festival of Pacific Arts in Townsville; arranging for many women to participate in important interstate conferences on a range of matters dealing with health, land management, birth rights, education, housing and women's cultural affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council has also produced magazines recording women's stories and, of course, it has produced this quite wonderful document which records it all. It has conducted a comprehensive research project examining the care and needs of the elderly and disabled in the area; assisted in the production of videos about women's laws and stories; assisted in the research and planning of the Congress Alukura-the birthing place for Aboriginal women in Alice Springs. </PARA>
<PARA> It has organised site visitation trips for women wishing to follow dreaming tracks and renew bonds with their country; supported Arrernte women's efforts to protect a women's site from a proposed dam in Alice Springs; organised training courses for its Executive; organised interpreter courses for women in communities; organised women members of parliament to tour through communities-the list goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> When people go into Alice Springs from the outlying communities they are assisted by the Council women. They may need help with money matters, hospital business, accommodation and language in many cases. This Women's Council has been functioning in this extremely constructive way now for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA> The document to which I am referring also recounts a number of instances where there has been a lack of official knowledge of women's dreaming sites, tracks and particular sacred sites. An extra role for these women-and a very important one, one which they would probably say was amongst their most important-has been to identify sites and work with the mining companies to make certain that those sites are not damaged. </PARA>
<PARA> There are anecdotes throughout the book. There is a reference to the women at Wingellina, which is in my electorate of Western Australia. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>You know we were just talking in a meeting with some women from Wingellina about the new mine. What were they saying?</PARA>
<PARA>The response was:</PARA>
<PARA>They don't want those men to come. </PARA>
<PARA>They-</PARA>
<PARA>talked about the important Dreaming stories, but the others have not understood it all yet. </PARA>
<PARA>It is going to need a great deal more talking. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>But . . . as of now, maybe in a month . . . the men from the mining company will come to take samples back to Kalgoorlie. They will clean it . . . and examine it and have promised they will come back</PARA>
<PARA>This is where their real anxieties come through. </PARA>
<PARA>They will build up this area, put up buildings, an aerodrome for their planes and a school for their kids. Right in the middle of Wingellina community reserve. Then they will be the strong ones and this community will be crowded out. </PARA>
<PARA>We hope that with our new Council operating over the next few years to bring Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities together to discuss their very real concerns-such as I have just quoted-confrontations will become less and less common. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another extract I would like to quote from here. If there is no objection I would also be very happy if it could be included in Hansard in the language of the Ngaanyatjarra people, as it is before me here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of the Senate I will read the interpretation. This is a very short story entitled the Centipede. Dora is talking to Suzy, a white woman:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dora: Now, what was I saying about centipedes? Just say I was tired and my husband said: ``Hurry up and make tea. Where's the sugar? Do we have any food?'' and I'd say ``Well I'm really tired and I've only got two hands. I'm not a centipede''. </PARA>
<PARA>Dora: How would you talk about this in English?</PARA>
<PARA>Suzy: My mother would say ``I've only got one pair of hands''. </PARA>
<PARA>Dora: And she doesn't mention a centipede?</PARA>
<PARA>Suzy: No she doesn't know anything about centipedes. </PARA>
<PARA>Dora: Well anangu talk about the two things together. ``Hey I'm really tired, why do you keep on nagging me? What's the matter with you, I've got just two hands and I've had enough. I'm no centipede. Only centipedes have lots of hands''. </PARA>
<PARA>This is what people say. </PARA>
<PARA>I read that as an illustration of how close we really are and how, when there is the opportunity to exchange anecdotes of whatever level of significance, whether it is about an enormous mining company coming into the area or whether it is about women exchanging their everyday experiences, it is extremely important that we have the capacity, the forum, the Council which will make this not only possible but an everyday occurrence in the very near future, I would hope. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer very briefly to the activities of some of the women in the Fitzroy Valley in Western Australia, quite a long way from central Australia, which we have been discussing for the last five or 10 minutes. It was decided by the Aboriginal women in that area not so very long ago that they simply must have a women's refuge. The level of domestic and familial violence in the area was very high, with deaths and injury to women extremely common. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to establish the need, to put together a working group and to also become incorporated, the leading women in Fitzroy Crossing had then to deal with 20 different language groups from the Fitzroy Valley. This was a matter which took an enormous amount of time, effort and diplomacy. There are not only language groups, but there are 20 different hierarchies. Although the need was clearly and quickly identified, all those power structures had to be appropriately incorporated in the venture if it was to go ahead. This has been achieved in a relatively short period of time, and the women in the Fitzroy Valley will have their refuge at Fitzroy Crossing before very long. </PARA>
<PARA> Empowerment of not only Aboriginal women, of course, but also Aboriginal men, as has been emphasised in the documents that I have quoted, is absolutely essential to the aims and objectives of the Bill that we are debating this morning. With the support that has been promised by the other parties in this Parliament and with the goodwill of all Australians involved, I feel quite certain that it can be the door to a new era of relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill seeks to establish a Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to promote a process of reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the wider Australian community. Under the proposal the Council will consist of up to 25 prominent people, including at least 12 Aborigines and two Torres Strait Islanders, as well as a secretariat of 10 people located within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It is estimated to cost $2.2m in its first full financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Council will have two major functions: first, to undertake initiatives leading to reconciliation between Australia's indigenous people and the wider community; and, second, to play an educative and leadership role in bringing about a deeper understanding of the culture and disadvantage facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, my colleague Dr Michael Wooldridge, announced the Opposition's support for this Bill in June when he told the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA>This is significant because it is the first time in eight years that there has been bipartisan support for a major piece of Aboriginal affairs legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Our support came after six months of deliberation, work and consultation during which the Government addressed many of the concerns we placed before it. I refer in particular to a letter from the Leader of the Opposition, Dr John Hewson, to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) dated 14 May 1991. In the concluding remarks of that letter Dr Hewson says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is our view that for any process to succeed there must be consultation with all Australians and not just one section of the community. This will ensure wide community involvement, which is essential if any ``process of reconciliation'' is to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Consultation with the wider community can be particularly beneficial as, in itself, it can lead to greater understanding and respect by Australians of Aboriginal culture and issues. </PARA>
<PARA> A process which improves broad community understanding and Aboriginal self-esteem offers the best hope of an environment in which Aboriginal advancement programs will succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> My response to you comes after wide consultation with Liberal and National Party leaders and organisations throughout Australia. If you are prepared to set up a Council that will focus at a community level on the well-being of Aboriginal people, that does not have an Instrument of Reconciliation as a means to a Treaty as its stated or even unstated aim and that will undertake genuine consultation with all Australians, then there is a basis on which we can go forward. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is determined that this Council should focus on a process of reconciliation at the community level rather than pursue vague national concepts. The Opposition also believes that the process of reconciliation should work to establish agreed goals and annual benchmarks for progress in areas such as education, health, housing and infrastructure. In other words, that the process of reconciliation should provide a tangible improvement in Aboriginal well-being. </PARA>
<PARA> For a moment let us put this in the context of what we mean when we talk about reconciliation for Aboriginal people. There are roughly 220,000 Aboriginal people in Australia; I hope the recent census will update that figure and give us a more appropriate measure of where we stand today. However, the statistics with which we generally work imply that 220,000 people in this country claim that an Aboriginal heritage is important to them. Of these, I estimate that 100,000 are participating well and routinely in the general community. While there are many special government financial programs to assist many of them because of their Aboriginal heritage, they generally operate, as I said, well and routinely in the community. I would categorise the remaining 120,000-and I hope I do not offend anyone in doing this-into two groups: I believe about half, around 60,000 people, are still traditional, ceremony-linked people living in isolated and remote communities throughout Australia, and the other 60,000 people are generally what are described, sometimes unfairly, as fringe-dwellers who live an abject and rotten lifestyle where awful health standards and shocking alcohol abuse, and the ramifications of these issues, pose major social problems throughout our community. </PARA>
<PARA> My own family relationships with the Aboriginal community and my electorate of the Northern Territory bring me into daily contact with all sectors of Aboriginal society. I have formed the view that all Aborigines, no matter what grouping they may identify with, have no alternative but to live in two cultures simultaneously, with the conflicting and competing values and standards of those two cultures. </PARA>
<PARA> The other 17 million Australians basically have to cope in only one culture. Generally, the values and standards that we have inherited from Europe, Asia or elsewhere are very similar, despite the ethnic differences. The issues that we have to seriously address on the topic of dealing with Aboriginal Australians generally relate to two main subjects that need to be debated and continually considered. The issues that we need to give priority to are the issues of disadvantage and discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past four years I have asked thousands of questions in the Federal Parliament and in Senate Estimates committees relating to the waste and inefficiency in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. I make no apologies; my motives in concentrating on this portfolio were and are to improve the efficiency of service delivery, to demand accountability for taxpayers' funds and to guarantee that Aborigines get improved access to basic services, not bloated bureaucracies. I have continually concentrated on aspects of funding in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio that ends up being wasted, primarily in administrative functions and salaries for white bureaucrats who often do not meet the important needs that I would like to see met in Aboriginal communities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not always, but occasionally, yes. I am therefore relieved that this Council will be subject to an annual assessment of its performance. The Prime Minister agreed to this request when he wrote to the Leader of the Opposition in May this year proposing the measures of accountability. These included a strategic plan stating the goals, objectives and strategies of the Council, as well as a requirement to report annually. The Prime Minister indicated that a copy of the annual report would be laid before each House of Parliament and a further copy would be referred to the chairperson of the House of Representatives committee responsible for matters relating to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister acknowledged the Opposition's concern that the process of reconciliation should not have as its aim, hidden or overt, the achievement of an instrument of reconciliation. I think that is most important. In her comments Senator Giles referred to the recent statement by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Robert Tickner, on 31 July 1991 to the Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the United Nations. In that address I note that Mr Tickner has tempered the remarks that have been made on previous occasions to the same international working group. The language he has used is no longer what I would term provocative in the political sense. It is certainly seeking an aim and an objective consistent with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> On this particular issue of concentration on a `treaty', or whatever name it goes by, the Minister has acknowledged that a function of the Council will be to determine whether reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people would be advanced by a formal document or documents. It is a matter for the consideration of the Council but it is not a primary goal or a predetermined factor. This has certainly been an issue that has been most provocative in the community in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> In a political statement by a Minister there are always issues with which we would disagree or on which we would take a different viewpoint. I certainly noted in Mr Tickner's Geneva statement that there were points with which I disagreed, in particular, his comments relating to the recent mining decision at Coronation Hill. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government concluded that mining would constitute a desecration of Jawoyn religious beliefs . . . should be seen as a significant victory for those who respect the rights of Aboriginal people to maintain their traditional religious beliefs and to custodianship of their sacred sites. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that many of my Aboriginal constituents in the Northern Territory and a large number of the Jawoyn people would disagree with that statement by the Minister. I have certainly had representations from my electorate and from the Jawoyn people in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, we are today addressing a new Council and a new process that is going to look, importantly, at objectives that the Government and the Parliament have been addressing recently. I note that the central objective is set out in clause 5 of the Bill, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The object of the establishment of the Council is to promote a process of reconciliation between Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community, based on an appreciation by the Australian community as a whole of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and achievements and of the unique position of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders as the indigenous peoples of Australia, and by means that include the fostering of an ongoing national commitment to co-operate to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>I mentioned earlier that in our community the two main topics to be addressed are those of disadvantage and discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, we need always to bear in mind and to place in proper context that at the moment there are millions of other Australians in poverty and struggling without the benefit of the special schemes and arrangements that are in place for many Aboriginal people. This in itself produces discrimination and automatic comment by other people. There needs therefore to be a proper understanding of Aboriginal issues, particularly by other people who are discriminated against and also disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we also need to be aware that we live in a multicultural society and that ethnic new Australians will often be sceptical and not attracted to many of the issues and topics that arise because of the special cultural differences of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there are many people who live in remote and rural parts of Australia who need to have a major say in the style and the character of their own communities mainly because they must live alongside and with Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, I am fortunate to have an Aboriginal family association and relationship. I find that is something that complements my lifestyle and my appreciation of Aborigines. The fact that my electorate is at least 25 per cent Aborigine gives me a very sensitive approach to this issue, and makes it necessary that I do so. But we always need to be aware that envy is a two-way street, particularly if either an idea or the essential funding for something is being driven from Canberra, Melbourne or Sydney. We need always to be aware of the priorities of people who live in the remote parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that three fundamental principles underline discrimination in Australia generally. They are, firstly, alcohol abuse; secondly, poor public community health standards; and, thirdly, a reaction to unacceptable, noisy behaviour. If we look at these three issues we will see that they are the fundamentals on which any community discriminates in any neighbourhood. We need to address them carefully in the relationships within a neighbourhood, particularly as people live together with Aboriginal people throughout Australia. They are the three significant issues that produce discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> The opposite side of the coin is to look at the positive areas where results are evident. I put on the record a couple of points that need to be recognised. One is public education and the other is public health. For example, the education systems that are being developed by the Northern Territory and various State governments that recognise Aboriginal culture and the needs of Aboriginal people are terribly important. It is only through education improvement and a change in community attitudes that we can counter discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> On public education I am also attracted by the role that is being played by television in the community. In my electorate, Imparja Television operating from Alice Springs is an Aboriginal owned organisation which essentially operates as a commercial television station to the wider community. Because of its ownership, it does have a special consideration for the Aboriginal people of outback Australia. Through those television programs, whether they are special interest programs for Aboriginal communities or whether they are traditional programs, we are seeing very dramatic changes, particularly in the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> I recount a recent visit that I made to Ngukurr, a community in my electorate, where I sat down with elders of the council, I asked them what their favourite television programs were and what programs they felt were most meaningful for their community. One of the elders looked me straight in the eye and said-I am paraphrasing in a white English style-that his first priority was the news and his second priority was The Cosby Show. I pursued that and asked: `Why The Cosby Show?'. His answer was-again I am paraphrasing in a white English way-that for the first time he had seen what it was like inside my lounge room, my bedroom, my kitchen, and how I managed my relationships with my teenage kids. I believe that appreciation comes from the fact that usually an Aboriginal person would not get into my house in a normal operational way. Of course, we know that television has a dramatic effect throughout the community, but on this particular issue it will be vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA> When I address issues such as public health, a number of people will recall the Australia Day statement that I made in Katherine this year when I said that I would rather see a television set put into every Aboriginal humpy before a water tap. It produced quite a reaction. A number of people felt that I was being heartless and cruel in not putting in the essential water tap first. But I was really saying that if we would put in a means of communication, the water tap would soon follow and it would be used properly in the administration of health. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, one of the major concerns of public health in the isolated Aboriginal communities in my electorate relates to a very simple thing; that is, mattresses. Mattresses are on view openly in every community. As I walk through the communities, it is obvious that the mattresses have probably been there for years; they have been soiled; and they have been used and abused or whatever. From my discussions with the community health workers, I believe that a simple thing like a mattress replacement program in those communities where they are generally available at the supermarket and where they would be destroyed monthly would see an absolute turnaround in public health in many of those remote communities. It is a simple thing. This process needs to bring out many of those examples so that we can get simple programs that can be very effective consistently. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned that there is also the need to concentrate on the positive impacts that are happening in the community. In dealing with the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, we always need to be mindful that we must step back from being patronising, embarrassing or offensive. Many people quote the recent improvements in the Moree community. It is not just an isolated example of community improvement. There are hundreds of communities throughout Australia making great strides locally. We need to concentrate on the other positive impacts in the relationships between Aboriginal Australians-for example, the voting participation in the Australian electorate since the 1967 referendum; the work of the churches, the social agencies throughout Australia and the many people who have approached the communities as missionaries or as people with a very special concern in the particular area; and the major programs by State, Northern Territory and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, in the Northern Territory I can quote the success of the community government scheme, which is a special adaptation of local government to suit the needs of the area and has been particularly successful since self-government in the Northern Territory in 1978. What about the positive impact of the sports field? Many people identify with Aboriginal Australians who have a remarkable prowess in sport. What about the concentration on arts appreciation? Aboriginal art is unique. Whether it is in the form of paintings, artefacts or the performing arts, Aboriginal people have a lot to teach us. Their art is very special and valuable. </PARA>
<PARA> We need also to recognise the sympathetic media attention that is attracted to this area. I draw a comparison in saying `sympathetic media attention' because too often people in the media-journalists and others who have had very little exposure to an understanding or an appreciation through a daily working relationship with Aboriginal people-tend to engage in looking at issues that relate only to the ghastly, the tragic or the awful side of many aspects of health areas or issues such as the wastage of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Other areas, such as the joint venture tourism projects, are now being developed throughout Australia, particularly in central and northern Australia. This poses problems for traditional Aborigines to compromise in many respects some of their cultural aspects. But at the same time the participation for employment, for investment and for the future is terribly important and worth noting. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally-and I have probably missed a number of other issues-I pay credit to the role of Aboriginal broadcasting. The broadcasting to remote Aboriginal communities scheme-BRACS-has been specially developed for individual Aboriginal communities. We have also seen the development of special media training units. I am aware of several in the Northern Territory and I am sure that there are others in New South Wales and Queensland. Aboriginal broadcasting forms a very special bridge of understanding between Aboriginal people and the wider community. Whilst there are 220,000 Aboriginal people in Australia out of a population of 17 million-odd, we need to recognise that we must go down the track of accepting that reconciliation is a very important concept. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, I would take issue to a certain extent with the comments of Senator Kernot yesterday in this debate when she drew a parallel to and a comparison with the objectives of this piece of legislation and the other political debate that is going on in the community with regard to republicanism for Australia. I would point out to the Australian Democrats that rhetoric does not solve real problems. The issues in the Aboriginal community are predicated on first addressing the real problems. That can be done only by practical measures and a very intense understanding and appreciation by all members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought not to confuse the date in this Bill of 2001 for its sunset clause with the other objectives that many people may have, and the Democrats may well have, with regard to a republic for Australia. It would be a crime if the focus on republicanism forced the Aboriginal community to be drawn in as part of that debate. The issue that we are addressing here in the reconciliation issues for Australia and Australian Aborigines is a much bigger, wider and very special project. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill 1991. I am particularly pleased that there is all party support for this legislation, which also has the support of a wide range of individuals and organisations in the Australian community, from both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. I pay tribute to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Robert Tickner, and the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, Michael Wooldridge, for the commitment they have shown for this process of reconciliation, which has led to a major step in that process-the introduction of this Bill. It is noteworthy that one of those who spoke strongly and convincingly in support of the Bill in the House was the former Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, Fred Chaney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has taken over 200 years for us to reach this point in the process of reconciliation and even then, in a formal sense, it is a first step. As the preamble to the Bill states, and I quote in part:</PARA>
<PARA>(c) to date, there has been no formal process of reconciliation between Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and other Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA>(d) by the year 2001, the centenary of Federation, it is most desirable there be such a reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is thus the beginning of a formal process to achieve aims which many of us have held for a very long time, recognising, and again I quote from the preamble, that:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) Australia was occupied by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who had settled for thousands of years, before British settlement . . . on 26 January 1788; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) many Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders suffered dispossession and dispersal from their traditional lands by the British Crown . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And, of course, more recently, without the benefit of the British Crown. Those responsible for the preparation and drafting of this Bill should be congratulated not only on its being written in plain English but also on the fact that the language is readily understood with the bare minimum of legal technology. So it should be widely accessible to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that it has taken us 200 years to reach this point, but I should add that we have come a long way, if belatedly, in recent years. I can remember taking part in a campaign back in the late 1940s to urge the then Menzies Government to act to include Aboriginals in the census and to grant citizenship rights to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. At that time not only were they not counted but we still had laws which allowed for segregation on reserves, the compulsory removal of people from their tribal lands-their traditional home-the removal of children from their parents in the name of the child's welfare, and even in some cases for Aboriginals' own bank accounts having to be operated by a socalled protector, often in remote areas the local policeman. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember feeling ashamed of white Australia when, in the 1950s, I found myself able to drink in the bar at the local hotel in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria while the Aboriginals had to drink in the lane outside. A major change came after another 20 years when the referendum of 1967, with cross-party support again, enabled constitutional change to allow for what was effectively full citizenship rights for Aboriginal and Islander people. I say cross-party rather than universal support because there were still groups in the community who opposed the passing of the referendum and were prepared even to hand out how-to-vote cards to that effect. Some of those groups will still, I am sure, be opposed to this legislation. We all know how difficult it is to get a positive result from a referendum, which requires not only a majority of electors but also a majority of States for success. It is noteworthy that the Yes vote in that 1967 referendum left no doubt about the electorate's opinion. It was one of the highest Yes votes ever recorded in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will allow for the establishment of a Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The functions of the Council, as set out in the Bill, are to provide a forum and an instrument to undertake the promotion of reconciliation between Aboriginals, Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community through the processes of education and discussion, fostering cooperation to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage and consultation with the Minister on relevant policies to pursue those aims. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Council is to consult Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community on whether the reconciliation would be advanced finally by a formal document or documents of reconciliation, and following that consultation it will report the outcome to the Minister. If the Council believes that such a document would benefit the Australian community as a whole, it would then make recommendations to the Minister on its nature, content and implementation. So the establishment of the Council will initiate a very important process, with no prescribed action at the end but the clear expectation that appropriate action will result. </PARA>
<PARA> Attitude change, as we all know particularly in this place, is always a slow process. But I believe the powers and functions of the Council will enable it to assist in accelerating the rate of change of attitude through the consultative and reporting functions set out in the Bill. This process will, of course, run in parallel with the implementation of policies of direct and practical concern in the areas of, for example, Aboriginal health, education and housing. Senator Tambling has focused on a number of areas where that action is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that the work of this Council is to carry out a process. The Bill specifies some of its powers without limiting those powers-for example, the power to hold inquiries, conduct research, and organise public education activities. It is also required to develop strategic plans for each three-year period up until the year 2001. These plans will be placed before both Houses of Parliament, as will the annual reports. The Bill contains a sunset clause; the Act will cease to be in force on 1 January 2001. Clearly there is an expectation that the Council's work will be satisfactorily completed by that date. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer briefly to the composition of the Council because that reflects the cross-party and community consultation which preceded the introduction of this Bill. One member will be nominated by each of the Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives and any non-Government party of at least five members that is not part of the Opposition. At the moment, of course, that would be the Australian Democrats, but it could involve other parties in the future. The total size of the Council allows for this and other flexibilities by providing that membership must be at least 15 and at most 25, of whom at least 12 must be Aborigines and at least two Torres Strait Islanders. I support what Senator Kernot had to say yesterday about the importance of the Torres Strait Islanders being recognised in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a further innovation in the clauses relating to meetings which might on occasion and with adequate safeguards be adopted by Senate committees and possibly other parliamentary committees. Clause 16(8) states:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Council so determines, a member may participate in, and form part of a quorum at, a meeting of the Council by . . . telephone; closed-circuit television; [and] any other method of communication determined by the Council.</PARA>
<PARA>There have been occasions, particularly when plane schedules have been disrupted by bad weather, when hearings of our committees here have been postponed or even aborted. Such cases occur when one person is not able to fly in and consequently a quorum cannot be formed. A provision such as that contained in clause 16(8) would enable a committee to proceed in that case. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the provision in the Bill giving members of parliaments and local government bodies the capacity to be members of the Council. Their involvement may greatly assist the Council's role. For example, it would allow direct access to State education policy. In the debate in the House of Representatives, several speeches referred to shameful examples of what appeared in school textbooks in some States in the not so distant past-within the last 20 years. References were made to Aboriginals in appallingly racist terms. I hope those examples have disappeared from curricula. It is important to ensure that all school children have the opportunity to learn about Aboriginal history and Aboriginal culture. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was at school-and that was in the 1940s-I did not get my first insight into Aboriginal culture until year 12, and not many, particularly girls, got to year 12 level in those days. We studied Eleanor Dark's novel The Timeless Land. That had a considerable impact on me, and I later followed up some of the questions she raised and became very impressed by Aboriginal culture and beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA> This sort of experience needs to happen much earlier in children's education so that they can grow up with that knowledge and appreciation and, importantly, without the prejudice that regrettably we still see exhibited by many adults. An understanding of the history of the dispossession of the Aboriginal people must surely bring an understanding of their present position of disadvantage. On that understanding can be built a resolve and activity to end that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As parliamentarians, we have a special responsibility to back policies to address past and present disadvantage through the implementation of, for example, the national Aboriginal health strategy. In order to do this, we need the support of State governments and local government bodies. All this depends, at least in part, on the total electorate being more aware of the needs and rights of Aboriginal and Islander Australians. We must support the passage of this Bill in the Senate and then continue to take an interest in and show support for the work of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I can think of no better way to celebrate our real 100th birthday as a nation in the year 2001 than to have achieved a measure of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. I believe that this Bill is a strong step towards that goal and I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am somewhat hesitant to speak on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill 1991, and I did think twice about doing so. But the Opposition does strongly support this measure as an all-party piece of legislation. I was hesitant because although in my lifetime I have lived in four States of Australia and the Australian Capital Territory-I now live in Tasmania-I have rarely known many Aboriginals at all, so I feel singularly unqualified to speak on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in my past I had a role model-a fine Aboriginal man who taught me to ride a pony when I was a very small girl. When I was a university student, I was a member of the student representative council at the Melbourne University when Aboriginal scholarships were introduced for the first time. We students raised money to establish the first Aboriginal university scholarships. Margaret Valadian and one young man whose name I cannot remember were the first recipients of those Aboriginal scholarships. I am glad that I had a tiny part in making that possible. Now, many more Aboriginal people go to university. As a Liberal, I am proud of the fact that Senator Neville Bonner was a Liberal Aboriginal senator in this place before I was elected. I have always had high regard for Charlie Perkins, who was a role model for many Aborigines in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people are not why I am speaking today, although I think of them with honour. I have responsibility in the Opposition for assisting Dr Hewson in the status of women portfolio. To do that more effectively and knowledgeably, this year I have paid a succession of visits to the Northern Territory and central Australia to try to make myself better informed about Aboriginal women in rural Australia. I hope to make myself better informed shortly about women's issues in urban and semi-urban regions of Australia. I am very grateful to my colleague Senator Tambling for facilitating my visits in the Territory. I visited a number of communities, all very different, some more remote than others. In none of those communities have I ever heard of a wish for apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only when I go home to Tasmania and hear Michael Mansell speak that I begin to wonder whether there are any others like him who seem to have an appetite for separate development. As an Australian, I am glad to think that the Aboriginals that I have met so far have expressed no such wish at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that there are special pressures on the Northern Territory and on those States which have large Aboriginal populations-pressures which we in States which have small Aboriginal populations do not face and, therefore, do not well understand. I recognise that those who have large communities in urban situations have different problems to cope with, but I always believe that there is a need for Aboriginals to have participation in the full, wider Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, I do not profess to come here with answers, or even with much knowledge at all, but I do come here with messages. Only last week I was sitting with women in the desert in central Australia. They said to me so urgently, `Take a message to Canberra for us. We want you to take a message to Canberra. Help us to help our men and our sons'. Of course, that does not mean to say that they were not concerned about themselves and their daughters, but they are so concerned about their men and their sons because in some communities they are concerned about kava; in most communities they are concerned about alcohol abuse; and in some communities they are concerned about petrol sniffing, particularly by the boys. </PARA>
<PARA> In the community I visited last week, the women had formed themselves into a night patrol. They were told that there was no money for uniforms for their night patrol. They felt it was important that they be seen to have some official capacity and, therefore, they thought uniforms were appropriate. So they set to and raised the money in order for this group of older women to have `night patrol' embroidered on their uniform dress. They spend their evenings patrolling their community to see whether illegal drinking is taking place because that community has banned alcohol altogether. Where they find alcohol being consumed they report it to the police and normal action takes place. It is a bit like our Neighbourhood Watch, I guess, but with special emphasis on their special needs. </PARA>
<PARA> In that community they spoke to me about their need for a refuge for women from violence brought about by drink. In another community I visited, the women talked about the women's centre that they had already established, and the need to put a high fence around it so that men could not get in when under the influence of drink and attack their women who had run to the refuge for protection. They were setting up a system of putting an older woman on duty each night in the women's refuge in order to protect the younger women seeking refuge, but they felt even that was not enough and they needed a high fence as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Women were telling me about those things. They told me also about their concerns that, because of the addiction of a number of their men to alcohol, these men were now refusing to go bush and take the young men with them. Not only was alcohol debilitating the men, but it was also preventing the young men and boys from learning of their culture and their tribal skills. The young men were also growing up with role models of men who were continually under the influence. </PARA>
<PARA> In every community women spoke about the lack of jobs and their despair at what would happen to their young men and women without the hope that employment brings. They do not seem to have any satisfaction at all from being able to draw a welfare cheque. They want work for their young people. They very proudly showed me the artwork and the crafts that they did. They showed me how it was done and in some places it was extremely well displayed. They are also now able to turn some of these skills into very good economic value for their communities. Some of the work I saw was beautiful. </PARA>
<PARA> I visited a training centre at Nungalinya in Darwin. I think it is a theological college, but a special program is being run under the auspices of that college that is not related to the theological part of it. In this program, women from all over northern Australia-from the Torres Strait Islands, the Kimberley and throughout the Territory-are brought in for a year. From a community a woman is chosen who has some quality of leadership which will enable her, once she gets extra skills, to go back and act as a leader for other women in her community. </PARA>
<PARA> The women spend a year away from home and for some of them that is extremely difficult because they suffer great pangs of homesickness. I think they get home once or twice during that year. A number of them, of course, are mothers and that can provide difficulties, too, with them either bringing their children with them or leaving them back home with a grandmother. During that year, literacy and numeracy skills are supported and encouraged. What is very interesting to me is that small business skills are developed so that the art and the crafts, which they produce so well, can be turned to good effect, and so that they have the business management ability to make sure that their goods are costed properly, they can keep proper records and apply for financial assistance for capital, where needed. They also receive training in health and nutrition. </PARA>
<PARA> They find great value in learning of each other's culture because they tend to live in communities where they do not have access to communities hundreds of miles away. The women I spoke to found it extremely valuable to learn what others cooked, what sort of paintings they did, what songs they sang and even what jokes they told. As I say, they go back to their people at the end of the year to be leaders amongst the women in their community. </PARA>
<PARA> Only recently, I read in a Territory newspaper that one of the major companies-I cannot remember whether it was a petrol company but it might have been Esso; Senator Tambling might recall-had voted some money to help this training scheme to continue, because the women do live on a very small financial allocation. The program seems to me to be very effective and the women are very pleased with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to reflect for a moment on the well-meaning actions of the past. There have been so many attempts over the years by white Australians to do what they thought was the right thing at the time to help Aboriginals, but so many of them have reaped most unfortunate-certainly unplanned-results. I am thinking about, for example, the changes to the stockman's pay in the 1960s. We would all recognise that a person is entitled to a fair pay for a fair day's work. The changes to the stockman's pay was seen to be a matter of equity-no doubt it was-and yet, certainly in the Territory, it has very clearly led to a great loss of jobs and, in many instances, to a loss of the health and welfare support which many families received on the stations. </PARA>
<PARA> Another change that has not all been for the good has been the review by the churches of their involvement in Aboriginal work. Although I recognise that in the past there have been some communities where missionaries perhaps or the churches have had patronising attitudes, the caring role of the missionaries has diminished since that review. What is not widely recognised, perhaps, is how important the role of the church was-particularly the Catholic Church, I understand-in enhancing the status of women in some communities. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that might be surprising, because sometimes we think that the Catholic Church has not been all that great for the status of women in some white countries. But I understand that in earlier days a bishop in the Territory bought women brides and was then able to free up those women to become wives in love marriages which, of course, gave them a special status. The examples of the nuns as women in positions of authority in the schools and the hospitals has also been very valuable for a number of Aboriginal women. </PARA>
<PARA> Another well-meaning action in the past, which I think had some appalling results, was the removal of children to be placed in white foster homes, as Senator Zakharov mentioned earlier. I spoke to one woman who for 20 years knew nothing of her mother, and only now that she is a grandmother herself is she able to share the joy of her children and her grandchildren with her own mother. Some people never found their families again and grew up in a half world where they did not have access to their cultural ties. </PARA>
<PARA> Another well-meaning action, if you like, was when Aboriginals were in fact allowed to drink alcohol freely. That certainly means equality with other Australians but the unplanned result is the ghastly problem which is being grappled with now by so many of the communities. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly I mention health care and social security payments, which are obviously so important and so vital for all Australians, but where there are people in remote communities, especially if they have been nomadic people, the requirement to stay in one place to have access to some of these services means that they are losing their traditional ways of living and their survival skills. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to concentrate on the past. Today is a time for looking to the future. The Council for Reconciliation is a positive exercise, and we must look to what can be done in the future. I do not think stacks of money is the answer. Money is important but there have been billions of dollars spent in the past, much of which has been wasted by both blacks and whites. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a Council for Reconciliation, as I say, but sometimes I think it could have been better named a council for understanding. We need to concentrate on things which we see are fair and equitable for all Australians because the problems being faced in Aboriginal communities are frequently the same as those faced by all Australians. They may have different ways of decision making and of approaching their problems, but they are problems-especially for women-that we face all around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the basics which we must insist that all Aboriginal people share with us? I believe that all Australians need a legal system which protects Aborigines no less than we are protected. They need health services which will allow them to raise their children to good, healthy adulthood. They need to be able to look after their elderly. I believe, above all, that all Australians need education if they are to break out of a cycle of disadvantage. It is doubly important if Aboriginals are to cope with the two cultures in which they live. </PARA>
<PARA> When I say education, I mean both formal school education and cultural education. For one reason or another many Aboriginal children are not spending enough time in school and are missing out on the chance to break out of their disadvantage. As I mentioned earlier, many of them are also starting to miss out on their cultural education. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal children also need role models. In the past Aboriginal soldiers and footballers were important role models. Aboriginals still have sports and military skills. But they need other role models-cultural and artistic ones, and tertiary graduates. I look forward keenly to the day when we see white advisers moving aside and handing over to qualified Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning, I am only a newcomer to these issues. I do not profess to have expertise, but I do speak today to fulfil a promise which I made to the women in the Northern Territory. They asked me to carry a message to Canberra. They asked me to tell of their worry about the grog. They want that to be widely known. They want Canberra to know about the violence that that grog brings and of the example it gives to the young of the way adults live, thus perpetuating the problem. It helps to keep their children from school; it is reducing the nourishment available to those children and it is affecting their health. It is causing a lack of self-esteem in the communities. </PARA>
<PARA> The women are trying all sorts of measures to deal with that problem. They are trying to prevent their boys taking to alcohol and petrol sniffing but they are having great difficulties. They need support and understanding. I am told that the hope for the future lies with the women. On every hand I have been told that-by the women themselves, by white advisers, and by bureaucrats. Everybody says that the hope for the future lies with the women. Those women I have met so far in the Northern Territory have impressed me with their clear-eyed assessments of their communities and of the need for action from within the communities. I have only begun to learn from Aboriginal women so that I can work with my colleague, the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, Dr Wooldridge. </PARA>
<PARA> As we said, we support the Council for Reconciliation. We do not want to spend the time, however, in warm, woolly goodwill. We look very earnestly to the important strategic plans outlined in the legislation. We look for practical achievements in reconciliation. The first step must surely be, however, for those of us who have not had contact with Aboriginals, to make sure that we learn and thereby understand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to make a contribution to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill 1991. I do not want to canvass the broad issues which other speakers have covered. I do not want to run over a whole litany of the goods and bads from times past. I do want to make a couple of points, though.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One point is reconciliation, and what reconciliation might mean. It is an interesting word. I looked it up in the dictionary and it seemed to say, `To encourage opposing views to get to be at one', or sentiments along those lines. It is a curiously interesting definition of reconciliation. It seems to describe differences and getting to a position of togetherness, but it does not mention the process of reconciliation. That process is not contained in the definition. I would have thought that if we were serious in addressing this Bill we would need to understand that process of reconciliation. In some ways the contents of the Bill try to address that, and in one important way I suspect they might have missed it. </PARA>
<PARA> Other things which are not written into the legislation come under the heading of reconciliation. By the way, I would say too that I find it curious that it is called the Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill. I suppose it is not an unreasonable title, but who are the Aboriginal people being reconciled to or with? It really ought to have a title like the Australian Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill. I do not like the inference that the Aboriginal people are to be reconciled. To my way of thinking the other side of that reconciliation equation is implicit, but it would be better stated. </PARA>
<PARA> Another dimension which is important to reconciliation is the notion of forgiveness. We are dealing here in particular with the importance of white people forgiving themselves for the sins committed by their forebears. The history of white people in this country is utterly disgraceful in large areas. It is a matter of the current generation of Australians learning that history. We cannot afford to keep sweeping it under the carpet or out of view. We have to bring that history into the full light of day. We have to confront it and we have to forgive ourselves for being part of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also very important that we do not then become confused about guilt that should be ascribed to people from two and three generations ago. But we have to appreciate the process of forgiveness that has to be gone through. I do not believe we can move to a satisfactory reconciliation without admitting that those things happened and without going through the process of acknowledging and appreciating it and forgiving ourselves for it-or our parents and grandparents-because that forgiveness is part of a healing process that is necessary before we can satisfactorily work together or achieve reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a lot of people in this country have to confront issues such as shame, anger and responsibility. It is not only black people who might want to be angry; there are many white people who might want to be very angry. I think we have to allow an opportunity for people, both black and white, in this country to confront that anger. Until we acknowledge it and confront it, I think it has the chance to fester and bubble up from time to time and prevent an adequate process of reconciliation. Under the heading `Functions', clause 6(1) (b) states:</PARA>
<PARA> 6.(1) The functions of the Council are:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to promote, by leadership, education and discussion, a deeper understanding by all Australians of the history, cultures, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and of the need to redress that disadvantage . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I am very concerned about that definition of a function, because it is easily able to be read in terms of the history of disadvantage, the history of evils done and the history of injuries, dispossession and crime against Aboriginal people. In that definition I do not see a strong enough urging for a recognition of the greatness, wisdom and understanding of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> We sometimes refer to Aboriginal culture as though it is all we need to know to understand the strengths and values of Aboriginal people. One of the things that sometimes makes me very angry is the loss of information and wisdom that we have suffered because we did not know-did not want to know-that black people in this country had things to tell us, whether that was in the late eighteenth century or the nineteenth century. </PARA>
<PARA> I almost suspect it was not until we invented the Bush Tucker Man that we understood that Aboriginal people knew how to feed themselves. That is a bit flippant, but I do not think it is too remote from the truth. People have marvelled at how Aborigines survived for 50,000 years, as though it were something that was rained on them. That these ridiculously insufficient people could have survived for 50,000 years never seemed to challenge white people or suggest that the Aborigines were a wise people who had a lot of skills and information. </PARA>
<PARA> In learning the history of Aboriginal people, I hope that we do not confine it to the history of white people's ills against Aboriginal people, but that we make sure history addresses the culture, stories, legends, strengths, wisdom and knowledge of Aboriginal people. The very best way for us to be reconciled is to appreciate the qualities of Aboriginal people. For many years it has been pointed out that the Aboriginal people had no qualities and, in many cases, were less than human-they were sub-normal-so we did not have to regard them with the same respect. That is the kind of attitude and history that we have to undo. In looking at that history, I hope we do not focus only on the litany of disadvantage and dispossession. They are vital for us to know, but they are really for us to know about ourselves. I think we must make sure that we honour and learn Aboriginal history. I hope that is powerfully told by this legislation. When I first read that definition, I did not feel that the words, which would encourage a good story to be told about Aboriginal people, preferably by themselves, were said strongly enough. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise a couple of points that I think we have to appreciate. I was delighted that Senator Newman thought that the Catholic Church might have advantaged women by having bishops buying black women. I wish she had told the whole story-it sounds wonderful-about the Catholic bishop who buys Aboriginal women. I think this is to redeem them from planned marriages. Let us hope that the Senate and all those listening are fully aware of the whole story because, at the moment, this bishop has an exciting reputation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Presumably, he was alive when he was doing the buying. I am delighted that there might be some ways in which we could look at any church-Catholic, Protestant or of whatever ilk-in this country that did anything honourable for women. It is not the history of christianity over the last 200 years. One of the really sad things is that both the church history and the colonial history of white male superiority has been perpetrated in this country. Women, even white women, know the struggle we have had to get fair recognition of the rights of women in this country. One certainly would not want to have the double disadvantage of being Aboriginal and a woman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I am not going to object or totally oppose Senator Newman's conclusions, I am glad there was one stunning exception to the general rule. Women, in particular, were foully abused, and Aboriginal women were more foully abused, as white male supremists ran this country to their preferred view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to examine, for example, why children were removed from Aboriginal communities. It would be very interesting to know the parentage of the children who were removed. Very often the children who were removed were the children of white fathers and black mothers. A lot of people have not wanted to face up to that fact. These were not full-blooded Aboriginal children who were removed from their reservations, they were half-castes. It is a history of appalling abuse of black women and the further appalling abuse of denying them their children. We have seen, and are now able to read, the stories written by some of those children. I do not suppose that there are any better written than the stories of Sally Morgan about the consequences and the damage done to those children. </PARA>
<PARA> I have met Aboriginal women in South Australia who are not fearfully old. They can show me the cards they were asked to carry-indeed, were required to carry-that exempted them from being Aboriginal so that they could be employed and paid white rates for house cleaning and that kind of work. But to enter into the paid work force, they had to have a card-a certificate, a little booklet-issued to them that exempted them from being Aboriginal. </PARA>
<PARA> We have committed most appalling crimes against Aboriginal people, and we have done that with very little self-awareness of what we were doing, not only to Aboriginal people but also to ourselves. Some of those battles for the rights of people, black or white, and the rights of women, I think, mean that this reconciliation Bill has the prospect of allowing some very constructive and useful reappraisal of past history. We have very little to be comfortable about. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I support the intention of this legislation. We admit to our consciousness the importance of appreciating the contribution of Aboriginal people; more particularly, their rights to be full Australian citizens. We have dispossessed them of those rights, and now, in returning some of those rights to Aboriginal people, we have to acknowledge the part played in that by white people. As I said earlier, I think that is a very necessary step before full reconciliation can proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> I also suggest that it may be a journey of fairly exciting discovery because, in learning about Aboriginal culture and history, people in Australia, black and white, will only be the richer for that knowledge. This Bill will help us to understand that Aboriginal people are not of one type but are as varied and as many as the Aboriginal communities around this country. It will also allow us to focus on the sorts of ways Aboriginal people ask for assistance. If we have learnt anything, it is that until people are in a position to campaign for their own rights those rights cannot be given. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of Aboriginal reserves, cultures or groups in respect of alcohol in this country is probably a very illustrative case in point. Sometimes these groups were denied access to alcohol and had dry areas, and so on. That denial was done at best as benevolent paternalism and at worst as a number of other things that we could describe as oppressive or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures were never satisfactory. People do not do well by being denied the right to make their own choices. The fact that in the end people may choose wrongly is their right. We have seen the culture change so that Aboriginal people could choose to have alcohol or alcohol was no longer forbidden to them. They have come to face the fact that, for many of them, alcohol is a very destructive and fatal drug. It is now very interesting to see Aboriginal people making the decision that alcohol is destructive for them and that they want to make decisions about how much and what access they have to it. That is the way to sanity, good health and proper government, and that is what Aboriginal people have been denied for some 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought it would be splendid if this reconciliation Bill could clear the deck absolutely of any of those repressions or areas where Aboriginal people are not able to make decisions for themselves. When those decision making processes can be more aligned with the decision making processes of everybody else in this country-that is, the more we are one-the more that will be a constructive outcome of this Bill. I commend the idea behind the Bill. It is a fairly challenging concept to introduce something like a conciliation Bill. If this is a step that will allow a healing process between white and black in this country, it should be approved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my Party predecessor in this debate, Senator Kernot, has already pointed out, the Australian Democrats strongly support, and always have, the idea of the conclusion of an instrument of reconciliation between the indigenous and non-indigenous people of Australia. During the debate on the ATSIC legislation, we deliberately removed the preamble from that Bill to ensure that this process was given a much more prominent place in the process of reconciliation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I have some reservations about the wording of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill 1991 and some of the directions which it seems to me that the wording indicates the Government is taking. As Senator Crowley and other speakers have pointed out, Aboriginal people have been in Australia for a very long time. The estimates vary, but a figure of 40,000 to 50,000 years is not at all unusual. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, we-and I say `we' in the sense of the white, predominantly European culture in this country-have recognised the need to move our whole cultural system towards what we have come to call sustainability. We recognise a system of attitudes to the use of resources such as land and the exploitation of people and the environment. If we can regard that as the total cultural system within which the dominant culture in Australia operates, we have come to recognise that that system is not sustainable, that we are heading for destruction and degradation in the quality of life of our children and our descendants. If we cast around for an example of a culture which did contain the notion of, and understood the requirement for, sustainability and which did preserve, albeit with some significant changes-I am not denying that-a cultural understanding deeply embedded at its roots, we need look no further than the indigenous culture of Australia, our own Aboriginal culture. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with this question of reconciliation, it seemed to me for some time that it is not simply a matter of saying to Aboriginal people, `We are sorry for what has happened in the last 200 years. Come across, for we now accept you into full citizenship. You can become a part of our predominant culture society'. It must become more a process by which we discover the mechanisms by which we weld together those elements of the Aboriginal culture and other elements of the dominant European culture and build a totally new culture. To my mind, that is what reconciliation needs to be about. </PARA>
<PARA> The introductory clause of this legislation begins with the word `because' and refers to how Australia was occupied by Aborigines, et cetera, for thousands of years. It also talks about their dispossession, and so on. Part (d) states:</PARA>
<PARA>as a part of the reconciliation process, the Commonwealth will seek an ongoing national commitment from governments at all levels to co-operate and to co-ordinate with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as appropriate to address progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations in relation to land, housing, law and justice, cultural heritage, education, employment, health, infrastructure, economic development and any other relevant matters in the decade leading to the centenary of Federation, 2001:</PARA>
<PARA>I am suspicious that those words are based yet again on the notion that what we have to do is simply welcome, at long last, Aboriginal people into white society so that they become, as it were, like us. If that is the basis of this process which we are putting in train, not only will it fail but also it will fail the majority of the Australian population because it will have failed to pick up that essential quality of Aboriginal culture which allowed it to survive in this country for 50,000 years and which attitude is absolutely necessary for the dominant, white, exploitative, market driven, competitive culture to adopt. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do not, we have lost a marvellous opportunity. As I have said earlier, we will leave a damaged world to our children. But if we do choose this alternative path towards reconciliation, then in the process we will be saying to Aboriginal people, `We recognise that within your culture you have something which is supremely valuable, so valuable that it is necessary that it be shared and built into a new culture and shared by every person and every process in this country. We need to become a lot more like you, not you like us'. In doing that, we will really be giving back to Aboriginal people the dignity and the respect which we have taken from them progressively over the last 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, like most indigenous people throughout the world, developed a culture which was dependent on a specific relationship with land and with the natural environment. It was a factor which resulted in a more caring, indeed a spiritual, relationship in these cultures which is not shared by the industrial societies which have come to look on the natural environment as a commodity merely to be traded for profit. One needs only to look in our newspapers each weekend to see how land has simply become a commodity. One can contrast the growing price of land with the Aboriginal attitude, which was no different from that of most other indigenous people around the world. It was indeed the attitude which our own forebears had to land for many tens, and possibly millions, of years. It is an attitude that we need to rediscover. If reconciliation is to be achieved, I believe the process must include the explicit recognition of this difference and, on the part of the non-indigenous population, the recognition of the legitimacy and the value of this central element of indigenous culture. </PARA>
<PARA> This does not mean merely a recognition of land rights, although, of course, this is important. It means a mind shift in mainstream Australian thinking. Bringing about this mind shift is a task which I suggested first at the time of the Bicentenary. It is a mind shift which I have already indicated is necessary if proper reconciliation is to occur. I would suggest that, while the successful negotiation of an instrument of reconciliation is an important step, it is only the first step. One of the keys to the survival of industrial civilisation is to be found in the special relationship which Aboriginal and Islander people had with the natural environment. The conscious acknowledgment of the value of what these old Australians can bring to this new culture-this integrated culture-would seal the process of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make one final point before I sit down. Successive statements by government, particularly the Labor Government in recent years, have spoken of the original occupiers and owners of this land being dispossessed and dispersed without compensation. When I was responsible for the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs, I travelled quite extensively around Australia and spoke to Aboriginal and Islander groups. I frequently asked them the question, `Have you ever been consulted as to your attitude to bringing more people into Australia?'. As far as I can determine, the indigenous people of this country have never-I repeat, never-been consulted as to whether they want more people to be brought in. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that expressions of concern about dispossession are meaningless-in fact, they are dishonest-if that dispossession is continued without consultation. The present immigration program represents an extension of dispossession for three reasons. The first is the lack of consultation to which I have already referred. The second is based on the general proposition that, if all of Australia is owned by all Australians, the larger the number of non-indigenous Australians the smaller the proportion of Australia nominally owned by the indigenous people-and that is simply a mathematical calculation. Thirdly, and most importantly, the economic emphasis in the present immigration program-especially the business migration and skills migration parts of that program-means bringing into this country people who are inimical to Aboriginal culture and to the synthesis of the two cultures to which I have been referring. </PARA>
<PARA> I have an indelible memory of an interview with one very rich American immigrant who had bought a large pastoral property in the Northern Territory. When he was asked the reasons why he came to Australia, he gave as his primary reason, and I am quoting him as best I know, `You know how to treat your niggers in this country'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I felt sickened that we were bringing such people into Australia and, through the transfer of wealth, according them considerable power to influence the economic and cultural direction of this country. I am interested in Senator Tate's interjection. I suggest to him that, under the present immigration laws, if there were a person identical in every respect to an Aboriginal person who was outside this country, that person would not be admitted as an immigrant to Australia. That to my mind indicates the culturist nature of the immigration program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are deliberately selecting people who have shown an exploitative tendency and whom we believe will fit in more vigorously with the mainstream, competitive, market driven, environmentally damaging approach to economic development. We are discouraging the alternative sorts of people, those who care for the environment. In fact, understanding or care of the environment has never been a factor in our selection of immigrants. It seems to me also that in this attitude to immigration, the way in which we select people, we are simply saying to the Aboriginal people, `We do not respect your culture. Your culture has nothing to give to a new and sustainable Australian culture. You must become like us. We are simply going to bring more people in who are like us to dominate this country'. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to overcome that attitude. We need, as I have said, to be able to say to Aboriginal people, `You do have within your culture something which is supremely valuable, without which none of us will survive into the distant future'. We need to make that element central to a new culture. That is the path to sustainability. We can do it by recognition of the value of Aboriginal culture, and that process will give back to Aboriginal people a dignity and a pride in what they are contributing to an Australia which, hopefully, will be here not just for our children and our grandchildren but also for our descendants well into the very distant future. If we do not do that, if we simply see reconciliation as making Aboriginal people clones of white European Australians, I think we will have lost a very valuable opportunity to the detriment of everybody, and not only will this legislation have failed but we will have failed to take up the opportunity to build a truly sustainable society in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill. The coalition is supporting this legislation as a genuine attempt to achieve what it says, a better understanding between Aboriginal and other Australians. We do, however, acknowledge that it has been amended to recognise some very proper concerns that the coalition has raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular, it is important that a positive note be struck in place of the emphasis on failure and grievance that may gladden the hearts of the trendy middle class, so often over-represented in our structures of government, but does nothing to secure a better understanding between ordinary Australians. Thus, I believe it is essential that clause 5 refer to the appreciation of Aboriginal culture and achievements in place of earlier stress on dispossession and disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> It is equally important that the functions of the Council enumerated in clause 6 refer also to the wider Australian community and the need for any final document to benefit the Australian community as a whole. That is a real start. It is a positive note, and it is the first time we have actually seen that type of statement in regard to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> For too long such a recognition has quite clearly been absent from the policies of the Hawke Labor Government. It is extremely important to me particularly, as a Western Australian senator, that under clause 6(2) (c) the Council is directed to consult the State and Territory governments, because quite often we see attempts by this Government to override the wishes of the States and the Territories, when in fact it should be the ultimate decision of the States and Territories as to what they impose on their people. Failure in the past to extend real cooperation to State governments that continue to provide so many basic services to Aboriginal people has resulted only in wasteful duplication and divisive policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I also very much welcome the fact that a sunset clause ensures that the Act will terminate at the end of the decade. The last thing that we need in the field of Aboriginal affairs is yet another self-perpetuating structure. On the other hand, I must voice certain reservations about this Bill. In the preamble, item (b) refers to `dispossession and dispersal from their traditional lands by the British Crown'. Again, there is a reference in clause 6(b) to promoting, inter alia, understanding of `past dispossession' of Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned not so much about arguing the facts of history as about the potential for these statements, when taken out of context, to be used in justification of a future campaign for some kind of national land rights legislation. It has been made quite clear to me over a very long period of time that the people in Western Australia simply do not want any form of land rights and will not countenance governments superimposing land rights over property in their State. I think it is important that this Government recognise that now, because it has had plenty of opportunity to know and understand the feelings of the people in Western Australia, and to date has not done so. </PARA>
<PARA> Land rights have been a most divisive feature of policy debate over the past decade, and I can assure the Senate that the concept of enforcing such a policy is, as I say, totally and utterly non-negotiable and unacceptable to the people of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that, if the Council is to have between 15 and 25 members, with a minimum of 12 Aboriginal and two Torres Strait Islander members, there may not be a great deal of scope for many non-Aboriginal community representatives. The Council will not succeed if these people are not representative of the general community, and we will not do Aboriginal Australians any favours whatsoever, in the short or long term, if these appointees are known to be biased in favour of land rights and against mining, or are people with uncritical acceptance of radical Aboriginal viewpoints. </PARA>
<PARA> Knowing the sorts of views that those appointed by the Labor Party and the Democrats are likely to hold, I have a very grave concern that the Council may be saddled with some predictable views that are out of sympathy with the great mass of Australians, who have a very genuine concern to see Aboriginals improve their conditions but who are properly wary of trends to separatist approaches and the overriding of development in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> We are seeing that time and time again with this Government: it takes the side of lobby groups to prevent the advancement of development, which development of course will create more employment at a time when we are facing dramatic levels of unemployment. Only last week did we see more mining being struck down by this Government in the interests of minority groups. </PARA>
<PARA> All we can do in the Senate today is approve the best possible structure. We must not confuse a consultative mechanism with outcomes. Nonetheless, no Australians can be more conscious than those in the western third of the continent as to the need to bring Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians together. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australians in the city, as well as those in rural and remote areas, do not need to be told that there are massive problems that manifest themselves in alcohol abuse and juvenile crime. What concerns me when I visit the north-west of my State is that I see so many Aboriginal people who are simply having money thrown at them to resolve their problems, in preference to constructive measures being taken to better their lot and to ensure their health, their housing, their education and better lifestyles. </PARA>
<PARA> Aborigines do not need to be told about supposed white guilt, but they do want positive solutions that will bring them into the general community as self-respecting, participating members. There will be no reconciliation so long as extreme activists are given support and credibility in the structures of government in taking action that harms the economic future of the State and nation. To put it bluntly, no reconciliation can be achieved when a Labor Government makes a decision such as that affecting mining at Coronation Hill, when a quite clearly divided response from Aboriginals becomes the means to deliver a promise to the green lobby to the detriment of the economy and the creation of jobs for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will begin to succeed in its objective only if it is prepared to take a stand against extreme Aboriginal activists and their supporters on matters where Aboriginals are divided and where there is a clear community interest under threat. It is always tragic to go to these areas and see some of the white activists who are really looking after themselves-No. 1-and the interests of the Aboriginals come a very poor last. Yet it is invariably the white activists, not the interests of the Aboriginal communities, to whom the Government listens first. </PARA>
<PARA> The redress of Aboriginal disadvantage in the areas of employment and economic development, noted in the preamble to the Bill, cannot proceed if necessary projects, supported by many Aboriginals, can be blocked by a voracious sacred site industry. The prime example is the controversy in the Eastern Gold Fields of Western Australia regarding the Yakabindie nickel project, which the Ngalia Heritage Research Council and the Swan Valley Fringe Dwellers are seeking to block, claiming that sacred sites will be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it must be noted that this is only part of the story. On Saturday at Wiluna, a meeting of local Aboriginals, who best know where the sacred sites are, gave their unanimous approval to the Yakabindie project provided that they received some of the jobs that would be created and which were guaranteed by Dominion Mining. That is not an unreasonable request. But what has happened?</PARA>
<PARA> To my mind, reconciliation and cooperation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians is epitomised by the reported remarks of Kalgoorlie businessman Don Green when he addressed the meeting. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Aborigines are still living and sleeping in the dirt when they could benefit from mining. </PARA>
<PARA>They are his words, not mine. That very clearly states the position. Again at Leonora on Tuesday, another meeting of local Aboriginal people affirmed support for the project, condemned the Aboriginal Legal Service for its failure to consult with traditional elders and rejected the need for any further anthropological research. </PARA>
<PARA> This $350m project will supply 3 per cent of the western world's nickel and cobalt requirements and generate essential foreign exchange for Australia. Surely that is important, but it is not considered important by this Government. What is most relevant to this debate is that development of this kind can benefit Aboriginals and will be welcomed by them without the sacrifice of their cultural values. If that is so-and it is-why does this Government still refuse to act on these projects?</PARA>
<PARA> Reconciliation depends upon improving the economic circumstances of Aboriginal Australians. The process is directly threatened when a professional activist such as Bob Bropho seeks to interfere with the beliefs and interests of Aboriginals hundreds of kilometres from his area and gets the uncritical support of Senator Vallentine, who is not even here to put her case and has not been seen in the Parliament this week. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine should listen to the advice given her by Mr Stephen Sprigg, who just happens to be President of the Kalgoorlie South Division of the Liberal Party. He urged her to speak with those local people who understood the issues rather than `siding with the radical misinformed losers'. Mr Sprigg is desperate to see the lot of the Aboriginal communities improved. He is encouraging Senator Vallentine to speak with them and understand the issues. She chooses not to do so. Should the Hawke Labor Government take action that impedes the project, it will be making the same mistake and giving the same wrong signals. </PARA>
<PARA> We will never achieve understanding, and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will be wasting its time, if the Mansells and the Brophos are effectively given licence to appropriate the beliefs of other Aboriginals in order to impose their own agenda. That is what concerns me. These people, particularly Mr Mansell, who is more white than I am in summertime, is given more credence as to what Aboriginal people want than the Aborigines themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Non-Aboriginal Australians acknowledge the need for special assistance to remedy disadvantage. They may think it reasonable for accommodations to be made for undisputed Aboriginal sites. What Western Australian people will not tolerate is the trashing of social and economic development that benefits Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians alike at the behest of a radical minority that includes many non-Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the coalition, as I stated at the beginning, supports the objective of a council that works towards understanding and reconciliation at a community level. Much will depend on the personnel of the Council and their willingness to take a view that is squarely based upon economic reality. It must be recognised that hostility to economic growth constitutes a condemnation of Aboriginals to poverty and dependence. If this attitude continues to prevail the Council will achieve nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this will not be just another bureaucracy. I hope that this is not just throwing more money at the problem and resolving nothing. It continues to concern me that when visiting areas such as the Gold Fields, Pilbara and particularly the Kimberley, we see more and more structures and offices being set up. Whether they be the Aboriginal Legal Service or the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission-this, that or whatever-they all relate to the Aboriginal community but they are not really improving their living conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> We are spending more and more taxpayers' money without changing anything.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to support the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill for the establishment of the Council of Aboriginal Reconciliation. I am also happy to support the preamble to the Bill as it speaks of addressing progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations in relation to land, housing, law and justice, cultural heritage, education, employment, health, infrastructure, economic development and other matters relevant in the next decade as part of that reconciliation process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia is a land of very great diversity and natural wealth. Part of this diversity and wealth is its peoples-all of them, no matter what their background. As a nation we must give the opportunities to progress and proceed by providing incentive and encouragement. As a Liberal I am committed to the individual and opportunity. I want to encourage all Australians to excel and to succeed. That success and excellence is a subjective term; it is in the eye of the beholder. I suppose it means happiness and contentment-satisfaction with one's lot. </PARA>
<PARA> But human beings cannot be happy and contented and achieve success if they are plagued by lack of opportunity, poor health, inadequate or unsuitable education, inappropriate housing, and lack of investment, which might produce long term economic problems. But, more importantly, human beings cannot be happy and contented if they lack self-esteem; if they are continually and historically treated as being different. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I, along with my colleagues, support the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill in the hope that the operation and functions of the Council will achieve a oneness and unity for all Australians and go a long way to understanding disadvantaged groups in the community and rectifying those disadvantages so that all Australians have the same opportunities; so that there is an appreciation by all Australians-whether they be white or black, old immigrants or new immigrants-that we are one nation and that we must work together for our collective good. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention an encounter I had recently in Cairns with a group of Aborigines who were giving evidence to the Senate inquiry into satellite communications. That group of Aborigines said that we could not take their land at Temple Bay simply to bail Australia out of the economic mess which, as they said, `You got us into'. But I pointed out to those Aboriginals that I had not got them into the mess and that I say the same things to this Government; the Government got us into this mess and now it is taxing us to get us out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I said to those Aborigines, `You are a proud people; you don't want to spend the rest of their lives getting government hand-outs. Don't you want to create employment in the areas of Cape York so that your children can get worthwhile employment and gain the self-esteem and self-respect that comes with not being on hand-outs all the time?'. Those people agreed with me. They do see lack of opportunities and lack of employment as a real curse for their children. They are coming to the realisation that opportunities must be provided in those areas so that their children can have the employment and, therefore, achieve the self-esteem to which they, and all other Australians, are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that in the past some Australians have committed horrific acts against other Australians. But I do not have any personal guilt about those actions. I am sorry that they occurred; I regret the way things have happened to all Australians who have been disadvantaged or who have had these things happen to them. I recognise the disadvantage that may have occurred in many parts of Australia and I want to lessen and-if possible in this imperfect world-eliminate completely all of that disadvantage for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> But I think that the separate development actions of the past in relation to Aboriginal and Islander people have been wrong, and I submit that they have been shown to be wrong. I look to the potential of the future, not to the blame of the past. I look forward to a day when there will be no need for special legislation or special rules for any group of Australians, when no group of Australians will be disadvantaged by reason of race, religion, origin or background. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are as diverse as any other group of Australians. It is often said that the people of Victoria are different from the people of Queensland. What a very boring and, I might say, very poor place it would be if we were all like Victorians. Similarly, the Aborigines and Islanders are as diverse as their geographical origins and residences. We must never fall into the trap of thinking that city-based Aborigines and Islanders are representative of, or even speak for, rural or remotebased Aboriginal and Islander people. I think it is important to recognise that the attitudes of many non-Aboriginal and non-Torres Strait Islander Australians towards Aborigines and Islanders also vary. Attitudes have been built up in the past in different places where different historical relationships have existed and been formed. That is why it is important to recognise and address the different forms that reconciliation might take. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why it is very important that the selection of the Council members by those entrusted with the job is done very carefully. There must be the widest possible range of members on the Council. It should not be comprised of well-meaning highly-educated city academics and social workers; there must be representatives of ordinary Australians-both Aboriginal and Islander people and non-Aboriginal and Islander people. More particularly, there must be representatives on this Council of those who have daily and permanent contact with each group in the community: those who live in close proximity to each other, those who interact and understand the needs, aspirations and prejudices of their fellow Australians-be they white, black or any shade in-between. </PARA>
<PARA> The group of fellow Australians of Aboriginal and Islander origin with whom I have interacted in my lifetime have the same attitudes, failings and aspirations as all other Australians. I do not think they want special treatment because of their race or origin. However, they do need a recognition of the disadvantages that they suffer and they also need solutions for those disadvantages. Special treatment for any group of Australians brings division and a feeling of separation, not integration and unity. </PARA>
<PARA> The disadvantage suffered by many groups of Australians manifests itself very differently in all of those different groups. I want to mention some of the disadvantages evident in places in north Queensland. Of course, I do not presume to speak in any way for other parts of the nation which I am not very familiar with, but those disadvantages do manifest themselves in different ways. </PARA>
<PARA> In the country towns of north Queensland one of the disadvantages is the separate existence which highlights the divisions and differences between Aboriginal and Islander Australians and other Australians. I think that matter has to be addressed. There is also a disadvantage in that many Aborigines and Islanders really desire not to be treated differently, but they are treated differently by the Government. They are subjected to different rules, different payments and different assistance, which make them stand apart from the rest of the community. I think that is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal and Islander people with whom I have had a lot of contact wish to have the same equal opportunities of access to the same jobs; they wish to have the same educational opportunities-and, I might add, the same educational opportunities that do not separate them, do not put them apart and do not identify them as being different. </PARA>
<PARA> In the cities of north Queensland, homelessness, drunkenness and domestic violence are real problems. I believe these problems arise from the fact that people are taken out of their natural environment and dumped in the cities. I think, on occasions, they have been lured into the cities with thoughts and suggestions of how they could attain happiness there, but it often does not work that way. The homelessness and drunkenness that one sees in cities really involves an enormous lack of self-esteem for those people. As I said before, all Australians must have self-esteem and a vision of the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In rural areas-and, again, I speak particularly of north Queensland; I am no expert, but I do have some limited knowledge-I believe that the aspirations of the Aboriginal community centre on obtaining that self-esteem. I believe the Aboriginal people as a whole recognise that, while they have an affinity with, and yearn for, the old ways, they are living in an ever-changing and modernising society which they understand they must be part of. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Aboriginal communities of Cape York are most terribly concerned about the alcohol problem. It is obviously a problem that is not natural to these Aboriginal communities; they are now grappling with this immense problem which white communities around the world have attempted to resolve all of this century. The Aboriginal communities are now just starting; they have been left with this problem and they are trying to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish I had a solution to offer those communities, particularly those on the western side of the Cape, where I have been recently, as they grapple with this problem. Complete prohibition has been proposed as a solution. I wish communities with such programs well. In the western Cape York area one Aboriginal community is enforcing complete prohibition while a neighbouring community is not attempting that because it believes prohibition will not work in practice. I wish I had a solution, but I do not. That is one of the sadnesses of our society generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Communities are concerned to see that their children have an education and therefore opportunities to advance. The possibility of advancement is needed to give children with education some prospect of employment-and employment in the types of jobs they are happy with. Too often Aborigines and Islanders are thrown into the most menial jobs. We have to work towards getting them into employment that they are happy with and that gives them self-esteem and a prospect for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> An ever-increasing number of Aborigines and Islanders are taking advantage of education in Australia. Some of them have reached the very highest echelons of the employment tree in Australia. That is one of the reasons I have little hesitation in supporting projects for the Cape York area, including the space base and the extension of the alumina refinery in the Weipa area. I believe bringing those sorts of job creation projects to an area where a lot of Aborigines and Islanders live will give them employment opportunities and skills in the technical work that will be part of these new projects for northern Australia. Projects such as these provide the best long term opportunity for Aboriginal, Islander and other Australian youth to become part of the future of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout Australia there is a misunderstanding of the rich culture, heritage and ability of Aboriginal and Islander people. At times, it seems to be greater in areas that have close contact with Aboriginal and Islander communities. If people encounter only disadvantaged and unwell Aborigines in city communities, they cannot but have a very negative and patronising view of their race but, if people can move out into the environment in which Aboriginals and Islanders find themselves most naturally placed, they cannot but be impressed by their vision, determination to succeed and aim to provide for their peoples and by their caring and supportive way of life. One cannot help being impressed by their concern for the health and welfare of their people, particularly their children and their elders, and by the recognition of the communities that they have a part to play in the future of Australia. The Torres Strait Islands people are a very proud and fine race and have a very important future in Australia as we enter our third century as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA> The days when white bureaucrats in Canberra and Brisbane determined questions of health, social welfare, housing and justice for Aboriginal and Islander people are, hopefully, fading fast. I look forward to the day when decisions on the management of and direction for Aboriginal and Islander communities are the province of those communities. I believe there exists a very good case for more autonomy and regional government for Aboriginal and Islander communities, particularly in the Cape York and Torres Strait Islands areas. I hope that as we proceed further in this decade those communities will be able to get more autonomy-more say in where the money is spent. The money that appears to be spent on white, city-based bureaucrats would be much better directed to areas which would significantly, and in reality, benefit Aboriginal and Islander communities. The decisions on what benefits Aboriginal and Islander communities are best left to people in those areas, rather than being made in Canberra or Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to the day when the paternal attitude of separate development can be abolished forever and when all Australians can live with dignity and self-respect. In so far as the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation can achieve or work towards achieving those aims, it has my total support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Queensland has 19 members of parliament in the Labor Caucus, yet it has only two junior Ministers and a Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry, with no representation whatsoever in the Cabinet. This situation has become such a disadvantage to my State, Queensland, that the Premier, Mr Goss, recently found it necessary to appoint a Western Australian, Mr Kim Beazley, as Queensland's representative in the Cabinet. According to Glen Stanaway in the Courier-Mail on 12 July:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Premier, Mr Wayne Goss, and ALP State Secretary, Mr Wayne Swan, first approached Mr Beazley several weeks ago to help out Queensland . . . their concern was simple. Queensland has only two junior Ministers in the Hawke Government . . . Mr Goss and Mr Swan were concerned that because Queensland lacked a Cabinet Minister, it needed an extra bit of clout in pushing its case on issues.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think he has trouble doing that, but he has been asked by the Queensland Labor Premier to represent Queensland's interests in the Cabinet. One would think the Hawke Government does not have any confidence in the abilities of Queensland Labor members of parliament to handle the job of a Minister. This is probably true, but is not the main reason Queensland is gagged in the government decision-making process. The Prime Minister simply takes Queensland for granted; he has carefully fashioned his ministry not on the grounds of talent but on the basis of factional deals and pay-backs. Former Senator Mr John Black from Queensland shed more light on this process when he explained recently that the Government had already decided to overlook Queensland yet again in the next ministerial shake-up. The Courier-Mail reported Mr Black as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister was tied to a deal with the Left Faction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Left is set to choose the Northern Territory's sole voice in the House of Representatives, Warren Snowdon, not Queensland's Keith Wright. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Black said that the Left had surrendered a previous ministerial vacancy due to them to allow the Right's Simon Crean into the Ministry at the request of Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Black said that the Queensland Right had made the mistake of not extracting a promise of ministerial positions in return for supporting Mr Hawke in the leadership. </PARA>
<PARA>For the sake of Queensland, let us hope the Queensland Labor parliamentarians do not make the same mistake when round two of the world's greatest leadership challenge comes along. </PARA>
<PARA> Representation in Cabinet and the Ministry is essential-not just for the State's balance but because of depth and breadth of experience. There is no substitute for experience. We cannot just breeze in and out of areas and become experts on them-particularly in a State as vast as Queensland. It is difficult for me to understand local issues in, say, Wynnum, where Senator Boswell comes from, or to feel a real sense of what is happening in the new Brisbane City Council, as my colleague Senator MacGibbon might do as he lives in that area. But Senator Reynolds and I know the northern feeling. We disagree on the emphasis we take, but we understand the north, unlike the rest of my Queensland colleagues, who are only visitors to the north. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland has been treated dismally over the years in terms of representation in Labor Ministries and shadow Ministries. If one looks at the figures one will see that under the coalition Queensland voters could expect a representation in the Ministry twice that which they could expect under a Labor government. Just to prove the point, Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to table a list of State representation in the Ministries and shadow Ministries since the 1972 Whitlam Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A study of the figures makes obvious the vast disparity between the importance that the coalition places on Queensland and that which the ALP places on it. Of the 289 positions in coalition Ministries and shadow Ministries since 1972, Queensland has received 39 positions, or 13.5 per cent. Of the 252 positions in corresponding Labor Ministries and shadow Ministries, only 19 positions have been allocated to Queensland MPs. That is only 7.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1983, under the Hawke Labor Government the position has deteriorated further, despite a large increase in Queensland representation in the Labor Caucus. Of the 114 positions available in the four Hawke Cabinets, only seven have gone to Queenslanders. Mr Deputy President, you, in particular, will be as disgusted as I am to realise that, in fact, Mr Hawke has the dubious honour of being the first Prime Minister since Federation to preside over a Cabinet with no representative from Queensland. This is the first government since Federation without a Queenslander in the Cabinet! That is the attitude of this Government and of Mr Hawke in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an absolute disgrace, particularly and especially for all the Queensland Labor MPs who have been willing to accept this situation. Every Prime Minister in Australia's history has seen fit to include at least one Queenslander in Cabinet-but not Mr Hawke. I ask you, Mr Deputy President, and your colleagues: what is wrong with our present Queensland Labor politicians? Are they no good? Are they incompetent or is it simply that they have chosen the wrong faction? I suppose it is self-evident that they are incapable managers, therefore they could not be good Ministers, because they did not think to get the agreement from Mr Hawke to get extra Ministers in exchange for their support in round one of the Labor leadership spill Australia had to have. They were bullied into it by some union bully boy, unelected by the people, who seems to have control over the preselection process in Queensland. They are more interested in jobs on Government-controlled committees and in selection for overseas trips than they are in doing their bit for Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has the Government overlooked Queensland MPs? Are they seen as not intelligent enough, not well educated enough, or are they just not good mates of the Prime Minister? Where in the Ministry is the Queensland representation in the Senate? What is wrong with you, Mr Deputy President? What is wrong with Senator Burns? What is wrong with Senator Jones? What is wrong with Senator Reynolds? I will tell you what is wrong: the Prime Minister could not give a stuff about Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> A quick look at the composition of the Hawke Ministry proves that beyond doubt. In the House of Representatives, only two of the 15 Queensland Labor Party members have Ministries. In the Senate, as I have mentioned, not one of the four Queensland Labor Party senators has a Ministry. </PARA>
<PARA> Compare this with the other States. Victoria has the same number of Labor politicians representing it, 19. Eight of the 14 Victorian Labor members in the House of Representatives are Ministers. Of the five Victorian Labor senators, two are Ministers. As well, there are nine Cabinet Ministers, including the Prime Minister and his Deputy. Heaven knows why the Victorian people continue to back the Labor Party when they see the mess that it has done to the Victorian State economy-but it has nine Cabinet Ministers in the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Capital Territory, which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) represents, has two representatives in the House of Representatives, one of whom is a Minister. It has one Labor senator representing it, and he is a Minister. That is not bad for Canberra. Of the three Labor politicians representing Canberra, two are in the Ministry. Queensland has 19 representatives but has only two in the Ministry. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two Labor Party members representing the Northern Territory, one in the House of Representatives and one in the Senate. One is the Parliamentary Secretary and the other a Minister-two out of two. Queensland has 19 representatives but only two are Ministers. And so it goes. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the Democrats do better than that. Senator Kernot, from Queensland, will at least become the Deputy Leader of her Party. The Labor Party could learn something from its fourth faction. It should do something more to give Queenslanders such as you, Mr Deputy President, a go in the Ministry and the Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> I compare this with the situation in the coalition. The Queensland Liberal Party has 10 parliamentarians. Mr Jull is a very senior shadow Minister in Dr Hewson's shadow Cabinet, and will be in his next government. We have one in the outer ministry. That member is here in the Senate. We do, at least, have some representation in the Senate from Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues from the National Party have six parliamentarians, one of whom is a shadow Minister as well. One of our shadow Ministers is from north Queensland, where I come from. The last government that we were in had a Minister from the very most northern seat. </PARA>

For the rest of us, of course, it is a whole day trip. I can understand why Mr Beazley is thinking of visiting Cairns next week. I suppose it is the first of his familiarisation tours in his new role as Queensland's Claytons Cabinet Minister. I am surprised that he has any time to spare. If he were in any way good at his job, he would be cleaning up the mess in the Western Australian Labor Party-WA Inc and all the crooks over there-rather than coming to look after the Queensland interest in Cabinet, which you, Mr Deputy President, and your colleagues should be doing. If he keeps as good an eye on Queensland as he did on what was happening with Burke and his cronies over there, then we will be much better off without Mr Beazley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to you, Mr Deputy President, and your Queensland colleagues: show a bit of the stuff you are made of. Let us get together and approach Mr Hawke or Mr Keating. I understand that Mr Keating has offered a few of his mates in Queensland as many as two more ministerial posts in the Cabinet when he becomes leader. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps you, Mr Deputy President, and your colleagues in the Left and the Right should rethink your support for Mr Hawke, given his complete disregard for Queensland in his Ministry. I might emphasise that all five northern Queensland Labor members of parliament have been excluded from the Ministry. The position is much worse in north Queensland. Senator Reynolds, the only Labor Minister from north Queensland in the entire life of the Hawke years, was the only female Minister from north Queensland in history, to my knowledge, yet she was unceremoniously dumped after the 1990 election in yet another factional deal. </PARA>
<PARA> Her protestations to the media at the time that she was happily making way or passing the baton to a younger person barely disguised her disappointment, particularly as the Labor Senate front bench now has no female representation at all-something that I am sure Senator Reynolds has some very strong views about privately. </PARA>
<PARA> In Rockhampton, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), who was an Opposition Leader in the Queensland Labor Party, has been snubbed by the Prime Minister. Former Senator Black has already made clear that there are sordid details behind Mr Wright's coming omission in the next reshuffle. The honourable member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, has served Townsville-where one of my offices is located-since 1983. Visiting MPs have repeatedly mentioned that he has ministerial potential. The Prime Minister, on a recent visit to Townsville to shore up Mr Lindsay's vote in round two of the leadership challenge, said on radio 4TO that Mr Lindsay would make an excellent Minister. Mr Hawke has admitted that there is a geographical imbalance in the make-up of Cabinet which excluded representation from north Queensland. He said that he hoped to remedy the matter in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA> Who is it going be? Methinks yond Robert Hulls has that mean and hungry look and maybe he is the one that Mr Hawke is looking at. But what is wrong with Lindsay, Gayler and Reynolds? What is wrong with Wright? What is wrong with all the other north Queensland people?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I am sure we are very well aware of that. As honourable senators will be aware, I have in the past drawn the attention of the Senate to the activities of the ICLE Bank-more correctly and fully known as the Instituts Nazionale Di Credito Per Il Lavoro Italiano All'Estore; I hope my Italian is interpretable-and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in relation to the downfall of the mineral water company, Huon Valley Springs Pty Ltd and the charges of fraud brought against the founder of Huon Valley Springs, Miss Donna Marie Batiste.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I would like to draw the attention of honourable senators to a potentially much more serious state of affairs involving the former parent company of ICLE Bank, namely, the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the Commonwealth Bank and the Australian European Finance Corporation, now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> In February this year the manager of the Atlanta, Georgia, branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, or the BNL, one Mr Christopher Drogoul, and nine others were indicted by a United States federal grand jury charged with making more than $US4 billion in unauthorised loans. The recipient of those unauthorised loans was the Iraqi regime of President Saddam Hussein and the period over which they were issued was between February 1988 and July 1989. Those are significant dates because, as I will explain in more detail in a moment, for much of that period the Commonwealth Bank of Australia was in partnership with BNL through its holdings of the merchant bank, the Australian European Finance Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Newspaper reports on the scandal claim that investigators in the United States have now established that more than 25 per cent of the funds had been backed by the Commodity Credit Corporation, an arm of the Department of Agriculture which provides guarantees to help sell US farm products. But rather than helping American farms, intelligence officials now say that the money was used by Baghdad to fund its chemical, biological and nuclear missile projects. </PARA>
<PARA> It is established that some of those funds went towards producing the Condor II missile, which is capable of carrying a nuclear payload to Jerusalem and other Israeli cities. Other BNL funds financed the chemical weapons which killed 5,000 Kurds in northern Iraq in 1988, the invasion of Kuwait and the Scud missile attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia during the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> During an arms embargo against Iraq, BNL Atlanta supplied funds which bought 40 electronic trigger devices, discovered by British Customs en route from the United States at Heathrow in March 1990, which were probably destined for the Condor II missile. It is believed that BNL funds were also used to develop Iraq's so-called `super cannon', a device also designed to deliver chemical and nuclear warheads. The super cannon's inventor, 62-year-old Canadian rocket scientist, Gerard Bull, was assassinated in Brussels shortly before British Customs discovered the triggers. Parts of Bull's cannon, manufactured in Sheffield and said to be destined for an Iraqi oil pipeline, were also impounded by British Customs. Twelve months before Bull's murder, his company, Space Research Corporation, had been linked to Iraq's network of European companies supplying missile technology financed by funds from BNL. </PARA>
<PARA> Investigators in Rome have identified more than 20 American, British and European companies which ignored the Iraqi arms embargo. News reports in both Rome and London say that within hours of the BNL scandal breaking in 1989, the Chairman, Nerio Nessi, and General Manager, Giacomo Pedde, resigned claiming innocence of the Atlanta dealings. However, since June that year, they and four other senior BNL officials had been under investigation by Italian authorities for involvement in an illegal arms deal with Iraq's warring neighbour, Iran. Investigations on both sides of the Atlantic are continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States the House Banking Committee is grilling officials from a range of government agencies to establish whether knowledge of the illegal loans extended as far as the Executive Office. The United States Attorney-General, Dick Thornborgh, has warned that the BNL affair raises national security concerns. But despite this warning Banking Committee Chairman, Henry Gonzales, is pressing ahead in the face of strong pressure from the Bush Administration to stop. </PARA>
<PARA> I have recently travelled to Washington to meet with representative Gonzales to raise with him the question of any possible Australian involvement in the BNL Atlanta scandal-questions which I am sure every responsible Australian will want answered. My major concern is to establish whether any Australian money was illegally funnelled through the Atlanta branch of the BNL, money which may have gone towards the purchases of arms which were then arrayed against our own Australian servicemen during their support of the allied offensive in the Gulf war earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA> My fears arise from the fact that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia-that is, our people's bank-was in business with BNL for much of the period that BNL Atlanta was illegally financing the Iraqi war machine. In fact, during my talks in Washington, I was told that some of the weaponry purchased with those Atlanta funds was deployed against allied forces during the Gulf war, including Australian sailors. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1980s, when the scandal really began, Western governments, led by the United States, turned a blind eye as Saddam Hussein went on a buying spree which was to make his army the third best equipped in the world. So much money flowed into the Iraqi coffers that the US congressional investigators now believe that the National Security Agency, the CIA and the Defence Intelligence Agency were deliberately looking the other way. American banking regulators are now speculating that the banking scandal goes all the way to the White House. A Cable Network News report quotes the US Justice Department as saying that much of the Atlanta money came from many of the West's leading and most trusted financial institutions, including the Banque Nationale de Paris, Barclays, National Westminster, the Bank of Tokyo, the Fuji Bank, Mitsubishi and American Express. According to top secret records of the transactions lifted from the so-called `grey books' of the Atlanta branch of BNL, even Israeli banks lent to Iraq's weapons fund. </PARA>
<PARA> What most Australians do not know is that for much of the period from February 1988 to July 1989 when the Atlanta branch of BNL was illegally and secretly financing the Iraqi war machine, BNL, the Banque Nationale de Paris and the Dresdner Bank AG were partners with the Commonwealth Bank. All held equity in what was then Australia's only consortium merchant bank, the Australian European Finance Corporation Ltd, AEFC, established in 1970 and ranked in Australian's top four merchant banks with total assets of almost $A2.5 billion. The Commonwealth Bank had a majority 51 per cent shareholding. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1989, five months before news of the Atlanta BNL scandal leaked, the Commonwealth Bank bought out its partners for an estimated $A48m. The takeover was instigated by the Commonwealth Bank with none of the three other partners voluntarily pulling out. The Commonwealth Bank was moved to defend its actions in the light of the claims by some banking analysts who expressed doubt over the funding of the purchase at a time when the banking industry was entering a period of rationalisation and contraction. </PARA>
<PARA> During that same period, BNL was 70 per cent owner of the ICLE Finance Corporation Ltd, a merchant bank established in Australia in April 1986. Among the directors of the ICLE bank at that time were Franco Belgiorno-Nettis and Carlo Salteri, founders of the giant construction business Transfield and co-builders of the Sydney Harbour tunnel. Belgiorno-Nettis and Salteri also held more than two million of the five million issued shares, all but two of the remaining three million being held by the BNL. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned at the start that I had in the Senate previously named the ICLE Finance Corporation, BNL, the Commonwealth Bank and the AEFC in relation to the collapse of the Huon Valley Springs mineral water company. Journalists Tony Dickinson and Jerry Cornford first raised the Commonwealth Bank-BNL link with me. I thought it serious enough to go to Washington to have discussions with representative Henry Gonzales, who is the Chairman of the United States House Committee on Banking. During my banking talks with him, I outlined my fears that Australian money may have found its way to Saddam Hussein via the Atlanta BNL connection and may have been used to purchase weapons that were later lined up against our boys in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> Representative Gonzales told me that it was very possible that Australian money had been funnelled through BNL-Atlanta and he has undertaken to have his staff thoroughly search all available transaction records in the grey books in an attempt to establish whether this was, in fact, the case. Representative Gonzales also urged me to investigate possible Australian involvement in the current Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal, due to that bank's high profile in the South East Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA> It was because of all this that yesterday I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, as the Minister representing the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), to investigate these possible links. In view of my disclosures today, I ask the Minister representing the Treasurer whether the Treasury is aware of the business links between the Commonwealth Bank and the BNL via the Australian European Finance Corporation during the majority of the period that BNL's Atlanta branch was issuing un authorised credits to Iraq?</PARA>
<PARA> I also ask whether the Treasurer will undertake to inquire whether any money from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, BNL Australia or the Australian European Finance Corporation was illegally funded to Iraq via the BNL Atlanta Georgia Branch and whether it was used to purchase weapons which were later deployed against our servicemen in the Gulf? I further ask: Will the Treasurer establish whether, during that period, the ICLE bank, which was at that stage 70 per cent owned by BNL, or any other Australian financial institution may have wittingly or unwittingly provided funds which were later to be forwarded illegally to Iraq by the BNL Atlanta Georgia Branch?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now approaching nine years since the Hawke Labor Government was first elected to office. This Government has promised a great deal, but delivered very little. It has been nine years hard labour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us cast our minds back to the Budget speech of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), on 21 August 1990. The then Treasurer announced that the trends were clear. Exports were supposedly on the increase and imports were down. The current account deficit was falling and inflation was on the decrease, according to Mr Keating. Inflation has fallen, but the current account deficit remains a continuing disaster. We see the occasional improvement in one set of figures, only to see the next set show a continuation of this country's endemic current account problem. For instance, the 1989-90 current account deficit figure was $22.28 billion. The 1990-91 current account deficit figure was forecast at $15.3 billion. However, the current account deficit for the 1990-91 Budget was revised in July 1991. The revised figure was $21.15 billion, an increase of $5.48 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Such an economic performance makes a sheer mockery of the notion of repaying the Australian people for their faith in this Government. The Hawke Government clearly bases its policies on whatever is politically or economically opportunistic at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years we have seen the Government twist and turn on economic policy. In 1983 the Hawke Government had a policy of fighting unemployment first through the assistance of the so-called accord. This has since changed to the balance of payments being the Government's main economic concern followed, most recently, by a `fight inflation first' policy. It is really a case of the Government making the best of a bad economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody should believe that the inflation target of below 4 per cent was a goal that this Government always intended to reach. Rather, it was a result of the worst recession since the Second World War. This Government has literally driven the country into recession through a policy of record interest rate levels from mid-1989 through to late 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a record number of bankruptcies, particularly among small businesses, and a rate of unemployment of around 10 per cent. Clearly, the Government has an extremely poor overall record on economic policy. Obviously, the Hawke Government has decided that the only thing it can salvage from the mess it has created is a low inflation target. </PARA>
<PARA> What kinds of winners are the Australian people in this kind of economic mess? Right from the very first major economic disaster of the Hawke Government in 1985, when economic activity collapsed, inflation began to accelerate and the value of the Australian dollar collapsed, followed by a debt explosion, every Australian has paid dearly. Every single Australian has had to suffer because of this Government's economic mismanagement in terms of high interest rates accompanied by a dramatic cut in living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployed, of course, are suffering particular hardship. Let us pause for a moment to examine the unemployment figures. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) clearly has a short memory. In 1983, the Prime Minister clearly believed that youth unemployment was something not to be tolerated. As Senator Baume mentioned in the Senate on Tuesday, in 1983 the Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA>No Australian government should ever be forgiven for creating the levels of youth unemployment of the last couple of years, which cannot and should not be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the difference then was that the Fraser Government was allegedly the culprit. How those words have come back to haunt Mr Hawke and his Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The levels of youth unemployment involving young Australians aged 15 to 19 who cannot find full time jobs are now far greater than at any time during the Fraser Government. Yet this Labor Government still has the temerity to paint itself as the true party of full employment. In the past 12 months alone, 129,200 young Australians have lost their jobs. This represents the biggest 12-month loss of jobs ever recorded for young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> In a few days time, the Government will unveil its Budget for 1991-92. Can we expect an answer to our economic problems? The Hawke Government clearly has no economic answers or vision for Australia as this country moves into the 1990s. It is too riddled with factional battles and leadership tensions to summon the will to take the decisions which are really necessary if Australia is to escape from its economic morass. Instead of interminable leadership bickering and quick fix solutions to economic problems, largely of their own making, the Prime Minister and his Ministers should go out and talk to those people in the community who are really suffering-the unemployed, the bankrupt and the manufacturers, farmers and miners who are trying their hardest to compete in international markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is this Government not grappling with the real issues so that business is not handicapped in competing with the rest of the world? Where is the urgency in dealing with such important matters as excessive transport costs, excessive waterfront and shipping charges, unnecessary government regulation and red tape, black bans, go-slows, stop works and Labor market deals? All of these problems only serve to impede Australia's progress in the world. In its own way, the picket line outside this building today is symptomatic of this same malaise. As with that problem, this Government shows no desire to deal with all of these problems. All we see is the continuation of a leadership battle between Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. Who cares? Only this week Mr Keating busied himself with attacking the Government for maintaining interest rates at relatively high levels despite the fact that when Treasurer he imposed a high interest rates policy himself. Meanwhile, Mr Hawke and Mr Kerin find their time consumed by way of fighting a rearguard action against Mr Keating's leadership ambitions rather than concentrating on Australia's dire economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to have a chance of stabilising our foreign debt, it will require a shift of nearly 4 per cent of our production into exports. That would not, however, reduce our debt; it would merely stop it growing faster than what we produce as a nation. Just how significant this task is can be evidenced by the fact that Australia has not realised anything like a 4 per cent shift in net exports in any five-year period since 1945. Indeed, even if we did match our best performance of the postwar period, our debt would still not stabilise this decade. Yet the Hawke Government has barely scratched the surface of performing this policy task. </PARA>
<PARA> In the year since the last Budget, the Government has thrown away another chance to correct the dismal state of the Australian economy. Why has the Government not done the three most necessary things? Firstly, government expenditure should be cut rather than have a reliance on using interest rates to cut private spending; secondly, the Government should reshape our tax system in order to restore incentives and also remove the damaging bias against our badly needed export industry; and thirdly, the Government should boost national savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1990-91 Budget has failed on all of the above counts and there are still no signs of the Government finally showing the determination to tackle the real issues. The 1991-92 Budget will fail because of this same paralysis. Perhaps the clearest sign of the Government's determination to play politics rather than tackle the real issues has been the attitude of the Government to the Opposition's proposed goods and services tax, a tax which, despite their denials, was supported by Mr Hawke and his Cabinet, including the former Treasurer, Mr Keating, in 1985. But what do we see from the Hawke Government regarding the goods and services tax? We see a pathetic attempt to mislead the electorate concerning the true purpose of this tax, a tax which 21 out of 23 OECD nations already have. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not fool the Australian people with this blatant hypocrisy regarding the goods and services tax. The Australian people will see that this tax will benefit them overall. It will mean less tax, both total and personal. It will remove the current hidden wholesale sales tax system which is levied from 10 per cent to 30 per cent on various items. For instance, orange juice is currently taxed at 10 per cent and washing powder at 20 per cent, while at the same time pornographic magazines face no tax at all. It is one thing for the Government to play its usual political point scoring on the goods and services tax but what is the Government's alternative? Clearly, it does not have one. This is a government which fiddles and manipulates issues while the Australian economy burns. </PARA>
<PARA> The upcoming Budget, which John Stone described in today's Australian Financial Review as the Budget that will `achieve the rare double of being both a non-event and a policy failure', will undoubtedly display no vision or policy for restructuring the current indirect tax mess. But, most importantly, Australia will become more competitive with its exports as, under the Opposition's policy, that vital sector of our economy will no longer be taxed.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government's economic performance has been based on what is best for the Labor Party's short term electoral prospects; the Australian people's needs come second. Only under a coalition government's economic policies will the real problems of crippling international debt, the current account deficit crisis, micro-economic reform and record unemployment be rectified. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking today during the discussion of matters of public interest, I will address the issue of the disarray of industrial relations in Australia. Two things are clear to me: firstly, the centralised wage fixing system is finished; and, secondly, the accord has failed and is in total disarray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The centralised wage fixing system, established through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, was torpedoed when both the Federal Government and the ACTU refused to abide by the umpire's decision at the last national wage case. The decision by the AIRC of a 2.5 per cent wage increase did not endorse accord mark VI. Of course, that left Mr Keating out in the cold because that was the deal that he sold to the Australian public prior to the last election. It was the first time in the eight years of the Hawke Government that the Commission had asserted its authority. </PARA>
<PARA> I have never supported the centralised wage fixing system. It has no relevance in the Australian system. It has no sensitivity to varying conditions between States and, more importantly, to sensitivities on the shop floor. Employer-employee contracts on the shop floor are the only way we will ensure long term employment and lift productivity to best world standards. The accord has been totally discredited. Mr Keating claims that it is responsible for the low inflation rate of today. That is absolute rubbish. If it were true or possible, why did it take more than eight years to come about? The accord rewards mediocrity. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us now look at what the accord has produced in Australia over that eight years. As mentioned by my colleague Senator Herron, it has produced sustained high interest rates. Even today when we hear members of the Government talking about how much interest rates have come down, at the current inflation level they are still at least two percentage points above what they should be-possibly more. We are still living with a relatively high interest rate regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord has produced record unemployment; a recession we had to have; and, worst of all, the blow-out in the national debt. It took this country 83 years to get the national debt to $23 billion net. In the last eight years, that figure has risen to $161 billion and this country is going to pay the price for that increase for a long time into the future. It will require a sustained effort to pull us out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have fallen behind in micro-reform. I must mention the waterfront in that context. What a joke when we think back to those long meetings by the Prime Minister to get something done on the waterfront. The employees were promised an increase of $12 per week in their wages to sit down and talk about reform. Fancy rewarding somebody to sit down and talk about the reform of those work practices which have held this country to ransom. Reward should come only when productivity has increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the political writers are saying about the current industrial relations situation in Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald carries the headline `Government pay decision threatens PSU awards'. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The bench member who deals with the Commonwealth Public Service, Commissioner Greg Smith, is expected to grant a 2.5 per cent pay rise before the end of this month. In line with the commission's policy, he would not allow retrospectivity, and would require the PSU to make no extra claims until November 1. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet in the same article Senator Cook yesterday reaffirmed the Government's promise to backdate the $12 to May 16. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA>In his statement, Senator Cook said the Government not only would backdate the $12 to May 16 but would continue to pay it until November 1 in cases where the 2.5 per cent expected from the commission amounted to less than $12 a week for low-paid public servants. </PARA>
<PARA>That highlights the disarray. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald entitled `Government looks to ``short'' Accord for wage deals'-even though accord mark 6 has failed-we read:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Maybe I'm talking about a short Accord, or 6.75 or something like that . . . ''</PARA>
<PARA>One must ask why it is 6 3/4 per cent? Why not 6 1/8 or 5 3/4 per cent? It is an incredible way to run industrial relations policy in this country. An article in the Australian was entitled `Cook trapped in the old union culture'. This is the fundamental problem we have today: industrial relations in this country have not moved with the times and with what is required. The editorial says:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook, the Minister for Industrial Relations, is a reasonable man but he remains a captive of the culture in which he has made his career. In his union days and in his portfolio, his perspective has been from the centre looking outwards. </PARA>
<PARA>How true that is. Let us go a little further, to the AAP news, in a reference to the former Treasurer Paul Keating. This is a classic example of what is happening now in the Government and the undermining that is going on. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Former Treasurer Paul Keating and his close friend, ACTU secretary Bill Kelty, held a long meeting behind closed doors at Melbourne airport as a prelude to the escalation of Mr Keating's leadership campaign this week . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It would be interesting to know, apart from the comments that were made in Perth last week, what other deals were cooked up at that meeting. Let us go a little further, once again to the AAP reports of 8 August. We read:</PARA>
<PARA>ACTU president Martin Ferguson today denied that Accord Mk VI was falling apart, despite another major public sector union breaking from the government-ACTU agreement. Mr Ferguson said most ``Australian government unions continue to support our position''. </PARA>
<PARA>His comments follow a move by the Australian Nurses Federation to pursue a 2.5 per cent pay claim in line with the April wage case decision, instead of the $12 offered in the Accord agreement. Another public sector union, the 9,000-strong Professional Officers Association (POA), yesterday won a 2.5 per cent pay claim in the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>This is further proof that the accord is in disarray and is running all over the place. The partnership between the ACTU and the Federal Government-and within the ACTU itself-is falling apart. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look a little further, to yesterday's Australian and Commissioner Maddern's decision to refer the future of the centralised wage-fixing system back to the Commission to revise its guidelines. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA>The centralised wage-fixing system could be abandoned before Christmas after a decision by the Industrial Relations Commission yesterday to reconvene the national wage case. </PARA>
<PARA>I make two particular points here: firstly, employers will call for an end to the multi-industry awards as part of the enterprise bargaining push; secondly, the ACTU must decide within three weeks whether to take part in a review of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's Australian, in an article entitled `Business puts plan to cut strikes', said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia yesterday proposed a sweeping reform of the nation's industrial law in an attempt to cut industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> The council called for fixed-term industrial awards and agreements, during which parties would be bound by ``peace obligations'' on the contents of the deals.</PARA>
<PARA>The article says that the main points are:</PARA>
<PARA>Fixed terms for industrial awards and agreements, with a ban on industrial action during life of deal. </PARA>
<PARA>Action allowed during renegotiation but present laws to apply in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA>Limited right to take action during renegotiation in longer term but some constraints still applying. </PARA>
<PARA>Key role for the Industrial Relations Commission in settling disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>Enterprise agreements to establish own rules for compliance and renegotiation.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, in the same paper, we read:</PARA>
<PARA>Unionists reject anti-strike proposal.</PARA>
<PARA>These quotes refer to the industrial relations system that is developing-or maybe one should say, not developing-in this country. Today's Australian Financial Review contains an article under the heading `Government abandons sanction consensus' which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government has abandoned its efforts to forge a tripartite consensus on more effective sanctions in the industrial relations arena. </PARA>
<PARA>These quotes put into perspective just where we are at today in terms of industrial relations in this country. The only way that we are going to overcome these problems and address a number of the aspects that the previous speaker, Senator Herron, raised in terms of lifting our national performance, is to come to grips with our industrial system and get it back to the shop floor. Negotiations between employers and employees need to be conducted in a fair and sensible manner. If we do not do that, we are going to continue with the current disarray. We are going to have a continuation of the industrial disputation which is paralysing much of this country at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> But, worse than that, we are being prohibited from tackling work practices in this country. Until such time as we seriously address that aspect, lift our performance at all levels-starting from the waterfront and working back-and allow our exporters to compete in an effective way internationally, we will continue to fall behind; we will continue to have a level of unemployment of around, or in excess of, 10 per cent; we will continue to see our national debt blow out and this, of course, will be a mortgage on our future, our children's future and our grandchildren's future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take this opportunity to refer to the national accounts statement that was released today. One reads and learns to one's profound disappointment that for this quarter there has been a further drop. In other words, Australia is still continuing its downward spiral. The document Australian National Accounts, National Income and Expenditure, June Quarter 1991 contains the following statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The most commonly used measure of economic growth is the income-based estimate of constant price gross domestic product (referred to as GDP(1)). Seasonally adjusted GDP(1) fell by 1.0 per cent in the June quarter. </PARA>
<PARA>The trend estimate of GDP(1) fell by 0.3 per cent in the March quarter 1991, its fourth successive quarterly fall. </PARA>
<PARA>The only component of private gross fixed capital expenditure to record a rise in June quarter 1991 was dwellings (up 1.6 per cent in constant price, seasonally adjusted terms, but still 7.2 per cent lower than in June quarter 1990). Total private gross fixed capital expenditure declined by 4.7 per cent in constant price, seasonally adjusted terms. </PARA>
<PARA>This grim, depressing news can be added to all the other figures. We constantly need to remind this Government that it has brought about the plight of the economy in Australia. Unemployment rose from 9.3 per cent to 9.8 per cent in July, after a collapse in the number of jobs of 83,100 in one month alone. This is the only reason for the fall in the inflation rate to 3.4 per cent. It does not take the world's greatest Treasurer, cum leader-in-waiting, to appreciate that such a massive surge in unemployment will allow for some classic Phillips curve trade-off in inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a fundamental recessionary weakness in the labour market which has been demonstrated by a 2.4 per cent fall in average, ordinary time, earnings of full time adults in the last quarter. This should not be seen, however, as some success in wage restraint brought about by the Government's centralised wages policy or the much discredited accord. Instead, the fall is a direct consequence of the recession, with record levels of bankruptcies and a substantial excess supply of labour. The only response of the labour market-even this overregulated labour market-could have been a plunge in wage rates. </PARA>
<PARA> An examination of the unemployment figures shows simply that last month's result means that the number of jobs has fallen by a massive 305,300, or 3.9 per cent, over the last year to match the severity of the 1982-83 employment slump. This Government, as we went through the plight of sustained high interest rates, kept trumpeting from its turrets that, despite all the pain and suffering that was being endured by the economy, it had managed to keep employment rates up. </PARA>
<PARA> I saw an interesting figure the other day which showed that the cost of the jobs that were created by this Government, in terms of wages paid, was exactly equal to the amount of capital that was imported into this country during the period this Government has been in office. It is the servicing of those loans which is keeping our annual deficit growing at the rate of something like $18 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of the figures which the Government admits to-that is, that 9.8 per cent of the work force is unemployed-it is important to realise that the rise in the official unemployment rate is being softened by the fall in the proportion of Australians who are in the so-called participation rate; that is, the number of Australians who have lost their jobs but are actively seeking another job and have not simply given up by being dispirited. </PARA>
<PARA> The participation rate continued to slip last month; it has slipped from 63 per cent to 62.6 per cent. The labour force-that is, unemployed plus employed-shrank by more than 40,000 people as disappointed job seekers simply stopped looking for another job. In other words, if we are truly honest about what has happened, we will concede that we already have an unemployment rate of over 10 per cent. Once we hit 10 per cent, there is not a family in Australia which is not touched by it. It is embedded in the psyche of every Australian family because families see the suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last two days we have had a debate in this chamber concerning the picket line surrounding Parliament House, which some could say, justly in some ways, was seen to be self-serving. The point that needs to be made is that trade union member after trade union member on the Government benches of the Senate shed crocodile tears for 40 people who no longer enjoy the work practices that existed in this building. Yet there was no apology-not a single, solitary murmur of solace-to the 800,000 people who are being put out of work by the deliberate policies of this Government. To call this Government hypocritical is to undervalue the word `hypocrisy'. This is a Government without any conscience, without any caring for the real plight of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that the greatest impediment to the clearing of the labour market is the centralised wage fixing system. It is the accord which has become the greatest single source of unemployment. The accord has denied equilibrium to the market wages, it has guaranteed an excess supply of labour, and it now ensures a mammoth level of unemployment. As I said, if we are honest, we will admit that the real level of unemployment is 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite this very real human tragedy, the Government's response is to maintain tight monetary policy through high real interest rates. We all got used to Treasurer Keating pushing the nominal interest rate high, and we got used to hearing of it in terms of 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 per cent. What we did not hear so much about was how the high inflation rate lowered the real level of interest rates. But now, with inflation having come down-and in no way, shape or form can this Government claim that the aim of its policy was to reduce inflation; it has become a side effect of inflation-real interest rates have remained among the highest of any of the OECD countries and, indeed, one could say the highest. </PARA>
<PARA> A quick look at a recently published chart showed that real interest rates for OECD countries range over factors of 0.52 per cent for Sweden, 1.28 per cent for Switzerland, 1.6 per cent for the United States, 2.6 per cent for Canada, 3.48 per cent for Japan, 4.75 per cent for Germany, 5.33 per cent for the United Kingdom, 5.71 per cent for Belgium, 5.92 per cent for the Netherlands, 6.28 per cent for France, 6.81 per cent for Spain and 6.82 per cent for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is exactly that high cost that is imposed upon the Australian economy that has prompted the NSW Farmers Association to write, I presume, to most senators calling for the high real interest rate to be addressed and to express its enormous concern. In its letter, the Association makes the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>If we do not get an investment led recovery, especially in the international trading sectors of the economy, we will continue along the path of `stop/go' economic management that will bring us to another recessionary crunch after a consumer spending led recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The costs to the community are being seen in our rising foreign debt, rising unemployment and falling living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>The positive approach must be to allow real interest rates to fall. Only then does Australia have a chance of being able to increase investment to allow us to raise our living standards, service our overseas debt and provide the job opportunities that Australians require.</PARA>
<PARA>What I have outlined very simply is a litany of all things that are wrong with our economy and all things that are wrong with Government policy, and yet the Government is locked in. It is locked in because the Federal parliamentary ALP which forms the Government today is nothing but the political wing of the trade union movement. The trade union movement calls the shots and the Ministers of the day oblige. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that the Australian people were given some hope that there is a way out of this mire-and there is. The alternative government, that is the coalition parties, offer that hope. They offer it with a three-pronged attack-a three-pronged attack with a three-pronged reform package. </PARA>
<PARA> The first part of the package is taxation reform. Taxation in this country is crying out for reform. Our package is simple and straightforward and it is honest. We are straightforward in what we say we are offering as needed reform. First, it is to make people aware of the current wholesale sales tax that they pay-that hidden tax of which my colleague Senator Herron, just a moment ago, gave examples to show how inequitable and illogical it is. Tax is being paid on chocolate biscuits, but no tax is being paid on caviar or oysters; tax is being paid on Coca-Cola and orange juice, but no tax is being paid on that marvellous product Evian water imported from France. </PARA>
<PARA> In excess of $10 billion is raised annually by the wholesale sales tax. It is levied on products ranging from toothpaste to detergent to disinfectant to a whole range of things that the average housewife puts in the supermarket trolley. I can attest to doing just that and realising the tax component that I and every other Australian householder pays every time we go to the supermarket. </PARA>
<PARA> We will abolish that tax and replace it with a much fairer, equitable and more logical goods and services tax, a broad based tax which will ensure that even people who operate in the black economy will pay some tax. In addition, it will give a most important boost to savings because it will take away the present bias in favour of consumer spending and make saving more attractive. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as abolishing the wholesale sales tax we will reduce income tax rates. Of course, that will make saving more attractive. If people are faced with the choice of either investing or spending the after-tax dollar that they earn, the choice to spend is now almost overwhelming. People do not know what items have a tax; the taxes are hidden. We have the Government's secret tax, the Government's own GST. </PARA>
<PARA> People will feel that they get the full value for the dollar they spend now. It will not be attacked by inflation and will not have additional income tax paid on it, which would occur if people invested it. With a reduction of income tax, saving becomes very much more attractive and the fact that people know there is a tax to be paid on consumer spending makes the playing field-dare I say it?-more level. </PARA>
<PARA> In cutting income tax and introducing a compensation package for those who find themselves unable to take advantage of the tax reform, we are promising real reform in the tax area. When we couple that with industrial relations reform and micro-economic reform-that is, making the ingredients of business cheaper and making product more efficiently and cheaply produced-we see that we offer hope to Australian people by way of an improvement in the economy and an improvement in the standard of living, which presently, as I outlined earlier, is in serious decline. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about an aspect of the Government's economic policy and its adverse effect on a very important sector of the Australian economy. I talk about rural Australia in particular. I refer to the way in which the Government's monetary policy and high interest rates have wreaked havoc upon the small business community. I acknowledge that the problem has been compounded by low commodity prices in a number of areas, and that has inhibited cash flow in rural communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The low commodity prices are one component; another important component in the cost structure of the operation of that section of the economy is the cost of finance. Because this Administration has kept the cost of finance artificially high over a number of years, the farming community of Australia-and, as a result, the service industries to the farming community-has been brought virtually to its knees. </PARA>
<PARA> We see throughout rural Australia small country townships and cities struggling to survive. As these places struggle to survive and businesses close, the servicing of the rural community is being inhibited. As a result of the contraction of the servicing of those industries in the network of country townships and cities throughout Australia, people are having to rely on servicing, parts availability and a range of other backup services from major metropolitan centres. That brings additional and substantial costs to the operation of farming units and enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we also see in those small country townships and cities throughout Australia a contraction of job opportunities for young people. This is only going to compound the problem this country has of being the most urbanised country in the world. I live in the most urbanised State in Australia. The Government's policies-in particular its high interest rate policies-have, in fact, compounded that problem. The simple fact is that today's national accounts clearly support and endorse that view. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak about rural Australia and those small country townships with some feeling because my family has a small business located in one of those townships. Following the untimely death of my brother almost 12 months ago, I have had to have somewhat of a hands-on involvement in the operation of that particular facility. So, as a politician, I have seen first-hand the difficulties that have been compounded by high interest rate policies and the net effect of these policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Bishop, the previous speaker, said that the national accounts for the June quarter, released today, show a negative growth of minus one per cent and 2.4 per cent for the year to the end of June. Last week's bad unemployment figures and the latest survey show a drop in consumer confidence. Is it any wonder that there is a drop in consumer confidence within the community? The national accounts offer no glimmer of hope for sustained economic recovery. So we have in the marketplace this psychological barrier, if you like, where people are not prepared to spend. Without consumer confidence and spending, we cannot break out of the cycle within the Australian community at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a legacy to all Australians that has been left by the former Treasurer, Mr Keating. As long as the team stays there, what we will see is a rolling recession. It will continue to eat away at jobs for Australians and at any prospect of improving living standards because there is no glimmer of hope or light at the end of the tunnel for these people. </PARA>
<PARA> Access Economics, in a paper that it has just released, clearly identifies and expresses some concern at the level of the deficit this year. It first notes that the Government will be seeking, I suppose, to grant tax cuts in the 1992 Budget, that is, the pre-election Budget. One would imagine that that is a course it would follow. Second, it says that these tax cuts are unlikely to be funded by spending cuts because it happens to be in an election year. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be interested if any Government Minister would be prepared to deny that that is the blueprint or formula that it will follow over 1992. If that is the case, we are going to have to have, and the Government will rely on, continuing high interest rates to keep the economy from growing too fast. It is that aspect of monetary policy, of high interest rates, that has brought significant difficulties and problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government talks about interest rates falling and the economy moving in the right direction; it talks about there being some signs in some sections of the economy that it is improving and says that there has been a substantial reduction in interest rates. The real test of the claim is the question, `What real rate of interest applies today?'. Despite the great deal of publicity on falling nominal interest rates, the situation remains the same-real interest rates are still extremely high in historical terms and certainly compared with a number of our overseas competitors and counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has consistently used interest rates for macro-economic policy purposes. There is no difference between the approach taken by Treasurer Keating and that being taken by Treasurer Kerin to high interest rates as a form of macro-economic policy. The costs of that are clear and can be seen by all of us. They are incorporated in the statistics that have been released over recent weeks-our rise in foreign debt, rising unemployment and, coupled with that, falling living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, a number of organisations in the community have drawn the issue of high real interest rates to the Government's attention and notice. Despite the fact that a fortnight ago the Prime Minister indicated there might be some easing-Treasurer Kerin took a different point of view-there has been no easing of those interest rates. Until and unless there is some easing in the real interest rate cost, we will not have increased investment; we will not have increased productivity; and we will not have an improving economy for the benefit of all Australians. A range of policy initiatives need to be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is about time that the Government started to understand the real impact of those high interest rates, and how its reliance on monetary policy is adversely affecting, in the instance that I referred to earlier, rural Australia, the servicing network of townships throughout rural Australia, and the important role it has played in the past and that is needed in future. If we do not take corrective action, it will wither on the vine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to draw the attention of the Senate to a situation where swift Government decision is required as a matter of both urgency and equity. In an Administrative Appeals Tribunal case of 26 April, the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs invited the AAT to comment on the effect of changes to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 by the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act 1990. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act took effect from 8 January. The AAT case and the legislative changes commented on relate to defence service home loan entitlements. In particular, they concern the issue of whether one member of a married couple, sharing the same dwelling place as his or her partner, is entitled to be issued with a certificate of entitlement when his or her spouse has already been issued with one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case before the AAT, a wife whose husband had already taken out a DSH loan was seeking to exercise her entitlement on the basis of her eligibility. The AAT had to make its decision based on the legislation as it stood before 8 January. Although the Tribunal considered that the overall scheme of the Defence Service Homes Act was supportive of the wife's case, it concluded that a strict reading of the legislation meant a certificate of entitlement could not be issued and the wife's case was rejected. However, the respondent in the case, who was the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, invited the Tribunal to make some observations on the effects of 8 January amendment of the Act. After carefully scrutinising the legislation in light of the changes, the Tribunal concluded, contrary to the Secretary's arguments, that it would seem the way should now be clear for the concurrent granting of a DSH loan entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has yet to indicate a policy position on these issues. A Government response is needed urgently because of an impending 31 August deadline. Service members, who are eligible for a defence service home loan but have yet to take up their entitlement, have the option of revoking this entitlement and taking up an entitlement under the newly established Australian Defence Force home loan assistance scheme. This option has been available since 1 March. The deadline for a decision on this option has been set for 31 August. </PARA>
<PARA> For a number of people, a crucial factor in deciding whether to forgo their DSH entitlement is the Government's position on whether it accepts the comments of the AAT in relation to concurrent DSH loans. It is not possible for two married members to exercise an entitlement concurrently under DSH and ADFHLAS on the same home. It is therefore obvious that for married couples, where each person is eligible for a DSH entitlement and where one partner has exercised a DSH loan, a Government decision on the ability of the other partner to exercise an entitlement concurrently is critical. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that under the new scheme, it is possible for two married members to exercise their entitlement concurrently. If the Government decides that this concurrent exercising of a loan is not possible, then it may well be that the other partner will elect to chose the ADFHLAS option. However, such a decision clearly cannot be made until the Government makes its position clear on the comments offered by the AAT. The deadline for the option of choosing the ADFHLAS is approaching fast; it is now only 17 days away. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been aware of the comments offered by the AAT since April this year. It must not continue to keep a large number of people in the dark with regard to the options that are available to them. I understand the Prime Minister's office is seeking legal and financial advice on the ramifications of the AAT comments and the effects of accepting or rejecting them. I hope it is being sought as a matter of urgency. Today I have written to the Minister expressing the views I am putting here. Members of the Defence Force are entitled to have the Government make up its mind and show some concern on an issue of importance to Defence Force members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I preface my question by referring to the extraordinarily poor quality of the Minister's answers to my questions on each of the past two days. The quality was surprisingly bad, if I may say so, from someone who is so obviously still an aspirant for higher office, either in this place or in the other House.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister to the fall of one per cent in real gross domestic product in the June quarter and of 2.4 per cent for the year as a whole. I also refer him to the dramatic collapse in national savings and investment revealed by the figures and, in particular, to the eighth fall in private investment in plant and equipment in the last nine quarters. Does the Minister agree that this dramatic collapse means that the outlook for 1991-92 is for further falls in employment, increases in unemployment and a continuation of Australia's deep and rolling recession? Will the Minister give an undertaking to the Senate and to the Australian people that next week's Budget will be framed to provide sustainable growth in jobs and some hope for the millions of Australians now suffering the results of the Hawke-Keating Government's massive policy failures?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not accept, and the Government does not accept, that there is anything in the nature of a dramatic collapse in the economy demonstrated by these figures. The June quarter national accounts suggest that economic activity has continued to edge downwards over the first half of the year. The national accounts indicate that GDP fell, as Senator Short said, by one per cent in the June quarter after rising 0.4 per cent in the March quarter. It is appropriate to take both quarters together because to do otherwise does not take sufficient account of the volatility that is often apparent in quarterly numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one looks at the last two quarters together and compares them with the two previous quarters, September and December last year, one sees that the rate of deterioration-or decline, if honourable senators wish-in the economy has markedly diminished. For the September and December quarters the total was minus 1.8 per cent and for the March and June quarters the total is minus 0.6 per cent. That is consistent with the Government's expectations and understanding of what the underlying features of the economy are.</PARA>
<PARA> The broad picture shown by this is also evident in the Australian Bureau of Statistics measure of trend GDP, which fell by 0.3 per cent in both the March and June quarters. As compared, the comparable figures were 0.5 in September and 0.6 in December last year. Again this trend is evident when one looks at the inflation figures that are part and parcel of the national accounts. I am not talking about the consumer price index figure, but of course the implicit price deflator for non-farm GDP-the cost of production indication of inflation-which rose by only 0.1 per cent in the June quarter, bringing the total increase for the year to the June quarter to only 2.8 per cent. That is the smallest increase since the year to the March quarter 1964. It is further evidence, if any were needed, that inflation is on the way down in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The encouraging feature of these accounts concerns the longer term picture for exports. Net exports contributed positively to activity in the June quarter, bringing the total contribution for the final year as a whole to 3.1 percentage points. That is the highest contribution from the external sector in a financial year for nearly three decades. I repeat: net exports have increased and made a contribution of 3.1 percentage points to growth over that last year, which demonstrates that in that sector of the economy-crucially important for the recovery and for a sustainable and durable long term recovery-we are doing very well.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators-Ha, ha!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about net exports. The positive contribution in the June quarter means that in all but one of the past eight quarters net exports have operated to boost activity. It is that contribution from expanded exports and reduced import growth that has underpinned the dramatic improvement in the current account deficit in 1990-91, despite the continued fall in our terms of trade. It is worth repeating what the improvement has been in the current account if we are looking at indicators for longer term durable and sustainable growth. The truth is that the current account deficit fell by 30 per cent in 1990-91, from $22.3 billion in 1989-90 to $15.7 billion in 1990-91. While private investment, which was also mentioned by Senator Short, including non-residential construction, fell in the June quarter, dwelling investment-the housing sector-grew slightly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has asked the question and he is getting the answer. This is consistent with the evidence given by leading indicators-that is, finance and building approvals; the housing sector is crucial, as we all know-the balance of which indicates that recovery has commenced in that sector. When we put all those things together it is evident that the economy, I repeat, is poised for a sustainable and durable recovery. The basis on which that will occur will be spelt out in detail in the Treasurer's speech next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason we are poised for sustainable and durable recovery is that we have the right policy settings in place. Official interest rates have been cut by over seven percentage points since early 1990, wages growth is being held in check through the accord framework and we are maintaining the structural integrity of the Budget. In addition, the indicators suggest, as I have already partially said, that the housing industry recovery has commenced, that the outlook for manufacturers has improved and that the run-down of business stocks has ended. Those indicators-there are others as well-will continue to be mixed until the recovery is well under way and, in particular, unemployment is likely to increase further, given that the labour market does, as we constantly acknowledge, lag behind economic activity. But the foundations for a stronger economy are being laid and nothing in the national accounts figures suggests otherwise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I ask the Minister whether he could advise the Senate on the outcome of the initial round of Australia-United States consultations on agricultural trade issues, which took place in Washington, DC overnight. What is the evaluation of the Australian Government?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="424" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After a 10-hour meeting, the initial round of the Australia-US consultations on agricultural trade issues concluded in Washington early this morning, Australian time. Before that meeting the Australian delegation met separately with senior officials of the State Department, the US Department of Agriculture and the Office of the US Trade Representative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All the discussions over the last two or three days, including the formal session, were comprehensive and certainly fulfilled the clear intention of both sides to explore the differences, which still undoubtedly exist, and our concerns in a constructive fashion. This consultative process is the only one of its kind that the US conducts with any country on these issues and, of course, it stems from the visit of the bipartisan delegation to Washington in March this year.</PARA>
<PARA> We have taken the view, on the basis of the reports of these talks that we have received so far, that they represented a positive and constructive start to what will continue to be a complex, ongoing consultative process. There are not any magic solutions. The EEP problem with the United States has already been with us for some six years. Its effects are necessarily going to stay very high on our agenda in the conduct of our bilateral relationship for the foreseeable future. Certainly we expect it to be further discussed when President Bush visits Australia later this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The discussions covered quite a wide range of issues, including the international market for grains. It was agreed-I guess that this is reasonably good news for farmers, to the extent that it holds up-that the current world wheat market fundamentals do provide real potential for price improvement. That is the judgment. The Australian and US export interests in individual markets were discussed. The operation of the EEP was, of course, discussed in great detail focusing, in particular, on the details of what may be involved in the assurances that we have formally received. The Uruguay Round was briefly discussed. A number of other bilateral issues including sugar, beef and dairy products were discussed, as well as the state of negotiations on the North America free trade agreement which is, of course, of immense interest to us, too.</PARA>
<PARA> For its part, the US reaffirmed that the prime focus of the EEP was countering the subsidy practices of the EC. Its position did not vary in that respect. Our emphasis in the discussions was to highlight the markets of significant commercial interest to Australia, including the Middle East, so that the US could be in absolutely no doubt-not just in a more generalised way, but in a very precise and specific way-of the effect on Australia of past or potential EEP activity in these markets. All aspects of the recent initiative to Yemen were discussed in detail.</PARA>
<PARA> We argued very strongly for consultations with Australia prior to individual EEP initiatives taking effect. For a range of reasons, largely based on acute commercial sensitivities-or claimed sensitivities-the US could not accept this concept. We have also advanced a number of ideas which I am not in a position to refer to in public at this stage. They were debated at some length and, while not resolved at this meeting, do remain on the agenda for further consultations. So the ground work has been laid for some further dialogue.</PARA>
<PARA> On the specific question of impact on particular markets, the United States has repeated its assurances that it will continue to do what it can to minimise the fallout of the export subsidy war on non-subsidising exporters such as Australia, and continue to seek specific assurances from importers as to their level of purchases from non-subsidising countries.</PARA>
<PARA> We all have to recognise that the export subsidy war is a symptom of the massive distortion of international agricultural trade which is arising from production-related subsidies and other barriers to trade. To cure the symptoms, we have to attack the cause, and the best hope for doing that remains the Uruguay Round. Along with our Cairns Group colleagues and the United States, Australia will be relentlessly pursuing a successful outcome to the Round. Again, we call on the European Community to show the political commitment which is necessary to move the agricultural negotiations in that Round forward to a successful conclusion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Such adverse social justice implications as there are are amply dealt with in an Australian context by the very extensive and elaborate network of social security mechanisms we have in place, which have been made far more far-reaching, comprehensive and effective in their application to people most in need by the policies which we have been putting in place and which I have described in answers earlier this week so far as unemployment, and youth unemployment specifically, is concerned. The implications of that commitment are very evident in the Budget blow-out that we have experienced in the 1990-91 financial year and the difficulties that that will create in the framing of the Budget this year.</PARA></TALK.START>

The kind of growth that we have been putting in place backed, as it is, by the inflation figures that I have described, which are spectacular and totally at odds with the kind of achievements that the coalition was able to make in the early 1980s when it was in government during a recession, have created the environment where that growth can be sustained into the future and will be durable.</PARA>

<PARA> The Melbourne based company Calgene Pacific Pty Ltd recently filed a patent application for the gene, which should enable the commercial development of a blue rose. This is a significant milestone in a research and development project which started in 1987 with the support, under the biotechnology grants scheme, of the Industry Research and Development Board.</PARA>
<PARA> Calgene aims to take the genes which produce the blue colour in petunias and insert them into various ornamental species such as roses, gerberas, carnations and chrysanthemums which dominate the world's flower market. The world market for cut flowers is enormous. About $US5 billion worth of roses alone are sold in the world each year. It is a market where novelty commands high premiums, and a blue rose would certainly be novel.</PARA>
<PARA> Another Calgene project aims to prolong the life of cut flowers, which also increases their market value. The project has been assisted through the biotechnology grants scheme-a grant of $740,000 over three years-not only because of its potential for commercial success but also because the technologies being developed will be able to be used in a wide range of other commercial applications.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of funding has come from capital raised by Calgene Pacific itself, from Australian shareholders and from the major Japanese firm, Suntory Ltd. Suntory will help Calgene penetrate the important Japanese market.

He also said `Policies are in place and are bearing fruit'. He did not describe the fruit. I ask the Minister: what real prospects exist for improved employment while there is an accelerating collapse in private sector investment in new plant and equipment, as revealed in today's national income figures, which show a worst ever postwar drop of 29 per cent over the last 10 disastrous quarters, of which 9 per cent came in the recent June quarter of the Government's deliberately engineered recession?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already acknowledged that investment was down in the June quarter, but these figures are volatile; they do move about from time to time. One has to look at them in the context of the total environment revealed by the national accounts. That total environment that is revealed by the national accounts does not indicate anything in the nature of an accelerating recession, but rather the contrary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said at the outset of the first answer, the figures indicate an economy that was, during the first two quarters this year, continuing to edge downwards but at a slower rate than was the case in the two quarters last year. There are plenty of indicators all around the place suggesting that that particular process is bottoming out and that we are back on the road to a durable and sustainable recovery, one of the crucial elements of which will undoubtedly be a recovery in the commitment of the private sector to investment. The obvious help in that respect will be the inflation rate, dramatically reducing, hopefully followed by a reduction in interest rates. As I indicated yesterday and the day before, that is something which depends on a whole variety of judgments that cannot be regarded as being automatically triggered by any particular inflation indicator.</PARA>
<PARA> We do have an environment where the housing industry recovery has commenced; the outlook generally for manufacturers has improved in the ways I have described; and the run-down of business stocks has ended. All of those factors will obviously be very helpful in creating the kind of recovery environment that we are anticipating. Beyond that, these are issues that will be addressed by the Treasurer in detail in his Budget statement next Tuesday and I will leave it to him to fill out the further detail.</PARA>

It is not to be assumed that anything will be shown up over the course of this year other than a substantial return to positive growth, which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have said will start before the end of this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport has provided me with the following response to Senator Maguire's question. The number of fatalities in June this year was, in fact, the lowest monthly figure for 29 years-which is very welcome news. It should be noted that there has also been a very large increase in population and vehicle usage over that period. There was a further reduction in fatalities in July to 178. The total number of road deaths from January to July was 13 per cent lower than for the same period last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many factors have contributed to this improvement. Both the Federal and State governments have adopted a wide range of initiatives to improve road safety, including action to reduce drink driving and speeding and to increase the use of seat belts, increased enforcement and public education. The Government's 10-point road safety package announced by the Prime Minister in 1989 has renewed this commitment to road safety. Under the Federal Government's black spot program, $50m was provided to the States last financial year to eliminate about 1,000 of the worst road crash black spots in Australia. This program will continue over the next three years. We have not yet seen the full long term effects of these initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal government is also committed to improvements in vehicle safety.The Minister for Land Transport recently announced a major program of research to identify the best ways of providing better protection for car occupants in a crash. The recent improved figures are good news but we must still recognise that road deaths and injuries are a major problem for this country. Apart from the human suffering, the cost of the crashes to the community is conservatively estimated at $6 billion a year. Road crashes are still the single major cause of death for people under the age of 45.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of Senator Maguire's question about low alcohol beer, I will seek further information on that from the Minister. There is no question in my own mind that a combination of the concentration on encouragement for people by things such as reducing excise to drink low alcohol beer, combined with random breath testing, has had a very valuable effect in terms of the increasing community awareness that people should not drink and drive.</PARA>

<PARA> In our view the individual work contracts Mr Howard was talking about recently on a Four Corners program, which he said would be similar in form, if I understand his meaning, to those provided in New Zealand by the New Zealand Government, would have no place in Australia. They would be work contracts which would set aside an institutional role of scrutiny of what is fair in industrial relations by a body such as the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>

He was not paid his full entitlement of annual leave. If that is an example of an individual work contract, which I believe to be typical of the sort of example that the Opposition is putting forward, it is a shameful thing. The fact that the eminent Australian in this case is Mr Tony Eggleton and the employer is the Liberal Party of Australia which, upon the termination of Mr Eggleton, refused to pay him his full entitlement for annual leave, illustrates not only that the policy is wrong but that the party which is advocating the policy is also wrong.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a little too much for some people in the press to grasp, and it has obviously been a little too much for some people in this Parliament to grasp-even when it is pointed out to them-including Senator Alston, as he indicated very clearly in that interjection. There is a huge difference between committing oneself to some value judgment which may or may not be justified and, on the other hand, simply reporting what a reaction has been. There is no doubt as to what the reaction has been. That is the context in which I used that particular word.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I went on to make it clear that there were a number of issues-capital punishment was one and logging was another-on which, from time to time, there may well prove to be policy differences between Australia and Malaysia, or between individual Australians and people within Malaysia. It is not a matter of making any apology, acknowledgment of fault or anything of that kind in relation to such honest differences of policy opinion. It is a matter of explaining specifically what the positions are and hoping that they will be understood on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the particular reference to logging that I made in the speech is, in itself, an ample reply to the last part of Senator Coulter's question. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>Other issues which cause problems from time to time-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, cause problems objectively, because of the nature of the reaction in other countries-</PARA>
<PARA>do not involve firm Australian Government positions, but are presently the subject of lively public debate. One such issue is the logging of tropical timber-not just in Malaysia but elsewhere in the region and, of course, in Australia itself. I say now that Australia is extremely conscious of the significance of this issue for a number of our neighbours; that we do take careful note of Malaysia's very firm commitment on environmental issues in the National Development Policy; that we believe this whole issue is one that cries out for an agreed multilateral solution; and that-whatever the final outcome-Australia will certainly not act in a some capricious, unilateral way at Malaysia's expense.</PARA>
<PARA>That is simply acknowledging on the public record very specifically that this is a matter on which the Government has not yet formulated a final position. As is well known, the importation of tropical timber is something that will be considered shortly by Cabinet. It is the subject of a lively public debate at the moment. In respect of what I can say at this stage about the Government's position, I put it on the record in that way. So the premises of Senator Coulter's question are false and the conclusions that he draws from those false premises are equally false.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course we should be concerned about the protection of the Penan people and other indigenous peoples around the world; we have made that clear in innumerable contexts. What we have to be sensible about is whether the policy strategies that flow from that concern actually help or hinder the plight of the people in question. One of the big concerns as far as some sort of blanket, across-the-board ban on the importation of timber from Sarawak where the Penan people live is that it may well have the totally unintended consequence of greater destruction of the forest habitat of those people because of the pressures that will then be created by an even greater exercise in uncontrolled clear felling for agricultural purposes by people displaced from the forest industry. That is exactly the sort of issue that we have to contend with in grappling with this topic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is why the kind of simplistic solutions that Senator Coulter and his fellow Democrats constantly come up with on these complex and sensitive problems are so often so comprehensively misguided. We cannot get by with emotion, rhetoric and sentiment; we also have to get by occasionally on just a little applied intelligence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to advise the Senate that the Prime Minister of Grenada, Mr Braithwaite, has just announced publicly that the death sentences passed on the 14 people involved in Grenada have all been commuted. The Australian Government has closely monitored developments in these cases. On several occasions during the last few weeks we have made direct representations to the Grenadian authorities urging that those death sentences not be carried out. The most recent such representation was made by the Government on Tuesday this week, 13 August, and there have been public statements made in my absence overseas by the then Acting Minister, Dr Blewett, on 29 July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that, in making his announcement, Prime Minister Braithwaite did acknowledge the representations the Government had received from a number of countries urging clemency. We recognise that in many respects the decision to commute those sentences was not an easy one for the Grenadian Government. The events of 1983 did cut very deeply into Grenadian society and there has been considerable domestic pressure upon the Government there to allow the executions of at least some of those 14 people to take place.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to commute the sentences is therefore all the more to be welcomed not only by the Government but also by the many Australian citizens and others in this country who made representations to the Grenadian authorities over this matter. I do hope the humane act of that government will further encourage moves towards the long term goal, which is, of course, the worldwide abolition of capital punishment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since Parliament last sat, there have been a number of positive developments in waterfront reform. The impasse reached by industry parties on finalising the new award classification structure, and the related wage increases, has been resolved to the satisfaction of the employers, the unions and the Industrial Relations Commission. The Government was instrumental in achieving that settlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a fundamental element of the reform program, complementing the new enterprise employment arrangements. The settlement gives added impetus to the reform by linking future pay rises to implementation of enterprise employment and delivered productivity improvements on the wharf. The last time the Parliament met we had concluded, in terms of agreements being implemented, only the national terminals enterprise agreements for the ports of Sydney and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the Parliament last met, the enterprise agreements which have been concluded and are now being implemented, in addition to the national terminals agreement for the terminals in Sydney and Melbourne, are as follows: Container Terminals of Australia Ltd-that is Conaust-agreements for the Sydney terminal; Union Shipping Australia Ltd agreements for its operations in Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart; the Strang Patrick stevedoring agreements for its Brisbane operations; the agreement concerning the Port of Darwin, being the first port to completely move to enterprise employment, with the approval of enterprise agreements for Conaust, Darwin Port Services and Federated Stevedores; and the agreement reached on disbanding the ancillary labour pools covering shipping clerks and stevedoring foremen in both Melbourne and Sydney, resulting in the exit of an additional 71 employees from the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, enterprise agreements which have now been completed and are in the process of being examined by WIRA for their endorsement are as follows: the Strang Patrick stevedoring agreement for the ports of Adelaide, Fremantle and Port Alma; the Brisbane Gateway Terminals agreement for its container terminal in Brisbane; and Conaust for its stevedoring operations in the ports of Adelaide and Port Pirie.</PARA>

He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There are enterprise agreements all over the place. Employers haven't tried hard enough-they're blaming everyone except themselves and are now saying it's too difficult-I just don't subscribe to that and I haven't seen evidence they've tried hard enough to work out the reform process. You can't throw out the agenda unless you've really tried to make the agenda work.</PARA>
<PARA> The Association of Employers of Waterside Labour has called for the advancement of the general review already provided in the reform program which is scheduled to take place six months prior to its finish, in May next year. One of AEWL's major members-National Terminals-is not supportive of bringing this review forward and neither, as I know from having had discussions with the Executive Director of Conaust, is Conaust.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I am interested to note that a number of very informed media commentators lately have been making the statement-and they are right-that the waterfront debate is in fact far too politicised for its own good. One of the problems, in terms of a number of the parties participating in this debate, is that, despite the fact that the reform process itself is extremely difficult and more than a full time job, one does have to spend a significant period of time worrying about the politics rather than the reform.</PARA>

<PARA>AUSTRALIA AND MALAYSIA: DOING MORE TOGETHER</PARA>
<PARA>Address by Senator Gareth Evans, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to Malaysia-Australia Business Council Dinner, Kuala Lumpur, 22 July 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted to have this opportunity to address this MABC/AMBC Dinner on the occasion of your inaugural Joint Meeting, not least because of the central theme of this occasion: ``Doing More Together-Malaysia and Australia in the 90s''. We have achieved a great deal together in the past; we are certainly capable of achieving a great deal more together in the future; and I think we would all acknowledge that there is scope for doing at the moment just a little more together than we are.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no question but that our commercial relationship has been built on firm foundations, and has scope for major further development. Total trade last year was $1.6 billion making Malaysia our third largest regional partner, after Singapore and Indonesia-and the total stock of investment was around $1.5 billion. These are more than 120 projects with Australian equity currently operating in Malaysia. Australian success stories here in the last year or two have included contracts for the management for the Port Kelang container terminal, catering services for Malayan Railways, engineering supervision for the Pergau Hydro Electric Project, communications equipment to Malaysian Telecom, and management and training services for the hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a sense of excitement among Australian businessmen I talk to about the potential of this country, not just at some unspecified time in the future, but here and now. Prime Minister Mahathir-especially with his articulation in February this year of the ``2020 vision'' and his announcement last month of the National Development Policy-has generated an image of Malaysia as a dynamic and purposeful country which knows exactly where it is going.</PARA>
<PARA> With real GDP growth at 9.7 per cent in 1990, and expected to be maintained at 7.5-9.0 per cent until 1995, there is every justification for that perception. The whole economy following the blueprint of the 1986 Industrial Master Plan has moved from primary dependence on commodities exports to its present status as a leading ASEAN exporter of manufactures.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian businesses contemplating investment here are not doing so with an image in their minds of Malaysia as a low income, low production-cost, developing country-but rather as a country where there is a strong (and strongly growing) skill base, a dynamic potential for sustained further growth, and a position at the hub of a very dynamic regional economy. At the same time Malaysia is seen as a country of our own size, with a partly shared cultural heritage, a strong defence relationship with us, and a long history of personal contact at all levels-all of which makes access and communication easier than in many other places.</PARA>
<PARA> These are some of the themes which provide the background to the Trade and Commercial Development Program for Australia in Malaysia now being developed. This program-and the published strategy document that will be associated with it will very much reflect the confidence we have in the potential of this particular relationship, and the efforts we are putting in to making it work. Aimed at promoting greater economic engagement between Malaysia and Australia, the Program, among other things, identifies twelve separate areas as particularly attractive for Australian investment: infrastructure development, energy supply, agro industries and agriculture, timber-based industries, rubber-based industries, construction materials, electronic products, precision products, machine tools, marine management and vessels, defence equipment, education and tourism.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course we are acutely aware that in today's highly competitive environment, in Malaysia or anywhere else, we have to get our own act together. We know that we have in the past had a reputation-in at least some parts of Asia-as lazy and flabby: not only economically and socially indulgent but arrogant and patronising as well. If there was ever any truth in that image-and there may have been just a little-we have had it well and truly beaten out of us. We have seen many other countries in our region getting their economic and social acts together, and rapidly ascending the growth and income tables. We are still a wealthy country-with spending power, despite our small population, roughly equivalent to all six ASEAN countries put together-but our comparative position has been sliding over the years, and we know that we have to fundamentally change our economic culture if we are to retain and build upon that wealth.</PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government has been acutely conscious of the need to fundamentally reshape our economy, and there have been breathtaking changes to that effect over our term of office involving, among other things, deregulation of the financial system, rewriting of the tax system, corporatisation and partial privatisation of major government business enterprises, fiscal and monetary policies designed to strip inflation out of the system once and for all, and-above all-the stripping away of nearly all the protectionist baggage accumulated over generations of belief that we could not compete without it. We know now that we cannot compete internationally with the levels of protection we had. None of this adjustment has been painless, particularly in the international recessionary climate we have all been experiencing-but it has been necessary, and it has happened.</PARA>
<PARA> Part of the business of getting our act together in Australia has been to come to grips with the question of our basic identity. Are we to be forever seen as a European outpost, a kind of cultural misfit trapped by geography in an alien environment? Or are we to recognise that Australia's future lies inevitably in the Asia Pacific region-that this is where we live and must survive strategically and economically, and where we must find a place and role if we are to develop our full potential as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA> I strongly believe, although it is not always completely visible to those outside Australia, that there has been in this respect a fundamental change in the centre of gravity of the country in recent years. Partly this has followed from the way in which we have become more fully and innovatively involved in the affairs of the region, for example in relation to the Uruguay Round (with the establishment of the Cairns Group to represent the interests of fair agricultural trading nations, including Malaysia), APEC, Cambodia and regional security matters. All of these activities have enabled Australians to see their own country not as a mouthpiece for anyone else, but engaged as partners with other countries in the region in finding cooperative solutions to regional problems.</PARA>
<PARA> Partly it is a matter of economic imperatives: we know we have to export more and faster, and not just in our traditional commodity areas, and the message has finally sunk in that we are living beside the fastest growing and most dynamic set of economies in the world. We did have, because of our commodity trade since the early 1960s, a Japan consciousness (as well as a United States and a European consciousness) but we did not have an Asian consciousness. That is rapidly changing.</PARA>
<PARA> Partly also it is a matter of much greater exposure to Asian people than has ever previously been the case for Australians-as a result of high immigration rates, growing levels of tourism each way, more and more Asian students coming to study in our schools and universities, and increasingly, the amount of new business Australians are doing in Asia and vice versa. It takes time for this to translate into a genuine, sensitive understanding of the subtleties of other cultures, so far as the population at large is concerned, but I believe we are gradually getting there.</PARA>
<PARA> The important thing is that, as countries living and working and doing business with each other in this region, we work actively at stripping away the stereotypes that undoubtedly continue to exist in each of our countries about the other. Australia and Australians certainly deserve, I think, by now, to be released from some of the perceptions about us-those I have already referred to-that we may, or may not, have richly deserved in the past. And certainly I think it is the case that knowledgeable Australians-in which category I certainly include the kind of business representatives here today-have long seen the stupidity of characterising Malaysia and other countries in this region in the kind of terms that may or may not have been appropriate in the colonial era.</PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes, of course, the messages we would like to be sending each other in this respect get a little fractured, and I think we are all conscious that some problems of this kind have developed in recent times in Malaysia-Australia relations. A number of different groups of Australians-some in the media, some in Parliament and some in pressure groups in the wider community-have acted in a way which has been seen as not only insensitive to contemporary Malaysian realities, but on occasions downright insulting.</PARA>
<PARA> Among the matters which have caused offence in this way in recent years have been the public stances taken by some parliamentarians and others on the logging of tropical timbers, the future of the Penan people in Sarawak, arrests under the Internal Security Act in 1987, and the execution in 1986 of two convicted Australian drug traffickers, together with-most recently-the screening in Australia of the ABC television series, Embassy. These kinds of things tend to have a cumulative impact, and we are seeing that now in the reaction of the leadership of this country.</PARA>
<PARA> Faced with that reaction, one possible response by the Australian Government might be wounded indignation. But that would not be helpful. It is far better for us to try and understand the nature of the problem, and do what we can to resolve it in a quiet way. It is a matter of explaining what can be explained, acknowledging fault where it is due, and trying to ensure that there is a better basis for understanding in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> Some issues are just the product of differences of policy opinion. Australia completely respects the integrity of the Malaysian legal system, and the policy choice that has been made here about the best way to deal with the abhorrent business of drug trafficking-but we do have strong views in principle about capital punishment, and will go on expressing them, as we do now, anywhere in the world where executions take place, be it for example China, the Middle East or the United States. We will also as a government occasionally want to raise-preferably quietly-other issues from time to time which we see, for better or worse, as raising human rights questions. In return we accept absolutely the right of anyone else to raise such issues with us, for example over the treatment of Aboriginal people where we have had over the generations a great deal to answer for. We simply cannot have double standards on any of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA> Other issues which cause problems from time to time do not involve firm Australian Government positions, but are presently the subject of lively public debate. One such issue is the logging of tropical timber-not just in Malaysia but elsewhere in the region and, of course, in Australia itself. I say now that Australia is extremely conscious of the significance of this issue for a number of our neighbours; that we do take careful note of Malaysia's very firm commitment on environmental issues in the National Development Policy; that we believe this whole issue is one that cries out for an agreed multilateral solution; and that-whatever the final outcome-Australia will certainly not act in some capricious, unilateral way at Malaysia's expense.</PARA>
<PARA> The Embassy series is a particularly tricky issue for an Australian government to deal with because of our long established tradition of media freedom-not least in respect to the public broadcaster, the ABC, which operates completely at arms length from the Government, with an independent charter. We can, and do, criticise the ABC and other print and electronic media when they get things wrong, or behave ignorantly and insensitively. We can, and do, express the hope in these situations that they will get things right, or behave more sensitively, in the future. We can and do dissociate ourselves publicly from particular reports or programs when it is our judgment that to do so is necessary to get our own position clear. We cannot and should not be expected to comment on everything the Australian media says about other countries, but where there is a danger of the report or program in question being taken as an official Australian position, we can and do distance ourselves accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, in the case of relations with other countries in our region, we have supported a number of exchange programs designed to give our journalists a better understanding of other cultures-most of which cultures tolerate less brashness and public aggression than our own-and of the ways in which at least inadvertent offence may be avoided. But while there are a number of things we can do, and are doing, what we simply cannot do, consistent with our own political and social culture, is to direct anyone in the media how to behave, and I believe that this is well understood in the region.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Embassy, the Government has been satisfied from the outset that no offence was intended by the program's producers. Moreover-as I wrote to my Malaysian counterpart shortly after the series started-the ABC has made clear to us that it very much regretted that any offence had been taken. But offence was taken, and it has to be acknowledged that there was some basis for that occurring. The program, filmed in suburban Melbourne and Fiji, dealt with what was meant to be a wholly fictitious country, ``Ragaan'', incorporating characteristics of some twenty real-life ones, and with plot lines drawn from incidents and issues arising all over the world. The difficulty, as I think we all have to acknowledge, is that the producers had located ``Ragaan''-in a rather fuzzy map appearing in the first episode-not only in South-East Asia, but in a bulge half way up the Malay Peninsula! They had also, inadvertently so far as we can establish, included at least one or two other matters in various scripts which seemed to have a specifically Malaysian origin. It was obviously unfortunate that these particular exercises of dramatic licence occurred. We have discussed these points with the program's producers, who are sensitive to the problems involved. We cannot guarantee that similar problems won't recur in the future, but we very much hope that they won't.</PARA>
<PARA> Politicians are more conscious than most people how stereotypes catch hold with particular kinds of publicity, and can take forever to eradicate, even with the most minimal reinforcement. Stereotypes can and do exist, similarly, about whole countries-and it can be important not only for a country's pride, but its prosperity, that that stereotype not be reinforced. The last thing any of us in Australia want to do in relation to Malaysia, or any of our other Asian friends and partners, is to perpetuate outdated, damaging images. Our regional friends, like ourselves, have been adopting new, independent, proud national identities-and we need to acknowledge and respect that about each other. We need to develop, and encourage in our respective countries, clear perceptions of each other, and real mutual understanding. Much remains to be done, but the price of not doing it-as this audience will know better than most-is too great for us all.</PARA>
<PARA> So let me end with a sincere appeal-to Australians and Malaysians together, to governments and media and businesspeople alike-to put stereotypes behind us and get on with the business of business, enhancing our cooperation for our common good. Let us behave, more thoroughly and more often, as partners together in this dynamic and powerful regional economy-to which we both, together and separately, have so much to contribute; and from which we both, together, have so much to gain.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government has plunged Australia into a very grave economic and social crisis. Its centralist experiment with the lives of average Australians has failed catastrophically. The recession engineered by the Australian Labor Party-the one we had to have-has destroyed thousands of businesses and families. If there were ever any doubt about that, one would just have to refer to the national accounts figures produced today for the June quarter and for the year 1990-91 as a whole. Those figures confirm without any doubt the deep, protracted and rolling recession that this country is in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Contrary to the assertions that Senator Gareth Evans made in response to questions from myself and my colleagues at Question Time today, that recession is not easing and the rate of decline is not falling. The rate of decline is accelerating and the fundamentals that are required to turn that around and provide sustainable growth and jobs in the future are simply not there-in fact, the fundamentals are weakening month by month. One only has to look at the savings and the investment figures to confirm that. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the most serious and long term disturbing element revealed in the national accounts figures today is the collapse in national savings and investment. It is a massive collapse. If we look at what is happening to private investment in this country, the figures show that total private gross fixed capital expenditure in Australia has fallen in six of the last seven quarters. It has fallen in virtually all components of fixed capital expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the figures for fixed capital expenditure in plant and equipment, which is probably the most important single component of capital investment if we are looking at the building of a productive base for the future in this country, we will find that there has been a fall in investment in plant and equipment in no less than eight of the last nine quarters. Not only that, but the fall has been accelerating. Investment in plant and equipment in the June quarter of this year was in real terms 19 per cent less than in the June quarter last year. That means that the prospect of providing the base on which a recovery of jobs and productive activity in this country is to occur is simply not there. Not only is it not there, but also the prospects of it ever being achieved are diminishing quarter by quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> We will never get investment in this country without savings. If we look at the savings figures, we will find that according to the national accounts figures released today-I find the figure quite extraordinary-national savings in the last year fell by 62 per cent. According to the official statistics, there was a 62 per cent fall in national savings in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> The household savings ratio, which a decade ago was of the order of 10 to 12 per cent, is now down-and has been for a series of quarters now-to between 3 and 4 per cent. In other words, there are virtually no savings going into the national pool from the household sector. If we look at the non-household sector-the manufacturing and operating sector, the company sector-we find that the situation is equally as bad. Over the last four or five quarters the profitability of companies has continued to decline and has fallen in each of the last five quarters as a minimum. For example, in the June quarter it fell by more than the figure in the March quarter, which itself was a fall of 7.6 per cent. The three preceding quarters showed falls varying between 3 1/2 and 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The collapse of savings and the collapse of investment is the really stark thing that comes out of the figures produced today. There is no evidence in the figures that came out today for 1990-91 as a whole-either the national accounts figures or the balance of payments figures-of the so-called structural reform that the Government has been claiming for itself as building the base for a productive and sustainable future for this country. Again, some of the fundamentals have gone the wrong way. For example, if we are going to build a more productive Australia and one that is more internationally competitive, we have to have a situation where the ratio of imports to sales of goods and services in Australia falls. According to the official statistics released today, in the last quarter alone there was an increase of no less than 6 per cent in the ratio of imports to sales. The figure has gone precisely the wrong way. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of payments figures for the year just completed as a whole show that the cost of servicing Australia's overseas debt, which now amounts to an enormous $135 billion net and is climbing daily, was $17.3 billion. That figure was larger than our current account deficit as a whole. The problem has more than quadrupled since the Hawke Government took office. It underscores the high and rising burden which is now being borne by average Australians as a result of years of neglect of the worsening foreign debt situation by the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> No less than one-third of all the goods that Australia now sells is committed simply to servicing our foreign debt-simply to paying the interest on our foreign debt, which is $135 billion and rising. That equals a burden of $8,000 for every Australian. This Government has plunged Australia into an international debt crisis. Paying off the mortgage is the legacy which this Government will leave to Australians in the future. The consequence of that is that if Australia is to stabilise its overseas debt, let alone get it down, the growth in domestic spending will have to be substantially less than the growth in domestic production for several years to come-indeed, right through the decade of the 1990s at least. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless we can sustain high rates of economic growth greater than 5 per cent per year, that high debt servicing burden means a cut in our living standards. The prospects of any change in that over the year ahead are absolutely nil. Every prospect, even on the Government's own figuring, is for the reverse. As recently as 30 May, the former Treasurer told the Premiers at the Premiers Conference that the current account deficit in 1991-92 was forecast by himself and the Treasury to be 4 3/4 per cent of gross domestic product in that year. If that figure turns out to be correct, we will have a current account deficit in this new financial year, 1991-92, of between $18 billion and $19 billion. That is a current account deficit which is $3 1/2 billion worse than the one that we have had this year. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's current account deficit is the third highest in the history of our country-it was a figure struck in the depth of recession-yet the Government is telling us that it will be $3 1/2 billion worse next year. At the same time the Government is trying to tell us that it has set in place the fundamentals so that we can have a sustainable recovery in the Australian economy in terms of investment, job growth and increased living standards. Those two are simply incompatible. If we run a balance of payments deficit next year of between $18 billion and $19 billion, when this nation quite indubitably will still be in recession, heaven help us when we experience the economy really starting to pick up later on during the 1990s. The simple fact is that the situation is absolutely unsustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> None of the policies that the Government has attempted to adopt has in any way tackled those fundamental problems. Indeed, the policies have been directed seemingly in the opposite direction. The policies have been completely irresponsible. It now seems impossible under Labor for government to operate responsibly at all. The Government is torn apart by internal divisions. It is distracted by its fight to the death over who should be the boss, whose ego is going to win out of all this. It does not worry about the more than one million Australians who are now on the dole queues seeking jobs or who have simply dropped out of the available work force because they know that there is no work. Hawke and Keating say, `Let's just concentrate on our having a fight to the death over who is going to run this country'. The top job is all that counts with this Government. Meanwhile, millions of Australians suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime the country is leaderless and directionless. This Government has failed the people of Australia. It has given up. It has no vision. Even Labor's traditional supporters know that it has deserted them and that it has lost its way. Every month, with every statistic that comes out, we are reminded of this abject failure in economic policy. I have already referred to the symptoms of that malaise, but the most chronic and cruel symptom of all is the collapse in employment. More than 308,000 people lost their jobs or, to put it in another way, more than 308,000 jobs were lost in Australia, over the past year. That is almost 1,000 jobs lost each day of the year-and that outcome from a government that boasts about creating employment and talks about its concern for social justice. If anyone can find a more hypocritical statement than the assertions by this Government that it believes in social justice and in the means of improving the lot of Australians, I have yet to hear it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a recorded unemployment rate of 9.8 per cent. We all know that, when allowance is made for the fact that the participation rate has fallen and that people have dropped out of the work force, the underlying rate of unemployment in Australia at the moment is actually over 12 per cent-that is, as I said before, there are more than one million people out of work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is according to the official figures, and the unofficial figures would have it very much higher than that. That is a disgrace. It is enormous in its implications. It is cruel and it is destructive beyond belief. Just in case anyone is tempted to doubt the honesty of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the question of employment, I remind the Senate of how he so callously deceived viewers of the 7.30 Report just 12 days before the last election, in March last year, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>And I'll tell you what, if you vote for me what you'll get, what you'll get is a continuation of record employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the same Prime Minister who said 10 days later, and two days before the election in 1990, that Australians had no need to fear a recession. Let us tell that to the average Australian today! Obscene as it may sound-and to me it is obscene-this economic disaster, with its inevitable devastating social consequences, is the result the ex-Treasurer now claims credit for. </PARA>
<PARA> In the face of such manifest failure, who but a person consumed with self-delusion could say, as Paul Keating said at the weekend, `I am very happy about my term as Treasurer'? He should ask the business men and women what they think about that. He should ask the unemployed and the underemployed. He should ask average Australians who have been forced to bear crippling mortgage burdens because he got it all wrong. He should ask his own constituency, if he has one left. Again last week the former Treasurer claimed credit for the low June quarter inflation figure. The following day those horrendous unemployment figures came out. Was he there to claim credit for that one too? Not on your life. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that time is going by. My colleagues will be wishing to fill in on many of the matters that I would like to have dealt with today but which time prevents me from doing. Let me now just say what I and the Opposition believe needs to be done next week in the critically important Budget to come to grips with some of these issues. In the light of what has to be done to correct the Government's mismanagement of the economy and to set Australia on the path to recovery, it is perfectly clear that the fiscal requirement, the Budget requirement, is to increase national savings. If we do not increase national savings, the problems that we have seen compounding in our nation over the last couple of years as a result of the policies of this Government will swamp us. </PARA>
<PARA> This coming Budget is no time to embark on new expenditure programs or to cut taxes without corresponding cuts in outlays. To do so would be absolutely and totally irresponsible. That is because Budget deficits reduce national savings. They plunder the savings of households and firms. A Budget deficit next week would worsen, not help to correct, our fundamental economic problem of inadequate savings. </PARA>

What he has not come out openly with is that the underlying deficit is much greater when one takes account of assets sales, transfers to the States of responsibility for financing their maturing debt and so on. Those changes will give a cosmetic cut to the Budget deficit, but they will still impact on economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All the indications are that this Government will continue with its gross fiscal irresponsibility. If it does that, the structural changes required-that is, the boost to savings and investment in tradeables industries-will not take place. As a result, interest rates will be higher than they would otherwise be and we will go further down the road that this Government has set us on: a road of lack of hope and despair for so many Australians at that time when it is of absolutely critical national importance that that be reversed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reading the terms of the matter of public importance before us, one realises that very few people in Australia and in this chamber would not be supportive of the idea that the Budget ought to be concerned with growth, investment and jobs. I think those objectives would be shared by both sides of this chamber. I say `both sides' deliberately because, if some honourable senators had crossed benches from time to time to express some severe reservations about economic growth as a desirable objective, I would leave them to justify that position for themselves. But Government and Opposition senators would share the objective of an economy creating jobs through investment as a product of economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at the objectives that are stated from time to time in matters of public importance, urgency motions and statements of what should be objectives of government activity, because the goalposts do shift from time to time. I notice that the desirability of achieving a low-inflation environment has gone off the agenda. Since that has been achieved, it is suddenly dropped and does not get a mention. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall read the matter of public importance again. I listened to Senator Short, and it did not get a mention. The goalposts change from time to time as the objectives are achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My main point is not to pursue that-that is a matter for debate on another occasion-but to say that it does not enhance the debate on economic policy in Australia if people profess a monopoly over concern about issues like growth, investment and jobs. It is a shared concern of most Australians and, with the qualification that I made earlier, of all senators. We need to talk about-and we approach this from different philosophical frameworks-the most appropriate means and mechanisms for achieving that, and I want to return to that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one question that people who do not have the responsibility for implementing policy often tend to gloss over in discussions about statements of agreed desirable outcomes like growth, investment, and jobs; that is, what is the timeframe within which those objectives are desirable? Are we talking about immediately? Do we want more jobs tomorrow? Are we talking about a two-to five-year period? Are we talking about over a generation, a lifetime, a career? What is it that we are talking about? In the main I want to talk about the next 12 months because I think we would all like to be here debating the Budget next year in a context in which economic growth, investment and jobs have all increased. I believe it is almost certain that that will be the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> All the indicators show that on balance that is the most likely outcome over the next 12 months, and I will refer to some of the signs and predictions that indicate that. Realistically we all have to say that nothing that any government does, whether by way of a budget or otherwise, will change the employment situation tomorrow. There is a long lead time for the consequences of the sort of initiatives we are talking about. We are now starting to see the slow return on the investment of major reductions in interest rates which the Government has undertaken over the past 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA> We do need, because of the attempt to corner the market in concern about jobs and growth, to look briefly at the historical record in a slightly more comprehensive timeframe than merely the past 12 months. As I usually do in these debates, I shall take not an arbitrary timeframe but that which is set out in the publication issued by the Parliamentary Research Service of the Department of the Parliamentary Library entitled Monthly Economic and Social Indicators, because it is a document which is available to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just look quickly at the number of employed persons over the period measured by that publication. From July 1986 until June 1991 there was an increase in jobs of 800,000, so there were 800,000 more employed persons over that period. If we wanted to take the period of this Government as a whole, we could get a much higher number but that then would be picking through arbitrary dates, and let me not do that. People talk about the change in employment as if, in some way, the Government's achievements have been caused by a fortuitous decline in the participation rate; but over that period the participation rate in employment has actually increased. </PARA>
<PARA> By most of the criteria, if we extend the period to a more realistic one, on balance we get a substantial increase in gross domestic product, in jobs, in the participation rate, et cetera. That is not to pretend that the past 12 to 18 months has not been an extremely difficult period for Australian families and households with the recession that we have had to endure; it is simply to say that to look forward we need to set our timeframes correctly and to assess the past we should not be quite so selective. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the evidence and the signposts showing that the recovery is on the way are clear, notwithstanding the enthusiasm by the Opposition for selectively quoting all the figures that might indicate the contrary. When we look for signs of improvement in most modern Western economies, the first thing we look at is housing: housing investment, housing approvals, housing finance approvals, and housing commencements. The first sign that the easing of monetary policies is likely to have the expected impact would be probably be seen there. We would expect to see that that would then start to flow through to demand for services in the manufacturing area-bricks, cement, et cetera. That is when, as the output of the factories that produce those goods starts to increase, the industry begins to operate at full capacity and we then see investment flowing. We do not see investment flowing before we come out of a recession; it tends to follow. It is not one of those leading indicators. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the surveys of leading indicators suggest that the economy is expected to move into a period of moderate growth during this six months in which we now find ourselves-and the figures released today are figures to 30 June. Most people expect this six-month period to be the start of a moderate period of growth which should continue through the financial year. That was certainly the prediction of the OECD; it is the most recent prediction of Westpac, for example, in its publication of August 1991. It expected that for the 1992 calendar year real GDP would increase by 2.3 per cent, with inflation at 3.5 per cent. That is a more moderate recovery from recession than we have had in the past, and in some ways that is a welcome feature. Australia has tended to be plagued by the boom to bust problem. We have tended to be plagued by coming out of recessions with a great surge, where governments buy short term advantage by priming the pump, sending the economy through the roof and then having to slow it down again. That tends to create a climate in which the slowdown drives us back into another recession, and we are back in the boom and bust cycle. If Westpac's predictions are correct, if the assessment of the indications of the OECD and almost every other economic analyst except those in the Opposition are correct, we would expect during the course of this six months to see the first signs of that return to economic growth reflected in the statistics and flowing through into improvements in jobs next year. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that the recovery is more moderate than we have experienced when emerging from previous recessions, and that may be for a variety of reasons. The Treasurer (Mr Kerin) set down some of those reasons in an address to EPAC on 12 July when he indicated a number of factors that may influence that, the first being that although the world economy is expected to remain relatively benign and that activity should pick up, international conditions are unlikely to provide a major fillip to growth in the next 12 months. I might interpolate that everybody is concerned about speculation of a slowdown in the Japanese economy and its consequences for the Australian and other economies, nevertheless, on balance, the international factors indicate moderate regrowth. Secondly, the rural economy is likely to remain weak; and, thirdly, the non-dwelling construction sector is likely to remain depressed. In a sense those are the three causal factors. The fourth point is the policy requirement for overall demand to continue to grow less quickly than production as a means of coping with the balance of payments problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there is no doubt that we are on the doorstep of recovery and that we can expect that to become evident during this or the next quarter, it is a recovery that will be somewhat more moderate than usual, although in many ways that is desirable so long as that moderate recovery is sustained and sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators have read the matter of public importance, they will see that it refers to what role the Budget should play in this-although Senator Short nearly forgot to talk about that. He only got on to what the Budget should do in the last couple of minutes of his speech. I understand that now and again we all get carried away with enthusiasm for criticism and we forget to say the last bit. Fortunately, Senator Short found that page in his speech towards the end. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very profound contribution and I look forward to the rest of Senator Brownhill's contribution. It is important to consider the role of the Budget in a circumstance such as this. I was somewhat perturbed-although, as he correctly said, it is not the first time he said that-when Senator Short spoke about trying to achieve a balanced Budget this year, in a recession. That is taking us back to the Sir Otto Neimeyer school of economics-that one comes out of a recession by imposing harsher and harsher stringency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not advocating a massive return to pump priming. However, I share the view expressed by the Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and every other spokesperson for the Government that what is called in jargon the `automatic stabilisers' ought to be allowed to operate. What has changed since the awful depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s is that modern fiscal policy and modern social welfare policy create a situation in which, as unemployment rises, government expenditure automatically rises to meet unemployment payments, government revenue falls through declining tax receipts and that provides an element of stimulus to the economy to operate as an automatic stabiliser. That is entirely appropriate. It is the reason that modern fiscal management is more humane and effective than its predecessor of the pre-Keynesian period. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the most conservative of economists is loath to advocate a return to a zero deficit where we are starting with a no policy change Budget outcome of a $5 billion deficit. I think $5 billion is the going figure-Senator Short said between $4 billion and $5 billion, so let us not quibble. I think that is actually the most recent figure. To suggest that we should slash that by $5 billion is suggesting a massive cut and a significant compounding of the problems of the recession just when the role of government will be exactly the opposite. It ignores entirely the social justice obligations of economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer, John Kerin, has been saying in a series of speeches-including that which was so inadequately quoted by Senator Alston at Question Time-economic policy requires a balance between concerns for economic outcomes and social justice. They need to be balanced. In a statement jointly with the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) about the preliminary Budget outcome for the last financial year, and going on to comment about the forthcoming year, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>The prospective sharp swing in the Budget from a surplus of $8 billion in 1989-90 to an estimated deficit of around $5 billion . . . will serve to cushion the downturn and facilitate the recovery in economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will not be aiming to offset the cyclical impact on the Budget--</PARA>
<PARA>I reiterate that it is very important that it does not. If we are seriously talking about growth, investment and jobs, it is fundamental that we should not try to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Opposition spokesperson on finance seriously to attempt to say that there would be a reduction to a balanced Budget-$5 billion worth of cuts or increases in taxes to balance the Budget in a recession-is alarming, and should cause significant fear and concern among all those who are reasonably concerned about the implications of the recession as we currently have it. Any prospects, with a $5 billion deficit, of only a very moderate recovery during the course of this financial year would be smashed by such a contractionary Budget. I reiterate:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government will not be aiming to offset the cyclical impact on the Budget-the broad objective will be to protect the structural integrity of the Budget so that as the recovery proceeds the Budget will swing back into surplus and contribute significantly to national savings and the repair of our current account position. </PARA>
<PARA>That is where I join with Senator Short-everyone is concerned about savings in Australia. I have a significant concern about the methodological approach to the measurement of savings not only in Australia but also internationally. That is an issue that anyone concerned with economic policy will need to address. Nevertheless, we appreciate we need to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time available-having said how I see the recovery that is emerging, and the role of the Budget in creating the climate for that recovery to continue-I refer briefly to what I certainly can assure the chamber the Budget will not do. The Budget will not-and in this climate it is entirely appropriate that it should not and, in any attempt to achieve investment, growth and jobs, entirely appropriate that it should not in the short term and the long term-involve that massive recessionary policy of $5 billion of cuts that Senator Short is advocating. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget will not propose abolishing the capital gains tax to open the way for investment in short term capital gains instead of substantial productive assets. It will not propose introducing a consumption tax to blow out of the water the inflationary achievements of the Government and of its policies. The preconditions for sustained and sustainable recovery are there at the moment. We are on the doorstep of that sustained and sustainable recovery. We will not introduce a Budget with any of those elements which would combine to smash the incipient recovery, distort the investment patterns and blow our inflationary achievements out of the water. </PARA>
<PARA> The concerns that Senator Short's matter of public importance refers to-although his speech scarcely did-about growth, investment and jobs, are shared by almost all in this chamber and certainly by Government senators, not because they are ends in themselves-I do not think anybody would advocate that they are. They are the elements of those policies which contribute to improved living standards for Australians now and tomorrow. Therefore, they need to be seen as part of a wider range of measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The other elements of the Budget are concerned with social justice and the programs and initiatives that are introduced to improve the lives of Australians-where they live, assistance to families and the improvement of the environment in which they live. Those are the issues that also need to be assessed in the Budget in terms of its impact on the living standards of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people have shown the capacity to make their judgments about this Government and about the Opposition, not just by the current circumstances in which we find ourselves, but over the last eight years of this Government and this Opposition and to assess the respective merits and performances of each. If we put ourselves in the position-as I indicated at the start-of looking back in 12 months time at the financial year which has just started and for which this Budget will apply, we will see that there has been an improvement in growth, investment and jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> We are better placed to achieve that sustained and sustainable growth with adequate and appropriate public and private investment and skilled, lasting and productive jobs for Australians to provide a basis for those improved living standards for this generation and for our children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is debating as a matter of public importance the need for the Government to bring down a Budget that will restore growth, investment and jobs. It is a matter of regret that the speaker for the Government was unable to offer any positive indication of any measures that the Government intends to introduce in the Budget to achieve any of these aims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All he did was tell us what would not be in the Budget. Unfortunately, the Government appears to be content to continue to leave it all to the market, to simply sit back, fold its arms and say, `With a bit of luck the market will fix it. The indications are that we will get there, so let us not worry about our responsibility as the Government to achieve the aspirations of Australian people, let us simply leave it all to the market forces'. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the Opposition-the coalition parties, I should say, because it is no longer a true opposition-that moved this particular matter of public importance. I have listened very carefully indeed to Senator Short's speech. He quite rightly and correctly outlined the desperate position we are in. He said that for the year to June, there will be a 2.4 per cent real decline in GDP; that investment in plant and equipment had declined in the June quarter by 19 per cent, compared with the previous June quarter; and that household savings which a decade ago were at 10 to 12 per cent were down to 3 to 4 per cent. He outlined the overseas debt, which is at $135 billion, costing $17.3 billion to service. He mentioned the figure of 10 per cent unemployment and he correctly stated that that is simply the tip of the iceberg, that the real figure is close to 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again I have listened carefully to find out what the Opposition proposes to do to address these problems. Once again I find that Senator Short has stated that there is a need to boost savings and investment, but I failed to discover in his speech even an indication of the measures that the Opposition would take to bring that about. So we are faced with a situation in which both the Government and the coalition parties are essentially standing back and saying, `Let's leave it to the market'. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I am doing the Opposition an injustice, because there are one or two measures that we have heard about. The Opposition is saying that it will abolish the capital gains tax so that the rich can get a little richer again. It is going to abolish the training levy. Apparently, we are a clever enough society. Of course, we are going to have the consumption tax. Unfortunately, far from even providing an alternative Budget approach, the Opposition has not even put any detail into its proposal for the consumption tax. All we know is that bread and milk will be dearer and Maseratis will be cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, other people have done some figure work, and I refer here to the current issue of the Bulletin. Looking at that, the pattern of the strategy of the consumption tax becomes very clear indeed. We find that at the income level of a typical taxable income of $65,000, the additional cost imposed by the consumption tax is $3,845, according to the Australian Taxpayers Association, based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics 1988-89 household expenditure survey. That amounts to approximately 6 per cent. So those people on a $65,000 taxable income will pay an extra 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> People on a typical taxable income of $31,500 will pay $2,226 extra. We are creeping up to 7.5 per cent. But wait for it; people in the lowest income bracket, $10,244, will pay an extra $1,295, close to a 13 per cent increase. That is all we know about the strategy of the Opposition to achieve greater investment, greater savings and a reduction in unemployment. Actually, I am grateful for the opportunity to reinforce today the message of the Democrats' alternative Budget proposals, particularly since we have already heard a great deal of misrepresentation from the coalition benches. I will deal with our proposals in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA> What we would like to see in the Government's Budget is a strategy to achieve a substantial reduction in unemployment and a decisive move towards a sustainable economy. These are the aims of the Democrats' alternative Budget and we will measure the Government's performance against them. The particular approach that we have outlined in our alternative Budget proposals is based on the belief that we cannot sit back and accept the figure of one million unemployed. We cannot sit back and accept the figure of 28.5 per cent of young people out of work. This figure is close to the 30 per cent unemployment amongst young people in Germany's Weimar Republic which paved the way for the extremist solutions of Adolf Hitler. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should be conscious of the future that we are not giving our young people. Already we see that crime rates are up and today we read in the paper that our prison population is up by 10 per cent. The signs are on the wall. However, as I have said before, this Government and the coalition parties-which are no longer in opposition because essentially they are doing exactly the same thing as the Government-are prepared to turn their backs and abdicate their responsibility and leave it all to the marketplace. They are not prepared to make any attempt to contain imports, to boost exports, to boost small business, to protect our industries from foreign control, or to strengthen the Foreign Investment Review Board. Currently, 40 per cent of our industries are under foreign control but that does not seem to worry either the coalition parties or the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Our alternative Budget proposals go on to suggest that the action we need to take is specific and targeted assistance to industry sectors. We want accelerated depreciation in industry sectors where we have a comparative advantage and where the future lies: in information technology, in environmental technology, in pharmaceuticals and in the service industries. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to take part in export facilitation schemes rather than cut small business out. According to the Government, which has the support of the Opposition, only the big companies should take part in export facilitation. We would like a 5 per cent bounty on new exports to generate economic activity in those sectors. But that is not enough. Very clearly, we need to do something about public infrastructure in Australia. We need to increase expenditure on schools, hospitals and transport and communications. The Budget provides for $750m in infrastructure grants to the States to finance that. </PARA>
<PARA> Inevitably, the question asked is: how is this to be achieved? The Opposition has called for more savings and for internal capital formation, because obviously we should not borrow more overseas. Let me state what the Democrats propose. Firstly, we propose a tax rebate on the first $1,000 interest from funds placed into a development fund. Secondly, we are suggesting that the Government take steps to direct part of the burgeoning superannuation funds into areas which will provide productive investment and work and employment for Australians. Some $15 billion is currently flowing into the coffers of superannuation funds. If we took most of that, including a proportion of what superannuation funds have currently invested, we could reduce our foreign debt by one-third within three or four days. </PARA>

<PARA> We already have an answer on record from the Government on this particular matter. In answer to a question yesterday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), who represents the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), said that the Government is not going to give any directions to superannuation funds. A major opportunity is available to us to mobilise and direct in a targeted fashion a major accumulation of capital in Australia, and we are not prepared to take that opportunity. But that is not where it ends. Clearly, we must become more efficient and more intelligent in the way in which we tackle the other countries which are competing against us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that we must become not only a clever country but also an intelligent society. It is unacceptable that thousands of young people cannot find places in our universities. Our Budget provides for an increase in university places and also for an increased emphasis on trade training schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The question we really have to answer when looking at the proposals of the Australian Democrats-proposals we would like the Government to implement-is whether we are prepared to accept the sort of unemployment we have now which has created misery and hopelessness for 28 per cent of our young people. In the closing minutes of the time allotted to me, I wish to turn to some of the points raised by members of the Opposition. Senator Macdonald obviously objects to imposing additional taxes on tobacco and alcohol. Our Budget proposal would get an additional $1.1 billion. Clearly, Senator Macdonald believes it is better to leave 28 per cent of young people without jobs than to make those people who wish to indulge in alcohol and tobacco pay a little more. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macdonald clearly objects to a land tax. I point out to him that our papers indicate a tax should be levied on land owned by foreign absentee landowners. I wonder what objection he has to that. He also objects to our proposal to recover road costs from trucking companies. I point out that there are at least two major reports-one by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics and the other by the Inter-State Commission, which was part of Treasury-which indicate quite clearly that the costs of road usage by trucks is not recovered by the current rates of registration fees. </PARA>
<PARA> What does Senator Macdonald want us to do? Does he want the Government to ensure that taxpayers pay for the costs of trucks using our roads? Clearly he does. Senator Macdonald mentioned one other matter; that is, the cut in defence expenditure-(Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA> The need for the Government to bring down a Budget next week that will restore growth, investment and jobs to the economy and hope to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA>This will be the Hawke Labor Government's ninth Budget. The past eight have led us down the gurgler. We are hoping that this time a plug will be put in the plug hole so that we do not go down any further. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate is being conducted against a background of an economy paralysed by lack of direction, incentive and capacity. It is also being conducted against a background of economic turmoil and squabbles between a man who was Treasurer and wants to be Prime Minister and a man who is Treasurer and gives the impression he would rather be somewhere else. Both these gentlemen want to take credit for their former portfolios. Mr Keating is taking credit for what happened in his former portfolio; Mr Kerin wants to take credit for leading the farmers down the road to the worst position they have been in since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia today has an economic record of which almost any developed nation would be ashamed. We in the Opposition are appalled by it; the man in the street is pretty disgusted by it; but those on the Government benches are scrambling to take the credit for it. In fact, in Question Time today, Senator Gareth Evans took credit for the state of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently one Labor Party backbencher asked: who should take the credit for nearly a million people out of work? As Senator Short said, one in four of our young people are out of work. Who should take the credit for our foreign debt which costs every man, woman and child in Australia some $8,000 a year to service? Who should take the credit for interest rates which are among the highest of any OECD country and which are the highest in Australia's history? Who should take the credit for a record number of bankruptcies, forced sales and business closures? There is no sign on the horizon of recovery in the short term, despite the almost daily suggestions or wishful thinking by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). </PARA>
<PARA> As recently as Tuesday, the Westpac bank ruled out any chance of economic recovery in 1991. Instead, it suggested that unemployment will get worse and is likely to stay above 10.1 per cent for the next 18 months. If we analyse each part of this debate-growth, investment and jobs-we see that the Government's performance in each sector has been absolutely abysmal. Even more depressing is the realisation, which we in the Opposition have come to, that the Labor Government has no capacity and no agenda for improvement in any of those sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the question of growth in the rural sector. The high point for agriculture is the record growth in the number of farmers. Four thousand eight hundred farmers are now receiving assistance under the rural adjustment scheme and another 9,000 farmers have applied for rural assistance. Seven per cent of all farmers in Australia are asking for assistance from the Government because they have been driven to the brink of bankruptcy-some have been driven to bankruptcy-by this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore not surprising to realise that with the number of farmers applying for assistance increasing, the number of farmers remaining in production is declining. In 1988-89 we had some 125,000 farmers, compared with nearly 170,000 in 1985-86. However, there has been a long term decline in the number of farmers which has continued unabated through the entire Hawke Government period. That is a sad indictment on the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of any performance capacity in the manufacturing industries, Australia relies very heavily on exports of rural commodities. Over its years in office, the Government has soldiered on under the mistaken notion that somehow metropolitan-based manufacturing, transport, tourism and service industries and no wealth creating activities will somehow pull us out of the problem we are in. The decline in the rural sector has reached such a level that the Budget next Tuesday will need to provide more than just the hinted additional assistance of $100m for the rural assistance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Listening to the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Simon Crean, addressing the Press Club yesterday, I suggest that the rural sector is in for another let down. Minister Crean appears to take the view that as long as Australian farmers become more productive and somehow find ways to value add, then their problems will be over. He failed to say how farmers in this country can be expected to become more productive, given that we are already among the most productive in the world and in an economic and trading environment which positively discriminates against them being so. He failed to suggest how we can make manufacturing industries in this country more efficient in order to allow any benefits of a value-added industry to flow through. He also failed to suggest where, how and to whom Australia could sell these value-added products when we have a wage structure and an economic climate that prevents us from being competitive on the world scene. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, we have growth in small businesses; we have record growth in the number of bankruptcies. In the year to June 1991, a record number of 12,991 businesses-nearly 13,000-were officially declared bankrupt. This was an increase of almost 52 per cent on the previous year which, in itself, was 15 per cent higher than the year before. </PARA>
<PARA> I go around many of the country areas all over this country-as I know, Madam Acting Deputy President, you do in South Australia-and I see the number of shops which are closing in country towns. These figures do not include those which have voluntarily gone out of business, or have reduced staff or their services. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent paper published by the Australian Chamber of Commerce suggests that the external reasons for the low success/high failure rates of small businesses are, firstly, the plethora of regulations imposed and, secondly, a deterioration in the economy. The paper said:</PARA>
<PARA>This debasement of the small business environment has been compounded by the Hawke Government's recession-inducing higher interest rate regime. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, the former Treasurer-the would-be Prime Minister-takes the credit for giving us the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> I imagine that any one of those 13,000 businesses would be offended by-I find it somewhat galling-a glossy colour photograph publication called Small Business in Australia, recently published by the Minister for Small Business and Customs, Mr David Beddall. It is an extremely expensively produced public relations exercise which, I suggest, hides the true picture of small business in Australia. What a pity the Minister did not tell the real story with more facts and less coloured photographs, like the National Farmers Federation country crisis financial survey. This ANOP survey indicates that some grain farmers this year will have a 94 per cent drop in income, and even the least affected beef producers will have 42 per cent slashed from last year's figures. </PARA>
<PARA> So where is the growth for primary producers? With growing unemployment queues and declining markets for our rural products, the future for farming looks bleak. The future for young farmers is one of increasing pessimism and hopelessness. </PARA>
<PARA> On investment, what has this Government done to stimulate the economy? We have a forecast current account deficit at the end of 1991 of $15 billion, or 3.9 per cent of our GDP. Servicing that debt costs every Australian $8,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Westpac suggests that continued poor prospects for rural incomes will put the brakes on a full recovery for manufacturers for the next 18 months. The finance sector is expected to continue to face difficulties through next year. The Commonwealth Bank paints no happier a picture. It says that the household savings ratio has fallen to its lowest level on record and is coupled with a serious deterioration in consumer confidence. Retail trade figures released on Tuesday support that, retail sales having fallen in June. People are saving less and spending less simply because they have less disposable income, notwithstanding the magic cure-all of a lower inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no incentive for anyone to invest in Australia at the present time. Notionally, interest rates are supposed to have come down. Housing loan rates are around 11.5 per cent. But talk to people in business, go and talk to any of the farmers, and one will find that they are not able to get any rate better than between 15 and 16 per cent. For those who are considered at risk, the margins are often some 5 per cent higher than that figure. The New South Wales Farmers Association wrote to me only yesterday expressing:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . extreme concern at the level of interest rates. Despite a great deal of publicity on falling nominal interest rates, the situation remains that real interest rates (the difference between stated bank rates and inflation) are still extremely high in both historical terms and compared to our overseas competitors. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The economy will not recover from a recession without a major increase in investment by business. If we do not get an investment led recovery, especially in the international trading sectors of the economy, we will continue along the path of `stop/go' economic management that will bring us to another recessionary crunch after a consumer spending led recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask: how do we improve the economy? I will come to that in a moment. I know Senator McMullan wanted that question answered. He has now left the chamber-obviously he is not on duty at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> When we move to the third element of the debate, the issue of jobs, we get to probably the most savage and heartless result of the Hawke Labor Government's handiwork. Unemployment, predicted at 10.5 per cent by the end of 1991, is higher than the UK at 8.9 per cent, the EEC average of 8.7 per cent and the OECD average of 6.8 per cent. Statistically, it sounds awful, but when we translate that to real people it is absolutely frightening. That is what this Government has shown no regard for. </PARA>
<PARA> There are currently nearly one million Australians looking for a job, and that does not take into account those who have given up the search. Last month over 44,000 people gave up looking for work; if they had not, unemployment would have been at 10.3 per cent. It will most likely reach that figure well before the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of people receiving unemployment benefits grew by 10,000 to 700,000-odd in July, with 38,300 more people looking for work than in June. The cost of those on unemployment is estimated for 1990-91 to be just under $3.5 billion. Who pays for that-the ever-shrinking work force and businesses which do not have any incentives from the Government?</PARA>
<PARA> In this matter of public importance debate we have asked for policies which will restore growth, investment, jobs and hope to the Australian economy, but there are no signs that this Government is either willing to provide or is capable of providing the necessary reforms. It is a truism that leaders must lead, but this Labor Government, with at least two people at the moment wanting to lead it, is still leaderless.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has a firm policy mix to restore incentive, growth, investment and hope to the economy and to the community. We must have taxation reform and a simpler tax system that gives incentives to people who want to work harder, earn more and save, so that they can have more money in their pockets at the end of the week to spend or save in the way they want to. As Senator Short said earlier in this debate, there has been a 62 per cent fall in savings in the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> We need labour market reforms. In some industries Australia is being dragged screaming into the twentieth century, with wage contracts removing at last the monopolistic powers of union bully boys who for too long have crippled industry and incentive in this country. We must have efficiency in telecommunications, transport, shipping, the waterfront and power generation. Despite the opinion of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy that all is well and that real reform has started on the waterfront, it has not started in a way which will enable us to become competitive on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> We have hopes-and I am sure that Senator Short, leading this debate, has hopes-that these vital issues will be addressed in next Tuesday's Budget. We have hope, but very little expectation, that this Government has the fortitude or the policies to do the right thing; that is, to take actions to restore Australia to prosperity. Let us hope that it has the guts to put the plug in the bath so we all do not go down the gurgler as we have been doing for the last eight Budgets that this Government has brought down. </PARA>

The Opposition is calling for that because it claims there is a need to boost growth and investment in jobs in the Australian economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do. How can we do these things if the Opposition is not calling for an expansionary Budget? I find this quite strange. The point I was making on Tuesday when we spoke on a very similar subject was that economic activity in the present day and age does not reflect the policies in place in the present day and age; it reflects the policies that were in place in the past. There are enormous time lags in economics. One may talk about 15 to 18 months in some cases between changing policies and actually seeing a real effect on the economy. That is the reality of some aspects of monetary policy. We have to be very mindful that even though we might change a policy, it can be many months before there is a tangible impact on investment, production or jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Economic policy in 1989-90 was very tight indeed. The objective of that was to restrain the demand for imports into the Australian economy. There was a large gap between the ability to spend and the ability of the Australian economy to produce, and that gap was filled by imports. The policy of the Government was to reduce imports, and it has succeeded in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> Policy is now less restrictive than it was last year. Monetary policy has been relaxed. At the beginning of last year official cash interest rates were 18 per cent, and now they are 10.5 per cent. We have seen a 7 1/2 percentage point reduction in official cash interest rates. Borrowing is much cheaper. We have only to look at the surveys--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brownhill clearly has not seen the surveys of home affordability published in recent weeks, which clearly show that it is much easier to service a loan now than it has been in the last couple of years. Fiscal policy has been relaxed. From 1 January we have had a significant reduction in personal income tax. The cost of that to revenue was $2,500m in a full financial year. We have seen that impact on the level of household disposable incomes, through the increase in take-home pay. That has been attained in that way rather than through extra wage claims. Those tax cuts themselves should help boost economic activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We had a Budget forecast for the last financial year of a surplus of $8.1 billion, including the tax cuts. In reality, that was the fourth Budget surplus in a row. We have had also the impact of the so-called automatic stabilisers in the economic system, which reflected the position and the economic situation of Australia. Those automatic stabilisers worked both to reduce the Government tax take from the rest of the economy and to lift expenditure for cyclical reasons, for example, through higher unemployment benefits. Those two things-the lower revenue and the higher expenditure on benefits-have also helped to underpin and cushion the Australian economy over the last 12 months. Those automatic stabilisers saw the forecast Budget surplus reduced, in reality, to a preliminary figure of $1.8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> When looking at the Budget this year, we must look at the setting for the Budget. Today the Opposition has raised a matter of public importance calling for what I have interpreted as an expansionary Budget. But let us look at the economic indicators. There has been a very tangible improvement in the balance of payments current account. That has been the number one objective of economic policy. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kemp" NAMEID="WW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator Kemp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No wonder-you have driven the economy through the floor!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind Senator Kemp that unfortunately the balance of payments has been the main constraint on Australian economic growth in the post-war period. In 1989-90 the deficit was $22 billion. In the financial year which has just ended it was reduced to $15 billion, with an 8 per cent increase in exports. They are all official figures on the public record which show a tangible improvement in that part of the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Inflation, I am sure, has been mentioned already this afternoon by honourable senators on my side of the House. We now have prices rising by a mere 3.4 per cent per annum. The figure for last year was 7.7 per cent. So in a financial year we have more than halved the rate of increase in consumer prices in Australia. We are now becoming much more competitive compared with our trading partners on the question of costs. The average rate of price rise in our trading partners was 4.3 per cent in the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates are down; inflation is down and we are starting to get the economic fundamentals right in the Australian economy. However, there is great concern on this side of the chamber about the level of unemployment. The 9.8 per cent unemployment figure released last week showed the level of the problem in the Australian labour force. Unemployment is almost back to the recessionary figures of 1982-83. We understand the concern of the community and the anxiety in many Australian families about their livelihoods. We can certainly see the impact that the recession has had on opportunities for full time male employees. Today we have learned of the one per cent fall in gross domestic product in the June quarter. Obviously, that is of concern to this side of parliament. But in making that comment I note that the March figure has been revised upwards. One thing we have to be very mindful about with these gross domestic product figures is the numerous and significant revisions that are made to the data from time to time. So that is the current situation.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other positive economic indicators in the marketplace that I am sure have been ignored today on the Opposition side of the chamber. The largest survey done in Australia of business expectations is the Dun and Bradstreet survey, which is coordinated through Melbourne University. It is a very large survey, with 1,000 business respondents. It is showing an expected September quarter which is much better than previous quarters. The index compiled in the Dun and Bradstreet survey of data for the September quarter is showing its second successive quarterly rise. More firms are expecting more orders, more firms are expecting higher dollar value sales, and the expectation is that the manufacturing sector will lead an economic recovery. I heard Senator Brownhill talking about housing and interest rates a moment ago. The reality in the housing sector is that in May a 1.1 per cent increase was recorded in the number of housing loans. Compared with May last year, a 10 per cent increase in the number of housing loans was recorded. That again reflects increased housing affordability in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget outline from the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) for this financial year has a starting point of a deficit of $5,000m. This will be the first deficit in five financial years, because we have had Budget surpluses in the last four financial years. That $5 billion deficit is a cyclical one, reflecting the decline in Government revenue and the increased payments through social security. It is not a structural deficit and it is not a long term deficit; it is one reflecting the stage of the economic cycle we are in at present. </PARA>
<PARA> It is legitimate to ask what the Liberals really want. What did they want when they put forward this matter of public importance today? For example, do they want a larger Budget deficit? They talk about restoring growth in investment and jobs. Are they in fact calling for a larger Budget deficit? One has to look at their track record to get to the facts, and the reality is that the Liberal Party in government, year after year, delivered Budget deficits. On the basis of that, I assume that those opposite are calling for a Budget deficit. Alternatively, would they follow their rhetoric about cutting government expenditure? Certainly, Mr Reith, when doorstopped on 1 July, laid out some very strong hints about cuts in government spending. Would the Liberals privatise the Department of Social Security? Dr Hewson has actually raised, for the first time in Australian history, the privatisation of that Department-as a means, I presume, of cutting Government spending. They are some of the measures that Liberal speakers need to explain and own up about. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that we can be absolutely clear about is that the Hawke Budget to be brought down next Tuesday will not include a consumption tax. It will not include a value-added tax, as proposed by the Liberals. We will be doing quite the contrary. We will be reforming the wholesale sales tax. One of the initiatives to be taken in the Budget, which will cost the revenue $200m this financial year and $375m next financial year, will be to exempt more inputs into business production from sales tax. We are going to exempt a range of raw materials and equipment, inputs into business production, from the wholesale sales tax, at a cost to revenue of $200m. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly will not be bringing in a general tax on expenditure, a value-added tax, which the Liberal Party has as the cornerstone of its policy. It wants to tax virtually all goods and services produced in the Australian economy at a rate of 15 per cent. So, for the first time in Australia's history, if a Liberal Budget were being brought down we would have a tax on food, clothing, footwear, services such as electricity and gas, bus fares and so forth. That 15 per cent tax would kick-start inflation and lift the consumer price index by 7 per cent in one go. I think the relevance of this matter of public importance, as the Liberals have called for a Budget to bring down growth, investment and jobs, is to ask: how would a consumption tax in a Liberal Party Budget boost jobs? After all, a consumption tax, by definition, is a tax on spending. If spending generates jobs, how does a consumption tax help to generate jobs?</PARA>
<PARA> One thing that is clear about this proposed tax is that it will cheapen the price of luxury goods. At present, luxury goods face a 30 per cent sales tax rate. Under the Liberals, we would see a 15 per cent tax on luxury goods. The reality is that overwhelmingly the luxury goods consumed in the Australian economy are imported. So the Liberals will cheapen the price of luxury goods and kick-start luxury imports. That is the reality. They will see people substituting luxury motor vehicles for Australian made motor vehicles because the top-of-the-range motor vehicles will be relatively cheaper. We will see production and jobs transferred offshore. So how on earth can a Liberal Budget, based around a value added tax or a consumption tax, generate jobs if it has this effect?</PARA>
<PARA> We could also ask how a new tax on food, clothing, fares, electricity and telephone bills would help the unemployed anyway? All these things would be taxed for the first time in Australia. It is clear that low income families spend a very high proportion of their total incomes on food and clothing-all the Budget studies show that. The Liberals would have a Budget which would tax equally margarine and Mercedes, yoghurt and yachts, and fruit and furs. This is the outrageous, unfair and unacceptable tax proposal that they would base a Liberal Budget around. </PARA>
<PARA> The point to bear in mind is that not only would this policy have these effects but also it would create more red tape. For years I have listened to Liberal Party members and senators talk about red tape for business and the amount of paperwork generated for business by government regulation, and so forth. That is their rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the proposal for a consumption tax or a value added tax, as it will be known, we see the potential for an enormous escalation in the amount of business red tape and paperwork. For example, at present the sales tax in Australia is a wholesale tax. There are far fewer wholesalers than retailers. Approximately 75,000 wholesalers are the collection points for the current sales tax, but about 750,000 retail businesses would have to file returns and paperwork for the value added tax. So we will see a vast increase in the number of tax inspectors needed to check on the value added tax. For example, in the United Kingdom it costs $2 for every $100 of revenue to collect the value added tax. At present, the Australian sales tax costs 50c per $100 to collect; that is, a quarter of the cost of the value added tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the Liberal Budget plans for jobs and the unemployed really revolve around a tax inspector led recovery. That is what the Liberals are on about because a value added tax would have to be to checked at every stage of production. We would have more bureaucracy and red tape and there would be thousands and thousands of jobs for tax inspectors. Our Budget next week will cushion the downturn in the economy, facilitate recovery and promote greater fairness. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA> The need for the Government to bring down a Budget next week that will restore growth, investment and jobs to the economy and hope to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA>It has to be said that the Government has given up on employment and workers' living standards. I ask honourable senators in the chamber to reflect on this. Senator Sherry, who is a former trade union boss, might particularly like to do so. Who would ever have thought that at a national Australian Labor Party conference a motion suggesting that cutting unemployment should be Labor's top priority would be defeated? If we ever want to think of the difference between this mob over there and the Labor Party of old, I suggest that the defeat of that motion says it all. </PARA>

In the old days we used to think that Gough Whitlam had run the worst government in Australian history. Indeed, that is what the new look Labor Party used to think. This Government makes Gough Whitlam's Government look not good but certainly not the worst government in Australian history.

<PARA> Record unemployment is what this Government has given us. The Government has conceded that unemployment will rise to almost 11 per cent. Senator Evans was asked today by Senator Short to give his latest forecast. He twisted and turned in the wind, hedged and even refused to confirm the Government's existing figure of just under 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Record youth unemployment and a record fall in living standards-what a record for a Labor Government. I suggest that Senator Cook get his Department, as he always does, to go through the national accounts and look at what has happened to per capita household disposable income. If that is what Senator Cook uses to measure living standards, he will find that the living standards of the Australian worker and the Australian family have fallen even further. The Hawke Government and the ACTU-which comrade Ferguson told us not so long ago is part and parcel of this Government-are presiding over a human and economic disaster, the magnitude of which we have not seen since the Depression of the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> I give Senator Maguire and Senator Sherry points for standing up today to defend this pathetic Government. One would have to say that that takes an act of political courage; there is no question of that. In the old days, Labor used to say, `We will strike this accord with the trade union bosses. We have an accord so that we do not have to have a fight inflation first policy. We could drive this economy, spend up big, borrow big and avoid inflation and a major recession'. That was the rationale for the accord when Labor started it. But what has the Government done? It has run the economy and workers' living standards right into the ground. It is now cutting workers out of jobs which they have often held for years. For a Labor Government, the present Government is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Maguire talked about his general fears for a goods and services tax, the very tax that Keating and Hawke promoted so vigorously in 1985. Were they lying or were they telling the truth in 1985? Senator Sherry will be coming into the chamber and I will ask him that question. In 1985 Labor said that this was one of the major reforms to make a fairer tax system. We have volumes of quotes from Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, both of whom argued that point. </PARA>

They want to impose a tax on brown coal, do they not? That is what they want to do. I hope that when Senator Powell and Senator Spindler go down to the Yallourn Valley, where the Democrats have been cultivating voters as hard as they can, they will get out and sell the idea that somehow we must have higher taxes on these products. I think they have a huge task ahead of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What else do the Democrats want to do? They want to slash defence spending-as Senator Mcdonald has pointed out in this chamber. All those defence establishments around Australia are going to be absolutely delighted at the massive cuts that the Australian Democrats are proposing in defence. We know they do not believe in defence because of their behaviour over the Gulf war. The Democrats are one of the few parties in the Western world that were prepared to oppose that Gulf commitment. We know how the Democrats feel about defence, but I am proud to say that most Australians do not share those sentiments. If the Democrats want my view, the reason why the polls are showing that their vote is going through the floor is the crazy policies that Senator Coulter and his colleagues are going out and promoting day after day. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus is in the chamber. He has been a Minister in this Government for many years now. He sits there grinning like a Cheshire cat.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate, the areas I intend to deal with include the relationship between Australia and the rest of the world-which is pertinent in terms of our Budget strategy; the economy over the next 12 months; some of the initiatives of the current Federal Labor Government in its Budgets over the past decade; and also, in the Budget context, some of the initiatives that I hope will be contained within it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I commence, I must say that I think it was a bit rich of Senator Kemp to make such heavy going of the 40 per cent tax on wine when, in fact, one of his solutions to the budgetary problems-and he boasts about one of the economic solutions the Opposition will be presenting to this country in its first Budget, if it is ever elected-will be a 15 per cent consumption tax. One of the three main solutions the Opposition has for this country is to impose a new tax on everything that is produced and moved in this country. If he has the gall to complain about a 40 per cent tax on wine-which I do not agree with-and if he has the gall to propose a 15 per cent consumption tax on everyone, we look forward to his trying to sell that. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the Australian economy and the world economy-which has not been touched on in this debate-there have been some very important changes over the last 30 years in respect of international conditions. During the 1980s there was increasing internationalisation of the Australian economy, and that is a trend that is conveniently ignored by those opposite. The result of this increasing internationalisation is that more than ever our economic fate is linked with the developments that are occurring in the world economy, and particularly in Asia. This change is reflected in our international trade statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 1980s the volume of Australian exports of goods and services, as a share of gross domestic product, increased from 14.4 per cent to 17.7 per cent. Import penetration increased at a faster rate. So now in the last decade more than ever our future is linked with the international economy. Unfortunately, those opposite did not adopt the strategies during their very lengthy periods in government to enable us to move though that transitional economy in much better shape. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference in our performance on the two sides of the trade account is reflected in a larger current account deficit throughout the 1980s and, with the shift in financing towards debt and accompanying substantial increase in our external debt, although great mobility of international capital allows us time to get our current account down, the task of tackling this imbalance remains of the utmost importance. We have been tackling that consistently over the last eight years in the Budgets that this Government has presented. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the economy over the next 12 months, it is certainly correct that the economy remains subdued, but there are some encouraging signs of recovery. Because economic data does lag, some of the views of the economy are necessarily intuitive, but there is sufficient anecdotal evidence, backed up by judgments about changes in economic fundamentals, as well as the timing of the various factors. Some of the important recent indicators released include: building approval statistics, which contain the first hard evidence that the building activity may be turning around, especially in the private residential sector; the latest housing finance statistics, which show an increased interest in the housing market; the index of consumer sentiment, which has risen for the fourth consecutive month to its highest level since May 1989; and also the CAI-Westpac survey of industrial trends, which suggests that the decline in manufacturing may be bottoming. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in commenting on this survey, its authors noted that the turning point in expectations recorded in the June quarter was similar to that which preceded the 1983 recovery in manufacturing production. These are early signs that indicate the economy will be recovering towards the end of this year and into next year. I have already mentioned that the dwelling sector is now showing signs of responding to the improved affordability of houses. Also important will be a modest pick-up in private consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Maguire has already outlined the devastating effects of a consumption tax on consumption. One does not have to look very far across the Tasman Sea to New Zealand to see that the consumption tax, amongst other factors, has flattened the New Zealand economy. The New Zealand economy is in a state of soporific torpor. It has just been completely wiped through the floor. The entire retail industry, which has been heavily affected by the consumption tax, has been falling apart, and that is one of the prescriptions that the Liberal and National parties want to impose in their first Budget, should they ever get the chance. </PARA>
<PARA> In the medium term, of course, business investment will play a crucial role in underpinning sustained growth in demand and employment. It is the Government's goal to put in place a policy framework that will foster business confidence and encourage strong growth in business capital. </PARA>
<PARA> The current state of the labour market gives me no satisfaction. The unemployment rate of close to 10 per cent-and in my home State 11.5 per cent-represents a significant cost to the Australian economy; and there is no doubt about that. It reflects the real hardship that is being suffered by hundreds of thousands of Australians. Ultimately, however, we must pursue policies that produce sustained growth in output and end the boom and bust cycles that this country has been through for the last 100 years. Those opposite have failed to meet the challenge. We have to break those cycles in this country, and the policies that this Government has adopted have contributed towards ending that sort of cycle. </PARA>
<PARA> We are enduring heavy costs in this recession, but we now need to take full advantage of the opportunities that exist to achieve sustained low inflationary growth. Again, when those opposite were last in office before they were removed by the Australian people, there was massive unemployment and significant inflation. In their seven or eight years-which, I note, many leading members of the Liberal-National Party considered wasted years-they did nothing to improve the fundamentals of this country. For years and years this country sat behind high tariff walls. When we had full employment, when we had the opportunity to make significant adjustments in a range of industries, what did those opposite do? They did nothing. They sat behind those tariff walls and, as a consequence, we have to catch up very quickly with the rest of the world in terms of the tariff adjustments that have to be made. It would have been much better for this country, and much easier, if those adjustments had commenced decades ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the medium term prospects, particularly in respect to inflation. Inflation is forecast to remain at around 4 per cent, which is comparable with the inflation rates of our major trading partners. Certainly, the latest figures would indicate that we are going to do better than most of our major trading partners. This compares with a relatively high rate of 8 per cent in the first year of the recovery, in 1982-83. The significant slowing in inflation over the past year also contrasts with Australia's comparatively high inflation rates over much of the 1970s and 1980s. There are also encouraging signs of declining inflationary expectations, and I think that is also particularly important. For two decades this economy has lived with high inflation expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> The gains to be made from this are considerable. In terms of fiscal policy and the contribution that this Government has made in the various Budgets that it has handed down, the revised estimate for the starting point for this year's Budget is a deficit of around $5 billion. That will be our first significant Budget deficit, and this represents a major achievement on what occurred when those opposite were in government. Year after year they had significant Budget deficits; they had no fiscal policy. That was another lost opportunity in their seven or eight years in office. Those opposite continually condemn themselves about those lost opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not attempted to offset the effects on the Budget of lower revenues and higher unemployment benefit payments. Certainly, I am hopeful and confident that next week's Budget will ensure that those relativities are maintained. This Government has allowed the automatic stabilisers to work so that it can moderate the effects of the recession. We will be running, I believe, a significant Budget deficit this year for the first time. We are grappling with the formulation of the 1991-92 Budget; we need to look at Australia's medium term economic health. It is important that we avoid decisions that boost the deficit, and I believe the aim should be to protect the integrity of the Budget and the Budgets that have been set down over the last eight years, particularly as the economy emerges from this recession. A clear fiscal policy will make an important contribution to restoring public sector saving and in the medium term will help repair the imbalance of our external account. We cannot afford any deterioration in the structure of the Budget in 1991-92. That would only make the medium term adjustments that we have to make a great deal more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of our external account, over the past year we have made very major progress in reducing the current account deficit. For the 11 months to May the current account deficit was $14.7 billion, 30 per cent below the level over the same Budget period of last year. The outcome for 1990-91 will be significantly below the Budget forecast of $18 billion. This is very encouraging for the future of this country because, as I said earlier, for years we lived behind high protective tariff walls and failed to make the adjustments. We are now paying the price for that. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of investment, in the medium term private investment is needed to underpin a sustained growth in our economy and I believe the Budget will ensure that happens. Some of the important lessons of the 1980s relate to the powerful positive influences of real wage restraint, which only this Government was able to achieve through the accord, and the factor share correction; these were very important in restoring investment and business confidence. There has been ongoing micro-economic reform and significant economic reform. In fact more has been accomplished during the past eight years than was ever accomplished in the 40-odd years of honourable senators opposite when they were in government. This Government has set the pace on those issues and has made change. The Government has ensured greater flexibility and productivity improvements in the economy through the changes it has adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the approach the Government will adopt in the Budget next week will stand in stark contrast to the sorts of policies put forward by the Opposition. If the Opposition were ever to gain government, the three main props of any budget it would introduce would be privatisation, a consumption tax and changes to industrial relations. The consumption tax has already been dealt with by my colleague Senator Maguire. How anyone in this country could advocate a significant new tax as a way out of our economic problems is a mystery to me; it is certainly a unique formula for economic recovery and I believe it will be treated justly by the Australian voters at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's solution to industrial relations-so-called enterprise bargaining-is actually individual wage bargaining and is very similar to the changes introduced to industrial relations in New Zealand. I see that some honourable senators opposite are nodding their agreement; that is good to see because in reality the outcome of the industrial relations changes the Opposition wants to introduce will be that the safety net of annual leave, sick leave, superannuation and reasonable wage increases-such as those established by the Industrial Relations Commission in this country-will be done away with, except for a basic minimum wage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will ensure that individual workers have to negotiate their own wages and conditions with individual employers. If Opposition members believe that there will be fair, just and equitable bargaining in that process, they will only need to talk to workers when they vote at election time, because the workers understand the consequences of those sorts of changes. Again the Opposition's solution in its first budget would be to flatten the wages and conditions of workers in this country. Members of the Opposition are certainly not hiding those outcomes, and the Government will certainly highlight them in the next election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the elements of next week's Budget, I believe that the Government, as it has over the past eight years, will place great emphasis on Labor's commitment to a social justice program. This has been clearly set out in its social wage concept. I believe that some of the great initiatives and changes the Labor Government has made-for example, family payments and the introduction of superannuation for all-will be continued in this Budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One absolutely certain thing to come from this debate is that the economic circumstances of this country will not be improved by the decerebrate invective of Senator Kemp. The alternative budget of the Australian Democrats says that a small levy will be applied to the consumption of fossil fuels, including imports, but excluding exports. Quite clearly when Senator Kemp was speaking he did not have his brain in gear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to contrast the minimum proposal from the Opposition regarding a consumption tax with the very detailed proposals put forward by the Democrats. On the one hand, the Opposition is imposing a consumption tax on all goods and services. Now it is quite clear to anybody with an IQ above 50 that what goes into every piece of good and service is both labour and resource. To place a tax on the labour component of goods and services when we have high unemployment makes very little sense, quite apart from the questions of equity and justice in relation to disadvantaged people. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, placing a tax on the resources component, which is precisely what our tax on fossil fuels relates to, makes a great deal of sense. It does not put a tax on the labour component of the goods and services that use those resources. Moreover, as we have already heard, the Opposition's consumption tax will increase the inflation rate by 7 per cent. Let me point out that our very modest tax on fossil fuels, which will raise $500m specifically in relation to the energy conservation part of our alternative, will have an inflationary effect of 0.12 per cent. However, even that inflation rate will be one-off and temporary because that money is specifically targeted for the development and implementation of technologies aimed at reducing the energy consumption required for production in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, to the extent that the amount of energy consumed to produce a particular good or service is reduced, of course the effect of the tax and its application in that area will be strongly counter-inflationary. It will actually produce more goods and services at lower cost, which is precisely what is necessary to get the Australian economy going. </PARA>
<PARA> While we would agree with the general thrust of the Opposition's motion, we see nothing in its proposal so far that will do anything to deliver any better economy because clearly we need to be on about an ecologically sustainable society. If we simply tinker at the edges, which is what the Government and the Opposition are attempting to do, we will not move towards a society that is better, both for ourselves and for our children. The proposal of the Australian Democrats in relation to the spending of the extra revenue we will raise is to address precisely those areas that will benefit the economy in the long term and move it more positively towards ecological sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the Democrats have been criticised because we have proposed areas in which we believe spending is needed and we have not, until last year, outlined very carefully precisely where the money was to come from. What we did in last year's budget and in this year's budget is draw up balanced budgets which show precisely where the money will come from, what the objectives are and where the money will go. That is something the Opposition has not done, has never done and is still not addressing in relation to its proposal for a broad consumption tax, which several senators, particularly from the Government side, have pointed out will be expensive and inequitable.

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO THE REPORT BY THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, ``RESCUE THE FUTURE: REDUCING THE IMPACT OF THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT''</PARA>
<PARA>This is a statement presented by Senator the Honourable Peter Cook, on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Honourable Simon Crean MP. </PARA>
<PARA>The enhanced greenhouse effect is widely recognised as a global problem. International negotiations are underway which aim to produce an internationally concerted series of actions to address it. Australia is taking a leading role in those negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government also recognises the need for a domestic response, as shown by our announcement last year of an interim planning target to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 20% by the year 2005. There are many actions which can be taken in Australia which will not only contribute to reducing the global impact of the greenhouse effect, but also contribute to the welfare of Australia and Australians. However, in setting the interim targets, the Government recognised that it would be imprudent for Australia to proceed with measures which have net adverse economic impacts nationally or on Australia's trade competitiveness in the absence of similar action by major greenhouse gas producing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>The magnitude of the greenhouse problem came to prominence following the Toronto International Conference on the Changing Atmosphere, held in June 1988. The Senate, recognising the importance of the issues, followed up quickly by asking the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology to report on the implications for Australia of the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA>After some preliminary investigations, the Committee accepted that there was sufficient scientific evidence to indicate that global warming was occurring and that the greenhouse effect was being enhanced by human activities through emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide. Like the Government, they recognised the requirement for action to reduce the greenhouse effect. Therefore, the Committee tabled an interim report in June 1989 in which it refined the terms of reference to more action-orientated ones, namely to report on:</PARA>
<PARA>The contribution that Australian industry, science and technology can make to reducing the greenhouse effect, in particular:</PARA>
<PARA> - implementation of changes in energy production and distribution, consumption patterns, industrial production, and government policies which would help adapt to, slow and eventually reverse the global warming trend;</PARA>
<PARA> - the priority which should be accorded to such changes;</PARA>
<PARA> - technical, economic and institutional impediments to such changes; and</PARA>
<PARA> - realistic methods of overcoming these impediments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's Report, entitled ``Rescue the Future'', was tabled on 12 February 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>In its Report, the Committee has concentrated on ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector, which account for almost half of the warming effect of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. We welcome the Committee's analysis of this part of the problem, while recognising that a comprehensive response to the greenhouse problem will have to also take into account other greenhouse gases, and consider not only sources but also ``sinks'' of those gases. A comprehensive response will also have to look at ways in which the world, and Australia in particular, can adapt to climate change. </PARA>
<PARA>As its basic strategy for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from Australia, the Committee advocates improving the efficiency of energy use. The Government concurs with this approach, not least because, as the Committee point out, actions to increase the efficiency of energy use will result in resource and cost savings to the benefit of industry and the community, regardless of the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee emphasised the importance of proceeding with action and made more than 40 detailed recommendations for measures aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. These recommendations range in character from calls for more research on fuel-saving technologies, through information services, increased energy efficiency, changes in building regulations, to development of national action plans for urban transport and electricity supply and distribution. </PARA>
<PARA>Government Actions To Date</PARA>
<PARA>Senators will be aware that the Government has already taken substantial steps to address the enhanced greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government was one of the first in the world to accede to the Montreal Protocol which addresses protection of the atmospheric ozone layer through reducing emissions of the chlorinated fluorocarbons (CFCs). The CFCs are also a very substantial contributor to the enhanced greenhouse effect. We are well ahead of many other nations in our policy to phase out CFCs by 1997. </PARA>
<PARA>In October 1990, the Government again put Australia at the forefront of international action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, by adopting the interim planning target to which I have already referred, which reductions are in addition to actions already covered by the Montreal Protocol. </PARA>
<PARA>The interim planning target on greenhouse gas reductions was endorsed by the States and Territories at the Special Premiers' Conference in October 1990. The development of the National Greenhouse Response Strategy is a priority item being addressed through the continuing Special Premiers' Conference arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>As a further positive step towards achieving this target, the Government also announced in October 1990 an expanded program of initiatives to improve efficiency of energy use. These measures include the ``Energy Guide'' now being distributed to every household in Australia, a new program of energy audits of industrial and commercial enterprises, demonstrations of energy efficient operation in commercial buildings, using Government buildings as models, and the establishment of energy managers in all Government Departments and agencies. These measures address several specific recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Other areas of Government are looking at the complementary questions of how to adapt to climate change. For example, the National Health and Medical Research Council are finalising a study of the health implications of longer term climate change. </PARA>
<PARA>Co-operation with the States</PARA>
<PARA>Senators will realise that only some of the Committee's recommendations fall directly within the powers of the Commonwealth. The Government has, of course, paid particular attention to those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>But implementation, and even development, of some of the national action plans and regulations envisaged in the Report will, under our federal system of government, require consultation with the States. I am pleased to say that action on the greenhouse effect is one area in which there has been good co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>For example, the States and Commonwealth, through the Australian Minerals and Energy Council, had already taken collective action before the Committee finally reported in several of the areas raised by the Senate Committee. All States are now proceeding towards implementing schemes for energy labelling of new appliances, and a State by State evaluation is being undertaken of fuel substitution aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, the Australian and New Zealand Environment Council has been responsible for an important contribution, in its report ``Towards a National Greenhouse Strategy for Australia''. </PARA>
<PARA>National Greenhouse Response Strategy</PARA>
<PARA>One of the major recommendations of the Committee was for a ``10 year energy plan, to be ratified at the Special Premiers' Conference, setting out the nation's commitment to international greenhouse gas emission reductions, as well as specifying particular measures to be implemented''. We recognise the advantages of having a clear strategy for greenhouse action which sets out our national objectives and the timeframe for achieving them. The concept of a forward looking planned approach to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is accepted, and will be embodied in the National Greenhouse Response Strategy. However, the National Greenhouse Response Strategy will have to encompass issues, such as sinks of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change, which would not be part of a strategy for the energy sector. </PARA>
<PARA>In the energy sector, it would be inappropriate to look upon a ``10 year energy plan'' as a rigid tool. Rather we will be looking to establish a clear policy framework within which the energy sector can operate dynamically, with the flexibility to respond to emerging issues. An important part of that framework is the microeconomic reforms that the Government is pursuing in several key sectors of the economy. For example, the Industries Commission has been examining energy generation and distribution, to see how it could be made more economically efficient for the nation. The Working Groups on electricity supply and transport set up by the Special Premiers' Conference are also expected to make valuable contributions to microeconomic reforms influencing the energy sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, a policy framework for the energy sector will necessarily encompass not only the National Greenhouse Response Strategy, but also many matters, such as access to resources, and returns to the community from resource use, that have little connection with greenhouse. </PARA>
<PARA>On a related recommendation, I am pleased to say that negotiations on reform of the national land transport system are well advanced. Achieving the maximum possible efficiency of the industry will result in greenhouse benefits from reduced fuel use. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Inputs to Greenhouse Strategy</PARA>
<PARA>To provide some more of the information needed to assist us in developing the National Greenhouse Response Strategy, the Government has directed the Working Groups on Ecologically Sustainable Development to report on options that will lead to the most cost effective combination of measures available for reducing greenhouse gases build-up. We have also asked the Industries Commission to report on the cost/benefit implications for Australian industry of an international consensus in favour of a 20% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government sees the Senate Committee's report as an equally valuable input to the development of a National Greenhouse Response Strategy. As the Committee's report has appeared while the ESD Working Groups and the Industries Commission are still deliberating, the proposals put forward by the Committee are being considered by those bodies. For example, the ESD Working Group on energy use is considering a full range of options in several areas covered in the Committee's report, such as energy management in industry and commerce, building practices, and domestic energy use. Similarly, the ESD Working Groups on transport and energy production are considering a full range of options in those areas, including those raised by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>In this way, the Committee's recommendations will be integrated with ecological and economic considerations in the development of the National Greenhouse Response Strategy. Some of the Committee's recommendations emphasise the use of regulation as a policy tool. However, at this stage, the Government wishes to consider the widest range of policy instruments, ranging from economic and market-based measures, through information provision, to regulations. On a case by case basis, we will seek to implement the combination of measures which is most effective in achieving the desired ends, taking account of the implications for the environment, energy security and the economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, the Government believes that it is imperative that implementation of major measures and actions to meet the greenhouse gas reduction targets should be part of an integrated National Greenhouse Response Strategy. </PARA>

<PARA>(Report Tabled in the Senate on 12 February 1991)</PARA>
<PARA>Specific recommendations as set out in Chapter 7 of the Senate report are reproduced below, together with Government responses. The recommendations have been divided into sections as follows: (A) Overall Strategy; (B) Prizes; (C) Electricity Generation; (D) Transport; (E) Energy Management in Industry and Commerce; (F) Buildings; (G) Household Energy Use and (H) Research. </PARA>
<PARA>(A) OVERALL STRATEGY</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.7</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that a 10 year energy plan be developed for ratification at the Special Premiers' Conference setting out the nation's commitment to international greenhouse gas emission reductions as well as specifying the particular measures that are to be implemented. To be effective the energy plan requires a national approach. The Committee recommends that national strategies in the following areas be central elements of the plan:</PARA>
<PARA> - A new charter for energy authorities to manage energy use to provide energy services rather than energy. Least cost planning and demand management must replace traditional supply dominated approaches. </PARA>
<PARA> Interstate load sharing should be used to maximise electricity supply efficiencies without consideration of state boundaries. AMEC should co-ordinate electricity supply to minimise greenhouse gas emissions and maximise efficiency and cost benefit. Using this approach the Committee suggests serious examination of linking Tasmania to the grid to provide access to its peak power potential in return for base load mainland supply. Least cost planning and effective use of the grid could obviate the need for additional fossil fuel based plant within the first 10 year energy plan. </PARA>
<PARA> - An integrated national transport strategy should be developed as part of the energy plan. ATAC should be responsible for the development and implementation of the plan. </PARA>
<PARA> - Energy targets must be set for commercial and residential properties to ensure best energy design and to minimise running costs. Targets must be set as part of a national code and must be backed up by mandatory energy audits. </PARA>
<PARA> - Appliance efficiency labelling must be implemented nationally and cover a wider range of energy consuming products. </PARA>
<PARA> - Renewable and other advanced energy technologies must be supported through the funding of research and demonstration, including a commitment by governments (utilities), industry and research bodies to large scale demonstration programs. </PARA>
<PARA> THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING A CLEAR STRATEGY FOR GREENHOUSE ACTION WHICH SETS OUT OUR NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND THE TIME FRAME FOR ACHIEVING THEM. THE CONCEPT OF A FORWARD LOOKING PLANNED APPROACH TO REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IS ACCEPTED, AND EMBODIED IN THE GOVERNMENT'S NATIONAL GREENHOUSE RESPONSE STRATEGY AS INITIATED IN OCTOBER 1990. THE STRATEGY IS TO BE DEVELOPED CO-OPERATIVELY BY THE COMMONWEALTH, STATE AND TERRITORY GOVERNMENTS IN CONSULTATION WITH INDUSTRY, SCIENTIFIC AND CONSERVATION GROUPS AND THE GENERAL COMMUNITY. THE FIRST STAGE OF THE NATIONAL STRATEGY WAS THE ADOPTION OF AN INTERIM TARGET FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, SUPPORTED BY THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST TO THE ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (ESD) WORKING GROUPS AND THE INDUSTRY COMMISSION (IC) TO EXAMINE ASPECTS OF THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT ISSUE. </PARA>
<PARA> IN THE ENERGY SECTOR THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE TO LOOK UPON A ` `10 YEAR ENERGY PLAN'' AS A RIGID TOOL. RATHER WE WILL BE LOOKING TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR POLICY FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH THE ENERGY SECTOR CAN OPERATE DYNAMICALLY, WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO EMERGING ISSUES. AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT FRAMEWORK IS THE MICROECONOMIC REFORMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS PURSUING IN SEVERAL KEY SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE INDUSTRY COMMISSION HAS BEEN EXAMINING ENERGY GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION, TO SEE HOW IT COULD BE MADE MORE ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT FOR THE NATION. THE WORKING GROUPS ON ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AND TRANSPORT SET UP BY THE SPECIAL PREMIERS' CONFERENCE ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO MAKE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO MICROECONOMIC REFORMS INFLUENCING THE ENERGY SECTOR. </PARA>
<PARA>(B) PRIZES</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.8</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that AMEC introduce a national scheme of prizes and awards for innovations in energy efficiency in industry and the home. Commercial recipients of such awards would use the awards as part of their advertising campaigns thereby strengthening the impact of government sponsored public awareness campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> A NATIONAL SCHEME OF AWARDS FOR INNOVATIONS AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN ALL SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY INCLUDING HOUSING, AND ADMINISTERED BY DPIE, HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR 10 YEARS. MANY OF THE AWARD WINNERS HAVE ACTIVELY USED THEIR AWARDS IN THEIR PUBLICITY. </PARA>
<PARA> A RELATED INITIATIVE IS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR THE HOUSING SECTOR, AND THE GOVERNMENT AGREES THAT THE APPLICATION OF THIS CONCEPT TO OTHER SECTORS SHOULD RECEIVE FURTHER ATTENTION. </PARA>
<PARA>(C) ELECTRICITY GENERATION</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.9</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends active encouragement of cogeneration. To help achieve this goal, the Committee recommends that the energy utilities be required to assess the potential for cogenerated power (as is being done in Victoria and New South Wales) and set targets concerning the minimum proportion of electricity to be obtained from cogenerated sources within a five year period. </PARA>
<PARA> THIS RECOMMENDATION WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AUSTRALIAN MINERALS AND ENERGY COUNCIL (AMEC). THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS ENCOURAGEMENT OF COGENERATION WHERE IT IS FEASIBLE TO DO SO. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.10</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is not advocating the construction of additional coal based power plants. However to the extent that their construction is necessary in the short term the Committee recommends that any future power stations which have to be built be based on the best available technology, and that targets be set for attaining energy conversion efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> MODERN AUSTRALIAN POWER STATIONS ARE ALREADY BUILT UPON THE BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS ECONOMICALLY VIABLE, AND HAS DEMONSTRATED RELIABILITY. WHILE ESSENTIALLY A MATTER FOR STATE GOVERNMENTS, THIS PRACTICE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AS THE BASIS FOR PLANNING BY STATE ELECTRICITY AUTHORITIES. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.11</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that on the basis of current proven reserves, the option of using gas on a large scale for base load electricity generation can only be regarded as a medium term measure for bridging the time gap until more efficient technologies become available. While eighty years may be considered by many to be a very large reserve, it is in reality quite small if one considers that this is approximately equivalent to one human lifetime. An eighty year reserve could be rapidly diminished if demand for gas as a direct source of energy or as a transport fuel expands significantly. The versatility and attractiveness of gas as an energy source makes it a valuable resource which should be conserved rather than being totally depleted for short term gains, be they economic or environmental. The Committee therefore recommends against using gas for base load power generation. </PARA>
<PARA> DECISIONS TO USE GAS FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION NEED TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE FULL RANGE OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND ARE PRINCIPALLY MATTERS FOR STATE AUTHORITIES. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.12</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the CSIRO and the energy utilities jointly establish demonstration projects of coal gasification and fuel cell technologies in Australia within a five year period, and that sufficient funding be provided to enable this to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> AUSTRALIAN ENERGY RESEARCH PRIORITIES REFLECT AREAS OF GREATEST PERCEIVED NEED AND WHERE THERE IS THE BEST POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT. RESEARCH PRIORITIES ARE SET BY A NUMBER OF AGENCIES INCLUDING CSIRO, ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND VARIOUS INDUSTRY GROUPS. </PARA>
<PARA> THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH CSIRO, IS FAMILIAR WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOLID FUEL CELLS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION AS AN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCE. </PARA>
<PARA> THERE MAY BE SOUND REASONS FOR A REVIEW OF GENERAL RESEARCH PRIORITIES TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE NEED FOR R&amp; INTO GREENHOUSE RESPONSE MEASURES, AND THAT POINT WILL BE CONSIDERED IN A MORE GENERAL REVIEW OF RESEARCH DIRECTIONS BY THE AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL (ASTEC), NOW UNDERWAY. </PARA>
<PARA> THE COMMITTEE'S VIEWS WILL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THESE VARIOUS PROCESSES AND WILL THEREBY INFLUENCE THE PROCESS OF THE SETTING OF PRIORITIES FOR ENERGY RESEARCH. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.13</PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of an energy `Charter' for utilities requires a commitment by all state and territory governments. In urging that commitment the Committee recommends that AMEC implement the measures required, which include:</PARA>
<PARA> - State Governments to require all electricity utilities to adopt least cost planning and develop effective demand management programs. These programs should immediately identify opportunities for reducing demand through energy efficiency and cogeneration. </PARA>
<PARA> - utilities should provide financing amortised over a long period for energy improvements in industry, the commercial sector and the home in preference to borrowing for extra generating capacity</PARA>
<PARA> - no further borrowings for new power station developments be permitted until all opportunities for cogeneration and energy savings through efficiency which can be realised at a lower cost than installing new capacity have been exploited</PARA>
<PARA> - the Commonwealth provide funding for the States to assist the introduction of demand management programs by the utilities</PARA>
<PARA> THE RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATION 7.7 ABOVE SETS OUT THE GOVERNMENT'S GENERAL VIEW OF THE PROPOSED ENERGY CHARTER. </PARA>
<PARA> THE AUSTRALIAN MINERALS AND ENERGY COUNCIL (AMEC) IS THE PRINCIPAL FORUM BRINGING TOGETHER STATE, COMMONWEALTH AND TERRITORY ENERGY MINISTERS AND OFFICIALS. AS SUCH AMEC PROVIDES A CONDUIT THROUGH WHICH THE STATES, TERRITORY AND COMMONWEALTH CAN EXCHANGE POLICY, AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER IT WOULD BE UP TO INDIVIDUAL STATE GOVERNMENTS, RATHER THAN AMEC AS A BODY, TO IMPLEMENT THESE MEASURES. THE RECOMMENDATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION THROUGH AMEC. </PARA>
<PARA> WITH REGARD TO THE FOURTH DOT POINT, THE GOVERNMENT NOTES THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INDUSTRY COMMISSION REPORT ON ELECTRICITY GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION. UNDERTAKING DEMAND MANAGEMENT WHEREVER ECONOMIC SHOULD NOT REQUIRE COMMONWEALTH SUPPORT. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.14</PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this objective, the Committee recommends that AMEC assess the potential for sharing generating capacity between the states and develop a methodology to effectively coordinate the operation of an enhanced grid and ensure equitable interstate energy pricing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>AND</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.15</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee further recommends that the Commonwealth provide financial assistance to the states to make necessary enhancements to the grid to ensure interstate generating capacity can be efficiently exploited. The target should be to have a fully integrated system operational by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> THE COMMONWEALTH RECOGNISES THAT THE FINANCIAL DEMANDS OF ENERGY DEVELOPMENT FROM ELECTRICITY UTILITIES ARE TOO LARGE, AND TOO IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY FOR THEM NOT TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY. ELECTRICITY ALONE INVOLVES INDUSTRIES WITH CAPITAL ASSETS OF OVER $100 BILLION, NET BORROWINGS OF SOME $25 BILLION AND EMPLOYMENT OF SOME 70 000 PEOPLE. ALTOGETHER THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR CONTRIBUTES AROUND 4 PER CENT TO GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT MORE EXTENSIVE ELECTRICITY GRIDS ARE NOW A REAL POSSIBILITY AND THAT, IN CO-OPERATION WITH ALL STATES AND TERRITORIES, WE ARE CLOSER TO ACHIEVING APPROPRIATE RETURNS TO THE COMMUNITY FOR THE USE OF ITS RESOURCES. THE DRIVING FORCE IS THE NEED FOR GREATER ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AND LESSER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. THIS VIEW IS SUPPORTED BY THE INDUSTRY COMMISSION REPORT ON ENERGY GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION. </PARA>
<PARA> AN ELECTRICITY WORKING GROUP (EWG) WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE SPECIAL PREMIERS' CONFERENCE HELD IN OCTOBER 1990. THIS WORKING GROUP IS LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT THE ECONOMICS OF ENHANCED INTERCONNECTION AND THE BEST ARRANGEMENTS FOR GRID MANAGEMENT. THE EWG IS DUE TO REPORT TO THE NEXT PREMIERS' CONFERENCE. </PARA>
<PARA> THE REPORT OF THE ESD WORKING GROUPS, TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT FROM THE ELECTRICITY WORKING GROUP, ESTABLISHED BY THE SPECIAL PREMIERS' CONFERENCE HELD IN OCTOBER 1990, WILL PROVIDE A FIRM PLATFORM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED ENERGY GRID WHICH WOULD ENSURE THE MOST ECONOMIC AND EFFICIENT EXPLOITATION OF NATIONAL ENERGY RESOURCES. THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE OUTCOMES OF THE WORK OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED GROUPS. </PARA>
<PARA>(D) TRANSPORT</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.16</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth and States, through ATAC, work towards the establishment of an integrated national transport strategy within two years. </PARA>
<PARA> THE GOVERNMENT WILL BRING THIS RECOMMENDATION TO THE ATTENTION OF ATAC. </PARA>
<PARA> THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT IS PURSUING, AS A PRIORITY POLICY OBJECTIVE, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTEGRATED LAND TRANSPORT SYSTEM IN COLLABORATION WITH THE STATES AND TERRITORIES. ATAC HAS BEEN FULLY INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. THE MAJOR ARMS OF THE GOVERNMENTS APPROACH ARE:</PARA>
<PARA> - TARGETED ROAD FUNDING PRIORITIES TO ROADS OF NATIONAL ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE</PARA>
<PARA> - ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL RAIL FREIGHT CORPORATION</PARA>
<PARA> - A NATIONAL APPROACH TO HEAVY VEHICLE REGISTRATION AND CHARGING</PARA>
<PARA> - HARMONISED ROAD TRANSPORT REGULATION</PARA>
<PARA> THE GOVERNMENT'S LAND TRANSPORT STRATEGY IS CONSISTENT WITH OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES. BY ACHIEVING THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE EFFICIENCY IN LAND TRANSPORT, THERE WILL BE CORRESPONDING REDUCTIONS IN THE INTENSITY OF ENERGY USE WITH RESULTANT GREENHOUSE EMISSION BENEFITS. </PARA>
<PARA> ATAC HAS ALSO COMMITTED ITSELF TO WORKING WITH THE ESD TRANSPORT WORKING GROUP AND WILL RESUME CONSIDERATION OF A TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT POLICY ONCE THE RESULTS OF THE ESD PROCESS ARE AVAILABLE. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.17</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that ATAC formulate a national action plan to make the changes needed to meet the requirements of urban transport users in the most energy efficient and cost effective way. This national action plan should be based on already available data and studies and take into account the comments and recommendations made in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> THE GOVERNMENT WILL BRING THIS RECOMMENDATION TO THE ATTENTION OF ATAC. </PARA>
<PARA> URBAN ISSUES, INCLUDING TRANSPORT, ARE CURRENTLY UNDER EXAMINATION IN A NUMBER OF FORA INCLUDING THE URBAN SETTLEMENTS WORKING GROUP ESTABLISHED BY THE SPECIAL PREMIERS' CONFERENCE, AND THE ESD TRANSPORT WORKING GROUP. THESE PROCESSES MAY PRODUCE RECOMMENDATIONS ON URBAN FORMS AND YIELD GENERALLY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES IN RESPECT OF INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING, FINANCING AND USAGE. THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE OUTCOMES OF THE WORK OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED GROUPS. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.18</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that a minimum fuel economy standard of 8 litres/100 kilometres be set for all new vehicles sold in Australia by 1998, and that this standard be reduced to 6 litres/100 kilometres by 2005. </PARA>
<PARA> THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (DOTC) HAS INITIATED A MAJOR STUDY ON THE CAPACITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY TO DELIVER FUEL ECONOMY IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE NEW PASSENGER FLEET. THIS STUDY IS BEING CO-SPONSORED BY DITAC, DPIE, DASETT, AND THE VICTORIAN DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION AND ENVIRONMENT. </PARA>
<PARA> THE STUDY WILL, INTER ALIA,</PARA>
<PARA> - ASSESS THE TECHNICAL CAPACITY FOR IMPROVED FUEL ECONOMY IN MOTOR VEHICLES OVER THE NEXT 10-15 YEARS, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THE RATE AT WHICH DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY ARE INCORPORATED INTO AUSTRALIAN MADE VEHICLES. THIS WOULD INVOLVE IDENTIFYING THE CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY THE NATURE OF THE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY AND ITS OPERATING ENVIRONMENT;</PARA>
<PARA> - ASSESS THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS (PARTICULARLY FOR THE MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY AND THE CONSUMER) OF MEETING THE FOLLOWING NATIONAL AVERAGE FUEL CONSUMPTION TARGETS FOR NEW VEHICLES BY THE YEAR 2005:</PARA>
<PARA> - 8.0L/100KM,</PARA>
<PARA> - 7.0L/100KM,</PARA>
<PARA> - 6.0L/100KM, AND</PARA>
<PARA> - 5.0L/100KM. </PARA>
<PARA> IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE STUDY WILL BE FINALISED BY JULY 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF ROAD SAFETY (FORS) IS DEVELOPING A MODEL WHICH CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO ESTIMATE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE FLEET IN ANY GIVEN YEAR, AND THUS DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS FUEL CONSUMPTION REGIMES. </PARA>
<PARA> THE PRODUCT OF THE STUDY OUTLINED ABOVE AND THE FORS MODEL ARE BEING DRAWN UPON IN THE ESD WORKING GROUP PROCESS TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACHIEVING GREATER ENERGY ECONOMY IN THE AUSTRALIAN VEHICLE FLEET. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.19</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that as part of the national action plan proposed in paragraph 5.46, ATAC develop a range of effective programs to:</PARA>
<PARA> - provide incentives for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles by business and private buyers</PARA>
<PARA> - decrease the use of cars for urban transport where a viable public transport alternative exists</PARA>
<PARA> - effectively encourage efficient car use practices including car pooling</PARA>
<PARA> - replace high standing charges for car and truck registration and insurance with a system under which charges are levied proportional to use</PARA>
<PARA> THE GOVERNMENT WILL REFER THE RECOMMENDATIONS UNDER THE PARAGRAPH TO ATAC. </PARA>
<PARA> THE PROVISION OF INCENTIVES FOR THE PURCHASE OF FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES WILL NEED TO BE LOOKED AT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CONSIDERATION OF THE ESD AND IC INQUIRIES. </PARA>
<PARA> THE ESD TRANSPORT WORKING GROUP IS CONSIDERING THE SCOPE FOR FACILITATING THE INTRODUCTION OF VARIOUS FORMS OF LOW GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION TRANSPORT VEHICLES, INCLUDING ELECTRICALLY-POWERED VEHICLES WHICH SEEM LIKELY TO BECOME MORE PRACTICABLE WITH DEVELOPMENTS IN BATTERIES, ELECTRICAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND SOLAR RECHARGING FACILITIES AND MORE ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE IN A REGIME IN WHICH FOSSIL FUEL PRICING REFLECTS THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. </PARA>
<PARA> THE GOVERNMENT AGREES THAT EFFICIENT CAR USE PRACTICES, INCLUDING CAR POOLING, IS A PRIORITY AREA FOR ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN IN THE SHORT TERM WITH MINIMAL COSTS TO THE ECONOMY. THE STATES HAVE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS AREA. LOW COST ACTIONS COULD INCLUDE SPECIAL LANES FOR HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLES, LIMITING PARKING IN CBD'S ETC. THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT WILL ADDRESS THE BREADTH OF RELATED ISSUES IN CONSIDERING THE OUTCOME OF THE ESD AND IC PROCESSES TO ENSURE THAT SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH AN INTEGRATED NATIONALLY AGREED APPROACH TO TRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT. COOPERATION OF ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT WILL BE ESSENTIAL. </PARA>
<PARA> AS REGARDS CAR AND TRUCK REGISTRATION CHARGES GOVERNMENTS ARE PRESENTLY CONSIDERING REFORM OF HEAVY VEHICLE CHARGING ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MAY INCORPORATE BOTH FUEL AND DIRECT MASS DISTANCE CHARGES. FUEL CANNOT BE USED AS THE SOLE CHARGING BASIS FOR HEAVY VEHICLES BECAUSE FUEL CONSUMPTION IS ONLY LOOSELY RELATED TO ROAD WEAR. ANALYSIS UNDERTAKEN BY THE INTER-STATE COMMISSION INDICATES THAT IF GOVERNMENTS WERE TO CONSIDER A MORE RATIONAL CHARGING SYSTEM FOR LIGHT VEHICLES A FUEL ONLY CHARGE MAY BE FEASIBLE. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.20</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends positive discrimination in favour of developing the use of LPG and natural gas as transport fuels. As part of this process the Government should provide guarantees concerning the maximum amount of levy to be placed on alternative transport fuels in the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> THE TRANSPORT WORKING GROUP SET UP UNDER THE ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE IS CONSIDERING PRICING POLICIES TO FOSTER A GREATER DEGREE OF SWITCHING TO ALTERNATIVE FUELS, AND OTHER ISSUES, AS PART OF ITS ANALYSIS OF TRANSPORT AND RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. </PARA>
<PARA> THE AUSTRALIAN TRANSPORT SECTOR ACCOUNTS FOR AROUND 27 PER CENT OF NATIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION ON A FULL FUEL CYCLE BASIS. THEREFORE GOVERNMENTS ARE WELL AWARE OF THE NEED TO DEVELOP PRACTICAL AND ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE FUEL OPTIONS WHICH MAKE GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL SENSE. IN VIEW OF THE POTENTIAL OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS, FUNDING IS ALREADY BEING PROVIDED UNDER ERDC PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP THESE OPTIONS AS TRANSPORT FUELS. </PARA>
<PARA> IN THE CONTEXT OF THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE THAT COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS HOLDS BENEFITS IN TERMS OF REDUCING AMBIENT AIR POLLUTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. LPG ALSO HAS AMBIENT POLLUTION BENEFITS, BUT ITS PROVEN GAIN IN TERMS OF GREENHOUSE IS LOWER. </PARA>
<PARA> THE COMMITTEE HAS OBSERVED THAT ONE ESTIMATE SHOWS THAT DOMESTIC SUPPLY OF LPG IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET ABOUT 7 PER CENT OF VEHICLE FUEL NEEDS, APPARENTLY BASED ON THE 1987 AMEC ESTIMATE THAT LPG COULD MEET A MAXIMUM OF 7 PER CENT OF PETROL DEMAND IN THE YEAR 2000. EVEN THIS ESTIMATE MAY BE TOO HIGH IF THE GROWING NEEDS OF TRADITIONAL LPG USERS IN INDUSTRY, HOUSEHOLDS AND THE PETROCHEMICAL SECTOR ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. CURRENTLY, LPG SUPPLIES OVER 4 PER CENT OF PETROL DEMAND AND DEMAND IS GROWING MUCH MORE RAPIDLY THAN THAT FOR PETROL. AT CURRENTLY PROJECTED RATES OF PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, AUSTRALIA MAY SOON FACE A GREATER NEED TO IMPORT LPG. </PARA>
<PARA> THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF LPG SHOULD NOT BE EXAGGERATED. THE BENEFITS OF LPG USE VERSUS MODERN VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH CATALYTIC CONVERTERS AND USING LEAD FREE PETROL ARE NOT CONSIDERABLE. ALSO IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE ASSESSMENTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS ON A FULL FUEL CYCLE BASIS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FOR EXAMPLE THE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS WHICH MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH NATURALLY OCCURRING LPG PRODUCTION. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.21</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommends that the Government encourage further research into the use of lower carbon fuels such as natural gas for transport sector use. </PARA>
<PARA> IN 1987 THE GOVERNMENT MADE AN ADDITIONAL $5M AVAILABLE FOR RD&amp; ON NATURAL GAS IN VEHICLES. AUSTRALIAN KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE IN THE USE OF LOWER CARBON FUELS, SUCH AS NATURAL GAS, IS THUS WELL DEVELOPED. </PARA>
<PARA> A REVIEW BY DPIE IN JANUARY 1991 OF THE RESULTS TO DATE FROM THIS RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM CONCLUDED THAT NATURAL GAS HAS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL IN THE TRANSPORT MARKET IN AUSTRALIA AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR DIESEL FUEL IN HEAVY VEHICLES. THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY OF WORKING CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY TO FOSTER AND CO-ORDINATE RD&amp; IN THIS FIELD HAS BEEN WELL SUPPORTED BY THE GAS INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT NATURAL GAS IS NOW APPROACHING THE POINT WHERE IT CAN BE WIDELY ADOPTED AS A FUEL FOR URBAN BUSES ON A NORMAL COMMERCIAL BASIS. </PARA>
<PARA> THE ESD WORKING GROUPS ON ENERGY USE AND TRANSPORT ARE BOTH EXAMINING THE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE USE OF LOWER CARBON FUELS IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR. A KEY FACET OF THEIR REPORTS WILL BE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBABLE FUTURE PATH OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ITS IMPACT ON TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IN THESE AREAS. </PARA>
<PARA>(E) ENERGY MANAGEMENT IN INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.22</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes that both the Victorian and New South Wales Government demand management initiatives make use of the energy audit process, and intend in the first instance providing free energy audits. The Committee commends this initiative and recommends that it be adopted in the other States. </PARA>
<PARA> DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A KEY ELEMENT OF A GREENHOUSE STRATEGY IN THE AMEC REPORT ``ENERGY AND THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT''. THE AMEC ENERGY MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING DETAILED STUDIES OF THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THE ROLE OF DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT IN EACH STATE. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.23</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that energy audits of industry should, in the longer term, become an integrated part of industry practice, as is now the case with other standard industry practices such as pollution control and occupational health and safety. For this reason the Committee recommends that within 10 years, regular energy audits in industry should become mandatory. </PARA>
<PARA> THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUBSIDISED ENERGY AUDITS FOR MANY YEARS. AN EARLIER ENERGY AUDIT SCHEME, ANNOUNCED IN OCTOBER 1980 AS PART OF THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT SCHEME, HAS NOW BEEN REPLACED BY THE ENERGY AUDIT SUBSIDIES WHICH FORM AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S ENERGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ANNOUNCED ON 23 OCTOBER 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> AS PART OF THAT PROGRAM, THE GOVERNMENT ALLOCATED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT A NEW PROGRAM OF ENERGY AUDITS TO FACILITATE AUSTRALIAN FIRMS' ACCESS TO ENERGY EFFICIENT PROCESSES AND TECHNOLOGY WHICH WILL BOTH REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND IMPROVE PROFIT THROUGH EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES. THE ENERGY AUDIT PROGRAM IS BEING DEVELOPED JOINTLY BY DPIE AND DITAC AND WILL BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE NATIONAL INDUSTRY EXTENSION SERVICE (NIES) IN COLLABORATION WITH THE STATES. </PARA>
<PARA> THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE REVIEWED AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME (PERHAPS THREE YEARS) AND THE NEED FOR ITS AMENDMENT AND SUPPLEMENTATION (EG. THROUGH MORE ASSISTANCE OR REGULATORY MEASURES) EXAMINED AT THAT TIME. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE WARY OF IMPOSING MANDATORY AUDITS ON INDUSTRY UNLESS THE THRESHOLD LEVEL OF ENERGY USAGE WERE STIPULATED. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.24</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned that as energy auditing becomes more common, there may be a shortage of qualified people to conduct the audits. The evidence received during the inquiry indicated that there are only a small number of people in Australia at present with the necessary experience and qualifications. The Committee recommends that the Department of Employment, Education and Training, in consultation with AMEC, investigate the likely demand for energy auditors, and initiate a program to ensure that future demand for energy auditors can be met. </PARA>
<PARA> ENERGY AUDITING AT THE HIGHEST TECHNICAL LEVEL IS A SPECIALISED FIELD OF CERTAIN PROFESSIONS, PARTICULARLY THE ENGINEERING PROFESSION. THE INSTITUTION OF ENGINEERS(AUSTRALIA), WHICH IS CURRENTLY PREPARING A REGISTER OF ENERGY AUDITING ORGANISATIONS ACCREDITED UNDER THE ENTERPRISE ENERGY AUDIT PROGRAM, IS CONCERNED TO ENCOURAGE MORE WIDESPREAD PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THIS AREA. </PARA>
<PARA> ANALYSIS OF THE LABOUR MARKET AT SUCH A DETAILED OCCUPATIONAL LEVEL WOULD BE TOO RESOURCE INTENSIVE. THE DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING (DEET) NEVERTHELESS IS NOT AWARE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES OF ENERGY AUDITORS. DEET HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS REGARD. </PARA>
<PARA> THIS RECOMMENDATION HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AMEC FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. IF THERE IS A DEMONSTRATED NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SKILLED PERSONNEL IN THIS AREA, THE MATTER WILL BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND DEET. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.25</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that AMEC, in consultation with industry and with the assistance of the Treasury, develop a range of measures to provide incentive and assistance for industry to implement energy conservation measures. These measures should be developed as an agreed package (including funding arrangements) by the end of 1991. Implementation should be phased in over a 10 year period. </PARA>
<PARA> THE GOVERNMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A RANGE OF SPECIFIC PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE INDUSTRY ADOPTION OF ENERGY CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY MEASURES INCLUDING THE PROGRAM OF ENERGY MANAGEMENT MEASURES ANNOUNCED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN OCTOBER 1990. THE ISSUE OF BARRIERS TO UPTAKE OF CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY MEASURES IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE ESD WORKING GROUPS, TOGETHER WITH THE RANGE OF OPTIONS WHICH MIGHT BE IMPLEMENTED TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND ENCOURAGE GREATER ADOPTION OF SPECIFIC MEASURES. THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE OUTCOMES OF THE WORK OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED GROUPS. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.26</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends establishment of comprehensive demonstration programs to show-case cost effective technologies to the industrial and commercial sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED A WIDE RANGE OF DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGH THE NERD&amp; PROGRAM AND ADDITIONAL DEMONSTRATIONS ARE PLANNED THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH'S ENERGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. </PARA>
<PARA> DPIE ACTIVELY DISSEMINATES INFORMATION ON THE BEST TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE INTERNATIONALLY. THIS INFORMATION IS OBTAINED THROUGH MEMBERSHIP OF THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY'S (IEA) CENTRE FOR THE ANALYSIS AND DISSEMINATION OF DEMONSTRATED ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES. </PARA>
<PARA> A RELATED DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM IS ALREADY BEING DEVELOPED UNDER THE ENERGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ANNOUNCED IN OCTOBER 1990, INVOLVING DEMONSTRATIONS OF ENERGY EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES IN COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, USING GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS AS MODELS. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.27</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends the potential offered by renewable technologies to provide some of the energy requirements of industry, particularly for low temperature heating, be exploited wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> THIS RECOMMENDATION IS JUST ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE ACTION IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IS BEING EXAMINED AS PART OF THE PROCESSES OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 7.25. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.28</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that a CSIRO project be established to investigate possible applications for renewable energy sources in industry. </PARA>
<PARA> CONSIDERABLE WORK IS UNDERWAY INTERNATIONALLY TO APPLY RENEWABLE ENERGY OPTIONS IN INDUSTRY, INCLUDING IN MULTILATERAL AGENCIES SUCH AS THE IEA. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN AUSTRALIA SINCE THE MID 1970'S AND SEVERAL NERD&amp; PROGRAM PROJECTS, NOW ADMINISTERED BY THE ERDC, ON THIS TOPIC ARE UNDERWAY. CSIRO IS CURRENTLY ASSISTING ELCOM NSW TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE AREAS SUITABLE FOR WIND POWER GENERATION. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.29</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommends that practical demonstration projects of renewable technologies in industry be established and funded under the auspices of the Commonwealth Energy Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> THE OBJECTIVE OF THE ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (ERDC) IS TO STIMULATE EFFECTIVE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGIES WHICH:</PARA>
<PARA> - INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY UTILISATION;</PARA>
<PARA> - ENHANCE THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A STABLE, SUSTAINABLE, ECONOMIC, RELIABLE AND DIVERSE ENERGY SUPPLY IN AUSTRALIA;</PARA>
<PARA> - REDUCE THE COST OF SUPPLYING ENERGY;</PARA>
<PARA> - REDUCE THE ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT OF ENERGY PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION AND USE;</PARA>
<PARA> - STIMULATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LOCAL INDUSTRY IN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES; AND</PARA>
<PARA> - STIMULATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPORT POTENTIAL FOR ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. </PARA>
<PARA> ``NEW AND RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES AND SYSTEMS'' IS ONE OF THE THREE ERDC PRIORITY RESEARCH PROGRAM AREAS AND ALTHOUGH RENEWABLE ENERGY REPRESENTS ONLY AROUND 6 PER CENT OF TOTAL DOMESTIC ENERGY AVAILABILITY, ERDC COMMITTED OVER 25 PER CENT OF ITS FUNDS FOR NEW PROJECTS TO THIS AREA IN 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.30</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends active encouragement of local manufacture of energy efficient technologies. To achieve this, the Committee recommends the Commonwealth Government implement changes to the taxation system to assist companies seeking to commence manufacture of new technologies which have been identified as offering significant energy efficiency improvements and export potential. The Committee also recommends that other methods of establishing such industries such as availability of low interest finance be investigated and implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> IN ITS RECENT INDUSTRY STATEMENT, THE GOVERNMENT RE-AFFIRMED ITS COMMITMENT TO THE PACKAGE OF MEASURES ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES BY AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY. THESE MEASURES INCLUDE THE TAX CONCESSION FOR R&amp;, GRANTS FOR INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE NATIONAL PROCUREMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. </PARA>
<PARA> BOTH THE ESD WORKING GROUPS AND THE INDUSTRY COMMISSION ARE EXAMINING THE ISSUE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE OUTCOMES OF THE WORK OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED GROUPS. </PARA>
<PARA>(F) BUILDINGS</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 7.31</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the following measures be introduced to improve energy efficiency in the commercial sector:</PARA>
<PARA> - Building codes should be changed to require energy efficiency targets in new buildings or buildings undergoing refurbishment to be set. This will involve Commonwealth, State and Local Government. In the case of Commonwealth Government buildings, the ACS should be given the power to require amendment of any design which fails to meet energy efficiency targets. The design brief for government buildings must ensure that the efficiency target will be met. This requirement must extend to buildings constructed by Government owned business enterprises. The Committee commends the important work being carried out by the Public Works Committee in the area of energy efficiency in Government buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> - An ongoing information campaign should be conducted to increase awareness of the possibilities for energy efficient design and savings to be made by identifying deficiencies in existing buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> Where proven cost effective, automatic controls of building services such as lighting and heating should be incorporated in all new buildings, and whenever major renovations are carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> - Commercial buildings should be energy audited at least every three years. These audits should be mandatory. Where the payback period for energy efficiency improvements is less than three years, there should be a requirement that the audit findings be implemented. This should apply to both Government and private sector buildings. The ACS should be given a brief to examine the energy performance of existing government buildings and should be empowered to implement the recommendations flowing from energy audits of Commonwealth government buildings. Buildings owned by Government Business Enterprises, where not subject to local building regulations, should be subject to the same provisions as government buildings. Similar mechanisms should be put in place at the State and Local Government levels. </PARA>
<PARA> - Permits to build or renovate commercial buildings should require provision of an independent assessment of likely energy consumption resulting from the design. </PARA>
<PARA> - Owners of commercial buildings should be required to provide prospective tenants with a statement of the energy consumption of the building and associated costs. </PARA>
<PARA> IN OCTOBER 1990 THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED A PACKAGE OF INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IN RELATION TO BUILDINGS THE PACKAGE INCLUDED:</PARA>
<PARA> - A NEW PROGRAM OF ENERGY AUDITS OF INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES, DETAILED STUDIES OF ENERGY USE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL IN INDIVIDUAL INDUSTRY SECTORS AND ASSOCIATED TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> - DEMONSTRATIONS OF ENERGY EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES IN COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, USING GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS AS MODELS</PARA>
<PARA> - DEVELOPMENT OF CODES OF PRACTICE FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT CONSTRUCTION OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS</PARA>
<PARA> - A SERIES OF INITIATIVES TO UPGRADE ENERGY MANAGEMENT IN THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN OPERATIONS, INVOLVING</PARA>
<PARA> - NOMINATION OF ENERGY MANAGERS IN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AUTHORITIES</PARA>
<PARA> - REQUIRING ANNUAL REPORTS FROM DEPARTMENTS AND AUTHORITIES ON ENERGY USE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES</PARA>
<PARA> - SETTING HIGH ENERGY EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR GOVERNMENT HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS CONSTRUCTION AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS LEASES, AND,</PARA>
<PARA> - THE ESTABLISHMENT, IN CONCERT WITH THE STATES, OF A FULLY INTEGRATED ENERGY MANAGEMENT ADVISORY CENTRE AS A MODEL FOR DEVELOPMENT OF SIMILAR CENTRES AROUND AUSTRALIA</PARA>
<PARA> IN TERMS OF AN ONGOING INFORMATION CAMPAIGN TO INCREASE AWARENESS THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSIDERING AN ADDITIONAL INITIATIVE TO INVITE PROFESSIONAL AND INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS TO IDENTIFY EXISTING ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS, AND PROVIDE FUNDS TO DOCUMENT AND PROMOTE THEM TO KEY DECISION MAKING GROUPS. </PARA>
<PARA> WORK HAS BEGUN ON THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING STANDARDS, WITH INITIAL EMPHASIS BEING GIVEN TO THE RESIDENTIAL SECTOR.

<PARA> Some States are moving to implement insulation standards for roofing and walls. For example, Victoria is in the process of introducing minimum insulation standards for walls and ceilings of all new dwellings. However, it has taken fourteen years for this proposal to be implemented-it was first announced in 1976. The Committee commends this initiative and recommends that insulation standards for new houses be set in all States within one year. </PARA>
<PARA> THIS RECOMMENDATION HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THE AMEC WORKING PARTY ON THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT WHICH WILL EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING INSULATION STANDARDS FOR NEW HOMES. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter relates very much to the matter I was speaking about a moment ago in the MPI that we have just debated. As I have said in the Senate before, the question of the development of a greenhouse effect is the most important environmental problem that we in Australia and everybody in the world face. The inter-governmental panel on climate control's scientific committee reported in May of last year that it was necessary for the world to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 60 to 80 per cent as rapidly as possible. That IPCC report, translated into Australia's terms-we are very profligate users of greenhouse gases; we have in the recent past been the world's worst polluters in relation to CFCs and halons and we are about the world's third worst polluters in terms of CO2 emissions-means a 92 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the criterion which must, above everything else, guide the development over the next 10 to 15 years out into the more distant future. It is quite clear from that imperative that investments which are made in energy efficiency devices must be very carefully crafted. One of the things which the report Rescue the Future points out is that many energy investments are, of their very nature, massive, take a long time to repay and are therefore very difficult to change in the short term. When one builds a thousand megawatt power station one is spending roughly $1 billion of investment which will be recouped over some 25 or 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The best scientific evidence-I am sure that most honourable senators in this chamber unfortunately are not interested in the best scientific evidence; they do not read and they do not understand the best scientific evidence-on which we should be basing our judgment is that within the next 10 to 15 years the evidence on greenhouse will become incontrovertible. I believe that it is quite clear that the majority of Australian people do not want to leave a damaged world behind for their children and for their grandchildren. When that evidence on greenhouse becomes incontrovertible, when it is not possible for governments to argue, as this Government response does with its `Well, let's wait and see' approach, then the Australian people will be demanding that we meet those very stringent standards and that we do attempt to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions not by 10 or 20 per cent but by much larger amounts. </PARA>
<PARA> The one thing we must not do-the report makes this quite clear-is lock ourselves into massive expensive energy developments which cannot meet the sorts of targets which in 10 years time will become absolutely imperative and which we will not be able to avoid making and for which there will be a very strong public clamour. We should not be investing in more power stations if we can possibly avoid it. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be investing in those sorts of technologies which can achieve small gains if the pay-back times are very short. We should be doing everything possible to put in place the energy efficiency measures which can avoid those massive investments so that when it becomes clearer and more politically acceptable for the community we can then move to the more radical technologies, many of which are emerging on the scene, and which we can then implement. We will not have made our investments which will have used up our capital and which will not allow us to make alternative investments. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology is totally inadequate. I remind the Senate that when I first suggested to the Committee that it look at the greenhouse effect and specifically said that the reference should be how one heads off greenhouse-as far as that is possible-what are the impediments to that and how does one overcome those impediments, there was strong and consistent opposition from people in Government and from government bureaucracies to that reference. They were saying, `Why not address the problem of how to collect a bibliography of the information on greenhouse? Why not address the problem of how one adapts to greenhouse?'. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea that the Committee might actually come up with some suggestions which would reduce the effect of greenhouse, as far as that was possible, and the idea that it might come up with a report which would look at the inefficiencies in many of the bureaucracies, particularly in relation to electricity generation, and make specific suggestions for quite radical change, were strongly resisted. It took nearly a year for that Committee to successfully get that reference before it. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Committee was taking evidence from Government departments, including the Treasury, transport and energy and resources portfolios, it was quite clear that the Government had appointed to those bureaucracies people whose specific task was not to address the problem of greenhouse but to work out how the Government could avoid addressing the problem of greenhouse. </PARA>
<PARA> I well remember a former Liberal colleague in this place, Senator Peter Baume, sitting opposite six of those senior bureaucrats who had been specifically appointed to one of those government bureaucracies to address the problem of greenhouse and saying, `I have been in the Senate since 1974. I have been on many committees. I have listened to a great deal of evidence. That is the worst evidence I have ever heard'. They were not my words; they were Senator Peter Baume's words straight to six senior bureaucrats appointed by the Government to address the problem of greenhouse. This report continues that same total misunderstanding of the importance of this very vital issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had this report Rescue the Future since February. We were given a response today at a quarter past three. We were expected to address the Government's response later this afternoon. Had there not been an MPI we would have been given the Government's response and been asked to debate it immediately. That is totally unsatisfactory and it indicates yet again the disregard and the misunderstanding that the Government has of this very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear from the Government's statement that in looking at greenhouse it simply regards that as one other issue along with many others. If the others were given a higher priority, greenhouse would simply not enter into its calculus as to what should be done in the energy sector. That is not the situation. Greenhouse is an imperative which must be addressed. We cannot put it aside for other issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that if this Government talks to the people in some of the Pacific islands, the coral atoll islands, and talks to people in Bangladesh it will find that they do not regard greenhouse as an issue that we can either take up or leave aside. In 30 or 40 years they may well be swimming for their lives, quite literally. This country may be faced with massive problems of what have been called environmental refugees. What are we going to do then? Are these the sorts of problems we should leave for our children?</PARA>
<PARA> The best scientific advice is that the consequences of greenhouse will be significant climate change, with a very considerable impact on agriculture. We do not yet know exactly what those impacts are going to be, but to go on rejecting that these things must be faced up to-to be turning aside, addressing other issues and avoiding facing up to greenhouse-is simply leaving the problem far too long. </PARA>
<PARA> Because we are not sure of exactly the rate of onset of the consequences, and the size of those consequences, we should be doing everything in our power to slow down the rate of onset of greenhouse effects. It may well be that where we have set aside national parks to protect particular species and to protect particular ecologies, every one of those national parks may be in the wrong place. The consequence of that is quite massive global extinctions. How we and our children cope with that is something this Government clearly has not yet come to face seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the consequences in terms of agricultural production. What happens if Western Australia becomes considerably drier? What happens to its production? We have a government which is hell bent on increasing the population of Australia, particularly in Perth where the ground has been overexploited and, quite seriously, mined rather than managed. What happens to the water supply if the rainfall decreases significantly over there? South Australia is becoming significantly drier. Large parts of the agricultural areas of South Australia should already be returned to mallee scrub. What happens to the fruit growing areas of Victoria when the frosts fail because the weather has warmed up by a couple of degrees and we no longer grow stone fruits in those areas?</PARA>
<PARA> We have seen very considerable disruption to agricultural production in Australia already. What happens when we superimpose these environmental effects on our agricultural production, particularly when the variability from year to year is such that we will not really know for a while exactly what is happening? Farmers will struggle on, thinking that these seasons will return to what they were 10 or 15 years earlier, and it will not be until the change is persistent for some years that they will say, `My God, we cannot continue with production in this area. We have to change to something else'. These are the sorts of effects that the Government is simply not addressing, not taking seriously. Indeed, we find this right through the report. I quote from the Government's response:</PARA>
<PARA>However, in setting the interim targets, the Government recognised that it would be imprudent for Australia to proceed with measures which have net adverse economic impacts nationally or on Australia's trade competitiveness in the absence of similar action by major greenhouse gas producing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Our report Rescue the Future: Reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect shows that a very large number of changes can be made which will reduce the amount of energy used for a given unit of production, reduce the amount of resource used and the amount of greenhouse gas emission and significantly improve the economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want to talk about competitiveness-and we are moving into a greenhouse world-surely it makes a great deal of economic sense to build those industries in this country which meet the criteria of greater energy efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions so that 10 years, 20 years or 30 years down the track we will have precisely the sorts of industries which will be of benefit to other countries, and they will be beating a path to our door to buy those technologies from us. We do not see the Government accepting that as a fair and reasonable assessment of the world which we face, the world which our children must face. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government talks about its action in relation to CFCs. In that respect, Australia has performed quite well. It needed to. Australia was the very worst polluter in the world in relation to CFCs and halons, but it certainly needs to move a great deal more briskly in these other areas. The Government's response says that the interim planning target on greenhouse gas reductions was endorsed by the States and Territories at the Special Premiers Conference in October 1990. The general thesis that there is a requirement for the Commonwealth and the States to cooperate in these matters lies right through the Government's response. </PARA>
<PARA> In the States we find that there is a total disregard-it is even worse than at the Commonwealth level-to meeting targets. In my own State in South Australia, the Government talks about building a multifunction polis in an area of land below sea level covered by eight metres of soft, saline, corrosive mud, which will have to be removed and replaced with about 13 metres of good soil before building can even begin. The energy costs of that operation have not even been taken into the calculus of the MFP. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that the South Australian Government is progressively closing down public transport. To say that the Special Premiers Conference has come up with some agreement is simply pushing aside what is really happening; that is, the States are not addressing this problem and, as far as one can gather from their actions, they have no intention whatsoever of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government then goes on in its response to talk about the energy guide as one of its initiatives. It is now being distributed to every household in Australia. That is a perfect example of blaming the victim. Australian consumers are very much the victim of unlevel playing fields in the energy sector, very often playing fields which have been made unlevel by government bureaucracy-I refer here specifically to the tariff charges for electricity-such that consumers are forced to make decisions on unbalanced economic grounds, which inevitably involve the use of greater amounts of energy. To turn around and promote to people an energy guide, and say, `You should buy this', when very often there may be a great capital hump in the way of buying this rather than that, is simply being very cruel to the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments must address the problem of properly levelling the playing field and properly representing the prices. In this the Democrats rely entirely on properly constructed market forces and on properly levelling the playing field. If people are given the proper price signals, they will make the proper judgments on price and these will also be the best economic decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> To give an example-and I mentioned our alternative Budget in my previous speech-we are proposing a very small tax on fossil fuels which will raise $500m per year. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A little tax, yes, because in the case of petrol the tax would be 0.4c per litre. This tax would be targeted to addressing the capital difficulty faced by many people wishing to buy energy efficient devices, but unable to do so. Let me give an example. If a potential consumer is faced with a choice of buying an electric or a solar hot water service, it is quite clear-and I think every honourable senator would know this-that to buy the solar hot water service costs a great deal more money. But the moment an electric hot water service is plugged in, $1 is demanded from the electricity utility for every watt which that consumes of capital equipment, but the consumer does not pay that amount. The total capital cost of making the electric choice is far greater than the capital cost of making the solar choice, but the capital cost of the electric choice is largely picked up by the utility and amortised into its costs over the next 25 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By using the fund which would be created by our fossil fuel levy to bridge that capital impediment, so potential consumers would see the capital costs of a solar hot-water unit as exactly the same as an electric hot-water unit, most people would then buy the solar unit. Of course, over time the solar unit is an incredibly cheaper option and very substantially reduces the consumption of electricity. In South Australia about 20 per cent of electricity generated goes into water heating; that figure ranges down to as little as 5 per cent in Queensland-a very significant reduction in the consumption of electricity and in the release of greenhouse gases. </PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly, there would be a very small initial increase-a 0.12 per cent increase in the inflation rate-but it is one-off and temporary because as that reduction in energy consumption starts to bite the overall amount of electricity consumed falls, the total amount of money spent on energy falls and there is a strong negative impact on the inflation rate. These are the sorts of things which the Government should be looking at. These are the sorts of things which are suggested in the report Rescue the Future: Reducing the impact off the greenhouse effect. These are the sorts of things on which the Government has turned its back. </PARA>
<PARA> Further on in the Government's response, we find the Government praising energy labelling on new appliances. Again, that is blaming the victim. Okay, give potential consumers information on energy consumption at the time of making particular purchases, when selecting one refrigerator compared with another, but if the more energy efficient refrigerator costs considerably more than the less energy efficient one, many poor people will simply have no choice. The Government is placing on them the additional burden of wanting to do the right thing and then giving them a bad conscience because they know that they have done something which is more damaging to the environment but they are incapable of making the correct choice. These are the sorts of areas which the energy fund that the Democrats would create under its alternative Budget would help to bridge, to level the playing field so that people would make the correct economic choices which would also be the correct energy efficient choices. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress the word `fund' because in relation to each of these electricity energy efficient devices we suggest that the extra capital be made available through the electricity utilities in each State so that, again, that capital difference could be amortised over a period of time into the electricity bills. That would mean that that extra capital would actually flow back to the utilities, back to the fund, and could be reinvested again and again in increased energy devices. </PARA>
<PARA> Investing $500m a year from the fund would provide 500,000 solar hot-water services at an approximate cost of $1,000 each. Within a few years every home in Australia could be equipped with a solar hot-water service out of that fund with very substantial savings in greenhouse gas emissions and with a recoupment to the fund so that money could then flow into other energy efficient devices. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 3 of the Government's response we find a description of the policy framework. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a policy framework for the energy sector will necessarily encompass not only the National Greenhouse Response Strategy, but also many matters, such as access to resources, and returns to the community from resource use, that have little connection with greenhouse. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a total misreading of the situation. Greenhouse must become the imperative. As our report showed, addressing that problem can also address the problems of resource use and economic returns. The Government has simply not properly understood that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government refers to the Industry Commission's report on the cost-benefit implications for Australian industry with the international consensus in favour of a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Madam Acting Deputy President, having looked at a couple of Industry Commission reports recently and having commented on them, you should not hold your breath. The Industry Commission, despite its charter, despite what it should be doing, is not addressing the problems of the environment. It is taking a very cold econometric view of everything to do with the environment. It is not addressing the environment in the ways in which it should be under its legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government in its response refers to not taking a 10-year energy plan, which was recommended in our report, as a rigid tool. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Rather we will be looking to establish a clear policy framework within which the energy sector can operate dynamically, with the flexibility to respond to emerging issues. </PARA>
<PARA>In light of the very large amounts of money which are invested in energy using parts of the economy-I have mentioned $1 billion for a power station with a pay back time over 25 years; think of the transport system in a city with the built infrastructure-to talk about operating dynamically with the flexibility to respond to emerging issues is an absolute nonsense. It is a misreading of the foundation on which a sensible greenhouse policy needs to be built. </PARA>
<PARA> We must take a longer term and a very careful view. As I said earlier, we must look to making those investments which can address the problems of energy efficiency in the short term, whatever that energy efficiency is, in terms of those things which have short pay back times. We should be avoiding the massive investments as long as possible because the situation in relation to greenhouse-the amount of time available to address it, the rate of onset, the severity of the effect-will, according to the best scientific evidence, become much clearer over the next 10 to 15 years. The Government's response also says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports encouragement of cogeneration where it is feasible to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee saw the work being done by CSIRO on the solid oxide fuel cell, work which could address directly the problem of greenhouse in that it could double the direct efficiency of generating electricity and could also provide, through the heat from the fuel cell, an efficiency which would probably approach 90 per cent compared with a current effort of somewhere between 25 per cent and 35 per cent, depending on whether brown or black coal is used. That work in CSIRO is languishing for want of proper government support. I simply cannot take seriously the Government's statement that it supports the encouragement of cogeneration. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government needs to do a great deal more. It needs to seriously address the problem of greenhouse. It has not done this. This is too little, it is probably too late, and the Government really needs to go back and rethink the whole response to this very good report entitled Rescue the Future: Reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to speak to the Government's response to the Industry, Science and Technology Committee report entitled Rescue the Future: Reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect. As is inevitably the case, this response follows a considerable time after the Committee started the inquiry. When we started the inquiry we came in at the latter end of a group of inquiries into various aspects of a similar subject. At that time it was a very hot subject. As various reports were handed down and as the matter settled down, it lost some of its heat. Our lifestyles exist in a world where people in virtually every country insist on a guaranteed energy supply. We are still in the early stages of determining the greenhouse effect-its level and effects and whether it is a phase or a pattern. We are still waiting to get more information on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we commenced this inquiry we took the attitude that, even if there was no greenhouse effect, our recommendations would be valuable and useful to the community at large. Much has and is being done. In my cursory glance through the Government's response, I noticed that in many of the areas in which the Committee made suggestions the Government has either referred these matters for action to various places or those matters are already being acted upon. I am pleased that we can say that things have got that far. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest industry that I can see coming up in the next decade is waste management and pollution control. Australia is well placed not only to improve its own situation but also to do an enormous amount in other countries where the problem is so great and requires such close attention. We must also bear in mind that, while there are general disagreeable features of coal burning and the manufacture of electricity from coal, the coal industry has made tremendous advances in the last decade and is working on considerably greater improvement in the next. That industry is interested in trying to increase the amount of efficiency it is getting from coal. It can now do considerably more about pollution, which in the past has always been an unsatisfactory aspect of its operations. </PARA>
<PARA> This applies also to gas. There have been various issues as far as the use of gas is concerned which are being attended to and on which progress is being made. One of the Committee's recommendations deals with the use of petrol in cars. We noted the degree of improvement which has come about due to the use of the catalytic converter, and so it goes on. As people become more conscious of this question and the problems it creates in the community, they are doing more about it. We need to give credit for the fact that that is happening, and we should ensure that we do not put obstacles in the way of its happening further. </PARA>
<PARA> We will get a lot more by educating, encouraging and demonstrating than we will by legislating. Over the next few years we will get a lot more if we encourage people with facts and figures rather than over-sensationalising, as has been the case in some of the material that I have read in the past few years. I have been given some highly coloured material that is claimed to be authentic when clearly it has been anything but. That has not done the cause any good. We should take this in a very rational way. We have to deal with it in a sustainable manner that will do the right thing by the country and the rest of the world in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several references in the Government's response to the fact that this is largely a State issue. I am one of those who believe in the Federal system. The States are entitled to make their own decisions. However, there needs to be greater cooperation, not only between the Commonwealth and the States but also among the States. This is one area where there is still room for improvement on a large scale. I believe that the States will cooperate further. Discussion is currently under way about a south-eastern grid or an eastern States grid for power and/or gas. Our Committee is probably about half a lap behind on that matter, as we were when we started the inquiry into the greenhouse effect. By the time we produce our report there will probably be half a dozen reports that have been put down just ahead of us. Nevertheless, if it is a matter of getting people to think about it and make submissions about it and getting the States to consider the necessary degree of cooperation, it will have been useful. </PARA>
<PARA> We owe it to the next generation to look at how we treat our resources and how we look after the planet that we currently and temporarily occupy. We have to ensure that in our planning for the future we use our resources wisely and well. We in Tasmania are now in that interesting stage when, having decided many years ago to have a hydro-electric system of pollution free, reusable material, rechargeable in every way, we have changed the plans, which has left us in a rather difficult condition. At the moment our water resources are about 27 per cent of capacity. We are not using water as effectively or as efficiently as was originally planned and as we could have done. Water is a beautiful, non-pollutant material. It is replaceable, but we are not using it adequately. We now find that we are belching smoke from an oil-fired power station, costing Tasmanians a quarter of a million dollars a day for the privilege. We are now being offered the alternatives of establishing a coal-fired station in one of the two worst inversion gullies in Tasmania-the Tamar Valley and the Fingal Valley-of connecting to the system that is now available in Victoria or of considering a gas connection. </PARA>
<PARA> In the next five or 10 years, while this is being determined and planned and while the funding is being discussed, we will run grave risks of committing our next generation to non-employment in Tasmania. We want to be able to provide a livelihood for the next generation of people who wish to work and to utilise the resources that the State provides. Unless we provide guaranteed energy to those people, Tasmania will continue to stagnate and decline. We need to look after the environment and to ensure that we provide the energy that will keep the employment environment and the living environment in a condition that those of us who currently enjoy them can pass on. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time I have been very interested in the development of the dry oxide fuel cell. I believe that that is ultimately going to be of great assistance to most places, and certainly places like Tasmania. It will be of great assistance to substantial industries, which would be able to supply their own power as well as fit in with a cogeneration grid. But here again, do we go ahead and put in a cable joining Tasmania to Victoria now? Do we wait to see whether we can get that more quickly or more slowly than it takes to develop the dry oxide fuel cell? Do we need both and will either of those preclude our capacity to get gas, which I believe is the fuel that we particularly require? These sorts of decisions have to be made even while we are waiting for something else to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to consider that the world will not stand still while we either try to resolve the problems of the past or pontificate about the possibilities of the future. Those things have to be done at the same time. We do need to concentrate largely-more than we do in Australia-on what is happening in the northern hemisphere. Our greatest problem is certainly going to be how we can assist the northern hemisphere to clean up the atmosphere and the environment generally. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to continue to investigate the possibilities brought about by climatic change, in case it happens. I think it is much too early to come to any firm conclusions, but we do need to accept that there are many parts of Australia and many parts of the world that would achieve great benefits from climatic change, as well as areas that would suffer to some extent. The most likely scenario is that if there were a change, for instance, Tasmania would get less rain and have worse problems with its power generation than it has at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report, which of course I have not had an opportunity to study at any great length, does place a lot of emphasis on what the States may or may not do. I do believe that we need to encourage our State colleagues to work very closely with one another and to sort out the State matters in which we have no direct participation. </PARA>
<PARA> The motor vehicle and the generation of electric power are the two particular issues that we need to deal with. Most of the issues in the report have been referred already to either the Australian Minerals and Energy Council or the Australian Transport Advisory Council for attention. I am of the opinion that this Parliament should allow the Government the opportunity to see how it can deal with these matters, having referred the various issues to those two bodies. If we are not satisfied that in due course the Government has made sufficient inroads into the problems, then we have the right to either have another inquiry or try to negotiate with it to achieve some improvement. In the meantime, while that process is happening, we should allow it and encourage it to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> We have discussed energy audits at considerable length. In spite of assurances that the matter is well under control, I am still of the opinion that many electricity users are unaware of the services that may be available to them which ensure that energy is used as efficiently as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The solar power issue is one that I believe we really have to come to grips with. I certainly agree that we have to be able to use solar power, particularly in water heating, over as much of Australia as possible. It will relieve the pressure on the use of electric power from a variety of other sources. Solar power could easily provide us with the necessary power extension that we are currently looking for to cover the next 20 to 25 years if we were able to encourage people to use it where it is appropriate and applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not rate the Government's response to the Committee's report very highly. I thought it was a bit patronising and perfunctory, but it does cover many of the issues raised. I hope that, with cooperation from ATAC, AMEC, the States and the electricity authorities, we may be able to make some progress in the years ahead. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the comments that have been made by Senator Archer. I was holding back because I thought that Senator Childs, who is the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, was going to say something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In its response to the report entitled Rescue the Future: Reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect, I feel that the Government needs to do more than pay lip service to areas such as making the transport system and the energy generation systems in this country more efficient and more environmentally sensitive. I believe that all of our recommendations have been referred to some other committee, and Senator Archer made that point in his usual erudite manner. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to look at the use of power and the use of our energy resources, whether or not people believe in the greenhouse effect. As much as anything else, this country needs to look at the economic advantages of being more cost effective while making sure that something is done in the environmentally sensitive area as well. Whether this is done with cooperative State approval or by the Commonwealth taking over the responsibility for some areas, it is up to the Government of the day to decide which way will achieve the best result.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, the coalition has a program called Auselgrid, which aims to have electricity-which is on a stand alone system at the moment-integrated into a grid system across the eastern States of Australia. Taking it to its final stage of electricity sharing, excess power loads generated in Tasmania would be put through the grid system in Victoria. That would be the last stage of electricity sharing, but it is still a way of making ourselves more cost efficient and making our industries better able to cope with problems with the greenhouse effect in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Government for its report. I make the point that this report was embargoed until the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, brought it down. That makes it difficult, when the reply to a report is as long as this, to be able to give it as good a response as we should. </PARA>
<PARA> I concur with the remarks of Senator Archer. I hope that we now have better cost efficient energy sharing and a better understanding of the problems of environmental concerns in some of the areas, notwithstanding the fact that at the moment we have a coal based electricity system in Australia which will be here for a long time to come. We require it to be sensitive to the needs of the community. Nobody would like it if the lights were turned out because we did not have enough electricity generated while we were thinking about all these other innovative things that Senator Coulter said should happen more quickly than they obviously will be able to happen. </PARA>

It is unsatisfactory, when we laboured so long on the report. The greenhouse issue is very complex, as can be shown by the various areas that the recommendations are to be sent to.

<PARA>Recommendation 1. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so as to provide the Australian Electoral Commission with the power to conduct spot audits of the electoral activities of registered political parties. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Agreed. The Government accepts the need to allow the Electoral Commission to be able to conduct spot audits of registered political parties to ensure that they are complying with the operations of the funding and disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill (the Bill) incorporates the necessary amendments to give effect to this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Electoral Commission in all future reports on the operation of Part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 publish a record of all spot audits undertaken, the reports to provide detailed information on audits only where breaches of the Act have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided that the Electoral Commission must publish in its reports on the operation of the funding and disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act a record of all spot audits undertaken and will amend the Act accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so as to provide for the full disclosure of all forms of income and expenditure by registered parties. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Agreed. The Government supports full disclosure of all forms of income and expenditure by political parties registered under the Act. The Bill contains the necessary amendments to enact the Committee's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 305 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so that during one disclosure period third parties are required to disclose income and expenditure which relates to any election and not just the election bounded by the current disclosure period. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts this recommendation and will present the necessary amendments in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Electoral Commission in all future reports on the operation of Part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 publish its current listing of third parties. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts the recommendation. The necessary amendments are included in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so as to provide for the full disclosure of all the income of and expenditure by third parties publicly listed by the Australian Electoral Commission in its reports on the operation of Part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts the need for third party disclosure of income and expenditure which relates directly to the electoral process. However, the recommendation would require disclosure of all income and expenditure whether related to the electoral activities of the third party or not. The resulting invasion of confidentiality and privacy cannot at this stage be justified. The Act will be amended to require disclosure by third parties of gifts made to political parties or auxiliaries thereof. The powers of the Electoral Commission to conduct spot upon third parties will be enhanced as discussed below per recommendation 7. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so as to provide the Australian Electoral Commission with the power to conduct spot audits of third parties known or found to have a financial relationship with a registered political party. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts the recommendation that the Electoral Commission should be able to conduct spot audits of third parties who in the view of the Electoral Commission are or may be required to disclose electoral expenditure or party political gifts under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8. </PARA>
<PARA>The Broadcasting Act 1942 be amended so as to provide for a system of allocating free time for political broadcasting on television and radio for elections in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not support the recommendation which discriminates in favour of existing and particularly major political parties represented in Parliaments or legislatures. The Bill will amend the Broadcasting Act to prohibit the broadcast of political advertisements, thereby achieving the Committee's objective of reducing election costs more equitably than as proposed by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 9. </PARA>
<PARA>An independent committee, such as the Party Political Broadcast Committee in the United Kingdom, be established and that it have responsibility for allocating free time to parties and candidates and the determination of time slots. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation will not be relevant given the Government's response to recommendation 8 above. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 10. </PARA>
<PARA>No minimum time period be set for political advertisements broadcast on radio and television. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>As per recommendation 9 above. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 11. </PARA>
<PARA>The Broadcasting Act 1942 be amended to ensure that the policy launches of major parties be broadcast free of charge at reasonable times. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation campaign launch broadcast times should remain as presently allocated. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides that Broadcasters may broadcast one policy launch at the request of a political party during an election period. The broadcast must be free of charge. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will be empowered to issue guidelines on the time at which a policy launch may be broadcast.Recommendation 12. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 116 of the Broadcasting Act 1942 be amended so as to remove responsibility for administrative arrangements for the electronic blackout from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and place the responsibility on the licensees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This issue before us has been canvassed ad nauseam over the past few days so I do not intend to speak at great length. It is worth noting that the Government's response comes two years after the event and, after the events of the last few days, it bears no relevance to the direction in which the Government is now going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen the debacle of this Government abusing the report entitled Who Pays the Piper Calls the Tune: Minimising the risks of funding political campaigns to attempt to ban at all times all advertising on radio and television. It has brought down a response when it knows that, somewhat reluctantly, some of our Democrat colleagues on the other side-and I am not referring to the one present, Senator Kernot-did not oppose this rather outrageous attempt to ban advertising in Australia and thus attack one of the basic elements of democracy, and that is, freedom of political expression. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to a couple of the responses of the Government. Recommendation No. 3 in the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so as to provide for the full disclosure of all forms of income and expenditure by registered parties. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government agreed to that. Disclosure has been a fairly major issue. It was not canvassed at great length by me in the recent debate, but I thought I would touch on it today so that everyone knows exactly where we stand on this.</PARA>
<PARA> As we know, the so-called `ad ban' Bill-the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991-has been referred to a select committee. There are two issues on disclosure that I and my Party are concerned about. The first is intimidation. That is the concern expressed most often by those in society who would like to support the Liberal Party of Australia, the National Party of Australia or even the Australian Democrats, simply because philosophically they agree with the Liberal and National Party policies and despise what the Australian Labor Party has done and continues to do to drag our great country to Third World status. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone knows that if someone wants to intimidate another person or a group, all sorts of penalties can be and have been applied by both incumbent governments and trade unions throughout this country. It is worth the Senate reflecting on this very subject. Back in 1985, Senator Ray-who is now a Minister-in debate with former Senator Sheil subtly warned Lindsay Fox from the transport industry that he would be unwise to make a donation to the Liberal Party. I quote from that Hansard as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>He has a very large and efficient transport operation in this country which has relatively good relations with the unions. </PARA>
<PARA>The threat was there that if Lindsay Fox made a donation, and it was made public, his relationship with the trade union could be in jeopardy. I refer also to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune and a comment made there by former Senator Sir John Carrick:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a strong deterrent against private or corporate donation. </PARA>
<PARA>This is disclosure. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>It provides a ready-made and published `hit list' available for punitive action by a mean-minded and vengeful government. President Nixon's socalled `enemies list' as revealed by the Watergate inquiry reveals the grave dangers of the corrupt use of the list of disclosed donations. </PARA>
<PARA>I point that out because, whilst we have said that we support completely full-blooded disclosure, we believe that it must protect anyone, whether an individual, a corporation or anyone else in society, who makes a donation to a party of their choice. I would sincerely hope that one of the things this Committee will look at is that area of intimidation because it is vital to the continued democracy of this country and the freedom of people to be able to make a contribution to people of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA> A second aspect of intimidation is the intimidation or coercion of individuals or companies, or even unions, to make donations. When it occurs I would call this unadulterated corruption. It is going on-right here and now. In the Cook inquiry in Queensland the Clerks Union officials were asked why, at a meeting with the Premier, Mr Goss, they, the Clerks Union officials, agreed to affiliate, at a cost of around $30,000 a year, with the Australian Labor Party. The response in the Cook report is interesting. The response was that it would enable the union to influence policy and have ready access to Ministers. The flip side, which was unsaid but clearly visible and transparent, was that without affiliation they could not influence policy or get access to Ministers. I make these points-and I am being bipartisan about the whole thing-because intimidation is very real. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Faulkner" NAMEID="5K4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator looks at the Cook report he will see it in black and white. I will give him a copy of it, if he wishes. What has come out, for instance, of the Royal Commission into WA Inc. and the infamous gold lunch with the Prime Minister? A donation was required to ensure the Hawke Labor Government took a course of action in respect to the gold tax. In other words, a policy direction would be taken, not because it was necessarily right, but contingent upon a donation being made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the fair and equitable element. This is important when we talk about disclosure and donations to political parties. If the Government is genuine about disclosure, let us ensure that donations are fair and equitable. The Labor Party is not the party of all Australians; it is the political arm of the power brokers and the trade union movement-not the workers, but the power brokers who determine whether an individual can earn a living or not. Hence the signs on construction sites all over the country, and at the waterfront, `No ticket no work'-and there are the Comcar drivers where there is a closed shop. The Transport Workers Union tells them, `You cannot cross the picket'. It does not have a meeting and it does not enable the drivers to have a meeting; it tells them. To work, a vast number of people must pay union dues-they have no choice. The dues are tax deductible. If a union decides to affiliate the amount of money is taken without reference to that worker who paid the dues, and it is then paid to the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the difficulty of getting information on these affiliation fees, it is hard to come up with accurate figures. However, it can be conservatively estimated that the affiliation fees represent an annual contribution of around $5m a year. No wonder the Australian Workers Union chief in Queensland, Bill Ludwig, with that sort of muscle was able to tell Queensland members of parliament that, if they did not do what he wanted in the leadership tussle between Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, they would be politically dead. What would have been the reaction of the Labor Party and the media if an industry organisation, or the Australian Family Association, for instance, made the same threat to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, or to me as a coalition member? There would have been justifiable outrage. This, however, is only part of the story. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one would deny that unions in Australia today are big business. They get commissions on transactions, including compulsory union superannuation. They have investments; they own property. Some are so big in property investments that I understand there is a union in New South Wales which does not need any members. It is not commonly known that all income on union investments is free of income tax and free of capital gains tax. So if a union owned the casino at Wrest Point, for instance, its income would be tax free. If it sold a central business district building it would be free of capital gains tax, so a union is given special consideration. When any union then makes a donation to the Labor Party, it is income tax free money. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the sorts of questions which must be addressed. The question is: is that fair and equitable? That sort of tax free status is just not available to any other political party in Australia. It is quite clear that these two points I have raised have to be a major consideration in the Joint Standing Committee's review of the ad ban Bill, the Bill on political advertising. As I mentioned earlier, this has been canvassed ad nauseam. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to comment on the extraordinary fact that this Government response to this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune has taken two years. We are talking about a report printed in June 1989, and here we are in August 1991. It is always wise to ask in politics: why is this so? There are some really obvious reasons that we can look at. Certainly the funding of political campaigns is an incredibly topical subject. I wonder whether this Government response two years down the track has anything to do with the sorts of things which are in this 1989 report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing I notice is the ALP submission. Under the heading, `The Democratic Principle', the ALP says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Democratic Principle would provide that:</PARA>
<PARA>* a limit be set to the aggregate amount of advertising time which can be made available by each broadcaster for use by, and on behalf of, political parties.</PARA>
<PARA>It says:</PARA>
<PARA>* a formula be established for allocating advertising time, recognising the rights of parties represented in the parliament and of minority parties with a significant level of community support;</PARA>
<PARA>So it is not a ban, but a limit. The Committee considered a range of options to minimise the risks of funding political campaigns-options designed to break the nexus between the cost of political campaigns, the corresponding need for huge donations and the question of the political influence which may reside with such donations. </PARA>
<PARA> This Committee considered a wide range of options. A lot of these options have not been canvassed in this debate ad nauseam. These options included increasing the level of public funding to take account of the greater cost of election media advertisements, tax deductibility of political donations, imposing a ceiling on paid political advertising, imposing a complete ban on political advertising and providing free time for political advertising. The Committee report states:</PARA>
<PARA>While some viewers may support a complete ban on political advertising, it would have a direct affect on freedom of speech by reducing opportunities for discussion during election periods. </PARA>
<PARA>This Committee report, out of all the options that I just listed, opted for free time as the most suitable option for allowing parties to advertise their policies. Yet the Government, in its response today, does not accept this recommendation and has opted instead for the modified position of a ban on advertising during election campaigns. Again, we ask: why all the interest? Why this change of position?</PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to some of the comments made yesterday by Senator Powell. She said that the whole question of election funding has become a matter of concern in a range of countries recently for three basic reasons: firstly, a number of studies, especially in the United States, have shown that special interest contributions to political campaigns do influence legislative behaviour and results; secondly, the rapidly escalating costs of political advertising, particularly on the electronic media, have placed enormous and growing pressure on participants in elections to raise very large sums of money; and, thirdly, the number of scandals in several countries have shown that legislation giving favours to particular groups, businesses or even individuals can be traced to donations made during election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> We are seeing evidence of this in Australia in a range of royal commissions. The reports of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct in Queensland and the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales have expressed concern about the dangers of political corruption associated with the existing system of election fundraising and advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> A specific recommendation of this Committee report was that all political parties should be required to disclose all donations, gifts and income, and that the Australian Electoral Commission should be given power to conduct spot audits of political parties. The Government, in its response to this Committee report, has accepted both parts of that recommendation. I want to return to that a bit later. </PARA>
<PARA> I place on record yet again that since their inception the Australian Democrats have had a clear policy of support of full disclosure. People here would know that we have pursued that commitment with vigour. We believe not only that a requirement of full disclosure is correct in principle but also that the electorate is entitled to know the source of donations and it wants to have that information available to it. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Faulkner" NAMEID="5K4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We made some suggestions about that, and I will turn to that later. I now refer to the submission the Australian Democrats made to this Committee. The Democrats have said that there should be a minimum period of three minutes of political advertising. We have heard-shock, horror-that three minutes will turn people off. Quite the contrary. We say that anything less than a three-minute block of advertising is not conducive to the dissemination of substantial policy information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In our submission we argued that financial resources alone should not determine which political party, or which party's policies, attract the most media coverage. Political advertising, at least during Federal election campaigns, should be done on an equitable and informative basis. We have heard a lot about `equitable', but not a lot about `informative'. There is too much emphasis on the 30-second superficial grab. We also said-there has not been a lot of discussion about this-that television and radio stations are licensed by the Federal Government and, therefore, as public facilities they should provide a certain amount of free time for the purpose of political advertising. This should be made a condition of licences. </PARA>
<PARA> We said that all political advertising should be regulated so that the obligations that apply to companies with regard to truth and accuracy in advertising under the Trade Practices Act would also apply to political advertising under the Electoral Act. This has often been called the licence to lie. That is what we want to eliminate. </PARA>
<PARA> Our submission to this Committee concentrated on the nexus between political and economic power, on minimum timeframes, on informativeness and on truth in advertising. I think it is interesting to note what happens in overseas countries. The Committee noted that some form of free political broadcasting on networks exists in many Western democracies and that, at least in Western democracies, there is widespread regulation of political broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA> It showed that out of the 19 countries for which data was obtained for this report, only two countries-Norway and the United States-do not provide some form of free party political broadcasts. Of the same 19 countries, only five countries-Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States and West Germany-allow paid political broadcasts. So the system that we are accustomed to in Australia is not the norm for Western democracies. Before we become hysterical about freedom of speech and its connection with democratic government, I think we should at least acknowledge the existence of systems in other countries which we would call democracies. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I think it is important to look at the cost of political advertising, which is the reason that the Government was motivated to introduce its recent Bill. As the report mentions in its preface:</PARA>
<PARA>The rising cost of television advertising time has coincided with the growing use of that medium for political advertising. This has greatly increased the reliance of parties on corporate sponsorship. The Committee is concerned that heavy reliance by parties on such sponsorship risks the distortion of our open democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The electoral system should ensure that large financial sponsors, having paid the piper, do not also call the tune. The wider membership of political parties should not lose its influence within the respective parties. </PARA>
<PARA>If we look at what has been spent recently in Australia at election times, we note an extraordinary growth in expenditure. In 1984 the ALP spent $4.7m; in 1990 it had escalated to $14.6m. In 1984 the Liberal Party spent $4.8m; in 1990 it had escalated to $11.86m. In 1984 the National Party spent $2.73m; in 1990 it had escalated to $3.4m. In 1984 the Australian Democrats spent $0.47m; in 1990 it had escalated to $1.13m. Because we spend so much money and we need to raise so much money, the issue of where the money comes from is extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some important things said in this Committee report and in the Government response about the issue of disclosure. In the original Committee report the Committee said that there is some concern about the extent of parties avoiding the disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act. When asked how many donations were being caught by the present disclosure provisions, the Electoral Commissioner replied that the AEC did not know. The Electoral Commissioner did not believe there were major abuses occurring, but he added:</PARA>
<PARA>There is the disquieting fact that the affairs that have become public knowledge, and that have led to further investigation by the police--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was talking about certain attitudes to the issue of full disclosure. I was referring to the comments of the Electoral Commissioner in the report Who pays the piper calls the tune. The Electoral Commissioner said that he did not believe that there were major abuses occurring. He added:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . there is the disquieting fact that the affairs that have become public knowledge and that have led to further investigation by the police and to prosecutions and the like, have invariably come about not as a result of any natural interpretation of the evidence but as a result of some internal controversy within the organisation or between organisations that has caused somebody to dob someone in. This is slightly worrying. If they do not fall out, then we never get to know. </PARA>
<PARA>I guess a recent example that we could ponder is with whom did ALP Secretary Bob Hogg fall out? I think we could argue that maybe Mr Hogg made a genuine mistake in failing to disclose a large number of small donations. But in any case, I think the important point is that it did happen. It is not good enough for disclosure to rely--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I will just talk about the general principle that disclosure should not in any way rely upon the internal party politics of any political party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I think it is interesting to note the views on full disclosure that the Liberal and National Party members of the Committee expressed in their dissenting report. If we look at what they said in this report, we can perhaps conclude that some members of the parliamentary Liberal Party have come a long way since then. They said that they find the recommendation on full disclosure to be offensive. They said that it is offensive for a party to disclose all of its income and expenditure. They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> This sort of detailed information about a political party could not be of interest or value to anybody, except perhaps the party's political opponents. </PARA>
<PARA>To that I say: indeed, who else would have a legitimate interest in the source of donations to a political party and the connection between donations and political and economic power. Of course, it is the people of Australia whose lives are affected by those political decisions. The submission went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The existing public funding provisions include an important safety valve which enables party supporters to give to the maintenance costs, as opposed to the campaign costs, of the party of their choice without fear of the inherently intimidatory aspects of the disclosure requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know that there has been a great deal of interest in this particular loophole. I think we have seen in the time since this report was published that it is that very loophole which has been the vehicle through which major parties have failed to disclose important large donations. </PARA>
<PARA> The view expressed in this submission that this safety valve of non-disclosable maintenance donations should be preserved would, I believe, still be the view of the Liberal Party administration. So I think we have to ask the question: where do both the Government and the Opposition really stand on the matter of disclosure? To answer that, let me look at recent events. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that it supports full disclosure and, indeed, it says that in its response to recommendation 3, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports full disclosure of all forms of income and expenditure by political parties registered under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The parliamentary Liberal Party says that it has reversed its previous opposition to full disclosure. It now supports the principle, but it wants to see amendments to deal with intimidatory aspects and equity in respect of donations by the trade union movement. I think it is true that the Liberal Party seems to have moved significantly since the publication of this report, but just yesterday both the Government and the Opposition failed to support the opportunity presented to them by the Democrats to implement this commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the views expressed by the Opposition speakers that the Government's Political Broadcasting and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 does contain some defects, but not major ones in the disclosure clauses; and amending legislation is what we do here. But the Opposition had no amendments ready to propose. I think if those opposite were at all serious about full disclosure, they could have anticipated that at one stage of the Bill's passage they might have been asked to put forward their amendments. But they did not appear to have any amendments ready. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask: since when did the criterion of perfect legislation apply as a prerequisite for voting on clauses of any Bill? It has never applied as far as I know. Yesterday was a really disappointing and, indeed, almost shameful example of the lack of action-perhaps even the hypocrisy-of both the Government and the Opposition with regard to the matter of full disclosure. I hope the matter can be rectified. Both the Government and the Opposition have the opportunity to support the private member's Bill on disclosure which was introduced by Senator Powell yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very difficult to accept the excuses for this failure to act yet again. It is the electronic advertising clauses of the Bill which are contentious, not the disclosure clauses-if one believes what Government and Opposition speakers have said in this debate. Yet because of their combined action, Australians are being asked to wait yet again to have access to the full information about who gives how much to which political parties. Only with full disclosure will we have the information from which to draw our own conclusions. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday time expired before I had a chance to speak to this document and I am grateful for the opportunity to do so tonight. There are two aspects of importance in relation to the supporting applications from the Advances to the Minister for Finance. The first is that they are evidence of the incompetence of the Department of Community Services and Health in its application to the Department of Finance for the allocation of these funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer particularly to the Advance for the funds required for the breast cancer detection program. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that only $1,045,250 was allocated to this program in the 1990-91 Budget. I am sure that if testicular cancer were as prevalent as breast cancer more than $1,045,250 would be allocated for early testicular cancer detection programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 8,500,000 Australians-or half the population-are susceptible to breast cancer, which can also, rarely, affect males. One in 15 women develops breast cancer-a figure that will increase with the ageing population. The only proven early detection method is mammography. Early detection programs have been shown to decrease the death rate significantly from 50 per cent to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to note that at the same time as $1,045,250 was allocated for this program, $92,982,000 was allocated for financial assistance to students of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent. They represent one in six of the 250,000 people who are of this descent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 May this year, I spoke on this report, but since then two significant events have occurred. The National Health and Medical Research Council is the peak medical research body in Australia and was founded in 1936, together with the medical research endowment fund, from which money is appropriated for medical research in Australia. The Council is a type of sorting body for these funds and in 1990-91 over $95m has been appropriated for allocation around the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over all these years, the National Health and Medical Research Council has been an outstanding success in the way in which it approaches the dispensation of funds. However, the Council has some critics. It has 30 members, including representatives from each of the State health departments and, in addition, representatives of the Public Health Research and Development Committee and the Medical Research Ethics Committee; nominees of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, the Australian Council of Social Service and the Australian Academy of Science; and the First Assistant Secretary of Health Research and Services Division of the Department of Community Services and Health. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time I spoke, all 30 members were academics or bureaucrats; there were no practising medical practitioners or nurses. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Mr Howe, was approached in this regard and refused to include a nominee of either the Royal Australian Nursing Federation or the Australian Medical Association. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has subsequently recognised the validity of my statement and has appointed a nominee of the AMA to the National Health and Medical Research Council. However, other events have occurred which are not as beneficial. Since the review of the NHMRC, changes have occurred regarding the provision of ethical advice to the Council. The Medical Research Ethics Committee has been responsible for a series of guidelines dealing with many aspects of ethics in medical research and has been recognised and commended nationally and internationally for its contribution to the ethical debate. Following the review of the Council and its committees late in 1990 and the position of the National Bioethics Consultative Council and its advice to Ministers, it was decided that the Medical Research Ethics Committee should be incorporated into the National Bioethics Consultative Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Health Ethics Committee will have a broader focus than medical research ethics. This expanded role for the Committee was supported by the Medical Research Ethics Committee, following an increase in the number of requests for ethical advice and decisions on clinical or public health issues. The new Committee will be chaired by Ms Robyn Layton. The composition and membership closely resemble that of the former National Bioethics Consultative Council. Only one member of the MREC, Professor Ross Kalucy, the former MREC Chairman, has been appointed to the new body. Most members of the MREC are disappointed that the work of the Committee may not continue and that their involvement has ceased. Members are concerned that the very important role of the MREC-to advise, support and review the international ethics committee system-will not be a high priority for the Australian Health Ethics Committee and that the unique system of institutional ethics committees will be damaged. It is the view of the ex-members that the research expertise should have been maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now no place for lay persons, and thus the membership does not mirror that required of IECs according to the National Health and Medical Research Council supplementary note 1 of the statement on human experimentation. It is obvious from the composition of this Committee that the ethical debate has been hijacked and that the focus of the National Health and Medical Research Council has shifted radically from its role as the peak body in the allocation of funds for medical research. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Australian Agricultural Council is for the meeting which was held in Nelson, New Zealand, in February this year. The meeting occurred at a time when the Australian rural sector was facing a very pessimistic future. In fact, the outlook continues to be bleak, with this week's news that an industry which is already facing considerable hardship-the wheat industry-is being knocked by the sale of Saudi Arabian wheat to our trans-Tasman neighbour, New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted that in the Ministers' policy session a number of major industry crises were considered. These included the wool industry, the current agricultural scene and policy settings, Australian agricultural and related trade policies post-GATT round, sustainable development, drought policy and research policy. It would have been interesting to have been an observer at the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already made what seems to me in only the past number of years many speeches on each of these subjects as they have become more and more critical not only in terms of our national financial welfare but also because they involve the disintegration of a lifestyle and society which has served Australia well in the past. I believe that if we fail any-and I reiterate the word `any'-of our rural industries now, we will possibly see the disintegration of rural Australian society as many of us have known it. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Ministers were discussing the current rural crisis, there was much talk about the highly contentious consequences of a national heavy vehicle regulatory and road charging system proposed by the Inter-State Commission. I noted that page 1 of the report states that the Australian Agricultural Council agreed that a submission would be made to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the effect that the Council believes that any national heavy vehicle regulatory and road user charging system should take full account of the legitimate economic and social interests of the remote areas of Australia. I do trust that the Prime Minister did take note of that resolution, though evidence to date has not been indicative of this. </PARA>
<PARA> It is distressing to note that the profound shift in Australia's export earnings from farm products to other economic sectors has left primary producers with shrinking incomes. These changes mean that we cannot afford simply to sit back and wait for the farm sector to be virtually depopulated. That really is what is starting to happen all over Australia. It is happening not only in the South Burnett where I come from but also in so many other rural areas. It is in the interests of everyone to control the process, to ameliorate its worst effects and to approach the whole issue with a balance of sympathy and energy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot claim that the rural crisis has only just hit. It has been warned continuously for years, and the evidence to show just what is happening outside our major cities has been around for some time. Similarly, it is not much use to so rationalise our rural sector that we eventually see the demise of the family farmer. This is what has happened in a number of our major industries, including the wool industry, which came under particular discussion at the meeting. The Ministers focused on what were at the time recent decisions concerning the pricing and marketing arrangements for wool which were outlined by the Commonwealth. It included details of projections of stock and financing costs under various scenarios. I do trust that not much attention was paid to those projections, as we all know how inaccurate they were. In fact, during the first half of this year, the Parliament frequently had to grapple with the continuing crisis in the wool industry and the failure of this Government to properly anticipate what would occur as a result of various pieces of its own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of the GATT Round would obviously have led to a more generalised discussion of free trade and tariffs. This came under considerable spotlight in the Senate in June when we addressed the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. Many other matters were raised at this agricultural Ministers council, but I do believe that as we think about the problems in the rural industry, some of which I have been speaking about, we want to remember that the Prime Minister promised in his rural policy speech in Griffith in 1983:</PARA>
<PARA>I make an unqualified commitment to maintaining the viability of Australia's great rural sector and the provincial infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA>I regret to say that the Federal Labor Government has not lived up to this commitment. Effectively, it has stripped away from Australian agriculture those measures which shielded it from the corrupt practices of the international market. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak tonight to the Government's response on the report entitled Independent Review of Asbestos in Defence. I am glad to see that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is present in the chamber tonight. The report of the independent review, completed by Mr Enfield, on the use of asbestos in the Department of Defence is an important contribution to the literature concerned with asbestos issues. As Mr Enfield notes in his report, asbestos and asbestos related illness are highly emotive topics. It is to his credit that he takes a professional, dispassionate approach in his review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report contains a number of important recommendations. These relate to issues such as training and instruction; the identification, labelling, enclosure, encapsulation and removal of asbestos; medical counselling; and improved processes for handling compensation claims. The Minister has accepted all these recommendations in principle. It is to be hoped that this in-principle acceptance translates into established practice. An extremely disturbing finding of the review was the observation by Mr Enfield that the Defence instructions on asbestos were inadequate. He pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a multitude of instructions in Defence relating to asbestos. In the course of my review I concluded that these instructions were inadequate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The instructions seemed to me to reflect the concerns of the originators rather than the needs of users.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Enfield, in light of these inadequacies, recommends that Defence instructions relating to asbestos be rationalised and revised and provides a number of suggestions on how this might be achieved in relation to both occupational and non-occupational exposure to asbestos. </PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1990 will help facilitate this. Importantly, Mr Enfield notes that an adequate level of funding will be needed to provide the necessary training, though he fails to say how much this will need to be. It is of some concern that these last recommendations, dealing essentially with defence policy, are necessary after 23 years of tardiness and inefficient and potentially life-threatening administrative practices. The Minister has indicated that the Department is addressing these administrative failures as a matter of high priority, and I welcome this. In a briefing I received from Mr Enfield in November of last year, it was foreshadowed that for those diagnosed as suffering from mesothelioma he would be looking to extend compensation to include counselling and psychological support as opposed to rehabilitation. I am pleased to see that this has emerged as a specific recommendation in his report. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Enfield also advocates a humane approach from the Commonwealth in regard to the acceptance and rejection of mesothelioma claims. He argues that mesothelioma should continue to be specified as an occupational disease caused by exposure to asbestos, even if it means accepting claims where mesothelioma could have been caused by inhalation of airborne asbestos fibres outside the workplace. This is valid on both humane and expenditure grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Veterans' Affairs has recently completed a review of the scientific literature relating to exposure to asbestos. At about this time last year, I asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs how many compensation claims had been made for asbestos related illness and was informed that as at 29 May 1990 there had been approximately 300, although for a variety of reasons that was likely to be understated. Approximately 65 per cent of claims considered were accepted, with over 30 per cent rejected. Significantly, at that time there were still nine outstanding appeals to the Veterans Review Board or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is totally unacceptable that ex-servicemen having been diagnosed as suffering from mesothelioma or asbestosis find themselves, in the last months of their lives, fighting to convince the bureaucracy of the validity of their compensation claims. I hope that the Department will note carefully and adopt the humane approach advocated by Mr Enfield in relation to procedures for mesothelioma claims. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the set of guidelines set out by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, for the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, its councils and its committees on the performance of its functions. The paper sets out the guidelines as three sets of priorities, namely, economic priorities, social priorities and budget priorities. I will speak very briefly to the first two of these.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The economic priorities include guidelines which are at variance with the legislation which the Minister has attempted to rush through the Parliament. The guidelines state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the removal of unnecessary regulations and other impediments remains central to the Government's approach. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet before the winter recess we debated two Bills which attempted to over-regulate and create difficulties for the education industry. I am referring to the renamed Education Services (Export Regulations) Bill and the Training Guarantee (Administration Amendment) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Board of Employment, Education and Training is urged by the Minister to be mindful of certain economic priorities, namely, increasing participation in education and increasing opportunities for the upgrading of skills and retraining. Perhaps this augurs well for the future, but the Senate inquiry into adult and community education has found that there are huge problems related to re-entry into education and training courses, that there is insufficient expenditure on migrant education, and that there is a deplorable lack of literacy in this country which is an indictment on the whole education system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board is also urged to be mindful of improving the efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility of education and training, including that offered by private providers. Yet the Minister has created a national unified system for training and so, far from allowing training to be flexible, his legislation confines it within the range of a very narrow definition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board is also urged to help reduce institutional barriers between different education and training systems. Again, I feel that this is a pious hope rather than a reality. The reality is that there is very poor articulation between different courses, let alone between different institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Under `Social Priorities', the Minister states that the Government's fundamental objective is to develop a fair, more prosperous and just society. A key element of his just society is a fair and equal access to essential services, such as education. Yet the Senate inquiry into adult and community education showed that there are still impenetrable barriers to education for some people, such as distance, gender, ethnicity, language and ability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister reminds the Board that the Government has substantially expanded the number of higher education places. So it has: with disastrous results. The Government has expanded the number of places, but without additional resources, with the result that universities are bulging at the seams. There may be more students at universities but, without increased staff and additional facilities, student overcrowding is currently damaging morale and creating an intolerable situation in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board is reminded of a particular priority for the Government in ensuring income support arrangements for young people in education, but the recent debate on the Student Assistance Amendment Bill in the Senate gives the lie to this, and students are finding it more and more difficult to get assistance to further pursue their studies. The Minister reminds the Board of the Government's priority to improve literacy in this country, but we are way behind. There are not enough resources to increase literacy. Finally, under `Social Priorities', the Minister urges the Board to facilitate re-entry into the work force, but this is a real problem when there are no jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make two final comments in relation to this document. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) urges Australia to become the `clever country', but his Minister for Employment, Education and Training has not one word in this document about the encouragement of gifted children. Much of this document refers to young people and new programs and assistance for those who are unemployed. It is a sad situation when a government has to devise guidelines for a national board to cater for massively high unemployment rates. One-third of our young people are out of work and the plans outlined in this document do very little to help them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Police Ministers Council's report on national common police services for 1989-90 reports on basically three components: the National Police Research Unit, the Australian Police Staff College and the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. I wish to briefly address the work of the National Police Research Unit, as reported, and comment on a number of matters that are not covered in the activities of that research unit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The record of the work of that unit is impressive. In the review of activities, we read that major research is progressing on a national strategic crime trend forecasting facility, on armed robbery, on vulnerability of the aged to criminal exploitation, on violent criminal apprehension programs, on electronic surveillance, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> What I find lacking in this document is any attention being given to our prison facilities throughout Australia. There is an obvious reason for that: clearly they are a State responsibility and it seems that the activities reported in this document have a national focus. However, the Australian Police Ministers Council is composed of police Ministers who have State responsibilities-they are State police Ministers. I believe it is time that this Parliament addresses itself to the question of how our prisons are administered, what they do to the people who are inmates of them and what happens when these people leave our prison system. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak with some degree of personal experience since my son, a community worker, at one stage was in charge of a halfway house for ex-prisoners from Boggo Road gaol in Brisbane. I visited him twice and my experience-and his-adds up to the view that a system that can do what we are doing to human beings in our prisoners is a rotten system. </PARA>
<PARA> I know it is difficult to create a national strategy and to bring measures into being on a national basis when the specific responsibilities are at State level; however, there are precedents where the national Government decides on a general policy, sets standards and provides grants on a tied basis. I believe the time has come to look at a strategy of that type. </PARA>
<PARA> In pursuance of that view I have included in this year's Democrat alternative budget proposals a number of items for prison reform in the portfolio of the Attorney-General. In the first instance the Democrats believe that the problem-and it is a problem-starts with the attitude, the level of education and the professional capacity of prison officers. It is time to ensure that prison officers are provided with the education and training they require to be able to change their attitude to the task they face in rehabilitating prisoners, not in just detaining them. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we need to review the existing curricula of the training courses for prison officers and establish new courses with the aim of substantially upgrading threshold qualifications for their employment. Those officers who are not prepared to take part need to be given redundancy packages. We need capital expenditure to improve prison facilities; we need increased funding for vocational training and general education of prisoners and we need a transition program, including counselling, to assist them in coping with current conditions `outside' and in finding employment, housing, social contacts and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently a program was started in Victoria by Fabian Dattner which was called Second Chance. Fabian Dattner approached employers asking them to employ prisoners who leave our institutions to give them a second chance. I fear that program has now come to an end. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak to Government document No. 28, Advances to the Minister for Finance-Supporting Applications of Issues, June 1991. In particular, I want to deal with the child-care fee relief element of the document which involves an additional requirement of $422,792 for the Department of Community Services and Health. This, on top of the original appropriation plus extra funds of $2.8m from the Advance to the Minister for Finance already, brings the total expenditure on this project to something like $136m. </PARA>
<PARA> These additional funds are required because they relate to the approval of additional new places and more eligible fee relief users commencing with approved services. Apparently, based on commercial services it was decided that there should be 33,000 places originally costed in the Budget and approximately 36,700 are now being taken up, and as well there are other demands on the services in the non-commercial user end. What intrigues me about this additional funding requirement is that it points to the impact of the recession on the Government's budget and on the Budget to be brought down next Tuesday. The supporting documents asking for this extra $422,000 in June say:</PARA>
<PARA>There is evidence that the above factors are outcomes of the recession.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the increase in demand for funding for child-care places. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The trend of reduced incomes of families using child care and the increased utilisation of family day care could be direct effects of recession.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the Government's own department talking; it is not the Opposition being a carping critic. It is the Government's own department explaining why it has to keep going back to the taxpayer for more and more money to cope with the consequences of the recession that this Government proudly states it engineered. The documents go on:</PARA>
<PARA>Labour market figures demonstrate that workers are losing overtime and the rate of part-time employment is increasing. These changing work patterns mean reduced family income through loss of overtime or hours of employment, but often without a corresponding reduction in hours of child care needed. As the Fee Relief entitlement is dependent on family income, that is, entitlement is higher for lower levels of income, a fall in family income will result in higher Fee Relief payments by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what is happening now. It is one of those continuing and broadening consequences of economic incompetence, and it will either be seen next Tuesday night in a substantial increase in required government spending to meet these programs of assistance or be met by cuts in assistance. It will be interesting to find out which of these two options the Government follows. All we know is that there is already evidence of substantially mounting demand for the services that the Government must fund under its present programs to assist those people who are, it appears, very vulnerable to the consequences of the Government's own incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> This is only one of the many programs-I pointed some out yesterday when this matter was before the chamber-that now require, because of the massive increases in demand, substantial financial support if they are to continue. Austudy required in the month of June alone an extra $53m in the Advance to the Minister for Finance to meet its requirements. Austudy is used to provide funding for young people who would otherwise be joining the dole queues. The number of people who have disappeared out of the labour force figures and have been funded by Austudy to go back to school to a large extent indicates something like a 44 per cent youth unemployment rate-that is, taking into account people who would otherwise be looking unsuccessfully for full time work. As it is, the unemployment rate for young people under 20 looking for full time work is a horrendous 28.5 per cent, certainly far worse than in the recession of 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish on the note of funding pressures that emerge from recession. The national income figures today clearly reveal how different this recession is from the 1982-83 recession. The national income figures reveal that it was a fall in farm incomes that pushed down the economy in 1982-83, whereas this time farm incomes have actually been increasing over the period of the recession while the rest of the economy has collapsed. Those national income figures today certainly show how dramatic and dangerous the level of economic activity is now in Australia and how severe the fall has been-a fall generated by the Government as against the drought pushed and world stimulated recession of 1982-83, which the Government continually points to. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>

<PARA> (b) regrets that Soviet troops remain in occupation of important installations in the Baltic States, including the Vilnius television station seized by force in January 1991, and urges that these troops be withdrawn;</PARA>

<PARA> (d) urges the Australian Government to support Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in their continuing quest to regain their freedom and independence. </PARA>
<PARA>I raise again the issue of the Baltic states because I think it is important for this Parliament to demonstrate support for Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in their continuing struggle for freedom and independence. Regrettably, as we have outlined in the terms of this motion, since the Senate last met they have experienced once again the tragedy of violence. The violence, unfortunately, follows a continuing pattern. </PARA>
<PARA> In this instance, it was on 31 July that a Lithuanian border post was attacked and seven border guards and police were killed. Although the attackers are unknown, the Lithuanians have accused the internal security force, Omon-or the black berets-of being responsible. President Gorbachev has said that he regretted the killings and has promised that they will be investigated. But, as I said, the attacks are part of an ongoing struggle between Soviet authorities and each of the three Baltic states over the border posts. A number of posts have been forcibly dismantled by Soviet forces over the last six months. </PARA>
<PARA> When we last debated the situation of the Baltic states in their struggle for freedom, we made reference to the 13 unarmed Lithuanians who were killed when opposing the illegal seizure of the television station. Later, five people were killed, again when the special police unit, Omon, otherwise known as the black berets, stormed the headquarters of the Latvian interior ministry. There is no doubt that these actions are designed to terrorise the peoples of the three states and to force them back into submission. The black berets have repeatedly carried out attacks on border posts in each of the three republics, and tonight I have detailed only some of the killings that have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> In June, Soviet troops again set up check points in Vilnius and were arresting people. It is no coincidence that these check points tend to be concentrated around the centre of democracy in Vilnius, that is, the Lithuanian parliament building. In the earlier instance, the Soviet Government attempted to avoid responsibility for these events. The Soviet prosecutor, for instance, attempted to blame the Lithuanians themselves for the deaths in Vilnius, a view which was flatly contradicted by credible eyewitness accounts of those events. </PARA>
<PARA> In other statements, the Soviet Government suggested that its troops were acting on their own initiative. The Soviet Government, and in particular the President of the Soviet Union, must take responsibility for the actions of Soviet troops. It is an inadequate excuse to claim that when armed forces terrorise people they are acting on their own initiative. When President Gorbachev received the Nobel Prize he claimed that world peace depended on the success of perestroika and, therefore, the West must support his program. He argued that perestroika could be successful only under a strong central leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> President Gorbachev must understand that he cannot hope to establish a stronger system without making it more just. A fair and just state cannot be built on the denial of the rightful independence of the Baltic peoples or of the desires of the peoples of the Soviet Union. What should the West generally and Australia, in particular, be doing to help the Baltic peoples in their continuing quest for freedom?</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that Australia could be doing a lot that it is not presently doing. One issue is the provision of aid to the Soviet Union. We know that President Gorbachev has been seeking significant aid from the West. It is the opinion of those on this side of the chamber that the West should not provide aid for any program designed simply to strengthen the Soviet state without fundamental democratic reform. In our opinion no true peace can be built on the basis of a stronger Soviet state which continues to deny its various peoples their fundamental rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has some influence through the newly established bank-the European Bank for Reconstruction, I think it is called. We are yet to hear from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) as to what is Australia's position in relation to foreign aid to the Soviet Union whilst it does not permit the basic reforms that are necessary to allow freedom for its own people. As I understand that the Minister is not participating, perhaps his spokesman in this debate will let us know the Australian Government's position on that particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The US Secretary of State, James Baker, recently made clear that aid for the Soviet Union would not be forthcoming unless, among other things, the aspirations of the Baltic peoples for independence were peacefully resolved. In early June the British Prime Minister, Mr Major, also affirmed that Western aid for the Soviet Union would depend on a recognition of the human rights and an acceptance of the right of self-determination of the peoples of the Baltic states. There is a precedent being set by other Western nations. We on this side of the chamber want to know the position of the Australian Government and we would urge that it not be party to aid to the Soviet Union whilst the Soviet Union opposes freedom for the Baltic peoples. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, compared with some issues, the voice of the Australian Government on this issue of fundamental freedom has really been quite muted. Following Lithuania's declaration reaffirming its independence, the Government issued a statement acknowledging the resolution and calling for negotiations. Later, after the unprovoked killings in Vilnius and Riga, the Government issued a statement urging:</PARA>
<PARA>The many complex legal, political and economic issues involved . . . not be resolved at the expense of the progress thus far achieved in the area of human rights and democratic reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very soft statement in view of the violence that was being exerted upon the Baltic peoples. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply draw to the Government's attention for its consideration the fact that these mild statements contrast poorly with the Government's sentiments on questions such as political reform in South Africa-an issue upon which Australia has been outspoken. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) was even reluctant to use the word independence in relation to the Baltic states. I hope that attitude has now passed and that his spokesman in this debate will make it absolutely clear that, in the view of the Australian Government, the Baltic peoples are entitled to their independence and that they should have it now, not later. The issues of stability in the Soviet Union and so forth will not be advanced by going soft on the issue of independence for the Baltic peoples. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make it clear that this attitude expressed by the Australian Government is in contrast with the view that we have vigorously maintained. I will quote the words of my own leader on this subject, Dr Hewson. He made his position absolutely clear in a recent media release when he said that the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>should take a lead in strongly pressing the Soviet Union, both in its own right and in conjunction with other governments, as well as in the United Nations and other appropriate international forums, to end its illegal occupation of the Baltic states and restore their legitimate independence and sovereignty.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition believes that the Government can take a number of other steps in support of independence for the Baltic states. It can actively pursue this issue in the United Nations General Assembly and in the United Nations Human Rights Commission because the Soviet Union is clearly in breach of very fundamental human rights in its behaviour in relation to the Baltic peoples. This would give maximum publicity to the rights of the peoples of the Baltic states and considerably increase pressure upon the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government can and should direct its embassy in Moscow to increase substantially its direct contact with officials of the Baltic republics. This will both underline Australia's view that these officials are legitimately elected representatives of their nations and send a message to the Soviet Government. This course of action has already been pursued by a number of other Western governments. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, during his visit to the Soviet Union earlier this year, John Major made a point of meeting with some of the elected leaders of the Baltic republics. On a lower level, Canadian and American diplomats were sent to the Baltic states to observe the referendums there and have been active in reporting on Soviet attempts to intimidate the elected governments. The Australian Government could be initiating similar action but to date it has not. I would invite it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government could also help by inviting government spokespersons from the Baltic states to enable them to present their case to the Australian people. As we know, the Hawke Government has been quite generous in providing this sort of support to groups struggling for self-determination in the Pacific and in South Africa. Why not apply it also to those struggling for freedom in the Baltic region? Unlike many of the figures that the Government has previously invited, the representatives of the Baltic republics have at least been chosen democratically. </PARA>
<PARA> A further possibility that should be explored by the Government is the awarding of training scholarships to the three republics. Training courses can provide valuable assistance for states struggling to establish functioning democratic administrations after 50 years of crushing bureaucratic rule. Australia has provided this assistance to other states which are coming out of periods of oppression or which have not had the opportunity to develop democratic institutions. If we are prepared to offer such assistance to others, why not also to the Baltic states? I draw that suggestion to the attention of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government could also contribute to the establishment of the economic independence of the Baltic states by further fostering trade ties, something that the Government's spokespeople have put to it. There is no better way in which the democratic institutions of the Baltic states can be supported than by developing their economies and their independence from the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> In this brief contribution, I have attempted to set out a number of initiatives that the Australian Government could take in support of these people if it were really prepared to act rather than simply mouth reasonable sounding sentiments from time to time. These people need action in support of their fledgling democracies, in support of their quest for freedom and independence, not just simply rhetoric. I raise this issue again because these people need Australia's support and the support of the whole free world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we note and deplore the violence that is continuing as these people go forth in their quest for freedom. It is even more important that we look for ways in which we can constructively support them in their very reasonable aspirations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the motion that the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) has put before the Senate this evening. A great many of the remarks that he has made will enjoy very broad support around the chamber, including from the Government side. I will take issue with one or two points which he made in the course of his contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are witnessing an utter tragedy in the Baltic states at the moment. That is recognised not only here in Australia but also by international opinion. It is not possible, of course, to look at the Baltic republics without looking at the history of Europe over the past half century. I refer in particular to the infamous Ribbentrop-Molotov pact of 1939 in which Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia divided eastern Europe between the two dictatorships. That effectively meant the destruction of Poland and the illegal incorporation by the USSR of the three Baltic states within its borders, and a war between the USSR and Finland. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in the Baltic republics of violence, contrived disorder, intimidation and tension cannot be divorced from the current situation in the Soviet Union overall. At this point I make specific mention of negotiations towards the conclusion of a new Union treaty. Amongst the various republics that currently make up the USSR, all three Baltic republics have indicated to date that they are not prepared to sign the new Union treaty. Negotiations are under way on the basis of a new political and economic relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> With all that perestroika has brought in terms of reductions in international tensions and all the opportunities it has brought for the betterment of mankind, within the Soviet Union itself grave problems have arisen. This is recognised by people in Moscow as much as it is recognised beyond the borders of the Soviet state. </PARA>
<PARA> The nationalities question has arisen within the USSR in any number of regions. There have been declarations of independence in republics as different as the Baltic states and Georgia. That has resulted in a certain fragmentation within the USSR, and accordingly there have been great tensions within that country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind that the nationalism that has been expressed in the Baltic states ought to be regarded as entirely legitimate. There is no question about the degree of popular support for independence movements in those countries. There is no doubt about the degree of popular support for the economic nationalism that is being expressed, for people to be able to determine their own economic future as well as their own political form of government. There is no doubt either that, overwhelmingly, efforts have been directed at a peaceful transition from a circumstance where the republics have been integral parts of the USSR to a circumstance where they can regain their independence, that short-lived state that existed prior to the onset of the Second World War. There is no doubt also that they have elected representative parliaments broadly reflecting opinion in the three states. </PARA>
<PARA> Here I take issue with Senator Hill, although I say again that I can agree without hesitation to much of his contribution this evening. I turn to the position of the Australian Government, which was perhaps best outlined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, in the Parliament on 9 May 1990 in answer to a question from my colleague Senator Colston. Senator Colston referred to the declarations of independence by the Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, asking:</PARA>
<PARA>Would the Minister outline what the Australian Government's position is in relation to those declarations?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has already recognised for many years the legal right of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to exist as independent states. Like many other Western governments, we have refused to accept in international law their incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940 rejecting the self-proclaimed Soviet sovereignty over them. The Government believes that the recent declarations of independence by their freely elected Parliaments do reflect the aspirations of the Baltic peoples to achieve economic and political independence through peaceful and democratic means. Equally, we do fully appreciate that it is the unprecedented process of reform in the Soviet Union which has made it possible for the newly elected Baltic parliaments to express these aspirations. We urge-I take this opportunity to do so again-the Soviet Government to respect those declarations and to refrain from actions inimical to the interests of the parties concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>I might add that there could not be a clearer expression of opinion on the part of the Government in relation to the independence declarations of the three Baltic states or a clearer expression of view for the Soviet Government as to the nature of the position taken by the Australian Government on this important matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the Baltic states of recent times has been that they were caught in a terrible tide of war between fascism and Stalinism. It was a history of tragedy during the 1940s under the occupation forces of the Nazis; a history of suffering. There were very brave partisan movements formed which fought against the Nazis. It was a period of repression. That repression followed hard upon the heels of a period of very real suffering at the hands of the Soviet authorities under Joseph Stalin. I point out that, only a week before the outbreak of the Second World War on the eastern front, only a week before Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941-to be specific, on 14 June 1941-widespread deportations commenced in the three Baltic states which resulted in some 600,000 deaths of people from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. It was a terribly tragic period. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill has made reference to the Soviet security forces. I agree with his assessment of the nature of the attacks being made by the black beret forces, the Omon forces. It is also instructive to note that the Soviet Government has deployed paratroops in some parts of the Baltic states. The Soviet paratroops are the most ideologically aligned forces in the Soviet military; they are also elite forces. It seems strange that in a circumstance such as this the Interior Ministry troops were not those dispatched to maintain order. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt at the moment that Defence Minister Yazov is loyal to the President of the Soviet Union, Mr Gorbachev, but given some of the remarks which have been made in the Congress of People's Deputies by those who are aligned with the Soyuz group, with the military group in the Soviet Parliament-and I refer particularly to Colonel Alksnis and Colonel Petrushenko-there is a real danger of certain elements of the Soviet military getting out of control. Colonel Petrushenko, of course, is most famous for telling the New York Times in the earlier part of this year that a military coup in the Soviet Union would be totally unnecessary because eventually the politicians would simply hand over power to the army. That was a truly chilling statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge of perestroika for the international community has been met on a number of counts and in a number of political circumstances in terms of reduction of tensions, in terms of opening doors to greater economic cooperation and in terms of negotiations on arms control. As I said earlier, perestroika brings with it certain dangers in regard to the Baltic states and also in regard to Yugoslavia, about which I will say a little more later this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> The real test of perestroika now is achieving the successful conclusion of a new treaty on matters affecting the Soviet Union with the republics of the USSR, and enabling the Baltic states to determine their own political and economic destiny, free of interference, intimidation and the kind of attacks that we have seen recently on the border posts. President Gorbachev has said that the matters will be investigated. He has promised that no less a body than the KGB will investigate these matters. That is a real test for the Soviet security services. The people concerned with this violence must be brought to book; they must be brought to account. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet leadership talks about changing the country from a situation of unfettered central authority to a circumstance where the rule of law prevails. A very good place to start would be in the Baltic republics. That is a challenge which faces the Soviet authorities tonight, as it is a challenge which faces our Parliament in terms of an appropriate Australian response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The killing of seven Lithuanian border guards on 31 July this year certainly represents a disturbing development in the Soviet Union; we believe that the Soviet Union's handling of this appalling incident deserves to be condemned. One of the most remarkable features of this border incident was that it took place on the eve of the visit to the Soviet Union by the President of the United States to discuss aid and a number of other issues of international significance. This highlights what little regard those who murdered the seven Lithuanian guards have for international opinion in relation to independence for the Baltic states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must admit that we in the Australian Democrats remain a little disappointed that during his visit to the Soviet Union Mr Bush failed to press the Soviet Government on the matter of the killings. According to some of the media reports on the visit, the President of the United States was far more concerned not to raise any matter which would stand in the way of a strategic arms agreement with the Soviet Union or, indeed, any issue at all that might cause his Soviet hosts some discomfort. Remarkably, at one point during his visit Mr Bush went so far as to advise the independently minded republic of the Ukraine to also desist from any efforts aimed at achieving independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that all democratic nations should provide strong support to the peoples of the Baltic states. After all, it is they who in their long and determined struggle for independence have suffered so much in the last 50 years and who, by these recent murders, continue to endure an unacceptable level of grief. We believe that this Parliament has a moral responsibility to share with the Lithuanian people the grief which they are currently suffering and to do all in our capacity to help them to achieve their goals. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators will undoubtedly recall, the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian people all expressed their unequivocal support for independence when referendums were held in all three states in February and March of this year. The referendum results in these republics revealed an overwhelming desire by the Baltic peoples to achieve the independence which is rightfully theirs. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Lithuanian republic, for instance, more than 90 per cent of the population voted for independence, which means that a significant proportion of the non-Lithuanian population of that republic also supports the idea of an independent Baltic state. The Soviet authorities initially claimed that the Russian minority in the Baltic states feels persecuted and needs to be defended by Russian troops against the nationalists who are now in control. Clearly, this is not the case. More recently, the Soviet authorities have enforced economic sanctions against Lithuania in particular and, as the Senate is aware, the Soviet military has also been sent in and now occupies key installations around the breakaway republic, such as the television station in the capital, Vilnius. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest threat being carried out by the Soviet authorities is in connection with the draft union treaty which the Soviet President has drawn up and which all Soviet republics have been asked to sign. We understand that six of the Soviet republics have so far refused to sign the treaty-Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia as well as Armenia, Georgia and Moldavia. All six of these states face the threat of stiff economic sanctions if they do not sign the draft treaty. Such threats are totally unacceptable. We condemn the Soviet Union's dogmatic stance in dealing with independently minded republics. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe it is more than appropriate that the Australian Parliament and our Government call upon the Soviet Union, in the strongest terms possible, to respect the rights of the Baltic states-this is particularly important as it reflects the wishes of the Baltic peoples, as expressed in their elections-and to finally and totally acknowledge the independence that rightfully belongs to the Baltic states. We must recognise here again that the Baltic states are seeking to do no more than to restore their own independence. </PARA>
<PARA> Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have all been illegally suppressed for more than 50 years in a union which has never been sanctioned by the peoples of these three tiny republics. As the Senate has been reminded today, the three Baltic states were never asked for their opinions on unification. It was forced upon them against their wishes by the notorious Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939. </PARA>
<PARA> Remarkably, the Soviet Union's own congress of people's deputies has itself now recognised that the 1940 annexation of the Baltic republics was illegal and invalid. In this context, we believe that the Australian Government should be using every available opportunity to provide strong support to the Baltic republics and to call upon the Soviet Government to recognise their independence. Iceland has done so, and the Government of Denmark has recently exchanged letters of recognition with the Lithuanian Government. The Baltic republics have a right to independence. They have expressed their desire for it and we, as representatives of the Australian people, should show our solidarity with their cause. The Australian Democrats commend Senator Hill for moving his motion and we will be supporting it tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion moved by Senator Hill is one which will attract unanimous support in this chamber although, to my way of thinking, it does not go far enough. Originally, the motion was a proposal which focused on the killing of seven border guards on 31 July 1991. Obviously, the debate has ranged far broader than that, and it is not my intention tonight to canvass all of those matters that have been raised by my parliamentary colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first part of the motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate . . . condemns the 31 July 1991 attack on a Lithuanian border post and the killings of seven border guards during that attack and calls upon the Government of the Soviet Union to vigorously investigate this incident and prosecute those responsible for these deaths.</PARA>
<PARA>It appears, from the material that I have seen, that not only is the Soviet Union not vigorously investigating the incident, but it is also making excuses. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with what was stated by the Soviet Union at the time. The Soviet Union denied that it was involved. The response to that by the Lithuanians was as follows-and I quote what President Landsbergis said about the official denials by the USSR Defence Ministry, the KGB and the Interior Ministry of involvement in the murder of the seven border guards at Medininkai. President Landsbergis said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . since these departments-</PARA>
<PARA>that is to say, the Defence Ministry, the KGB and the Interior Ministry-</PARA>
<PARA>concealed the perpetrators of the murders of innocent victims in Vilnius in January of 1991, and intentionally circulated lies and disinformation, their present statement concerning Medininkai cannot be fully trusted. </PARA>
<PARA>I admire the Lithuanians for not overstating things. Here is President Landsbergis making the understatement that those departments `cannot be fully trusted'. Of course they cannot be fully trusted. Their record does not give one confidence to trust them. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bourne mentioned the apparent weakness of President Bush when he was in Moscow at the time of these killings. I, too, was concerned about that apparent weakness. It now appears that President Bush has tightened his approach. In a letter written to Prime Minister Vagnorius of Lithuania, President Bush makes it rather clear that he is linking these killings with the ones that occurred in January and also with the Soviet opposition to the legitimate aspirations of Lithuanians for their independence. </PARA>
<PARA> President Bush in responding to Prime Minister Vagnorius's letter of 31 July said that he was `appalled and sickened by this senseless act of violence'. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>Actions of this kind can only set back the process of peaceful dialogue that is the only viable avenue toward fulfilling the legitimate aspirations of the Lithuanian people. </PARA>
<PARA>After he conveyed sympathy, he said this:</PARA>
<PARA>Soviet authorities-including President Gorbachev-have expressed their commitment to assisting the Lithuanian Government in investigating this crime and bringing the perpetrators to justice. As I have said previously, a situation has been created in the Baltic states that itself leads to violence, and that situation must be changed. We will continue to press the Soviet Government to exercise control over the actions of its forces in the Baltic states and to make clear our belief that Moscow is ultimately responsible for acts committed by its personnel. </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to be at least a belated change on the part of the President. But clearly more is required. Before I get to what I mean by that, I make the point that the Lithuanian Government commission of inquiry, which was appointed in the aftermath of the killings, asserted in a public statement on 8 August that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . representatives of the USSR Procuracy and the USSR Internal Affairs Ministry do not provide any concrete aid to the law enforcement institutions of the Republic of Lithuania, do not fulfil many assignments, and hamper and disrupt the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion is asking that the Soviet Union vigorously investigate this incident and prosecute those responsible for the deaths. It is apparent that up until now the Soviet Union has not been doing that and, indeed, according to the commission that was established by the Lithuanians themselves, certain arms of the Soviet Government are hampering and disrupting the investigation. That is unfortunate because everyone in this chamber desires a peaceful situation which would enable the legitimate aspirations of the Baltic states and those of the people of Russia to be recognised and allowed to flower so that peace, security and development can proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is: how can we in Australia and nations with whom we have close relationships assist in this process? Honourable senators who spoke prior to me gave some examples of how this can be done. We know that the Soviet Union needs technology transfers, money and assistance in order to develop and overcome the problems that have been caused by the imposition of the communist state. Clearly, a message should be given to the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> But more than that, I believe the one thing that will truly show the Soviet Union that we are fair dinkum is to give diplomatic recognition to the states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and nominate an ambassador to those countries. If we took the lead and did that and if others then followed, clearly that would be an undeniable message that the process of democratic reform in these countries is irreversible-that the process of true freedom in these countries is irreversible. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that this year I moved a notice of motion which calls upon the Senate to note:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) that 50 years ago whilst the West was preoccupied with dictator Adolf Hitler, the Soviet Army invaded Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that last year, after years of Soviet imposed terror, forced exile and gross violation of human rights, the seven million people in these countries freely elected their own governments and parliaments, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that today, whilst the West is preoccupied with dictator Saddam Hussein, the Soviet Army is again attempting to subjugate the Baltic States;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) ongratulates the people of the Baltic States for their courageous stand for democracy and human rights and the restoration of their national independence;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) calls on the Australian Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) immediately recognise and establish diplomatic relations with the new, democratically elected Governments of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and nominate an ambassador to those countries,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) strongly condemn the recent atrocities perpetrated against the Baltic States for their stand for democracy, human rights and self-determination,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) demand that all Soviet troops and the KGB be immediately withdrawn from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) take a leading role with other democratic nations to provide practical assistance to the peoples of the Baltic States and to raise their right to self-determination at the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>It is my view that we must act urgently, that the Federal Government must take action. It has gone some way, but it must start taking the initiative. It appears that it has not gone beyond what other nations with whom we have close trading and other relationships have done. We are not necessarily tied to what these other Western nations do. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of what has occurred in the Baltic states, and in view of the responsibilities that we have to the peoples in those countries and also to the many Australians of Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian descent, we have the responsibility, I believe, to take the lead. I am calling for Australia to recognise and establish diplomatic relations with the democratically elected governments of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. My motion, of course, is not up for debate at this juncture; the motion of Senator Hill is before us. I am supporting that motion and I hope that it is unanimously adopted by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to speak briefly to Senator Hill's motion and in very strong support of it, particularly the final clause, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . urges the Australian Government to support Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in their continuing quest to regain their freedom and independence. </PARA>
<PARA>I fully support the remarks of my leader, Senator Hill, and of the other speakers who have participated in the debate, in particular, my friend and colleague Senator Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA> We are considering a very important matter. The peoples of the Baltic nations are small in number. The total population of the three nations-Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia-is only of the order of 8 1/2 million people in a world approaching five billion people. But the way in which those people have, with great integrity and dignity, fought for the restoration of their legitimate freedom and sovereignty over a period of 50 years is to me a great example to the rest of the world and a very important example to us in the free world. </PARA>
<PARA> I visited the Baltic nations two years ago after having many years of association with the peoples from those nations in Australia. That visit had a lasting impact on me and I came to appreciate, even more than I had before, the courage and indomitable spirit that those peoples have exerted and shown in fighting for the very things that we in this country take for granted-the whole basis of democracy, freedom and liberty, the right of free speech and so on-which they have never had and which is rightly theirs. </PARA>
<PARA> What this debate around the world is all about is no more than the restoration of the legal, legitimate independence that was usurped from the peoples of the Baltic nations through the infamous, secretive Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 23 August 1939, which is within a week of being 52 years ago. I will not go into the history of that pact because it is well known to members of the Senate and I am sure it is now known throughout Australia. However, that pact led to the mass deportation and murder of Baltic peoples commencing in June 1940 which, in turn, led to the loss of life and/or the disappearance of more than 600,000 people, or more than 10 per cent of the population of the combined nations of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Since then those nations have experienced 50 years of illegal, frequently brutal, subjugation; Russification; denial of basic human rights and freedoms; inability to exhibit any of their own national characteristics; and inability to follow their own cultural heritage-all the things that we in Australia take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> I have similar views to Senator Harradine concerning the attitude of the United States in this matter. I say this with some sadness because I am a strong supporter of most of the international efforts of the US and I support it in its aspirations, at the end of the day, for the Baltic states. But I share Senator Harradine's view that more should be being done by the United States in particular to give leadership in supporting the cause of the Baltic peoples. I am also concerned about the bottom line attitude of the Soviet Union, and in particular President Gorbachev, on this matter. I have always believed, perhaps hopefully, that his aspirations for the Baltic states are the same as those of the Western world and most other freedom and peace-loving nations-namely, in the end, independence for those nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The actions of the Soviets were under what appeared to be the cloak of the Gulf War. Taking actions of a quite brutal nature in Lithuania around the turn of the last year-1990 moving into 1991-is a matter of considerable concern. I do not think that the actions of the Soviet Union and President Gorbachev since then have assuaged the doubts and concerns that I had at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very real need for the West to take a stronger leadership role in this matter. Within the West there is a very strong obligation on our nation to be up-front for the sort of reasons that others in this debate have expressed. We have in Australia a community of peoples whose countries of origin were the nations of the Baltic states. These people have been tremendous Australians. Some of them now occupy leading positions in Australian business and society. All of them have been a great attribute and have made a great contribution to Australia over the last 30 or 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Australia does have an obligation to our Australian Baltic communities, and through them to their countries of origin, to do as much as we possibly can to see that the Baltic nations have restored to them what is nothing more than their legitimate sovereignty and independence which they had until it was illegally usurped in 1939-40. As I said earlier, in those 50 years they have been subjugated to an illegality that should never have occurred. So we are simply asking for the restoration of sovereignty and independence that should always have rightly been theirs. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I have great pleasure in supporting Senator Hill's motion-as I am sure the whole Senate and the overwhelming majority of Australian people do-and, in particular, that part of the motion urging the Australian Government to support Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in their continuing quest to regain their freedom and independence. My only remaining hope is that that legitimate aspiration be achieved as soon as possible because those people of the Baltic nations should expect nothing less. </PARA>

<PARA>There is no doubt that this year, 1991, has been a very significant one in the struggle for freedom in the Baltic states. As with all struggles for just causes, there is a tendency for violence to erupt, for passions to be aroused and, regrettably, for there to be deaths. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that those who died at the border post on 31 July will be seen, and quite properly, by their compatriots as martyrs to a cause. I know that the Opposition will support me. All I can hope for in this struggle is that there is no need for further martyrs to this cause and that the cause will be triumphant. I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting Senator Hill's motion urging the Australian Government to support Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in their continuing quest to regain their freedom and independence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address briefly the matters raised by Senator Hill's motion. There are a number of matters which are common to the Baltic states-Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania-and the states which currently comprise, under a degree of obvious compulsion, the country of Yugoslavia-Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The United Nations Charter on Human Rights guarantees the independence of people, in contrast to the independence of nations which was guaranteed by the Charter of the League of Nations. I think we have entered an age not only in Europe but the world over where people are now claiming their sovereignty, in a personal sense and in their communities. </PARA>
<PARA> Having recently visited the countries of Eastern Europe-in fact, I returned after 40 years-I became conscious of the strength of their will to have self-determination, their cultural and national identities guaranteed and their future determined. </PARA>
<PARA> Several questions arise from the tragic situation in Slovenia and Croatia and the no less tragic situation in the Baltic states. In the face of plebiscites, which show that it is the will of more than 90 per cent of the people to be independent, why does the Government hesitate to recognise these aspirations? Why does it not take the next step, the obvious step, and recognise those communities as independent nations?</PARA>
<PARA> In Europe, the feeling is growing that, in time, there will be a united Europe that will include those countries. There is no reason-I have been told this by a number of representatives from various governments-why communities based on regions rather than nations, as they are now constituted, could not become members of the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, it is clear that the Government must catch up with the prevailing mood, with the national aspirations of people in Eastern Europe and recognise these countries. It is obviously necessary to send an international observer team to Croatia in the immediate future and, even before that, to send humanitarian aid to relieve the suffering in that country. However, I leave this question with the Government: why has there been hesitation in refusing to recognise the justified aspirations of these people?</PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) deplores the violence, loss of life and destruction of property that has taken place in Slovenia and Croatia, where more than 300 civilians are reported to have been killed, largely as a result of the attacks of terrorists supplied by the communist led Federal Army and attacks by the Army itself;</PARA>

<PARA> (e) further calls upon the Australian Government to recall its Ambassador to Yugoslavia for consultations on how Australia might, consistent with a desire to preserve peace, support the newly evolving independent states, including the most appropriate time to give diplomatic recognition. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that Yugoslavia is breaking up. It is equally clear that it cannot be held together at the point of a gun and, in my opinion and the opinion of my colleagues, the international community should vigorously oppose any attempt to do so. It is easy to understand the initial reaction of the United States and some European states some months ago to seek the continuation of Yugoslavia out of a fear that the break-up would not resolve the ethnic and religious differences, and of course also a fear of a violent transition. But not even superpowers can today hold together these artificial states if the separate nations which comprise such states desire otherwise. It is clear from the referendums and the declarations that the Slovenian and Croatian peoples wish to exist in independent states. In our opinion, we should therefore understand, respect and support that reasonable aspiration. </PARA>
<PARA> As we now know, Macedonia will also hold a plebiscite on independence on 8 September and the President of Bosnia-Herzegovina has now ordered a plebiscite to decide the future of that republic. All around Yugoslavia decisions are now being made about whether individual component republics will continue to seek a future in the form of independent sovereign states. As I said, we know that two-Slovenia and Croatia-have already made that decision, although the declarations of independence may have been suspended for three months. </PARA>
<PARA> We are unsure of the picture in Serbia. We are aware of the aspirations for a greater Serbia claimed by Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, but that seems to be breaking up, particularly if it seems that Bosnia-Herzegovina is going to move in a different direction. There is a highly complicated situation in Bosnia itself, because over 40 per cent of its population is Muslim, with just under 30 per cent being Serbian and 18 per cent Croatian. Although there has been speculation for some time that there might be a move to divide it in some way between Croatia and Serbia, it looks as though the people in Bosnia themselves are taking action to ensure that does not happen. However, whether its diverse communities are going to accept that it continues as one sovereign state is something that they will have to decide themselves and it will be a difficult issue for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course there is also the complication that Albanian people, particularly in the province of Kosovo, are again looking to restore the autonomy they enjoyed until last year. We are all aware of the human rights abuses that have occurred and have been perpetrated on them, but it is unclear also as to what they are going to seek for the future. Whether that part can be taken out of Serbia is something that obviously still has to be determined. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that it is also unclear what the borders of these new states will be. That raises difficult issues such as that of the Serbian villages within Croatia, but it seems to me that it is impossible to carve up Yugoslavia purely on ethnic lines alone because whatever the boundaries of the new states might be, there will always be minorities and states will have the responsibility to protect the interests of those minorities. Of course the international community also has a responsibility to protect the interests of minorities, something it has been prepared to support elsewhere with varying degrees of enthusiasm. I suppose the most recent example is the modest efforts taken by the international community to protect the interests of the Kurdish minority in Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been distressed by the violence that has occurred and we condemn it. We condemn the early role taken by the federal Yugoslav army, which has been referred to in this motion, when it was ordered into action in both Slovenia and Croatia. </PARA>
<PARA> We commend all those people who are trying to facilitate a peaceful transition to whatever the new structures for Yugoslavia might be. I mention particularly the continuing efforts of the European Community. It has been able to negotiate a cease-fire of sorts, although, sadly, individuals are still being killed, but at least it has been able to hold off war whilst the complex negotiations can take place between the Yugoslav republics as to exactly what form they wish for their future. Clearly, war between the Croats and the Serbs would be a tragedy and a contradiction of all that was envisaged in the new world order. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that this new world order is much more complex than some envisaged, but once the pressure cooker lid of communism was lifted from these states so that the nationalities within them had a reasonable opportunity to express their aspirations for the future it was inevitable that, in the case of Croatia and, to some extent, the Soviet Union, different nationalities would see their futures in independent terms. I for one do not see that that is something that should particularly concern the international community. It provides a new challenge for the international community, but it simply means that, consistent with its desires, the international community has to find ways to accommodate these new states. There is no doubt that Europe will do that. In the case of Slovenia, it already has well developed economic relations with Austria. There is no doubt that an independent Croatia would be readily absorbed within the European Community as well. Obviously, there will be difficulties, but they are simply challenges that have to be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise the changes that are occurring within this highly complex situation, but we do say that the Australian Government must address them, as any other international government must, and look for ways in which it can be supportive, and it should be realistic. So far-again, consistent, I regret to say, with the previous motion that we have just debated-apart from what might be described as some soothing rhetoric, the Australian Government has taken little action to either support the peaceful transition or to support what will be the reality of newly independent states. We say that it is now time that it faced up to its responsibility in that regard. It can do so by taking note of this motion-in particular that part of the motion which calls upon the Australian Government to support international efforts for a negotiated settlement between the republics, which will avoid conflict, of course, but will achieve the independence that the peoples of Croatia and Slovenia demand, and will help protect the interests of ethnic and religious minorities. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Government can now constructively take a step forward by recalling the Australian Ambassador to Yugoslavia for consultations on ways, consistent with our obvious desire to preserve peace, in which we can support the newly evolving independent states, including the most appropriate time to give diplomatic recognition to those states. That in itself, I readily acknowledge, is tricky because, although, as I said, the declarations were passed, they were suspended. During this period of cease-fire that the European Community leaders have been able to negotiate, the Yugoslav republics are to negotiate on their future form. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, it seems to us-certainly we would not wish to see Australia or any other of the international communities take action that might in some way inflame the difficulties-that there must be a correct time in which diplomatic recognition for these newly evolving independent states will facilitate that process of peaceful evolution rather than hinder it. At the moment I do not think the Australian Government is facing up to its responsibility in that regard, rather it is hoping that it does not have to make these decisions. It should be addressing these matters. A way in which it can start to do that is by getting our Ambassador back, getting the best information that it possibly can and starting to address the correct timing that can best facilitate a peaceful transition to the newly independent states. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore constructively produce this motion tonight after consultations. I particularly mention Senator Harradine, whose contribution in discussions has led to the strengthening of several parts of this motion, but strengthening in a way that we think is in the best interests of the various peoples of Yugoslavia, and will earn some respect for Australia and indicate to the very large Australian community of Yugoslav origin-from Yugoslavia in its various forms-that Australia is really interested and concerned about what is happening in its homeland and is anxious to take positive steps to facilitate and to contribute to the peaceful transition that is going to be necessary. I commend the motion in its amended form. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to contribute briefly to the debate on the proposition that Senator Hill has advanced this evening. As with the earlier proposition on the Baltic republics, it is not possible to view the circumstances in Yugoslavia without looking at the history of the region over the twentieth century. I refer in particular to the wartime agreements between Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin which governed Eastern Europe at the end of the war and which related to Hungary, Yugoslavia and Greece. It is a matter of fact that Churchill and Stalin agreed that in the state of Hungary in the postwar period the Soviet Union would have 75 per cent of the influence and the British 25 per cent; in Greece the figures would be reversed, with the British having 75 per cent of influence and the Soviets 25 per cent; and the two powers would share influence in Yugoslavia on a 50 : 50 basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also a matter of history that this was communicated between the two wartime leaders by way of Churchill noting this suggestion on a slip of paper at one of the conferences-Yalta, I believe-and passing it to Stalin, who glanced at it, ticked it with a blue pencil and passed it back to Churchill. We see in that agreement the beginnings of a number of the problems that are faced in Yugoslavia tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The circumstance in Yugoslavia at the moment is truly terrible. Security forces appear to be out of control. There is internal tension that spills over routinely into bloodshed. The Yugoslav federal army is seen as an arm of one of the participating nationalities. We have had indiscriminate attacks upon civilians. There has been communal violence. We have all the elements needed to turn Yugoslavia into a fragmented state. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of Yugoslavia, unfortunately, has been one that suggests that there was never a real unity, not since the country appeared at the conclusion of the First World War. There was for a time an imperial system which maintained a semblance of unity between the wars. In the postwar period the Tito Government maintained a certain unity through an authoritarian system, mild by Eastern European standards in a number of respects but nonetheless authoritarian. One element has united all the peoples of Yugoslavia, and that has been a determination to fight against the various invaders who have appeared upon their soil. I think it is instructive to note that in 1941, after the destruction of the modern Yugoslav state by Nazi Germany, the country was actually partitioned five ways-between Italian-occupied Albania, Germany, Hungary and Bulgaria, with some other territory being ceded to Italy.</PARA>
<PARA> That circumstance then led to a very bloody partisan war in which large numbers of the Yugoslav people died, and in which large numbers showed great courage. Here again, there were great divisions. Some Yugoslavs sided with the forces of occupation while most actively opposed, but Josip Tito emerged a wartime hero of great courage and stature. He enlarged upon that stature in the eyes of many people, not only in Yugoslavia but beyond, by being a great anti-Stalinist. One need only read Milovan Djilas's magnificent little book Conversations with Stalin to know how difficult that was at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tito system was very authoritarian internally. There is no question of that. Of course, that led to the great break-up with Djilas. The publication of Djilas's book The New Class about the Yugoslav bureaucracy, like the bureaucracy of Eastern Europe, led at one point to his fall from grace. By way of background, the death of Tito meant the gradual fragmentation of the post-war Yugoslav state to a situation where the federal presidency has become largely impotent and the different republics that make up the country war one with the other. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a real test here for the European Community, a real test for the Europeans, to act in concert-something which they have singly been unable to do. Of course, we have various positions occupied by different European powers. Spain and France with their own minority problems-the Basques and the Corsicans-favour a federalist Yugoslav state. Germany openly supports independence for Croatia and for Slovenia. Britain and the Netherlands look to the United States to act in concert with the Americans. There is talk of intervention. The Germans have great problems with the concept of intervention, given their constitution, and Ireland is a declared neutral country. It may be that European forces are peacekeeping forces only. I doubt that a European intervention is possible. An article in a recent edition of Newsweek stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The crisis in the Balkans represents a major test of Europe's willingness to sacrifice individual national interests to the cause of a stronger collective presence on the world scene. The EC's apparent effectiveness in July raised hopes that the Twelve might develop a true ``political union,'' including common foreign and defense policies, by the end of this year. But the collapse of European mediation efforts in Belgrade strengthened the sceptical view that Western Europe is nowhere near ready to ``speak with a single voice.''</PARA>
<PARA>That struck me as an accurate analysis of current European conduct, looking to reach a solution but unable to act in a unified manner. The Australian position was set out by Dr Blewett on 27 June when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government is closely monitoring events in Yugoslavia but we regard it as premature to be contemplating recognition for Croatia and Slovenia. At this stage the two republics do not meet fully the criteria for statehood under international law. </PARA>
<PARA> The proclamation of independence by Croatia and Slovenia on 25 June should be seen as the commencement of a process rather than its culmination. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Blewett's statement went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>While the two declarations follow plebiscites in which the people voted overwhelmingly in favour of breaking with the existing Yugoslav structure, both republics acknowledge that their declarations require further negotiations to bring them into full operation. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Blewett concluded his statement by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia will continue to follow the situation closely . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is why the Government will be unable to agree to the final point in Senator Hill's proposition. Withdrawing our ambassador at the current stage would be an act of futility. It would have nothing by way of diplomatic impact to recommend it. It would not add to our capacity to make our presence felt. It would deny the Australian Government a first-hand account of events. It would deny the Australian Government a first-hand capacity to intervene by way of counsel and it would achieve little, perhaps nothing at all. While there is little difficulty with the first four points of Senator Hill's revised proposition, the Government cannot accept the fifth point. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my brief remarks by saying that what is happening in Yugoslavia is a part of the process by which the map of Europe is being redrawn. Just as we saw the Baltic states exercising a legitimate nationalism, we see an outbreak of nationalism in Yugoslavia in no sense less legitimate than nationalist commitments elsewhere on the European continent. It is a real test for the European Community-one which it cannot fail. The Europeans are the most insular and selfcentred in their politics. They demonstrate that continually with their trade policies. If they fail the test in Yugoslavia, they cannot be taken seriously as a political entity with a common approach. This is not a test that the EC can afford to fail. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government's position was best set out by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in a news conference at Parliament House on 4 July in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We deeply hope that the relations between what had been the constituent parts of Yugoslavia will be able to be resolved peacefully. Of course as far as Australia is concerned if Slovenia and Croatia come to a point where they satisfy the requirements of independent statehood, then we would recognise them. But the important point to make, I believe, is the one I have, that we want to see these matters resolved peacefully and in an acceptable and orderly fashion. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, we are witnesses to a tragedy in Yugoslavia. The response of the Australian Government has been entirely appropriate in pressing for a peaceful solution. The response of the Australian Government has been entirely responsible in monitoring events very closely and very carefully. The community in Australia with its ethnic origin in the various parts of Yugoslavia is to be commended for the enormous restraint it has shown in the conduct of community relations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt at all that a tragedy of great proportions has been unfolding in recent weeks. Unfortunately, to date, the European Community has not been equal to the test. I have no doubt that over time the international community will be equal to the test in assisting in the arrival at a peaceful solution. The Australian Government's response has been entirely proper and appropriate in the circumstances. For those reasons, while the first four points of Senator Hill's proposition are eminently reasonable, the fifth point is not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the time remaining tonight for debate, I will keep my remarks fairly brief. I start by saying that we saw the final wording of this motion at only 10 minutes to 10 this evening. It is unfortunate that we did not have more prior notice than we did that it was going to be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Along with a great number of Australians, we have been profoundly disturbed by the events of recent months in Yugoslavia. As Senator Hill has mentioned, the whole world has been witness to an increasingly disturbing trend of vicious and brutal acts of violence in the republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats support the efforts of the European Community to find a peaceful settlement to the crisis in the Yugoslav republics. Certainly, it is now apparent that the various Yugoslav republics have gone beyond the step of turning back. They appear to be unable to reverse the situation and to restore calm themselves. There is no reason to assume that communists in Yugoslavia can defy the dominant political trend of the late twentieth century. Events in Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania and the Baltic states show that it is foolhardy for Yugoslavia's Federal Government to believe that it can avoid a similar fate. </PARA>
<PARA> The wishes of the Slovenians and Croatians have been unambiguously declared at the ballot-box. They are no less entitled to self-determination than any other group in Europe or elsewhere on the globe. The right to freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development is specifically proclaimed in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Whatever their wishes, it is gravely perilous for Yugoslavia's Federal Government to believe that the yearning of a large proportion of its peoples for self-determination and democracy can be indefinitely repressed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no more sure way of alienating Slovenians and Croatians than by turning the might of Yugoslavia's defence forces against them. The purpose of any country's defence force is to protect, not to kill or intimidate its citizens. The EC Ministers got it right when they said that the best place for Yugoslavia's army is in its barracks. That is why we support the European Community's efforts to find a resolution to the crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The European Community is clearly working on the basis that the Yugoslavs can be encouraged to sort out their own affairs if presented with the right mix of sticks and carrots. We understand that the European Community is presently considering a variety of military and diplomatic steps, including economic sanctions, to tackle this crisis. There now appears to be a faint glimmer of hope that growing violence and social and political disintegration in the Balkans may be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> We feel great sympathy for the hundreds of thousands of Australians with fears for the safety of family and friends in this troubled part of Europe. The Australian Government has a responsibility to the vast number of people with relatives and friends living in this volatile area. Obviously, there is a limit to what Australia can achieve to stop an all out war from breaking out. However, we believe that Australia must apply every possible influence to try to bring about a peaceful resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Politicians in Yugoslavia have failed their people badly. In recent years the people have endured great economic hardship. It is appalling to see now that they are facing death at the hands of aggressive and vindictive armed forces. The Democrats will be supporting this motion which Senator Hill has moved tonight in relation to Yugoslavia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too will try to be brief. I support the motion that Senator Hill has moved because I wish to represent the vast number of people, particularly those in Tasmania, of Croatian and Slovenian extraction who have contacted me, as they have contacted other members of parliament all over Australia. These people have a great concern for their friends and relatives in those states. I understand that some 500,000 Croatians and their families live in Australia. The Croatian and the Slovenian communities in Australia have been collecting money for medical supplies for their friends and families in those countries. I know that these people have a very deep love for their countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all have a love for our own country and our own States. I felt a little, perhaps, of what the people here are feeling about what is happening in Croatia and Slovenia when I read the article in the Canberra Times in which Ian Warden had a cheap shot at Senator Walters and Senator Harradine for continuing to come up here from Tasmania. It upset me when he referred to my State as `that miserable little island they come from'. That might be his opinion, but it is certainly not mine; that stirred my hackles. So I can understand how the people of Croatian and Slovenian extraction living in Australia must feel when they know that their homeland and their friends and families are being threatened. I can understand, when they read about their friends and relations being murdered, maimed and mutilated, just how concerned they must be. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Senator Hill's original motion has been changed, I do not believe that the part of the motion that calls on the Australian Government to support international efforts for a negotiated settlement between the Yugoslav republics goes far enough. I think that Australia should go further than just talking about this issue. The EC team, as Senator Loosley pointed out, has been effective to a degree. We saw how action by the UN resolved the Gulf crisis. If that sort of pressure were put on the Serbian communist regime I wonder whether it would withdraw. </PARA>
<PARA> When the three-month suspension of the declaration of independence expires, Australia should recognise Croatia and Slovenia as independent republics. Such recognition could lead to building up sufficient international support which may have the effect of stopping the Federal Government of Yugoslavia and the Serbians from continuing this senseless killing and mutilation. It has to stop. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that Australia has a fear of setting a precedent. In the past we have been fearful of that, and I can understand that. For instance, it would have been foolish to recognise Bougainville when it tried to separate from Papua New Guinea. We certainly did not recognise the insurgent movements in Sulawesi and Sumatra in 1957, but we did recognise Bangladesh when it seceded from Pakistan in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said tonight about Australia's position on the Baltic states. Senator Loosley referred to Senator Evans's statement in May 1990, but this case is different. An article written by Des Moore, a well-known political commentator, states:</PARA>
<PARA>The 1974 constitution of Yugoslavia provides specifically for the right of republics to withdraw from the federation, and overwhelming majorities in Croatia and Slovenia have recently voted in referendums for independence. Both republics have governments elected in free and democratic elections. The republics have their own administration structures, public services, armed forces and police enabling their governments to exercise effective control throughout their territories. They thus satisfy the essential criteria for diplomatic recognition. </PARA>
<PARA>The people have also shown their willingness to fight and die for independence. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>At this point in world history, continued dominance of the democracies in Slovenia and Croatia by a hardline Communist establishment in Serbia would clearly be an anachronism. </PARA>
<PARA>Many people argue that Croatia and Slovenia are small states. Croatia has a population of 4.8 million people; Slovenia has a population of 2 million people. There are sovereign states in Europe which have smaller populations, such as Iceland, Malta, Luxembourg, Cyprus and even Ireland. Mongolia, the country I visited last year, has a smaller population. </PARA>
<PARA> On 3 July, at the request of the Croatian community in Tasmania-and along with others around Australia-I wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) expressing my concerns. I still have not received a reply, of course; nevertheless, I made my views known. It is interesting to note that at a press conference on 4 July the Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA>If Slovenia and Croatia come to a point where they satisfy the requirements of independent statehood, then we would recognise them.</PARA>
<PARA>On 27 June, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government is closely monitoring events in Yugoslavia but we regard it as premature to be contemplating recognition for Croatia and Slovenia. At this stage the two republics do not meet fully the criteria for statehood under international law. </PARA>
<PARA>From those comments it seems that Australia has adopted the same sort of line as the Americans and is just marking time, waiting for good company. In the meantime, the Yugoslav Army, along with Serbs and Chetniks, are out to crush these fledgling states. If we took the lead and recognised Croatia and Slovenia, we could do it on a principle, that principle being that we should support the right to self-determination of two communities which have their own cultural identities and democratically elected governments and have voted for independence in a referendum so that they can join the free democratic society of western Europe.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish this evening to pay tribute to a former long serving member of the Federal Parliament and a most prominent and distinguished Territorian, John Norman Nelson, who died on 20 June 1991 in Alice Springs. Jock, as he was commonly known, lived most of his 83 years in the Northern Territory and was, without doubt, one of its all-time favourite sons and respected citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Jock Nelson served as the Territory's Federal Labor member of the House of Representatives from his election in 1949 to his retirement in 1966. Tonight I would like to place on record the appreciation of this Government and the Australian Labor Party of his long and distinguished service to the people of the Northern Territory and of Australia, both inside and outside parliament. I know that Senator Tambling will join me this evening and also pay his tribute to Jock Nelson. </PARA>
<PARA> A dedicated Labor man from a strong and dedicated Labor family, Jock held a staggering number of jobs in his lifetime, working as a jackeroo, a water boring contractor, a cattleman, a commission agent, a member of the armed services, a foundation member of the Northern Territory's Legislative Council, the Territory's Federal Labor member for 17 years, the first elected Mayor of Alice Springs and the first Territorian to be appointed Administrator of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Jock was born on 28 May 1908 at Mount Perry in Queensland, the son of Maude and Harold George Nelson. When Jock was five the growing family moved to Pine Creek and later to Darwin where Harold became the leading force in the burgeoning local union movement and, indeed, was the instigator of the Territory's most famous political event. Jock had strong childhood memories of this event, watching his father lead a deputation in 1918 of more than 1,000 workers who waited on the Commonwealth's first and very controversial Territory Administrator, Dr John Anderson Gilruth, whom they invited, not very politely, to leave town-an invitation he eventually accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, Harold Nelson led the fight of `No taxation without representation' to demand that the Territory be given representation in Federal Parliament, a campaign which was successful. In the 1922 election which ensued, Harold became the Territory's first Federal representative, serving in that capacity until 1934 when he was finally defeated by the conservative candidate, Mr A.M. Blain. Although Harold did not have a vote, he was such an effective orator that it was said that parliamentarians from both sides of the House listened intently whenever he spoke, always strongly advocating the Territory's cause. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the logistics of getting to and from the Territory to Melbourne and Canberra in those days, the days before regular air flights and the still to be completed transcontinental railway, the Nelsons moved to Melbourne and then Sydney during Harold's parliamentary career. However, as soon as Jock had completed his schooling he returned to the Centre and got his first job as a jackeroo on a station near Alice Springs. In 1928 he brought a mob of several hundred sheep from Oodnadatta, but when the drought of 1928-29 wiped out his flock he began to work as a contractor boring for water on government stock routes. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1934 Jock married Peg Bloomfield, the daughter of another pioneering Territory family, and the young couple moved to Tennant Creek to join the search for gold and to operate a much needed butcher's shop in the embryonic township. The family returned to Alice Springs in 1936 where Jock worked as a contractor and agent before joining the Australian Imperial Forces. </PARA>
<PARA> During World War II, Jock served with the Royal Australian Engineers both in Australia and overseas. At war's end he returned to Alice Springs where he acquired an interest in a Central Australian cattle station and began following in his father's footsteps of working towards the political and social reform of the Northern Territory. He became an active member of the Northern Territory Development League and in December 1947 was elected as a foundation member of the first Northern Territory Legislative Council-formed, I might add, through legislation passed by the Chifley Labor Government. He was one of 13 members, six of whom were elected and seven appointed. It is worth while noting that during his maiden speech as the member for Stuart, Jock said that he would not rest until the Territory had a fully elected governing body. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to work more effectively toward achieving this goal, Jock stood for the Federal Territory seat in 1949 and, despite the fact that the Chifley Government lost the general election, his personal popularity ensured that he won the Territory seat from the man who had defeated his father. In his maiden speech he referred to the importance of the pastoral and mining industries and drew attention to the need for improved road construction in the Territory. He also referred to constitutional development, giving credit to the Chifley Government for setting it up but strongly pointing out that the Council now needed to be a fully elected body, urging the Menzies Government to proceed with that. It was not until a Whitlam Labor Government was elected that that reform was achieved in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> Like his father before him, Jock was a voteless member when he was elected. Eight years later, after persistent appeals, he finally achieved a vote in the House, although only on matters affecting the Northern Territory. Nevertheless, he pursued the Territory's interests relentlessly. It is a great tribute to him that he was re-elected to Parliament five times, twice unopposed. During his parliamentary career he was a member of the Select Committee on the Voting Rights of Aborigines, in 1961, and the Select Committee on the Grievances of the Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve, in 1963. He also served as Secretary to the Parliamentary Labor Party between 1956 and 1966-a decade. </PARA>
<PARA> After 17 years in politics, Jock allegedly retired and returned to Alice Springs to live. By this time most people would have had enough of public life, but five years later, in 1971, he was persuaded to stand as the first elected mayor of Alice Springs, winning the position in a landslide victory by relying primarily on his track record of public service and a very low-key and inexpensive campaign centred around the slogan `Give Jock a trot'. Between 1968 and 1972 he was also the Northern Territory delegate to the Labor Party's Federal Executive. He served as Alice Springs Mayor until 1973, when he became the first Territorian to be appointed Administrator of the Northern Territory. It was indicative of his commitment to Territory self-government that in his very first interview as Administrator he said that he hoped he would soon be out of a job and that the Territory would soon be completely self-governing. </PARA>
<PARA> Jock and Peg served in their vice-regal posts with distinction, particularly in the very difficult period following Cyclone Tracy, which devastated Darwin on Christmas Day 1974. Less than a year later, when the Whitlam Government was dismissed from office, Jock Nelson felt so strongly about the events of that time that he stood down from the office of Administrator to contest once again the Federal seat for Labor. Although he was not elected, the principled and self-sacrificing position he took during those difficult days served as an inspiration for many Labor people such as I, who made a renewed commitment to the Party and its policies. In 1977, the year that I entered politics, that renewed commitment resulted in the Labor Party coming extremely close, within a few hundred votes, to winning government in the Northern Territory-the closest we have ever come. </PARA>
<PARA> When Jock Nelson finally did retire to his beloved Alice Springs in 1976, he continued to serve the community, always finding the time when asked to give advice and support to people on all sides of politics. For his long and untiring service to the Labor Party, he was given life membership in the Northern Territory Labor Party. It is an indication of the esteem in which he was held that several of his former Federal colleagues, including Clyde Cameron and Frank Crean, both of whom gave their maiden speeches at the same time as Jock Nelson, were present at Jock's funeral in Alice Springs. At his eulogy it was said:</PARA>
<PARA>Love, concern and care for others went out into the community where this humble, self-effacing man never sought honour, only to serve his country and its people, particularly those from the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to pay tribute to Jock Nelson, who served both the Territory and Australia so effectively for such a long period and who was a friend to and inspiration of many. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am certainly very pleased to endorse the comments that Senator Collins made about the late Jock Nelson. Jock Nelson was an icon in the Northern Territory. He was a man of great inspiration to many territorians and he was certainly loved throughout the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had a close association with Jock Nelson for as long as I can remember-as a child growing to maturity in the Northern Territory, and during the period that Jock was a Federal member of parliament. I believe that he had a great influence in my own home and on many occasions I learnt a lot from him. I also had the great privilege of being a member of the Administrators Council during the period Jock Nelson was the Administrator of the Northern Territory. At that time I was an elected member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. During the period that he was Administrator it was indeed a privilege to serve as a member on his Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Senator Collins, because of personal associations I would also like to pay a particular tribute to the role that Jock Nelson played in that important year following Cyclone Tracy in Darwin. I can remember spending time with him in the days following the cyclone and noting the important leadership that he gave as Administrator on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> To me, Jock Nelson was one of the pioneers of Northern Territory politics. He was first elected as the member for Stuart in 1947 in the then Northern Territory Legislative Council. Subsequently, as Senator Collins said, he was elected a member of the House of Representatives from 1949 to 1966. In 1971 he was elected as the first mayor of Alice Springs. Then, probably to top off his career, he was appointed the Administrator of the Northern Territory from 1973 to 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory has come a long way politically since Jock Nelson was elected to the Federal Parliament in 1949. So much has happened. What we need to reflect on is his vision of a truly developed north of Australia. Jock Nelson's maiden speech to this Federal Parliament contained this inspiration. Like Senator Collins, I have reviewed that speech in the last few days. I found that Jock Nelson certainly had a great vision for the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Jock Nelson made his maiden speech in this Parliament on 15 March 1950. I have identified 10 major issues that I find are still threads which run through the debates that Senator Collins and I engage in so passionately in this place. I think the three of us-Jock Nelson, Bob Collins and I-would take pride in putting these points forward. The 10 points that I identify from Jock Nelson's maiden speech are as follows: the development of Northern Territory resources; road construction; the pastoral industry; mining and its future; the lack of water with regard to development; the planning of Darwin as a very significant capital city in Australia; his concern for social issues in terms of his Northern Territory constituents and the need to achieve certain goals; the reorganisation of the legislature within the Northern Territory to enable it to play a more effective role; a fully elected and voting representation of the Northern Territory in whatever parliament is established; and, finally, the very important issue of defence and north Australian security. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, in his maiden speech Jock Nelson referred to the fact that the bombing of Darwin had taken place some eight years before. He spoke about the lapsing memories of people and the need to be always very vigilant in that part of Australia. Probably his final point related to populating the north. All of these goals have common themes and threads running through them. </PARA>
<PARA> Jock Nelson certainly had a distinguished career and he can only be described as a person who had a close identification with the constituency he represented. Throughout the 70-odd years that he lived, worked and finally retired in the Northern Territory we can see that Jock Nelson was a man who cared. He was a man who got involved; he was a man who delivered what he said he was going to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA> At all times, I found Jock Nelson to be a man of great personal integrity, honesty and character. He provided an example that I am sure historians will take a great deal of pleasure in constantly reviewing when they examine not only Jock Nelson's life and contribution, but also the era in which he served publicly in the Northern Territory. That period ran from 1949 until his retirement as Administrator in 1976. He certainly led a very distinguished life. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, I also pay tribute to the very great role played by his family and his role as a family man. Jock Nelson's wife, Peg, is equally a character of the Northern Territory and a much-loved lady. She and her daughters have the sympathy of all Territorians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Nil. The threshold figure of $300 refers to the minimum amount below which the Australian Customs Service administrative penalty guidelines recommend that a penalty not be imposed. It is not a litigation threshold as stated in the question.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) 1 December 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) There have been no reviews by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) of ACS penalty remission decisions where the original penalty amount was less than $300. It should be noted that where a review is undertaken by the AAT, the ACS remission decision is placed in abeyance and the AAT is required to determine afresh whether any remission should apply and, if so, the appropriate level. In a recent case a penalty of $799 was imposed against A &amp;M Topper and was 85 per cent remitted by the Customs Service on application for review. The Customs agent representing the company has rejected the penalty remaining of $119 and has actioned the matter before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is yet to give its decision.</PARA>

<PARA>  (1) No. The Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Employment, Education and Training use the same indices as prescribed in Sections 40 and 68 of the `Higher Education Funding Act 1988' and the `Higher Education Funding Amendment Act (No. 2) 1990'.</PARA>

<PARA>  (3) The HECS debt is indexed on 1 June each year for the portion of the debt which has remained unpaid for 12 months or more. The indexation factor to be applied each year is based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics after the March quarter (7.2 per cent and 8 per cent respectively for the years 1989-90 and 1990-91).</PARA>
<PARA>  In any one instance the `real value' of the debt will depend on a number of factors including the rate at which the debt is being repaid and the difference between the real rate of interest and the CPI applying in different years.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) (a) The HECS Annual Course Contribution represents approximately 20 per cent of the average cost of a higher education place.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) In establishing HECS the Government considered the recommendations of the `Report of the Committee on Higher Education Funding', April 1988, which found that on historical and overseas precedents it would not be unreasonable to expect higher education users to contribute around 20 per cent of the average costs incurred by the Commonwealth Government.</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) The Committee also found that in 1988 a contribution of $1,800 per full-time student equivalent would represent around 20 per cent of the total Commonwealth outlays in higher education (excluding the cost of student income support).</PARA>

<PARA>  The entitlements of war widows and veterans to health care services apply uniformly across all States as set out in the Veterans' Entitlements Act (the Act) and the associated Treatment Principles.</PARA>
<PARA>  Under the Treatment Principles, veterans and war widows who have an entitlement to hospital care and who do not obtain prior approval for a private hospital admission are not eligible to be reimbursed for the costs of that care. The prior approval requirement does not apply to admissions where there is a specific agreement with a individual country private hospital, provided the admission is not for elective surgery.

In these cases payment is made of all costs of treatment, including drugs, which are clearly related to the reason or reasons for admission and which are related to continuing care.</PARA>

<PARA>  (1) The Energy Research and Development Corporation is funding the following research and development (R&amp;) activities associated with coal- bed methane:</PARA>
<PARA>  (i) Prediction of natural gas production from coal seams in Queensland, $370,900, by a joint venture comprising MGC Resources Pty Ltd (75%) and Mount Isa Mines Ltd (25%); MGC Resources Pty Ltd is a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co. Inc. of Japan.</PARA>

<PARA>  (3) No. The Government considers that the coal- bed methane resource development is a matter for the private sector when the resource is competitive with the production of conventional natural gas.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) The Government aims to provide a suitable economic environment so that the private sector can introduce alternative energy sources such as coal- bed methane on a commercial basis at the appropriate time.

<PARA>  (1) Sub-section 243(U)(2) of the Customs provides that applicants be informed of the Comptroller's decision within 30 days of receipt of the application for remission.

<PARA>  (g) The above administrative penalties were granted a full remission on the basis of the delegate's consideration of the matters contained in Sub-section 243U(4) of the Customs Act 1901. The types of considerations involved included:</PARA>
<PARA>  Minimal risk to revenue, as well as no prior penalties or convictions incurred by Customs agent or owner of the goods;</PARA>
<PARA>  Capacity to avoid error diminished by outstanding tariff classification disputes;</PARA>
<PARA>  Genuine attempt to voluntarily disclose error prior to detection by ACS;</PARA>
<PARA>  Capacity to avoid error reduced by information supplied on import documentation; and</PARA>
<PARA>  Customs agent's medical condition lessened capacity to avoid error.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) No. At a recent meeting with the ACS, Customs brokers' representatives requested that the summary of administrative penalty statistics report format used by the Victorian Office of the ACS be adopted nationally. This proposal is under consideration with the intention of introducing a uniform format for reports on administrative penalty statistics issued by ACS regional offices to the importing community.</PARA>
