<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. I ask: what were the reasons for the Government's change of mind to allow the Australian troops about to go to Cambodia to be armed? When will the Minister make a statement to the Parliament about Australia's full commitment to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia and, in particular, the number of Australian personnel involved in the second and larger phase of the operation, known as the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether the troops were to be armed or not armed was a matter of a recommendation made over time. I do not think there was a specific decision in regard to that being either yes or no. It was one of the things to be considered, and a decision was made in favour of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the broader question of a statement, it is not always Government policy to make a statement on every commitment to a United Nations peacekeeping force, but my understanding is that the Prime Minister intends to make a major statement on Cambodia. The only hold up in that statement at the moment, as I understand it, is that we are still negotiating with the United Nations on the second and larger contingent, its nature and its composition, and we did not want to pre-empt that at this stage. As soon as those negotiations are over, the Prime Minister will make a statement in the Parliament, and I assume either Senator Button or Senator Evans will replicate it here.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Referring to the answer to the second part of my question, in view of the fact that there has been a large number of what are presumably speculative reports about the number of Australian troops who will be committed&mdash;there are 40 going in a few days; so it is as low as that, but even up to 1,000 troops have been the subject of speculation&mdash;is that not a good reason for an early statement to be made about the size, at least, of this commitment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two Australian contributions, one to UNAMIC and one to UNTAC, and it is on the second one that Senator Durack asks his question. I think it is relevant that a statement be made on it, but the difficulty at the moment is that probably up to 20 or 30 countries have considered at Cabinet level, or whatever other decision making process they go through, the type of contribution they would like to make. It is then the task of the United Nations to coordinate all those offers and to determine whether they can be acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not much point if every country offers air transport and no-one offers anything else. We are still involved in that process, and the United Nations is still involved in that process, of determining the acceptability of each country's offer and trying to blend them together. It is for that reason that we cannot necessarily anticipate that our favoured configuration that we have offered will or will not be accepted. I am fairly confident that it will be accepted, and as soon as that point is reached, as I indicated, the Prime Minister will make a full statement to Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Can the Minister explain the precise nature of the agreements signed recently in Paris on a settlement of the Cambodian conflict and outline Australia's expected role in the implementation phase of the settlement?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2363" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some aspects of this have been covered in the answer that Senator Robert Ray has just given. So far as the political side of the settlement is concerned, the agreements signed in Paris were four, two of them of treaty status and two supplementary agreements. The first was an agreement on a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict committing all parties to it to a permanent cease-fire, the demobilisation of military forces, the holding of free and fair elections, the adoption of a new democratic constitution and the associated arrangements involving the United Nations in supervising this entire process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there was a declaration by Cambodia of its future neutrality and guarantees of that neutrality simultaneously by other states, including the provision for joint action which might be taken in the event of a threat to that neutrality. The third element was a declaration on rehabilitation and reconstruction describing the principles and processes involved in reconstruction assistance. Then there was the final act of the Paris conference, so-called, which is essentially a procedural document, describing the status of the conference and the various agreements signed at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators will know, the agreements in Paris represent the culmination of more than two years of very hard and patient work by the Permanent Five; members of the Security Council; the regional countries, particularly Indonesia as co-chairman of the Paris conference; Australia; and the Cambodian parties under the chairmanship recently of Prince Sihanouk. As has been gracefully acknowledged in a number of quarters in the past couple of weeks, the settlement is based in very large part on general principles and quite detailed proposals devised and developed by Australia over the past two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the achievement of the settlement itself is momentous and historic, we, like everybody else, are now concentrating our energies towards assisting in the very complex and difficult process which remains ahead of implementing the settlement. We have provided an electoral expert to the UN to assist in preparatory activities for the eventual holding of elections, which we hope will take place in a year or so. As has just been said, we will shortly send a 40-man contingent to Cambodia to provide vital communications links as part of the United Nations Advance Mission into Cambodia&mdash;known as UNAMIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also plan to make a major contribution in personnel and materiel to the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, UNTAC, probably involving about 500 personnel&mdash;as Senator Ray has said, that has not yet been resolved&mdash;and possibly involving the military command in question. As Senator Ray has said, and I can only&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the order of magnitude that is presently being contemplated. It is impossible to be precise about it because the overall numbers have not yet been resolved. It is not just a matter of each individual country's contribution, which, as Senator Ray has said, still remains to be resolved; it is a question of the overall numbers. The working premise is that it is of that order of magnitude, but a lot remains to be settled and there is no point in making any final statement about that until it is settled. The main UN body, UNTAC, will be deployed from early next year to provide major humanitarian and administrative assistance to the Cambodians and to help guarantee that neutral and secure environment for the holding of free and fair elections, which is the indispensable requirement of the whole Cambodian settlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now in the process of establishing a physical mission on the ground in Phnom Penh to support our activities in the implementation phase. I am anticipating that we will have a resident Australian ambassador in Phnom Penh by late November. I will be visiting Cambodia on present expectations in mid-December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I say finally that Australia will not step back from its responsibilities to provide an appropriate level of assistance to repatriation and reconstruction efforts in the country. We have just provided $1m to the UNHCR for the repatriation of displaced Cambodians on the Thai-Cambodian border and we are very actively encouraging the early convening of the International Committee of Reconstruction in Cambodia&mdash;ICORC as it has been designated&mdash;which is provided for in the settlement documents and which will have the task of encouraging greater coordination in planning and organising the provision of longer term assistance in the reconstruction and development of the country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to hope that with Senator Harradine's vocal support we could single-handedly solve the problems of the world in general and Yugoslavia in particular. The problem is, as everyone should know by now, an immensely complex one. It has been very difficult to secure the active agreement to and effective enforcement of, on both sides, the various tentative cease-fires that have so far been reached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I have said often enough in this place and elsewhere in recent times that we believe the primary responsibility for the scale of the violence which is presently occurring must rest with the Serbian authorities, nonetheless, it is not the case that the other side to the conflict&mdash;the Croatian side&mdash;is completely immune from responsibility for the continuation of this particular conflict. It is a very difficult situation to manage, both for the parties on the ground and for those who are trying very hard to get a peace settlement in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are awaiting the decision of the EC on the question of economic sanctions, which does seem to be the likely next step in the European process if the parties are unable to reach a workable consensus among themselves. Should developments point to that need, we will move quickly in concert with the EC and with the UN Security Council, if that too becomes involved, to meet our appropriate responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say at this point of time is, bearing in mind what is happening in The Hague and the likely meeting very soon of the UN Security Council, that we will very strongly support international moves to produce a sensible result. We continue to call upon all the parties to this conflict, as we have from its very outset, to observe restraint and to go down the path of a negotiated solution. We will do everything that we appropriately and sensibly can to support that.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When those reports came out a few days ago I immediately asked our ambassadors in Bangkok and Rangoon to investigate them and to report back. It is very difficult to verify the information in question as Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is held incommunicado, of course, as everyone knows, under house detention. Recent information from the embassies' contacts in Rangoon just a few days before the reports in question were that she was fit and well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our assessment, based on all available sources of information, is that it is unlikely that there has been any drastic or dramatic deterioration in her health since that time. There is no definite evidence that she has begun a hunger strike, although there are of course still rumours to that effect in Rangoon. We are continuing our efforts to establish the nature of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's state of health. We are very gravely concerned, obviously, about the reports about her well-being. We would certainly view with the utmost seriousness any information confirming any substance to those reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said on 15 October in this place that Professor Yokota would be visiting Burma as a representative of the UN Commission on Human Rights and was likely to request a meeting with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. I have been advised that she was not successful in obtaining a meeting, which does add extra weight to the concern of the international community about these developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past 24 hours or so I have initiated contact with a number of other governments that share our concern about Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to propose joint representations, a joint demarche, on her situation to the Burmese regime, and I expect those representations to take place very shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detention of the Nobel Prize winner seriously infringes internationally accepted standards of human rights and is a matter of enormous concern worldwide. We will continue both to condemn that detention and to demand in very vigorous terms her immediate and unconditional release. We will take any action we possibly can to bring that about and, in the meantime, in a number of other forums, including the United Nations General Assembly, we will be actively pursuing political action to continue the spotlight of attention on this regime.</PARA>

Does the Minister agree that such a development would be detrimental to Australia's sovereignty and contrary to Australia's policy of self-reliance in defence matters and should therefore be rejected?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. A recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Thursday, 31 October&mdash;questioned the need for the third runway at Sydney Airport and suggested that a more cost effective solution would be to relocate private and commuter operations to Badgerys Creek.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it does not. I read the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and I would like to set the record straight in respect of a number of assertions that the article made. The third runway will be funded entirely by the Federal Airports Corporation. No taxpayers' money at all will be spent on the project. On the other hand, the construction of the airport facilities at Badgerys Creek, which I have advised this House of previously, would not be a commercially viable proposition and therefore would require some form of Government contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The third runway would generate additional aeronautical revenue for the FAC in the medium to long term, simply through increasing the capacity of the airport and hence allowing access to the airport by an increased number of aircraft.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third runway can also be viewed as a key component of a broad strategy to develop the potential capacity of the airport. The overall result would be a very significant increase in revenue to the FAC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggested forced relocation of commuter operations to Badgerys Creek demonstrates not only a complete lack of understanding of this sector of the industry, but also a supreme contempt for the people of regional New South Wales. Many commuter aircraft are, in fact, operated by the major domestic airlines&mdash;which appears to have escaped the author of the article&mdash;or subsidiaries on major routes; for example, the Dash 8s that are used on the Sydney-Canberra route. Large segments of the commuter market would find Badgerys Creek totally unacceptable. One-third of the market from commuter flights uses KSA to transfer to both domestic and international flights. A significant amount of traffic also comprises same day business traffic into Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Apart from pointing out the factual inaccuracies of the article, I want to reiterate something I have said in this chamber before: the Government reasserts its commitment to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport being used as a regional airport for regional New South Wales as well as for the important role that it plays in both domestic and international air traffic in Australia. The suggestion put in the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> would be totally unacceptable to Government. It is the Government's intention to maintain the important role of Sydney Airport as a regional airport for New South Wales.</PARA>

I understand from a number of my colleagues who were on the delegation that on a number of occasions Senator Burns said in public speeches, not private comments, that he had an understanding in similar terms of the events, based on cultural differences. I would like to know what cultural differences justify the slaughter of 2,000 to 4,000 people because they were protesting for democracy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is genuinely a question without notice. The best practice demonstration project was announced in the March economic statement. It is a program by this Government which aims to encourage, by providing some catalytic finance, a change to a new workplace culture in Australian workplaces. It aims to encourage employers and employees jointly to set the goals of the enterprise, to strive for greater productivity and, in the achievement of that, share the rewards fairly between those who have helped generate it in the workplace, the employees, and those who have helped finance the industry, the investors and shareholders,  and, of course, to achieve a competitive edge in the marketplace by reducing the price of the good or service to the consumer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian best practice demonstration project offers a series of packages of financial support to companies to enable them to transfer into a best practice mode. There is a limited number of packages. That limited number of packages is auctioned to companies which are interested in making the transfer, and the auction is on the basis of those companies filing corporate plans with a commercial panel of judges. Those corporate plans show how they intend to implement best practice in their companies. The commercial panel is headed by John Prescott, the Chief Executive Officer of BHP, and it looks at what, in its opinion, will be the most successful best practice plans out of those filed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first round&mdash;which has just been announced&mdash;271 companies made applications; 19 were awarded. This means that, for 19 packages of support, 271 companies have commenced the process of consulting with their workers, drawing up plans and committing themselves to best practice as benchmarked by best world standards. The companies were from a range of industry sectors and were of a range of sizes&mdash;big, medium and small. They were mainly in the traded goods sector. The level of applications was very high indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does show that in this country best practice is catching on; that Australian companies are indeed taking their employees more into their confidence; that we are reaching for higher standards; and that, as tariff protection walls start crumbling under the determinations of this Government, the traded goods area, exposed to best world competition, will be able to emerge to hold its own and in fact succeed in a globalised marketplace.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can tell Senator Panizza that I obtained direct advice from the French Government which I am about to deliver to the Senate. I was aware that no valid comparison could be made at this stage between the Australian Government's waterfront reform and the reform being proposed in France because the waterfront reform in France is at such an early stage that it is very difficult to draw any valid conclusions from it. When we did contact the French Government, it was interesting to be advised of its proposal because it appears to bear an amazing similarity to what we are now in the final stages of completing in Australia, which seems to be something that everyone has agreed on except Mr Sharp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current advice from the French Government is that its reforms are at a very early stage with no framework or timetable yet available, unlike Australia where the current reform program is now in its final stage. However, the French Government does foresee a two-stage process whereby the Government will initially call for port by port negotiations between unions and employers to improve productivity and to address high labour levels; I am not sure where I have heard that before. When productivity gains have been met, the Government intends to provide assistance for early retirement and compensation packages for dockers leaving the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will sound familiar to everyone apparently, except Mr Sharp. It is fundamentally the same process of negotiated reform that has already been implemented in Australia with government assistance on redundancy of surplus labour after the reforms have been implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major difference between the Australian and French waterfronts lies in the French Government's still exercising direct regulation over labour arrangements by legislation which, among other things, provides for security of employment for French dock workers. The Australian Federal Government withdrew from direct legislative control of the labour force in 1977, when the industry-wide labour pooling system was introduced. This is now being dismantled under the Government's reform program and being replaced by enterprise employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Sharp was apparently excited by French dockyard reform because he got the idea that the Government intended immediately to abolish the security of employment provisions in this legislation. This accorded with Mr Sharp's approach to reform, which is simply to threaten workers with the sack. However, I am advised by the French Government that such legislative change is not a foregone conclusion; no decision has been taken on it. It is hoped by the French Government that negotiations between the industry parties will produce increased efficiency without any extensive government intervention. I hope that it does, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Mr Sharp's view this must make the French Government apparently as gutless as the Australian Government. I do not agree with that assessment. I think the way the French Government is proposing to go, which is very similar to what we have done here in Australia, will be successful. Certainly I hope that it will be as successful as it has been here in Australia. I am sure that by comparison the French Government sees itself as proceeding along a realistic route which eventually will produce a much greater rate of reform than that suggested by the Federal Opposition here in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is from 1 January. This requires a number of changes. It requires a change to how we define unemployment, as an example, because these are not people who are actually unemployed. They could perhaps be called `underemployed' but not unemployed. Previously, they would have been disqualified on that basis. Also, we have sought to make farmers sell their farms, or put them on the market, and sell off life insurance and that sort of thing when they have gone for benefits. So we would be required to make a number of changes to give effect to this. The honourable senator seeks to add to this those people who are aged persons, who have retired on their farm and who the honourable senator says are living in poverty.

I do not know of any way of quarantining an assessment for that which would be in any way fair, just and equitable. I am quite prepared to have a look at the matter.

We have opened career paths by adding training into the workplace situation so that advancement now can occur because of acquisitions of skill and not just simply because of seniority or more superior placings in the managerial scale. We have, as well, modernised awards. All of those changes were necessary to create the right framework for this decision to be made. This decision now introduces workplace bargaining into the Australian workplace against that restructured background. If we had moved, as some of the Opposition talk about, to workplace bargaining immediately, without going through that restructure, it would not have worked successfully. It now will.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Professor Ball's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pacific Defence Reporter</EMPHASIS> and press reporting of it are jumping to conclusions in suggesting Soviet access to Nurrungar data, and especially Soviet visits to Nurrungar. United States officials have assured us that no discussions have been held with the USSR about sharing data from Nurrungar or about Soviet visits to Nurrungar, and none are currently contemplated. However, I would like to stress that Nurrungar is a very important facility, not just to ourselves and the United States but also to other friends and allies. Just how important was dramatically highlighted during the recent Gulf war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent weeks the US and Australian governments have discussed and agreed that it would now be appropriate to make public the role of the joint facility in Operation Desert Storm. As part of Desert Storm the coalition forces used space based systems to provide weather data, navigational assistance, information on the geographic disposition of forces and other related intelligence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nurrungar is, of course, an important part of the defence support program&mdash;the DSP&mdash;which provides early warning of missile launches, surveillance and the detonation of nuclear weapons. During the Gulf war the DSP detected the launch of Iraqi scud missiles and provided warning to coalition forces and to civilian populations in Israel and Saudi Arabia. The DSP's superb performance during that conflict confirms the flexibility and the continued relevance of a system which was designed primarily to provide early warning of missile attack against the US and its friends and allies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that the important role played by the joint defence facility, Nurrungar, in the Gulf war will further enhance public appreciation of its significance in efforts to promote measures for maintaining peace and stability, both globally and regionally. If anything, facilities such as Nurrungar are likely to be more important in the post Cold War period. They not only provide intelligence and early warning at a time when the prospect of proliferation is increasing, but also their arms control and verification function will be of greater significance to the cause of world peace.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. As the Minister would no doubt be aware, many farmers are currently experiencing either no income or even negative income as a result of the disastrous drought and rural downturn. Is the Minister aware of the inability of many rural families to qualify for isolated children's assistance under the assets test guidelines?  Is the Minister also aware of the fact that many rural families do have assets worth in excess of the prescribed amounts for the assets test but have no income to cover school fees and expenses? In light of the extreme economic hardships these families are facing, would the Government consider removing the assets test for assistance to isolated children and base the eligibility criteria for this benefit on income alone?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say at the outset that the one thing we will not be doing&mdash;the one thing that can be seen as nothing more than being geared towards making life more difficult for people such as those whom Senator Bjelke-Petersen seems to be concerned about&mdash;is introducing a consumption tax which will impact directly on their real disposable income. As Senator Bjelke-Petersen would know, in the recent Budget the Government announced the introduction of hardship provisions which allow the assets tests for Austudy and assistance under the isolated children's scheme to be waived while a student's parents or spouse are receiving a Department of Social Security pension or benefit on hardship grounds, a Department of Veterans' Affairs pension or household assistance under part C of the rural adjustment scheme. This came into effect on 1 October 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 29 October, as Senator Bjelke-Petersen should know&mdash;though she might have been preoccupied with other matters at the time&mdash;the Government announced a widening of the hardship provisions under the Social Security Act to improve access to Jobsearch and Newstart allowances for farming families.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Look, if he were honest he would ask for the keys to Boggo Road and walk straight in himself. I am not being nasty about this. Social Security will obtain reports from RAS authorities on families in severe financial hardship who are ineligible for RAS assistance but whose farms are profitable in the long term. These reports will identify those business assets that are essential to the long term profitability of the farm. Such assets will not be counted under the Social Security hardship provisions for otherwise eligible applicants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These extended provisions are expected to operate from 1 January 1992 for a period of two years. Eligibility for the Austudy and AIC hardship provisions will automatically extend to families granted Job Search or Newstart allowances under the new social security provisions. As I mentioned, these are initiatives taken just in the last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be mentioned that for those students not eligible for the hardship provision, the assets test threshold for 1991 is $347,500, calculated net of debt and excluding the family home and surrounds. A 50 per cent discount applies to owner operated farms or businesses, effectively raising the threshold to $695,000 for such assets. Applicants are ineligible for assistance only while asset values, less debt, remain above the test threshold and they may be granted a benefit for any period when assets fall below the prescribed limit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Benefits are usually commenced on the basis of the estimate of asset values provided by the applicant on the Austudy application form. This, of course, avoids causing undue hardship to many students by having to wait for completion of all asset checks, including title searches and the like. Clear advice is provided in the application guide as well as the Austudy guide issued by the Department and the National Union of Students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish on the point that I made at the start: this Government has been concerned about the plight of families in the rural crisis. We have taken meaningful measures to do something about that. Those measure have been geared towards alleviating the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the start, these measures are in stark contrast with what has been offered by Senator Bjelke-Petersen's colleagues&mdash;her coalition partners. She knows full well, her leader in front of her knows full well and her leader in the other House knows full well that the consumption tax&mdash;the GST&mdash;will impact enormously on these people. Senator Bjelke-Petersen is going along for the ride; we know that she does not agree with them. But she can see the direct positive effect that our measures will have on the families that she is concerned about, as opposed to the consumption tax which will impact very deleteriously on them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At Question Time on 17 October, Senator Campbell asked me a question without notice relating to the availability of capital.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to Senator Campbell's question on capital availability, I have been advised that the Reserve Bank, in its 1991 Annual Report, has estimated the non-performing loans of Australian banks to be around $29 billion as at June 1991. However, this does not mean that the banks expect to lose $29 billion, as this amount includes restructured loans, debts the banks deem to be doubtful as well as loans not earning any interest. Given that the total stock of credit outstanding by all financial institutions, as at June 1991, was $339 billion, the availability of capital has not been severely affected by the increase in the banks' non-performing loan portfolio, from $16 billion to $29 billion over the year to June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission, in a draft report on the availability of capital, released on 25 September 1991, stated that while economic conditions have contributed to perceived problems about the availability of capital, the banks have also had trouble adjusting to the post-deregulation environment. The Industry Commission states that the banks themselves have acknowledged that poor lending decisions in the wake of deregulation, and subsequently in some over-reaction, has contributed to the growth of bad debts over the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is no evidence to suggest that a supply-side "credit crunch" is occurring, despite the tightening of lending requirements in the wake of the growth of bad debts. The low lending figures by financial institutions are, to a significant extent, a reflection of weak demand for credit. It is also interesting to note that the September quarter CAI/Westpac survey of manufacturers shows that there has been little change in the availability of finance; only 17% of respondents believe that it is harder to obtain finance than it was in the June quarter and 72% believe there has been no change. The Reserve Bank concludes that "while finance has been less readily available than in the boom years of 1988 and 1989, it is not as difficult to obtain as in the period of credit rationing in 1974.</PARA>

<PARA>I speak only briefly to the motion, which should be unnecessary. In a personal explanation we would expect to get only the personal explanation. In fact, what Senator Burns gave us was his interpretation of the history of China that might justify the rulers of modern day China in the atrocities that they perpetrated in Tiananmen Square. Somehow or other, from that point a journalist interviewing Senator Burns&mdash;in Shanghai as I understand, after or during a dinner&mdash;was able to report him in terms that were put before the Senate by Senator O'Chee. In a most serious way, it is suggested that Senator Burns in fact condoned, or at least sought to explain away, the atrocities that occurred in Tiananmen Square. In fact, I cannot think of a more serious matter that could be raised in this chamber. Senator O'Chee correctly said during Question Time that it is a major affront to all Australians, particularly Chinese Australians and Chinese who have fled that sort of regime to seek the protections that we have in this country. </PARA>

I want to stress that it seemed to me that what Senator Burns allegedly said to the journalist was very much along the lines of what he had said publicly and which we found unacceptable. However, I have to say that he did not publicly say specifically what the journalist says Senator Burns said to him after the cocktail party in Shanghai. Nonetheless, I stress that Senator Burns did say that overseas criticism&mdash;which includes Australian Government criticism&mdash;of the activities in Tiananmen Square emerged from a lack of understanding by other nations of the situation in China and its history.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the delegation to China, I would also like to reiterate some of the comments made by Senator Michael Baume. I note that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> article, which in a rather forthright way is headed, `Tiananmen Massacre was right&mdash;Aust MP'&mdash;which certainly is an inflammatory statement for a leading article&mdash;the three particular paragraphs that are attributed directly to Senator Burns are, firstly:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe from the cultural background of Chinese history, they (the Chinese Government) were correct to respond in the way they did.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What occurred was a reasonable response.</PARA>
<PARA>And thirdly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chinese people for thousands of years have been governed by authority from above, sometimes cruelly, sometimes benevolently.</PARA>
<PARA>I find those three quotes to be very similar in context to the comments Senator Burns made in this chamber today. The notes I took as Senator Burns was speaking, where he said, `Given the culture and history of China', `the harsh social environment and heartbreaking circumstances' and `the massacre of 22 million Chinese by Japanese', indicate that he understood how the Communist Government in China may have come to its conclusions to clear Tiananmen Square in the way that it did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find those statements today by Senator Burns to be very consistent with what the reporter has printed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier Mail</EMPHASIS>; therefore, I must dissociate myself from them. I believe that, in the course of the delegation's tour, I did make it clear that on several occasions Senator Burns, as Chairman of the delegation, just went a little too far in some public comments. I certainly recall his comments in our meeting with the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing where a number of us were, to say the least, uncomfortable with his statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the social function in Shanghai, to which the article refers, we did meet with officials in Beijing, Lanzhou, Xi'an and Shanghai. As I said, there were several unfortunate occasions. There were many other occasions when I, as a delegation member, totally agreed with the Chairman's comments. As Senator Baume has said, for the most part I believe that the delegation was very successful. It covered a lot of ground, particularly in trade related areas. We did not shy away from good, straight and honest discussion, be it on environmentally related issues in the new trade development and economic zones or on several occasions with regard to the human rights issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other occasion on which I dissociated myself with statements by Senator Burns was with regard to the role and relationship between China and the United States. I recall in a meeting stating publicly that in Australia we have various perspectives with regard to political sides. That was one occasion when I did have to draw a different viewpoint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> is certainly unhelpful in trying to build a very special relationship that we need to have with China. It is unfortunate if Senator Burns did reflect in this way with the journalist, Ed Southorn. I recall a number of discussions with Mr Southorn at the reception. I found him to be a very straight talker and someone who was keen to learn more about China, especially about the relationship between China and Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before this rather grubby little persecution of Senator Burns continues any longer, it is important that something be said on the other side of the equation. There is a certain amount of hypocrisy and pomposity one can put up with without one's gorge rising, but I think that we have just about reached that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously I was not present when Senator Burns made the remarks in question. From what has been said, I do not understand that anyone else overheard the conversation in question with the journalist. At best, people are reporting other conversations or statements they heard Senator Burns make in similar circumstances. Obviously, since I was not there, I cannot make any judgment about what was said, but I can make these points. The first is that, from everything I know about Senator Burns's character and commitments as a lifelong supporter of the Australian Labor Party and the values for which this Party stands, it is inconceivable that he would have said anything of the kind that was attributed to him in this headline&mdash;that is, that the Tiananmen massacre was right&mdash;with him making some judgment to that effect. Whatever one might think of Senator Burns or what he stands for, I find it inconceivable that he would have lent his name, judgment and perception and commitment to any proposition of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make is that all of us in this chamber should be aware from our own personal experience of how much things depend on the particular context in which something is said and how much accurate reporting depends on conveying everything of what is said, not some selective proportion of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I can vouch from my own personal experience on a number of occasions when what has been a description by me of the reactions of others has been reported as a value judgment of my own. There is no clearer demonstration of that than a great deal of the reporting on the subject of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Embassy</EMPHASIS> that accompanied my own visit to Malaysia. As I retailed in a speech at the National Press Club yesterday, and as I said on a number of occasions at the time, what I had said in a speech&mdash;and the text is on the public record so it can be checked&mdash;was that a series of incidents, the details of which do not now matter, were seen in Malaysia as being `offensive and on occasions downright insulting'. The way that was reported in just about every Australian newspaper was that the series of incidents in question were offensive and on occasions downright insulting. In other words, what in my mouth was an objective description of the reactions of others was reported as a value judgment that I myself was making about the offensiveness of the incidents in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised this a couple of days later with a couple of journalists. Journalist A, who shall remain nameless, said when I drew this distinction to him, `I am sorry; I don't understand the difference'. Journalist B said, `Well, yes, I accept that there is a difference, but, mate'&mdash;and I remember the conversation vividly&mdash;`you have to appreciate that the little words do tend to drop out in reporters' accounts of these things, and if not in the reporters' own account, then in the way the piece is finally subbed. And if you don't want the thing to be misreported, well, you shouldn't use colourful words like "offensive" and "insulting" anyway'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that what happened&mdash;and I make no judgments at all about the integrity, the qualifications or the professionalism of the journalist in question&mdash;was that either he misheard what Senator Burns was saying or was trying to say, or in some way the message was lost in transmission. When Senator Burns got to his feet today and described to the Senate in his words what he had been putting to the journalist and to others on similar occasions, he was saying that in his understanding of Chinese culture and history the kind of reaction that occurred in Tiananmen would have been perceived by the Chinese leadership in question as a reasonable reaction. In other words, he was reporting, as he described it today, the reaction of the Chinese leadership; he was not making his own value judgment about the rectitude of that reaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is my understanding of what Senator Burns said. Consonant with the dignity of this place and the benefit of the doubt that we usually give each other when questions of personal probity, rectitude and integrity are at stake, I believe that Senator Burns's explanation should be accepted in those terms, and that this particular episode should now cease. </PARA>

I would just like to say that I was on the delegation. One can say one thing about Senator Burns: `What you see is what you get'. Some people in this chamber have the ability to dissemble; Senator Burns is not like that. What he did on the second day of the delegation was to answer a very sharp criticism by the Chairman of the Chinese Congress in a very proper and dignified way, disagreeing very properly with the Chinese Government's position. Throughout the visit that sort of statement, unofficially and officially, was reported to the people; in other words, he was very consistent in what he said.</PARA></TALK.START>

When we think of the role of a journalist in just the ordinary work that occurs here all the time&mdash;and Senator Bishop is a close user of journalists&mdash;we would know that occasionally they do not put in, as Senator Evans has said, everything that is said. What Senator Burns said is exactly the way he put the matter on all the occasions I heard him say it. What we have is a journalist who in my view has probably taken part of what Senator Burns said but not put it in the full context of what was said. So the journalist has gone, as Senator Baume has pointed out, and got a story and has taken that story and built on it in what he has written. </PARA>

He does not know anything else but to tell it straight and to say things as he believes them, from the heart.

<PARA>I congratulate the Federal Court of Australia on the report it has presented to the Parliament for tabling. I draw the attention of the Senate to point 2.9 on page 22 of the report which deals with costs of litigation in the Court. Under the heading `Filing fees' the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Filing fees for matters under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Federal Court Act</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS> are fixed by the Executive under the Federal Court Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no increase in fees during the reporting year.</PARA>
<PARA>That is last year. The Senate should note, as should the people of Australia, that in this year's Budget this Government, which claims to show some social justice and social equity in the way of taxes, has increased filing fees in all Federal courts by an amount of $500. If one wants to set down a matter in a Federal court, one now has to pay a fee of $500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Government made this announcement one had to pay a fee of nothing. There was no such thing as a setting down fee; this has been introduced by the Government and it is simply taxation by stealth. The announcement was given no publicity; no-one in the legal profession was aware of it at the time. Even now, there is some uncertainty about its implementation. At a time when everyone is very concerned about the costs of justice and about the difficulties that Australia is in&mdash;particularly the difficulties that middle Australians have in getting cases before the courts because of the very high cost of justice&mdash;this Government has made it even more difficult by imposing a $500 setting down fee that was not there before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the bottom of page 22 the report of the Federal Court indicates that it is very concerned about the cost of justice and is undertaking several initiatives aimed at reducing the cost to litigants and streamlining the recovery of costs. These include a number of measures which are listed. I congratulate the Federal Court for taking those initiatives and doing something positive about the things that are making justice so expensive for ordinary Australians. The Court deserves the congratulations of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Court is doing that and looking at ways of reducing the costs of justice, the Government is imposing that fee of $500. It makes one wonder whether it is worth the Federal Court's while looking at these projects for reducing the costs of justice when this Government keeps increasing them by sneaking in these quite substantial fees that were never there before, which increase the costs of justice to ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the people who cannot get before the courts and who cannot get justice in Australia are middle Australians. If you are very rich&mdash;if you are a multinational company&mdash;it is easy to go to court and spend what you like; if you are in the very poor category you can get legal assistance where the Government will pay your legal fees and, of course, the $500 would not matter. It is those in middle Australia, the vast majority of Australians who have grown up under the English institutions of justice, who are now being squeezed out because the cost of justice is getting so high. This Government, rather than trying to do something about that, simply adds to that cost and makes it more difficult for middle Australians to get before the courts by imposing yet another fee, and a substantial fee at that, on anyone wishing to set down a matter in any of the Federal courts. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statistics in this report show levels of increases in bankruptcy numbers that have never before been experienced&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>never before&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with Victoria and Western Australia experiencing the highest levels, but all States experienced major increases.</PARA>
<PARA>I mention, naturally, that Victoria and South Australia have been assisted in their endeavours to become the worst States in bankruptcy by having Labor governments. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As at the end of the financial year there were no indications of any significant levelling off in the rate of increase.</PARA>
<PARA>The report further states that because of this high increase in bankruptcies the Inspector-General of Bankruptcy was required to get additional resources. I quote further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the actual rate of increase in new bankruptcies since the need for supplementary resources was estimated in mid 1990-91, has been significantly greater than was predicted at that time. If the rate of increase evident at the end of 1991 is sustained it will almost certainly be necessary to seek further supplementation of resources from the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>That simply underlines that in yet another area of government activity the Government had no idea of the consequences of its incompetence. It did not have the capacity to plan for this huge increase in bankruptcies under the allegedly engineered recession of the then Treasurer. If the Treasurer was so busy engineering a recession, he might well have also engineered an increase in the resources available under the Bankruptcy Act. But his capacity to engineer is clearly limited to a destructive role, a blowing up role, rather than a role of any positive nature.

<PARA>With the indulgence of the Senate, if I transgress over the period of five minutes, it is to save the time of the Senate, because I will be debating four documents and could have taken 20 minutes had I had that privilege. During the passage of the Data Matching (Assistance and Tax) Bill late last year, the Parliament stipulated that both the matching and the source agencies table a comprehensive report on the first six months operation of the data matching program.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interim guidelines required these reports to include details of the costs and benefits flowing from the program; relevant non-financial factors; difficulties in the operation of the program; assessment of the program; and statistics relating to the accuracy of the matching process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that, from the information I have received and examined to date, it seems that this program has been operating relatively smoothly, with a minimal amount of intrusion into the privacy of individual Australians. A large proportion of the plaudits must go to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which examined the legislation in depth and in detail, and to the Senate itself, which passed amendments that significantly tightened the operational requirements of both the matching and source agencies. As the Privacy Commissioner stated in his interim report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act and the Guidelines impose on the data matching activity an unusual level of discipline and public accountability. In my view these requirements are justified by the degree of intrusion into individual privacy inherent in the program.</PARA>
<PARA>The efforts of the Privacy Commissioner and his staff who have overseen the operation of the program should not be underestimated. A prime example of their effectiveness occurred earlier in the year when the Matching Agency attempted to introduce DSS overpayment files to the data matching cycle to identify people in receipt of a benefit from one agency with a debt outstanding in another agency. The Privacy Commissioner recognised that the Act as currently drafted does not permit use of overpayment files in the data matching cycle and the Matching Agency was made to withdraw. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this example, the efforts of the designated staff in the Data Matching Agency should not be underestimated. From my examination of the Privacy Commissioner's interim report, it is obvious that significant efforts have been made to separate the data matching program from the Department of Social Security's normal operations. In light of the Opposition's qualms about the security of the computer systems to be used in this matching, I am gratified that substantive measures have been undertaken to ensure the security of the information produced by this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the available evidence may give honourable senators reason to be generally satisfied with the first six months of the operation of this Act, I believe a number of matters should be brought to the attention of the Senate. Firstly, it should be realised that the data matching program is still in its infancy. To my knowledge, a comprehensive data matching run has not yet been undertaken, hence the fact that two of the agencies, namely the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, have no results to report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first cycle did not entail income matching, while the income matching which was attempted during the second cycle had to be aborted due to technical problems. The lack of a comprehensive matching cycle means that Parliament is not yet in a position where it can properly assess the financial implications of this program, a matter of conjecture during the implementation of the legislation last year. Thankfully, the Privacy Commissioner will give us that opportunity in 12 months time before the sunset clause takes effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is important that all senators are aware that the data matching guidelines governing the operation of this program were tabled in the Senate on 8 October as a disallowable instrument. While they do not differ greatly from the interim guidelines, there is one important change to them. New guideline 7.4 allows source agencies to create permanent registers for the purpose of excluding individuals from being selected for investigation. Last year the Parliament was adamant that it would not allow the creation of a new separate permanent register or data bank of information relating to individuals whose information had been subject to the program. A significant portion of the Senate Committee's time was taken up discussing this concern. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) was adamant that no new register would be created. Hence the existence of interim guideline 7.1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the operational problems entailed in preventing an individual from needlessly being investigated time and time again. However, it concerns me that guideline 7.4, as it currently stands, allows for the register to be maintained by source agencies. I am yet to be convinced why it is not preferable for both operational and privacy reasons to have the matching agency receive updated lists of irrelevant re-selections from source agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that Social Security intends collecting many of the remaining required tax file numbers by way of a direct transfer between it and the Australian Taxation Office. Only last week a document leaked by the Taxation Office to the shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Howard, highlighted the continuing problems relating both to the fraudulent receipt of tax file numbers and the sloppy administration in the issuing of these numbers. I have provided the Privacy Commissioner with a copy of this document. He has continued to express concern about the integrity of the TFN. Despite the fact that such interdepartmental transfers appear to have legislative strength, the Senate should be very wary that appropriate safeguards are in place to overcome the problems that will result from the low integrity of the tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish to say that I would like to have the opportunity to witness a data matching cycle first hand. On the whole, I commend the officials who have been involved in the first six months operation of this program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the data matching program report for the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Honourable senators will note that in that report it is stated that the data matching program is to identify those persons receiving payments to which they are not entitled. The problem is that at present veterans who are entitled to payments are not receiving them. That is very largely due to current industrial problems in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. So, quite apart from trying to identify people who should not be receiving payments from the Department, we now have a situation where people who should be receiving payments are not getting them because of industrial action illegally being taken by the Public Sector Union in the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department's national computer centre is immobilised due to those work bans and this situation has been proceeding now for something like 13 days. At the moment all non-pension benefits and payments to health service providers have been stopped, and it means that there is a very real threat that the health agencies that are currently providing podiatry services, domiciliary nursing services and doctors may in fact end up withdrawing services to veterans. I remind honourable senators that we already have enormous unemployment problems in this country. Some of these domiciliary nurses in fact may be supporting families as sole parents. They may be the sole income earner in a two-parent family. It is disgraceful that people who have been providing services to the Department are not getting paid and people who are entitled to allowances because of their war service are not receiving payment, all because this computer centre is not doing the work it was set up to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in the Senate in answer to my question Senator Cook said he deplored these work bans and that the action of the PSU was not appropriate in the circumstances. But he was not prepared, as the Minister responsible for industrial relations for this Government, to tackle those Government employees who are not prepared to do the work for which they are being paid. It is ironic that, in a submission arguing for the retention of the national computer centre in the public sector, that union stated that one of the penalties of commercialisation would be `the loss of a loyal and dedicated staff who understand what the Department and its clients need'. What a sick quote that is in light of the fact that union members are preventing those clients from getting the services that they need. What has happened to the loyal and dedicated staff? Is it an ideological issue, whereby the union takes priority over the needs of the people who fought for our country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the actions of the PSU show a total lack of understanding of the needs of the veteran community, and I am astonished that a department with a history of caring for veterans has allowed the situation to develop to this stage. I am particularly concerned that we have the Minister responsible for industrial relations in this country prepared to sit back and let this thing continue when it has already gone on far too long. The union may have an argument with the Government over the privatisation of these computer facilities. That is not something which should be used to jeopardise the financial entitlements of people who fought for our country, nor for the people who provide services to those veterans. That is what has been allowed to continue for far too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we may be interested in what is happening to the data matching program in the Department of Veterans' Affairs and in knowing whether it is going to be able to identify people who are receiving payments to which they are not entitled, we are much more seriously concerned at this stage about those people who are entitled to payments who are not receiving them while the Government sits idly by.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This audit report shows that the concerns which the Opposition has been expressing for quite some time about the unemployment benefit and the administration of the unemployment benefit are clearly soundly based. This report by the Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An audit of the initiatives taken between 1988 and 1991 to improve the effectiveness of work/activity testing, and of the liaison between the two Departments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">showed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">measures introduced in 1989 and 1990 had not all been successful in meeting the objectives and budgetary savings set for them</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">staff in the CES network continue to hold the view that work/activity testing is not compatible with the primary job placement role of the CES, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the initiatives adopted by the DSS in 1990 to interview in greater numbers shorter and medium duration beneficiaries, and to make better use of related information and services from the CES network, although soundly designed, were not well implemented. This implies that related increases in staffing were not used effectively for the purpose provided.</PARA>
<PARA>It is hard to imagine a more damning report on such a vital issue than this Auditor-General's report. The measures have failed in what must be the most rapidly expanding area of government activity, that is, trying to look after the record numbers of unemployed people who are requiring assistance of one kind or another.  The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 1 July 1991, the enhanced Newstart and Job Search Allowances commenced. They, too, call for continuing close liaison between DSS and DEET, but have eliminated some of the previous problems.</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of that, the Auditor-General has made a series of recommendations about how this liaison&mdash;which has been so unsuccessful in the other areas I have referred to&mdash;could, in fact, be done better in the future. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO intends, within the next one or two years, to review the progress achieved in the areas covered by these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The facts are that millions of dollars are involved in this. For example, the report reveals:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction from 1 July 1989 of the revised procedures&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, for the work test&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was expected not only to double the number of Work Test breaches notified by CES to DSS to about 25 000 a year, but also to increase from 27% to as much as 100% the proportion of breaches resulting in UB cancellations by DSS, thereby leading to annual savings of $15m.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of Work Test Reports raised by CES in 1989-90 did not increase significantly, if at all, compared with 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA>According to DEET records, only 44 per cent of those reports&mdash;instead of 100 per cent&mdash;resulted in the cancellation of unemployment benefits. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence, the forecast savings of $15m do not appear to have been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the continuing story throughout this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of improved liaison between the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service, it says that proposals were agreed to by the Government in April 1989. They were expected to double the number of work test reports issued by CES each year and, as I have said, to increase to as much as 100 per cent the proportion of work test breaches resulting in cancellations of unemployment benefit. However, the ANAO found that the number of work test reports raised by the CES did not increase significantly, if at all, and unemployment benefit cancellations arising from these reports were substantially fewer than estimated. Hence, the forecast savings could not have been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other areas, with regard to the work test of persons who, post 13 November 1989, reduced employment prospects by moving, the audit conclusions were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two initiatives referred to in this section</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">were directed to target groups with particular characteristics associated with movement between geographical locations. Substantial difficulties were encountered at operational levels in the CES in applying the approved criteria in individual cases. The second of the two initiatives, relating to itinerants, was not proceeded with as planned, although a pilot study is said to be underway.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have another clear failure in the Government's attempts to resolve problems arising from claims by people who are highly mobile seeking unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another element of the report dealing with initiatives implemented by the Department of Social Security during 1990 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the audits in both States&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, both the States involved in this particular audit&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">disclosed that significant departures from procedures had occurred at regional offices. In particular:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow Minister for social security is in the chamber, I think it would be appropriate if I deferred to him as he may have a more intensive view of this report than I have. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>I would like to complete what I am saying by noting the Auditor-General's conclusions on the 1990 initiatives to try to improve things. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO concluded that shortcomings in the implementation of these policy initiatives at regional offices resulted in a standard of outcome less than could have been achieved if the Integrated Review Model procedures had been implemented more enthusiastically.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the continuing story, I suggest, of the failure of these two organisations to get together. The Audit Office concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a number of issues, as set out in the recommendations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which followed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are fundamental to the successful administration of the Newstart and Job Search Allowances. . . .The ANAO suggests that these recommendations be given the closest possible attention.</PARA>
<PARA>I think every senator should ask the Government to ensure that these recommendations to correct serious problems, as outlined by the Auditor-General, be accepted, particularly the general conclusion which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a principle weakness in the implementation of the Work/Activity Test has been the procedure requiring CES staff to make recommendations to DSS which (adversely) affect a client's entitlement to UB.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As departmental records show, the policy and procedural changes that were instituted in 1989 did not achieve the expectations for increased numbers of Work/Activity Test Reports, and prima facie did not increase significantly the number of resultant cancellations of UB.</PARA>
<PARA>I admit that the Government has set itself a huge task by creating such a high level of unemployment. There is no doubt that the Auditor-General finds its method of resolving these problems to be unsatisfactory to an unacceptable degree. I certainly urge the Government to accept the recommendations of the Auditor-General in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Audit Report No. 10 1991-92 confirms what anyone who has made even a cursory examination of the degree of cooperation and liaison between the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service would already know to be true. The Auditor-General's findings on the administration of the work test for the unemployment benefit are best summed up by the opening paragraph of the Australian National Audit Office's accompanying media release, from which I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO today called on the Departments of Social Security and Employment, Education Training to improve their liaison and cooperation in administering programs for the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>As the official number of unemployed moves closer and closer to 900,000, this report could hardly be more timely. This is particularly true when it is also remembered that the number of long term unemployed in Australia is now over 200,000 and climbing rapidly&mdash;so rapidly that the Department of Employment, Education and Training now estimates that by the end of next financial year there may be up to 350,000 Australians who have been unemployed for 12 months or longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This important report is helping the Government to make an assessment of whether these two departments have the necessary skills, expertise, training and coordination to cope with the massive number of unemployed people in Australia. When one considers that the current record number of unemployed is occurring at the same time as the two departments are implementing the recently enacted Newstart legislation, one can understand that the timeliness of this report is more evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly not surprised that the Auditor-General has urged that ongoing attention be given to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">providing training for staff involved in Newstart, particularly in conducting the intensive interviews and the preparation of activity agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>Less than five months ago when the Newstart legislation was debated in the Senate, coalition senators expressed grave concern about the ability of the DSS and CES to implement these changes in an efficient manner. On 4 June, in my speech during the second reading debate, I stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the full effect of those who have lost their jobs during this recession is felt, it is not unthinkable that the number of long term unemployed could reach 300,000 in the first half of 1992. This is the scenario facing a Commonwealth Employment Service which will be required to negotiate, update and check compliance with Newstart agreements that have been made with each and every person who has been unemployed for longer than 12 months. This will place an enormous strain on the staff and skill resources of the CES, but we have been given absolutely no indication of the number of recipients of Newstart agreements, nor has there been any convincing argument to show that the CES has sufficient resources to undertake this task effectively.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on in that speech I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been told that the officers undertaking negotiations will be at the ASO4 level. They must have an intimate knowledge of the process of negotiating these agreements and they must have the relevant people skills: patience; ability to listen; a genuine interest in the client's well-being; and an ability to communicate on the same level as the client. </PARA>
<PARA>Rather than saying, `I told you so', it is fairer to recognise that the Auditor-General has not directly criticised the implementation of the Newstart program by the CES but rather has stated that training in the implementation of Newstart be given the closest attention. In other words, he has recognised the very same concerns in relation to the effective implementation of the Newstart legislation as were put forward by the Opposition five months ago. He has recommended that quality assurance processes be developed in relation to the quality of CES interviews, Newstart activity agreements and assessments of compliance with the agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not surprised that the Auditor has urged that particular attention be given to the liaison between the DSS and CES for Newstart eligibility and continuing entitlement. Five months ago, when the Newstart legislation was causing considerable unrest in some parts of the community, it was revealed that a crosschecking of the records of DSS and CES found that 45,000 CES clients who were supposedly receiving the unemployment benefit were not actually receiving it. A number of reasons, some plausible and some implausible, have been offered to explain this discrepancy. However, the glaring problem that this revelation highlighted was the fact that the CES often fails to monitor whether people who are registered with it have found employment, even when such people have notified the Department of Social Security that they have found work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much song and dance lately from the would-be Labor leaders, the ACTU and Labor State Premiers that this Government should do something about the appalling unemployment situation. The Opposition remains adamant that the Government must immediately commence implementing the sorts of economic reforms which are required to turn around this massive unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Government should not forget that it is also very important to run its welfare and training programs for the unemployed in the most efficient way possible. This audit report is a reminder that there is still ample room for improvement both in the CES as well as in Senator Richardson's supposedly, in his own words, `trim, taut and terrific Department'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Auditor-General to which my colleagues have just referred is a devastating indictment of the inadequacies of both the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service in so far as the enforcement of the activity test is concerned. If one wanted to look for a better example of the sort of failed approach that people such as Senator Cook constantly endorse, one would find it in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all of the attitudinal testing programs and re-education courses that CES employees have been exposed to, this report makes it very clear that there is a high degree of intransigence, verging on insubordination, in the Commonwealth Employment Service. Despite what their political masters might say, the rank and file simply do not see it as their place to be engaged in any form of activity testing. They think they are much more important than that and that their job is one of placement. That is what they are on about, despite the fact that there are very few jobs available these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although ANZ figures suggest that something like 13,000 jobs a week are still available, if one goes into a CES office, as I have done on a number of occasions, one finds that it is like a morgue. There is virtually nothing on the boards and there is nothing to do. Yet we have the spectacle of these employees saying that they ought to be concentrating on job placement. They have time on their hands and they are perfectly placed to conduct activity testing if they were so minded. But the fact is that they are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In delightful bureaucratic understatement, the Australian National Audit Office makes it clear that this has reached the point of no return. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO concluded that, notwithstanding the substantial efforts devoted to improving review activities, the degree of success in achieving an appropriate level of performance in regional offices, and achieving a degree of consistency in performance levels between regional offices, has not been as successful as may have been expected.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a delightful understatement. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CES staff have held a strong belief that work testing and the consequences that flow from it are not compatible with the primary job placement role of the CES.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEET informed the ANAO that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The belief of incompatibility between work testing and the job placement role of the CES was acknowledged as prevalent within the CES network, but was not a belief shared by senior management.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, open warfare is being carried on with a government not in the slightest degree interested in resolving it in a proper manner. In most instances, the Government is simply allowing the PSU to ride roughshod over it as that union is now in the process of doing in relation to the Department of Veterans' Affairs dispute over the contracting out of computer facilities. Undoubtedly we will see that happen in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that the CES by its actions has forfeited any claim to ongoing relevance. The fact is that 62 per cent of DSS and CES officers are already collocated. We have had many claims that this process is moving apace and that moves towards full amalgamation are being expedited. The fact is that they are being frustrated constantly by the CES. This simply underlines the need for a fundamental overhaul and a rationalisation of activities. An independent CES in these circumstances is a luxury that we cannot afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that if ever there were an indictment of the pace of change which this Government is so fond of endorsing, despite the fact that we fall further behind the pace every day, it would be this. There has been an inordinate amount of lead-up time and every opportunity to re-educate the troops, yet here we have a report that has come in months after the activity tests are supposed to be in place and enforced under the Newstart agreements. We have virtually a strike on our hands. That should not be tolerated, yet this Government seems quite relaxed about the fact. It has turned its active employment strategy into a farce. It has been replaced by an act of Public Service resistance strategy in particular areas&mdash;not much less than a guerilla campaign in places such as DVA. This makes it clear that the CES has no claim to stay in the game. It is no longer relevant to an active employment strategy if one is serious in pursuing that objective, and this process could be taken over readily by the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time in some years, the number of males registered as in receipt of Jobsearch allowance and Newstart allowance is some 15,000 in excess of the current number of males registered with the Australian Bureau of Statistics as unemployed. That situation has not pertained for quite some time. It is not explained by any discernible shift to male part time employment, which might otherwise provide some explanation for the figures. But it suggests that the activity test is simply not being enforced and that what we are seeing is a continuing reluctance, bordering on refusal, to cooperate in a policy which supposedly has been determined by the Government and senior officers of the Service but which the rank and file refuse to implement. I would have thought that that was signing one's own death warrant, but it has not happened to date. Certainly it does not justify any more expense on attitudinal change, staff training and the management effort needed to achieve the necessary degree of attitudinal change. According to the Audit Office, it is sheer self-indulgence, not likely to get anywhere, not necessary and well past the point when it should have been relevant. For all those reasons, the Auditor-General's report makes crystal clear the deficiencies and what should happen with the continuing separation of these two services in future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1991-92, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers' Conference and Loan Council meeting on 31 May 1991. The Bill will replace the State Grants (General Purposes) Act 1990 and its provisions closely follow those of that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current estimate of general purpose funding for the States and the Northern Territory under the Bill totals $13,734 million, or about 13 per cent of estimated Commonwealth budget outlays in 1991-92. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's budget. In combination with the global borrowing limits agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they also have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of State governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years there have been significant real reductions in payments to the States and in the size of their global borrowing limits. These reductions in payments and borrowings have been a key part of the Commonwealth strategy to ensure a continuing process of fiscal consolidation by encouraging restraint in expenditure at all levels of government but, at the same time, targeting that restraint so that the burden is shared equitably and sensibly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We acknowledge that in recent years the States have borne substantial real adjustments in the level of Commonwealth assistance. Against that background, and in response to requests from the States for greater certainty in funding levels for the purpose of planning their medium term budget strategies, the Commonwealth agreed at the 1990 Premiers' Conference and Loan Council meeting to maintain the level of general revenue assistance in real terms for the three years 1991-92 to 1993-94. This commitment was subject to the qualification that Australia not suffer a major deterioration in its economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the 1991 conference, the Commonwealth agreed to honour that undertaking, notwithstanding the sharp slowdown in economic activity and the consequent deterioration in its own budgetary position. In return the States undertook to focus their adjustment efforts on restraint in current outlays and to consider increases in taxes and non-routine increases in tax charges only as very much a last resort. This undertaking has been honoured by the States in their 1991-92 budgets, and the Government is confident that excessive increases in State taxes and charges will not threaten to erode the substantial progress we have made in reducing inflationary pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the assistance to be provided under this Bill is in the form of general revenue grants, which are currently estimated to be $13,382 million in 1991-92. By far the larger part of this amount comprises financial assistance grants, but it also includes special revenue assistance to the Northern Territory and a separate new, interim, category of assistance, namely `identified road funding' which gives effect to the October 1990 special Premiers' Conference decision to untie local road funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the arrangements in previous years, financial assistance grants, special revenue assistance and identified road funding will all be adjusted for the difference between the actual increase in the Consumer Price Index in the year to the March quarter 1992 and the forecast at the time of the Premiers' Conference, so that the real level of assistance agreed at the conference is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial assistance grants are to be distributed on the basis of the Grants Commission's updated per capita relativities based on the five year review period included in the Commission's 1991 report. As in recent years, the relativities are applied to a combined pool of financial assistance grants and the base level of hospital funding grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted earlier, the Northern Territory is to be provided with special revenue assistance in 1991-92. Similar special assistance has been provided to the Northern Territory in each year since its inclusion in the pool of general revenue assistance for the States. In line with the intention to progressively move the Northern Territory to a financial basis comparable with the States, the base level of this assistance has been reduced from $50 million in 1990-91 to $40 million in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to the identified road funding to be appropriated under this Bill, while the greater part of the funds for local roads that are now untied are paid to local government there remains a small amount of these funds which, under the agreed arrangements for 1991-92, are to be paid to State, rather than local, governments. This Bill will authorise those payments. The overall distribution of these funds between the States reflects the existing distributional principles pertaining to previous tied grant arrangements. The arrangements for payments to local government bodies in 1991-92 were incorporated in amendments to the Local Governments (Financial Assistance) Act passed by Parliament last June. This will make a modest, but nonetheless significant, contribution to enhancing State and local government budgetary flexibility. The final arrangements to apply beyond 1991-92 will be determined with an eye, inter alia, to the implications of other such changes in Commonwealth-State financial relations which might be agreed in the context of the current special Premiers' Conference review processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for the payment of $296.8 million in interest free capital grants to the States and the Northern Territory. This is the same amount as provided in 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No provision is made in this Bill for payments of general purpose assistance to the Australian Capital Territory (Act). However, provisions in Appropriation Bill No. 2 allow for analogous payments to be made to the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill is an integral part of the Commonwealth's financial relations with the State Governments and the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the committee stage of the Bill in the other place, the Government amended the Bill, to complement an amendment within the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill. The amendment as part of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill is in response to a request from the Victorian State Government to transfer the State's share of the responsibility for funding the higher education program at the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has primary responsibility for funding higher education. Victoria's funding of a proportion of the college's higher education program therefore represents a departure from funding arrangements which apply to other Commonwealth funded higher education institutions. The Victorian Government is preparing to introduce legislation to enable the college to become part of the University of Melbourne as agreed by the institutions. The college's funding arrangements represent the last remaining issue to be resolved in order that this merger may proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill reduces the financial assistance grants, in the case of the State of Victoria, by the amount of some $2.5m. The effect of this amendment, in conjunction with the financial adjustment to increase the maximum grants to higher education institutions as part of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, is to providce for the college's higher education program to be funded fully through the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 as from 1 January 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Together, the amendments to the two Bills will mean no net change to total Commonwealth outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the related explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Parer would know, and as we discussed in the Committee process, the management of Comcar has been the focus of an evaluation by Price Waterhouse Urwick. We have had preliminary discussions with PWU and discussions on a preliminary report of which I think the final version will be coming to me on the 12th of this month. As part of their process, they have managed to determine that there is about 10 or 15 per cent excess capacity in the management side of the organisation. It may in fact go to 20 per cent, but 15 per cent is a reasonable figure to anticipate them coming to us with. So, the area has been one of concern, and we have focused on it by the use of outside management consultants. The final report should arrive soon and it would be my intention to have that report implemented as soon as possible. I would expect, given the sorts of tasks that are involved, a target date of something like February next year or thereabouts should be set by us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I preface my remarks on Comcar by saying that when I was involved in local government we were required to consider many large budgets and very controversial issues, and most of them used to go through the keeper of the accounts with council. But whenever the question of cars was raised, it always became an issue that everyone knew something about. I noted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 16 October that in your party room, Madam Temporary Chairman, it supposedly took 45 minutes of the allotted 90 minutes of Caucus to deal with complaints about the threat to the luxury chauffeured limousine service. It went on to say that members whinged about having to take taxis instead of white LTDs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the Comcar situation, like your colleagues, I presume. I believe Comcar provides an excellent service in ways which I do not believe taxis can. The drivers work late at night and in particular provide security which I do not believe hire cars can. Certainly security of the passengers and the quality of the drivers are first rate. They are required in some circumstances to drive at high speeds. The reason I raise this is that I had the luxury of having had an opportunity to test out its new skid pan simulator in Hobart recently. I am pleased to say that I have a certificate to prove that I have passed most of the tests applying to those car drivers, not that I would ever be a threat to them. However, I would like to compliment Comcar on the purchase of the $40,000 skid pan simulator which I believe it will be hiring out to other areas of government for driver training. It goes to show that the Comcar <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>operation does require an extra skill of its drivers and does provide security, as I mentioned earlier. I feel quite sorry for Comcar because many of the losses incurred have been brought about by the sale of assets and in having to lease back cars and premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following on from Senator Parer's question, I ask about the casual drivers.

The honourable senator, having made those comments, can be sure his car will arrive on time, unlike Senator Ray's. However, I think he raises a pertinent point. When one looks at the cost of providing the service to the Commonwealth, the figures indicate that, from the financial year 1985-86 to now, there has been about a $4m reduction in providing the service. So, things have not been moving, as would appear in the press, in one direction at all times&mdash;in a bad direction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we are to take this back to the genesis of the problem, Comcar, as the Committee would know, has been an evolving organisation and one that has been commercialised over recent years. As part of that process it has had to work out new accounting and billing procedures; it has also been involved; and it is evolving with greater access to computerisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the aspects that has been focused upon in the scrutiny that I and others have applied to Comcar is to segment the sorts of work that Comcar does and to work out where the losses and profits accrue. In that process it is fair to say that we have discovered that in contracting out we may have been subsidising other departments by not charging sufficiently for the service we provide. That is a matter that has been focused upon now and could have come to light only with the greater scrutiny of the sorts of products Comcar provides and what we charge for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I also said in the committee process, it would be easy for us to raise our prices to cover those charges. However, it is imperative for us to ensure that prices are increased only when we have taken all steps to ensure that the organisation is as lean and as efficient, particularly on the management side, as it could be. That is why at this stage work is still going on to scrutinise the sorts of products that are provided and where the losses accrue, to ensure that, in the sorts of work we charge for, at the end of the day we do not lose on contracting out and that those sorts of situations do not continue. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. One of the problems with the Comcar service is that it now depends increasingly upon more sporadic work. Over recent years a decision has been made that, where government departments have access to transport, they can use facilities such as Cabcharge or hire cars. It is fair to say that, because of that, much of the bread and butter work, much of the backbone of the work of Comcar, has gone to other areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances where we have the sporadic demands of Parliament sitting, without a lot of the work we had in the past, it would be totally inefficient to maintain the sort of organisation we had in the past which would have catered for the peak work load demanded by the House sitting. That is essentially why, given the increase in the burden on Comcar because of the sporadic nature of the work, we have had to move towards casuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Knowles mentioned, it happened again last night. We are increasingly picking up the 30 casual drivers we think we need to cater for a lot of the work that is going on here. Short of maintaining an expanded army of Comcar for the peak period that is demanded when Parliament sits, we have little option. We cannot maintain a high level of work force in this place to satisfy the demands of the Parliament and then have that staff with little to do when Parliament is not sitting, for instance. The mix between permanent, full time, permanent casual and private contract work will evolve to a settled formula over a short period, but we really have no option. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would expect that that is a factor involved and it is a step that has had to be taken. As Senator Calvert would know, in the past if a 10-hour break was not utilised by a driver the wages for the next day were at double time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is fair to say that an award prevails in the transport industry, although the extent to which that is applied by employers is another matter. We probably have all had the same experience driving home late at night from this place or in other cities. There is an award but we cannot enforce it; it is very much up to the union and the drivers involved. An important aspect is that in many instances we are talking about owner-drivers. In those circumstances, they can complain to no-one but themselves. We cannot enforce it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This also raises a problem that should be placed on the record. It is very easy to compare Comcar prices with, for instance, the private sector and say that we might charge $4 or $5 an hour more or whatever. However, more often than not we find that those with whom we are compared do not apply the award rates and conditions. So there is not a level playing field in a comparison of Comcar's charges with those in the private sector. I should not say that as a broad generalisation because obviously it does not apply to everyone in the private sector, but we are finding that amongst some competitors. We are also finding instances of predatory pricing, where prices are being reduced in order to obtain a component of work, but with either consequent price increases or anticipated consequent price increases further down the track. The end result is that Comcar is being squeezed in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these matters are before us, and come before us continually. The manager of Comcar, the Department and I really cannot take a general approach. I would like to stress one point:  when we look at Comcar and the rationale for its existence&mdash;Senator Knowles made mention of the fact that we are the ones who may suffer when the drivers do not have a 10-hour break&mdash;we have to keep in mind that the service is not just here for parliamentarians; it is not just a delivery service of bodies to and from this place. The Commonwealth also has to maintain this capacity for security reasons.

For instance, if we kept on staff only the number of drivers that we need for the level of work that is always on hand, Comcar could run at a profit. However, if we did that, we would have nowhere near the number of drivers that are required whenever Parliament sits. It would mean that there would be nowhere near the capacity that might be required for special visits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sporadic nature of the work, the fact that we do not have owner-drivers and the fact that we do play the game by the rules to ensure that customers' security is protected makes Comcar a little different and imposes costs on it. The fact that Comcar has to go through a process such as this, where it is accountable not only to the Parliament but also to a Minister and is subject to a degree of scrutiny, also imposes costs on the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while going back to the point that I made earlier. Hire care drivers get paid a percentage of the take. We should keep in mind that hire car prices vary around Australia. In some instances a profit is not made. I am told that there have been a number of recent bankruptcies in the industry in New South Wales. It is not an easy industry to assess. More importantly, as I said before, there is no level playing field. On the one hand one might say that Comcar does not pay tax on fuel or other items but on the other hand there are other costs. Comcar has a problem in that it has a sporadic level of work for which it has to make some allowances in its overall cost structure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is probably one of the most futile suggestions that I have heard in terms of picking up work. Productivity depends on a number of things. For instance, last week in Adelaide a driver told me that he had alerted his customers to a number of services and booking procedures that could be used. I have not had a chance to talk to management to see what has been done in this regard. Senator Knowles's question and my answer has probably put management on notice to follow up such suggestions.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is something that management as well will also have to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marketing does not stop at the personal level; the whole organisation has a role. However, I think drivers can be helpful and more productive if they have direct contact with customers. I think that covers the thrust of the question.</PARA>

<PARA>but, like many of us, I am also a consumer. I have to say that the marketing of Comcar leaves much to be desired on a purely monetary basis. For example, when I go to the bush in Western Australia I have the choice of taking a Comcar or a hire car. If the hire car costs the taxpayer considerably less than a Comcar, I will take the hire car every time. The reality is that Comcar is pricing itself out of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not care how much marketing Comcar does. If at the end of the day Comcar costs more for the same job, people will try to make their dollar go further and take the less expensive service. Maybe that is what is happening here. I might just ask another question:  what is the ratio of supervisors cum managers to drivers in Canberra and on a State by State basis?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question Senator Parer raises is one that has been bashed around for some time. The consistent advice the Australian Government Solicitor has been giving us is that a fair and just standard for liability in IT contracts is to let the common law principles apply to both contracting parties. We have moved slightly from this principle in a few recent contracts by placing a cap on liability for some elements of the risk, although common law principles still apply to the major elements of risk.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise the question of the existence in subprogram 3.7 of the National Media Liaison Service. As honourable senators would be aware, one of the key purposes of Estimates committees is to enable senators to scrutinise expenditures and the operations of a department within a portfolio. I make the comment&mdash;because it has been referred to in the report to the Senate of Estimates Committee D&mdash;that we have this most unusual situation where the National Media Liaison Service is funded within the Department of Administrative Services but is not responsible to the Minister for Administrative Services.</PARA></TALK.START>

Similarly, even though the National Media Liaison Service is responsible to Minister Kelly, people on other Estimates committees&mdash;because there are no appropriations in it&mdash;do not have the capacity to question the Minister in respect of the operation of the National Media Liaison Service.

Laurie Oakes wrote an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 15 August 1989 entitled `People in Glass Houses'. He talks about the preceding organisation to NMLS, which was the Government Information Unit. That organisation was also structured and paid for in the same way. Basically, it has been done this way because the staff of the NMLS are employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act and, as a consequence, the Department of Administrative Services pays for them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to go on further in respect of the payment to the staff of the Leader of the Australian Democrats, which comes under subprogram 3.7. I put in a reservation about this matter. We hear a lot about honesty, the opposite of which is corruption. We have heard a lot from the Democrats in the past about `keeping the bastards honest'. In more recent times, the Leader of the Democrats has referred to the other parties as being beyond redemption. Of course, he is correct in reference to this worn out Labor Government that, through its Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), it has forfeited any claims to honesty and integrity. But honesty and integrity are fine words. The test, however, is what happens in practice. The worst form of corruption is when the public purse is being pilfered for purposes which are not related to the Parliament and/or the electoral responsibilities of members of parliament. That is the reason for the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland, which attracted so much attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Estimates committee hearings, the matter of Mr Bill Scetrine, who was on the staff of the then Leader of the Australian Democrats, was raised. Over a nine-month period, he received an amount of $59,212.77 in overtime; $2,965.50 in meal allowance; $17,723.40 in travel allowance; and a Comcar charge of $8,834.91. That makes a total of $88,736.58 just in extras. If one adds to that the approximate salary for nine months, it reaches a total of $112,736.58. There have been all sorts of stories around the corridors of this place about the final resting place of some or all of that money. As they are unsubstantiated rumours, it would be improper for me to air them here under privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there can be a fine line between what is right and what is wrong. While there is nothing illegal about it, what is morally wrong is that Mr Pass&mdash;who, as I understand it, is the Leader of the Democrats in Victoria&mdash;was on the payroll of the Leader of the Democrats and collected some $18,000 in overtime.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have recently discovered in these sorts of matters&mdash;and the Blunt case is one that comes very much to mind&mdash;in the first instance departmental officers obviously scrutinise the conduct, the activity, and they then raise it either directly with the member or with me.

I also note that recently in the Parliament we had tabled a special report dated September 1991 on the Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In turning to the detail of the answers provided, I note that the community electoral assistants are paid only for their training and for the periods in which they are hired for the duration of elections. In one of the answers&mdash;I believe it is in 5(c)&mdash;it is noted that as at 30 August 1991 in excess of 400 community electoral assistants were in place in Aboriginal and Islander communities and organisations.

I also note that in the seven or eight years of the operation of this scheme, the Commission has expended $7.27m on this program. Therefore, it has been an expensive exercise training and facilitating the operation of this scheme, and 400 of these people are now in place in organisations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that all 14 electorates I nominated can be identified as remote, rural, disadvantaged and the most significant Aboriginal populations in Australia. What concerns me more is that the activity of the Australian Electoral Commission, in eight years of operation with a budget in excess of $7m, has been focused primarily in those seven seats held by the Australian Labor Party. That is a serious omission and is a serious disadvantage to the Aboriginal constituents of Australia who ought to be well served. In some way, it invites comparisons and questions of political involvement in the processing of how these decisions have come about. Similarly, if one looks at the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the numbers of Aboriginal people identified by electorate in the capital cities, one will see that it is very easy to note that there is no large migration of Aboriginal people back into the capital cities. Yet obviously that is the focus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be pleased to receive the list of the identifying 400 positions of trainees to see where the training and evaluation for these people rests in respect of the majority electorates, whether they are located in the seven significant Labor Party seats, and to what degree there has been an emphasis in activity. I note in the detailed answer to the question referring to the workshops that have been carried out that they also arise in Labor held seats of the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can change the emphasis slightly, I note that there is to be an expansion of the activity in this area to concentrate on State and local government priorities. Again, I can appreciate that the local government area is similar to the ATSIC consideration. I fully expect the Electoral Commission to concentrate activities in local government areas that can be identified as having significant numbers of Aboriginal voters. What identification work has the Commission carried out to identify those local government municipalities in Australia? How have they been identified by Aboriginal population and voter numbers? How have the priorities been worked out for future activity in that area? Is it to arise only in the seven significant Labor held Federal areas that have received the obvious advantage of this very significant and important program to date?</PARA>

It is simply that the emphasis will remain on Commonwealth elections but that attention will be given, within the areas already designated, to local government election matters as they arise, as persons take an interest in them or, I suppose, as an election is coming up. But it is not that a separate detailed program has been devised based on local government areas with respect to the education of Aboriginal persons within those areas as to their rights and opportunities under the voting regime that might apply there.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will always be areas of criticism because of the controversial nature of this large and important portfolio. The evolution of development in many Aboriginal communities is not uniform, nor should it be, and many problems will arise. The main matter that this chamber has a responsibility to address is the fact that the portfolio figures indicate that there is well in excess of an estimated expenditure of over $600m on the portfolio related activities in this area. That is a large investment of taxpayers' funds. From time to time there will be criticisms where projects fail, where administration may not be effective or where, for other reasons, maladministration, ineptitude and in some case even fraud take place. We must address these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I say that the portfolio identified area is in excess of $600m, I point out that there is a considerable amount of additional expenditure in the Aboriginal community that is proper, routine and additional.

In answer to my questions, I have received eight pages of detail, which is quite comprehensive, in attempting to reconcile the portfolio expenditure with the Budget related papers.

Whilst the very comprehensive eight-page document is certainly available to anyone who seeks to look at it, there were two tables in this particular issue, on page 2 and on page 7, which I think were important statements in attempting to reconcile the papers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having dealt with the issues arising from the reconciliation of the various documents put forward, I would like to pursue several other matters with regard to some questions that I asked at the Estimates Committee with regard to the activities and financial administration of an Aboriginal organisation at Tennant Creek, the Anyinginyi Congress, which basically is a health provider for Aboriginal people. I was given a four-part comprehensive answer with regard to the various stages of budgeting, objectives and evaluations of the programs at that time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Anyinginyi Congress, there are two elements in the response: firstly, the Congress is scheduled for health performance review as part of ATSIC's cyclical assessment process, and this review will be undertaken in accordance with normal procedures and will commence as soon as a suitable independent consultant can be assigned. With regard to the second aspect, which relates more directly to the matter Senator Tambling raised about the specific allegations concerning the financial operations of the organisation, the accounting firm of Pannell Kerr Forster will undertake a separate review of accounts of the Congress. Originally the review was to commence today, 5 November. However, due to traditional mourning ceremonies within the region, the accountancy review will now commence in the week beginning 11 November. That is the information I have on the first matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With regard to the second matter&mdash;if Senator Tambling will forgive me, I will call it JORC for want of opting out of the pronunciation of the original Aboriginal name&mdash;there has been concern about continued breaches of grant reporting conditions and, as a consequence, ATSIC has imposed additional conditions on JORC with a view to a full financial and performance review of its operations in June of this year. That review identified further breaches of ATSIC grant funding and led to a submission to the ATSIC meeting No. 12 in August this year. The Commission at its meeting in August determined that JORC could continue to receive funding subject to certain stringent conditions, one of which was that the regional manager needed to be satisfied that financial and physical reports are available to indicate that the grant moneys are being correctly applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Office of Local Government Tennant Creek branch recently initiated a review of JORC management following receipt of a substantial list of allegations of mismanagement. On the basis of advice received from the Office of Local Government, the Commission served notice on JORC that further grant releases were being withheld and that it intended to commission the firm of Pannell Kerr Forster to carry out a detailed investigation in view of continued breaches of Commission grant conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investigation commenced on 9 October. On 24 October the report was provided indicating that JORC had used Commission moneys for unapproved purposes and that there was evidence of gross mismanagement and deliberate breaches of grant conditions. On 30 October the Commission sent two of its senior central office staff to Tennant Creek to work with local staff to develop a strategy to address the findings and recommendations of the Pannell Kerr Forster report, that is, the accountancy firm's report. This report from the officers was received in the Commission's central office yesterday and is currently being considered. Commission decisions on the report, I am advised, are imminent and there is an awareness of the need to take immediate action. I am also informed that the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations, who has responsibility for administering the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 under which the JORC is incorporated, is issuing JORC with a notice under section 68 of that Act requesting the public officer to show cause why the Registrar should not investigate JORC's affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I look forward to receiving the information that Senator McMullan has indicated will subsequently be reported on this particular matter. It is obvious to me as a senator for the Northern Territory that there is an obvious and major and significant problem in the Barkly region and the Tennant Creek office of ATSIC. The fact that it is acknowledged that there are necessary inquiries in the case of the Anyinginyi Congress and the Jurnkurakurr outstation resource centre is of major concern. It would appear that it is acknowledged that misappropriations are in excess of $1m in at least one of those programs which is now under major inquiry and review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, when events such as this come to our attention, the tragedy is that the persons affected most are the Aboriginal people who rely so heavily on the services of these organisations. Anyinginyi Congress was established to provide essential health care for the Aboriginal people of Tennant Creek and the Barkly region. The Jurnkurakurr Outstation Resource Centre was established to provide a necessary infrastructure and community services facility for thousands of Aboriginal people in a remote, isolated and often desert type area. For such allegations even to be made and subsequent problems to arise means that it is these very Aboriginal people who live in such isolated and unfortunate circumstances who are missing out on the benefits of the funds that have been appropriated through this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two programs that I alluded to, which the Parliamentary Secretary was not able to provide information on at this stage&mdash;that is, grant funds for municipal and local government functions at Elliott and Borroloola, and for three very significant employment related programs of the CDEP in the Barkly region&mdash;are also in question. Here are two areas of municipal functions which it is important to recognise go to the very provision of essential health services&mdash;be it public health facilities&mdash;and other community services. Whilst the CDEP is, in effect, a workfor the dole situation, it provides excellent facilities in many areas. The fact that these have all had to be called into question raises some major problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that they are receiving the close attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Tickner; the Federal member for the Northern Territory, Mr Snowdon; and my Senate colleague Senator Collins; all of whom, I am sure, share with me a major concern when we talk about the misappropriation of millions of dollars in this particular area. I hope that in the next few days we will see this matter addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did seek from the Minister's office earlier this week a briefing on these particular matters. My staff requested it initially, I subsequently followed up with more formal requests and I was annoyed that today, following subsequent follow-ups, I received a message that I would now have to put my comments and request for a briefing on this matter in writing. I would have hoped that because the matters are so very serious Minister Tickner would have responded much more promptly, and sought to acknowledge that this is a very serious service delivery matter that could affect not only the lifestyle, but also the very lives, of many people who may well be threatened if health care is not properly delivered. I hope that we will get a satisfactory report from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at an early date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The very nature of the material we are discussing means there is not a lot I can say in response to Senator Tambling's contribution&mdash;essentially, he was making a statement for the record&mdash;but I do want to say two things. I acknowledge the seriousness of the two initial matters which he raised and to which I gave a comprehensive response. They are serious and worthy of consideration. In the other two areas I cannot at this stage even confirm that the problems to which Senator Tambling refers exist. We all have to be a bit careful about leaping from real problems in one area to assuming that all the expressions of concern and allegations that one hears&mdash;and we all hear them in lots of areas of public life&mdash;are necessarily accurate. That is not to say they are not true either; it is a matter of saying let us show some discretion about that.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not want to leap to opposite conclusions and say that because I do not have any evidence that there is a problem, there is not one. I simply want to make sure that we are not leaping from two real concerns to assuming that every other potential area of concern is as serious as the allegations made about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few general comments on the ATSIC program. I noticed in this year's Senate Estimates Committee hearings that ATSIC officers stated in response to questions that certain funded programs were the responsibility of former departments of Aboriginal Affairs or the ADC, and that ATSIC is not responsible. I appreciate that ATSIC should not be held responsible for some of the failures of DAA and ADC, but it goes against the grain a little if ATSIC continues to make what certainly can be perceived in some areas as the same mistakes as the DAA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two matters which I wish to comment on relate to the responses given to the questions I placed on notice. My staff went to considerable lengths to ensure that questions were divided into program, subprogram and component order, as were the wishes of this Committee. Consequently, I was a trifle unhappy to see that ATSIC answered questions in a format which was very difficult to match with the questions, as the program numbers in some cases were not provided. The work of the Committee of the Whole is severely hampered because a number of questions asked of ATSIC and DEET have not yet been answered. In future, the Committee should take care to ensure that the bulk of questions have been answered and that a certain amount of time has elapsed to ensure that adequate attention has been paid to the answers provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins is now the Minister at the table and I can tell him, in case he is not aware of it, that I was able to have a very brief discussion with Senator McMullan.

Senator McMullan was kind enough to agree that these questions should be placed on notice, so I place those questions on notice. I have a number of questions on the ATSIC program ranging from land management to law and justice. I have had the chance to have a brief, informal discussion with the officers. My questions will require somewhat fuller answers than can be given by the Minister at the table and it might be better if I put these questions on notice as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some questions relating to page 2 of the Estimates Committee E report to the Senate about the Attorney-General's Department. There is a general reservation by the whole Committee in relation to Copyright Agency Ltd. During the Estimates Committee questions were raised as to whether the Attorney-General's Department had had any negotiations with Copyright Agency Ltd, a private company set up in this country which collects copyright licence fees from a variety of people, not the least of which are our tertiary institutions, and then allegedly distributes those licence fees so collected to the people who earn them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time there has been concern that, because the copyright laws in Australia contain a particular exception relating to journalists, they might wish to claim what I understand&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;to be some sort of residual copyright that the journalists have in articles of theirs that are printed in newspapers. By that I mean that if Michelle Grattan were to write articles for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> and was paid a salary package and if the articles were used for anything other than reprinting in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> or within the newspaper group by which she is employed, the general law is that, unless she has contracted out of that, she has some copyright in those articles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has particular consequences for a wide variety of people who might like to use photostat copies of the articles in question. The journalist need not be Michelle Grattan; it might be Beverley Sutherland Smith, who is the food writer for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. Unless Beverley Sutherland Smith has a particular contract with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, that newspaper would not be able to publish a collected series of her works without having some additional negotiations with her as to the copyright left in the articles because they are being used for something other than printing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One immediately thinks of people in the Parliamentary Library as being the sort of people who might be affected by this.  Everyone in this chamber and anyone listening would be aware of the use parliamentarians make of photostat articles from the newspapers. Not only the Parliamentary Library provides such a service; a lot of departments also have their own libraries and their own newspaper clipping services. Articles that are relevant to departmental purposes are clipped from newspapers across Australia. They are photostatted and distributed throughout the department, perhaps to various members of the perceived client group, and certainly to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Copyright Agency Ltd has not been set up by the Government; it is an independent company that has, as I understand it, the signatures of about 300 journalists, which certainly does not include all the journalists in this country. Through the Estimates Committee we found that it has approached the Attorney-General's Department and said, `We want to negotiate with you about the copying of our articles'. The initial gambit was that it wanted 10c per page. This is not an easy matter for a variety of reasons. For instance, not every article written by a journalist carries that journalist's by-line. How is someone to know whether something that is being copied is an article the copyright agency for which is held by Copyright Agency Ltd. If there is no by-line, we do not know who wrote it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the Copyright Agency Ltd response to this is, `Just give us 10c a page for every page and then there will not be that problem'. That is fine for the Copyright Agency Ltd, but it is not fine for the journalists who have not signed up with this agency. They might say, `Over and above what you give to them, if I can show that that is my article I want some money for it'&mdash;to say nothing of the copyright element that is left with the newspaper proprietor in the photocopying of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am informed, Copyright Agency Ltd has said that it wants 10c a page.

I am well aware of the fact that aNiMaLS frequently copies, if not my booklet then a lot of work put out by members of the Opposition, members of the Government and a whole lot of other people, without a whisker of concern for who owns the copyright. That is a matter for aNiMaLS to worry about. When asked about this, they said that it was not their problem; they did not actually clip articles. I am not sure that that is the whole truth, but that is what we were told. They deal with a clipping agency, the name of which escapes me. </PARA>

If I make an arrangement with Copyright Agency Ltd, all it will do is cover me for the use of the copyright for the journalists for which it is agent; it will not cover me for every other Tom, Dick and Harry journalist around. It will certainly not cover me for the use of the work of Senator Macdonald, Senator Hill, Senator Reid, Senator Walters, nay, even the work of the good Minister. It will not cover me for that; but if it did cover me for that&mdash;that is, everything that I ever wanted a photostat of in my life&mdash;which only a halfwit or a grade 2 child who had had this half explained to him would imagine to be the case, it would certainly not cover anyone to whom I passed those articles. The understanding of aNiMaLS is, `Oh well, we have got it from someone who is covered'. It is questionable whether that is so, but it thinks that, because it has got it from someone who is covered, it is covered too. That is clearly not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to this at some length because I want to highlight the degree of concern there should be over anybody negotiating with Copyright Agency Ltd as though it were the agent for all authors, as though an agreement with it as to copyright covered an agreement for all the people for whom it is not agents. It does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the first point. The second point is that it just happens to be a fortune or misfortune&mdash;I am not sure which; my view fluctuates on this on a day to day basis&mdash;as to the regard in which the legal profession is held in this community. By and large, it is held in high rather than low regard, and Copyright Agency Ltd knows that. That is why it has started to negotiate with the Attorney-General's Department. If it can say `The Attorney-General's Department&mdash;the people who have some say and some sort of guidance to offer in the construction of copyright law in this country&mdash;has agreed that we should be paid 10c a page', it would be no surprise to me if other departments and government instrumentalities did not fall over like ninepins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who would they be to say that the Attorney-General's Department was wrong? They would have to have pretty confident legal advice to say, `The Attorney-General's Department&mdash;a bunch of whackers yet again'. I do not say that that is the common view; it certainly is not. I raise it because it is a very uncommon view. I expect that other departments and government instrumentalities would think very seriously about saying no to something that the Attorney-General's Department has said yes to. In the Estimates Committee I found that the Attorney-General's Department has commenced negotiations with Copyright Agency Ltd. I am very concerned about that because of the precedent it creates for every other department and government instrumentality, let alone private enterprise. I think it is an appalling situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have been told, the Copyright Agency Ltd has dropped the 10c a page, whether or not it has the agency for these people, and we have forgotten about that technicality. Despite the fact that Copyright Agency Ltd is claiming this money on the basis of a technicality, it forgets the technicality that it does not have agency for everyone. Madam Temporary Chairman, if you were able to speak from the chair, I would ask you what you think it was asking as an alternative.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that there is some attraction in the idea that if we can channel lawfully required payments into one organisation, which can then disburse them to its members or to those on whose behalf it acts, that is an efficiency gain&mdash;at least so far as the payment to that one organisation rather than to many authors is concerned. </PARA>

On the whole, all I can say is that this is an attempt by the Attorney-General's Department to see how the Commonwealth might discharge its lawful obligations.

One does not have to have an agent if one does not want one, and one certainly does not have to have the Copyright Agency Ltd if one does want an agent. Why does the Minister say that this is the body to which people ought to belong? Is it because by a happy accident it has the monopoly in the market at the moment, and the Minister and his Department are happy to encourage that?</PARA>

I was simply saying that that was the way in which the Department was approaching this very preliminary and early stage in the negotiations. I give great weight to the sorts of considerations which Senator Vanstone has raised. Certainly, the authors and journalists of Australia cannot be hijacked by a group purporting to represent them and act on their behalf in these negotiations. That is absolutely right. If this were to be, if not the exclusive, certainly the premier, primary or most common channel through which payments were made, I do not believe the Commonwealth could reach that point without being absolutely satisfied that, as far as authors are concerned, this body is properly constituted to fulfil their expectations of representation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to hear that from the Minister, although all it convinces me of is that he is far from saying that the sky is not black. We all know it is not black. The fact that the Attorney-General's Department realises that, is a good thing. These people are clearly not the agents for the whole range of people entitled to claim copyright.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two questions in relation to this matter. The first is: what investigations have been made by the Attorney-General's Department, and what are the consequences or the outcomes of those investigations, as to the propriety&mdash;that is not quite the right word, but it will do for the moment&mdash;of the Copyright Agency Ltd in the sense of being an agent for its principals? In other words, what investigations have been made into the amounts of money it collects and the amounts of money it pays out?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If no investigations have been made as to the legitimacy of this organisation and the manner in which it carries out its duties as an agent, why is the Attorney-General's Department continuing to negotiate with it? I ask that because earlier on I asked how much it was collecting from tertiary institutions and how much it was paying out and, as I am advised, it is a very large amount that is being collected and a paltry sum that is being paid out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people in this chamber might be less concerned if the sum was collected from the Attorney-General's Department. I would not be, because I would see that as coming from the taxpayer anyway, but some people would be much more concerned if they realised how much was coming out of our tertiary institutions and being paid to these people and how little was being paid out. I would have thought that some knowledge of that would be helpful to the Attorney-General's Department to know the substance of the people it would be dealing with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tate indicated to me that the officers here have little or no knowledge of that. That worries me, because the Copyright Agency Ltd, by virtue of the fact that it is, as I understand it, the only body that has set itself up as a specialist collecting body, may well have established some sort of practical, if not legal, monopoly and as a consequence of that its bona fides are not questioned. As the Copyright Agency Ltd is taking money out of educational institutions, I think that its bona fides should be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question is: Is the Attorney-General's Department now working on the copyright legislation that we have in place to consider whether this problem could be resolved by following the United Kingdom and removing the residual copyright currently available to journalists in this country which is not available in the United Kingdom?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a query that relates to a matter raised by the Committee of the Whole, that is, parliament and the privacy principles. Perhaps I could deal with it briefly and then, if any other Committee members want to raise matters on earlier programs than program 3.12, which is the first program on which I have made a reservation, I will give the floor to those people. I wonder whether there is something that the Minister can offer in relation to the reservation made by the Committee of the Whole as to parliament and the privacy principles which, as I know the Minister knows, relate to the use by members of parliament of equipment and resources provided by the Commonwealth to store information on all the electors in their electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This information can be of a very personal nature. A telephone poll using Commonwealth provided facilities can easily follow the lines of, for example: `I, Joe Bloggs, am ringing on behalf of Senator ABC, who wants to know what you think about the situation at the moment. Are you personally affected by the unemployment in the country?' `Yes, I am unemployed.' That can go down. `What do you think about Mr Webster's private member's Bill as it relates to Medicare funding of abortion?' Someone can, on a one-to-one basis, give an answer as to whether they think Medicare should fund abortions or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People might give some information as to their medical or employment history; they might give information that relates to their family in the sense that they see themselves as being the child of a sole parent or part of a divorced family; they might give some sort of family law history. All of this can quite easily be stored on any of the machines provided by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister may not know, because his ministerial duties may take him away from such mundane matters as the capacity of the machines provided by the Department to his Senate office in Tasmania, that each of the three machines can easily store an entire Federal electorate and an A4 page of information on each elector. That can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some disagreement at the moment between me and the Privacy Commissioner&mdash;I think no-one else is involved&mdash;as to whether members of parliament could be covered by the privacy legislation. I think that albeit it was not intended they should be, the wording is such that they could be. But that matter is inconsequential to the real substance of it, that is, what are we going to do to control ourselves in the way we store information on citizens?  We are quick to say in this place what everyone else should do about protecting information on individuals that is collected by other people. I have heard very little raised in this place about what should be done to protect the information that we collect on individuals; I regard this as a very serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, before I ask the Minister to respond, I say that I understand the difficulty in seeking to apply privacy legislation to members of parliament and, as the Act reads at the moment, I would not want to apply the whole Act to every aspect of the activities of a member of parliament, not the least of which would be constituent inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise as an example that I may write to the Minister in some capacity about a constituent and he may provide me with information that he may or may not be prepared to provide to the constituent. But if, by virtue of some legislation, the constituent is able to dip into my files, then the Minister is going to be apprehensive about what information he provides to senators and members. That is going to be a bad thing for everyone in terms of the representations we can make to Ministers of whatever government and the replies that we can get.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not what I am talking about and I think that because the Minister has been at the Estimates Committee hearings, he knows that my concern is about the storage of information for electoral purposes, all of which might be quite innocently given and quite innocently used.

I think I raised the example of Mr Romeyko's do-it-yourself divorce kit. I asked why the Department was not doing more in this area. The officers&mdash;Mr Rose et al&mdash;pointed out that a lot of these are not matters of Federal law, and I understand that. But to the extent to which they are Federal law, what is the Attorney-General's Department doing about producing&mdash;in any languages it chooses as being appropriate because of our multicultural approach, which I endorse&mdash;leaflets which explain to people what their rights are and how they can access them themselves without going to the legal profession?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Committee hearing this was not seen as being the problem of the Attorney-General's Department.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An exception to that would be in the area of consumer affairs where I have taken great pains over the last year or so to have information made available in community languages in the media&mdash;whether it be in written publications, radio slots or, in some instances, on SBS television. I have tried to acquaint various major ethnic groups, and some smaller ones, of their rights as consumers and the way in which they might, using consumer affairs officers at either the Federal or State level, assert those rights if necessary. But, basically, I wanted to make them aware of their rights. Quite often there are cultural impediments to their understanding that, indeed, they do have rights and that they might assert them without great fear or trepidation in our sort of community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that extent, I have certainly launched campaigns involving Greek, Spanish, Vietnamese and the Chinese speaking communities and two or three other major language groups in Sydney and Melbourne informing them of their rights.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the family law area is concerned, the Family Court itself has been attempting, through various programs, to reduce the costs consequent upon the breakdown of marriage. I could mention some which at least reduce the exposure of an unfortunate couple to the legal system; certainly, they try to avoid protracted litigation which is such a burdensome and crippling cost, on top of the disastrous consequences of separation as to property and other matters. The use of a system in the Family Court which bypasses, in a timely fashion, judicial determination of the dispute between the parties is to be encouraged. </PARA>

They make not very complimentary remarks about what I told them I was told, which was that the legal profession had agreed to a reversal to pleadings and that it agreed it would reduce the cost of justice. The Minister will remember that we were told that some practitioners would put in 30- to 40-page inflammatory affidavits and that pleadings were introduced to stop that and therefore reduce the cost.

I leave that matter until the next Estimates Committee, unless the Minister would like to say something about the return to pleadings issue which has been a disaster. Finally, will the Minister agree that every annual report produced under the auspices of the Department, so far as the Minister or his Department can direct them, makes a reference each year from here on in&mdash;until we are all happy that the cost of justice is what it should be&mdash;to what that body is doing to reduce the cost of justice?</PARA>

I had some correspondence with the Securities Commission in relation to a matter that came up where the Commission indicated&mdash;I think it was in Estimates&mdash;that it would assist the creditors to pursue the directors if its investigations revealed that the directors of APS mills were liable in law to creditors. The Australian Securities Commission indicated that it would assist those creditors in pursuing whatever remedies they may have. As a result of that, I wrote to the Commission asking what the creditors needed to do to make the Commission aware. The Commission replied by giving me a phone number, which I have passed on to most of the creditors. </PARA>

I do not think that I necessarily need a response from the Minister on those points. I simply put that information on the record. It may well be passed on to the Commission. </PARA>

What is the difference between the two? Am I being discriminated against because of my sex or because of my choice not to join a union? To me they are the same thing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, it is not for me particularly to defend the way in which CEDAW interprets its charter or operates in fact. It is an independent body which is not subject to direction, as I understand it, by states parties and certainly not by Australia. An interpretation which it gives to its charter is a matter for it and if states parties were totally unhappy with its particular interpretation they could withdraw from the convention. I say that as a preliminary. In other words, I do not think I should stand here as defence counsel for CEDAW. I am not assuming that role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do understand that the request for information on abortion laws was made by CEDAW to all states parties. I do not think Ireland was singled out or discriminated against. The brief which I believe was provided to the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee requests all States Parties reporting to it, pursuant to Article 18 of the Convention, to provide information concerning the "legal regulation regarding abortion, its legality and enforcement of the law".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Guidelines have been issued as to the types of information the Committee wants to receive and these are set out in the Manual on Human Rights Reporting, Under Six Major International Human Rights instruments.</PARA>
<PARA>The briefing note then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee requests the information on abortion laws in regard to Article 12 of the Convention which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"1.States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of health care in order to ensure a basis of equality of men and women, access to health care services, including those relating to family planning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, States Parties shall assure women appropriate services in connection with pregnancy, confinement and the post-natal period, granting free services where necessary, as well as adequate nutrition during pregnancy and lactation.</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, that is the article in the convention on which the Committee relies in asking states parties to provide information regarding the legal regulation pertaining to abortion, its legality and enforcement of the law. However, I would agree with Senator Harradine that the term `abortion' does not appear and, in so far as that request is made in reliance on article 12, that is a matter for CEDAW to defend if states parties refuse to acknowledge that was a legitimate inquiry based on that article. </PARA>

It also says that the questions about the legal regulation and incidence of abortion do not necessarily imply or endorse any one view as to the merits of abortion. They seek information as to an operation in the reporting states parties' territory which, whether common or rare, legal or illegal, has potential implications for the health of women in that state party.

Firstly, is the Minister suggesting that the monitoring committee of the Convention to Eliminate Discrimination Against Women is able to ask that question? Secondly, I refer the Minister to the article which his Department referred him to which says that states parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of health care in order to ensure on a basis of equality of men and women access to health care services, including those relating to family planning.

If the Department does not have the particular officer here, I cannot be blamed, nor can the Committee be blamed. It is a very important matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties is quite relevant because a committee's interpretation could result in actions by states relevant to the interpretation of the convention. I shall give the background for saying this. As the Minister has said in his reply, as a treaty organ established under article 17 of the CEDAW Convention, the CEDAW Monitoring Committee is competent to interpret the convention so far as is necessary for the performance of its functions. As the Minister has said, under article 18 of the convention, it seeks information from states parties concerning the legal regulation regarding abortion, its legality and enforcement of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, however, the interpretation of the convention remains the prerogative of states. The committee's interpretation is undoubtedly capable of affecting states' reporting requirements and their internal and external practices. Moreover, whilst the committee's interpretation is not binding per se on the states, over time it may establish and reflect the agreement of parties concerning its interpretation. It follows, therefore, that a committee's interpretation could result in action by states relevant to the interpretation of the convention. </PARA>

If it is suggested that clause 1 or clause 2 of article 12 is appropriate to be used by the CEDAW Monitoring Committee so as to enable it to demand of reporting states the situation as to abortion facilities in those states, the Department and this Government are either saying that abortion is a legitimate form of family planning or that they do not care what the CEDAW Monitoring Committee does. </PARA>

I indicate that if, indeed, CEDAW moved to the promotion or advocacy of abortion, that would be a different question,  properly posed, in relation to whether that could be based on the convention.

If the committee is going beyond that&mdash;into promotion or advocacy of a particular regime in relation to the provision of abortion services or operations within a state party's jurisdiction&mdash;that would raise a different question.

That would not entirely deal with Senator Harradine's point but, nevertheless, the question has been asked by the committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated previously, I have a couple of questions in relation to subprogram 3.4, `Provision of legal aid and family services'. They relate to the Queensland Marriage Guidance Council, about which I made a reservation. I have received some answers to questions that I raised at the Estimates Committee hearing, which were not available at that time. At the Estimates Committee hearing I was pursuing a line of questioning which had been raised with me by a constituent regarding the general allocation of funds for Queensland. I do not want to sound parochial, but this is the States House and because I represent Queensland I am concerned about the information that was given to me in writing to the questions that were taken on notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A certain amount of money is divided up between the States for marriage counselling in Australia. I want to pursue with the Minister the questions I raised at the Estimates Committee hearings. Relatively, Queensland seemed to be getting the raw end of the stick when it came to marriage guidance and marriage counselling. It was mentioned or agreed in the Estimates Committee that for every dollar spent on marriage counselling a further $7 was saved by the Australian taxpayer and the Australian public in the costs of divorces, problems with children and those sorts of things. The Minister did not agree with my figures, but he agreed in principle with the suggestion I was making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answers given to me in writing have shown&mdash;I pick a couple of items at random to emphasise my point&mdash;that Tasmania, for example, which has 2.66 per cent of the population, receives 4.1 per cent per capita of the total amount available. Tasmania receives $1.09 per capita for marriage counselling. By contrast, Queensland has 17.07 per cent of the population and only receives 13.8 per cent of the total amount available.

I simply emphasise that in Tasmania one receives $1.09 per capita for marriage guidance counselling and in Queensland one only gets 57c per capita. That is a fraction more than 50 per cent. I was wondering whether the Minister can explain why there is such a wide variance in the amount that Queenslanders receive compared with that received by Tasmanians. Is it that we in Queensland are less deserving or is it that we are better family people and we keep our marriages together better than in other parts of the country? Possibly the Minister might be able to give some explanation on the per capita division of the funds available for marriage counselling.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I ought to indicate that the Commonwealth has had to deal with an historical base of counselling organisations and others providing services in the various States. I would not for one moment say that there is an absolutely equitable&mdash;if we talk in terms of per capita being the sole criterion&mdash;distribution of funds in this area around Australia. I believe that with regard to marriage counselling, if we look at family services as a whole&mdash;we now include marriage education, mediation services, parenting skills projects and so on&mdash;Queensland, whilst still not doing as well as other States, is not doing as badly as the figures indicated by Senator Macdonald might lead one to conclude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Total family service grants from the Commonwealth in 1991-92 were $16.502m. It resulted in Queensland receiving 73c per capita against the average of 85c per capita in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. There is still a difference, in other words, but I believe that it is not as drastic as if one looked simply at the question of marriage counselling. It is true that there is a difference, and I do not deny that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have attempted to deal with the Queensland Marriage Guidance Council in a generous way. In the years 1989-90 to 1991-92 there was an increase in funding for that organisation for its various services, not just marriage counselling, from $842,800 to $1,242,900&mdash;an increase of $400,000 or about 47 1/2 per cent in its funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why occasionally, in letters not to me, the Marriage Guidance Council of Queensland keeps on criticising the Commonwealth. In fact, it is inconsistent with a letter I received from Mr Anthony Kelly, the President of the Queensland Marriage Guidance Council, on 15 August 1991, responding to my letter allocating more funds at its request. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your most responsive letter of 12 August. I am grateful to you for your decision to review funding decisions made in regard to this agency and for your acknowledgment that genuine misunderstandings have occurred. Your decision to make an additional $41,700 available to MGQ will most certainly relieve some of the immediate pressure on the agency.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to talk about what the staff are doing, trying to hold the line and avoid the withdrawal of any of its existing services. It remains the hope of the President that the agency can continue to build on strong growth, et cetera. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do assure you that my executive committee is appreciative of your Government's increased commitment to marriage support services and that our desire is to work with you and your Department to provide the highest quality service to as many Queensland couples as we can reach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I share your express desire that past misunderstandings can be put to rest, it remains my own view that there is a need for government to articulate its policy on marriage support more clearly, both to the approved organisations and to the community as a whole. I shall look forward to the opportunity for further dialogue on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA>As far as I am concerned, that letter from Anthony Kelly is one to which I can respond in the same terms. I am very happy to continue dialogue with the providers of family services in Queensland, including Marriage Guidance Queensland, but on the basis of a recognition of good faith on both sides in our commitment to provide as much as we can in relation to the services and the programs it wishes to foster in the community. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Why that should upset him I am not quite sure. Maybe it is because Tasmania is getting so much.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fact is well recognised by the Grants Commission and other bodies, and I indicate that as one of the bases.

If one looks at the Northern Territory, which has a smaller population than the Australian Capital Territory, it still has a smaller per capita funding allocation. Therefore, although what the Minister says is generally correct, it certainly has not applied right across the board.

Marriage Guidance Queensland has received over the past couple of years a huge increase in its funding of 47.5 per cent, an increase of some $400,000 in its funding. Its relative position in Queensland as among those organisations which receive grants has declined because other organisations have come forward with very good projects that deserve funding.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>In the 1991 Federal Budget the Government announced a unified fee relief system to apply from 1 January 1992. Two levels of fee relief will apply to children using approved long day care, occasional care and family day care services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Category one, higher level fee relief (based on the system currently applying in all long day care centres and family day care) will apply where care in these service types is for work-related reasons (including seeking work and studying or training for work); where a parent or child has a disability; and where a child is at risk of abuse or neglect. Category two, lower level fee relief (based on an enhancement of the system currently applying in occasional care centres) will apply to all other families using these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One-income families where one parent is in the workforce and the other is seeking or training for work will be eligible for the higher rate of fee relief. Sole parent families will be eligible, like all other families, for income-related fee relief based on their reason for requiring care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new fee relief system will replace the different fee relief systems that currently operate in each service type and will result in families with similar financial circumstances who use these different forms of care receiving the same level of fee relief. This is more equitable than current arrangements where families using occasional or non-work related care in occasional care centres may pay more than those who use the same form of care in a long day care centre or family day care scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's commitment to families with one parent at home has not diminished. The level of fee relief available for non-work related care from 1 January 1992 (based on the system currently applying in occasional care centres) will involve the payment of maximum assistance to families on incomes of approximately $22,000 per annum with a tapered withdrawal of benefit so families on incomes up to around $45,000 per annum will receive some benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 Budget does not envisage that there will be no growth in the provision of occasional care. The 1990 election commitment to extend the National Child Care growth strategy to 1995/96 includes a significant expansion of long day care (centres and family day care). Occasional care is provided by way of gap filling in these services. The 1989 Census of Government-funded child care services indicates that about 16% of care provided in long day care centres and 9% in family day care is for non-work related purposes. Accordingly, it is estimated that there will be considerable expansion of occasional care places over the next six years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is strictly within the guidelines. It refers to a figure probably in excess of $80m. Prior to the Senate Estimates Committee hearings I asked whether the Committee could be provided with details of the National Health and Medical Research Council grants for 1992, similar to those provided to the Estimates Committee in previous years. The response was that the NHMRC research grants for 1992 were expected to be announced towards the end of September, after approval by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), and that details would be provided to the Committee when the Minister had approved the grants. That is totally unsatisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made reference to this before. We are talking about many millions of dollars. The Estimates Committee is unable to consider those grants and the expenditure on those grants. To my knowledge, the material has never been received by the Estimates Committee until after the Estimates Committee has met. For example, on this occasion the letter from the Department was written only last Wednesday, weeks after the Senate Estimates Committee met. I think the material was received in my office on Friday of last week. I was here late on Sunday and I saw it on my desk on Monday. On Monday there was a full day of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies. Today is the only chance that I have had to look at this multimillion dollar expenditure which we have been asked to approve. That is not satisfactory, in my view, unless, of course, we take the view that we should trust what the NHMRC does with the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions in this chamber I have made reference to some of the very doubtful projects to which the NHMRC has directed the money. I hasten to say that most of the projects are certainly not in that category. I also hasten to say that a considerable amount of fine work has been done by the assessors and others who are required to do work in this field, assessing the proposals. I will be quite open about that. In general, these people should be congratulated for the very good work they are doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the figure for 1992 is $104m, so it is a considerable sum. I suppose the fact is that the process which is thought&mdash;and, as I understand it, well supported within the scientific and research community in Australia&mdash;to provide the fairest method of allocating the funds is the peer group assessors' report and the various regional committee recommendations that precede the final recommendations to the Minister for approval of particular grants.

If the assessors' reports&mdash;which I presume could be from a group of three assessors with two in favour and one against, with all sorts of comments&mdash;were to go into the public domain, it might cause great difficulty to applicants.

It should not be forgotten that this same National Health and Medical Research Council gave something like $350,000 to Professor Peter Singer's outfit to develop a philosophy, as it were, in respect of human embryo experimentation. That, surely, should have been a matter for considerable discussion in this chamber before it was approved, but we did not know about it. The material was not given to us until after the appropriations had been passed. That is not appropriate; that is entirely inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members of parliament, we have a representative function. We also have an audit function over the activity of governments and over the activity of organisations which are under the control of the Minister. It is the Minister who approves these.

I have asked for this three years running and still it has not been done. I understand there may be difficulties because the budgetary year, being July to June, does not coincide with the university year and many of these grants are made to universities and other institutions. Perhaps some sort of indication could be made. In respect of the question that I asked the Minister, I have been supplied in previous years with the information that I requested and that I requested from the Minister just a moment ago, including the assessors' reports. They have been supplied with the names of the assessors deleted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no-one&mdash;neither here, in the medical or scientific community, nor in the Department&mdash;who will say that I have abused that in any way. It is necessary for us to know not only the details of the project but also how the assessors see that project working out. That is a very important reason for the necessity to have the assessors' reports. With a number of these project grants, one does not quite know on paper what will be done, what is proposed and so on. For example, on the first page, on attachment 3, I notice a grant made to a Ms J.L. Halliday of Murdoch Institute in Victoria. It is entitled, `The utilisation of amniocentesis and chorion villous sampling in Victoria and subsequent perinatal outcomes'. I do not know what that is about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) has not answered my question. I asked the question quite deliberately. He will have to look at the documentation to see whether the advice that he has been given is correct. I invite him to look at the posters that are proposed. Will he first tell me whether he can see any of the first two elements that Senator Tate promised would be in these campaigns? He promised them on behalf of the Minister. Let us see whether any of those are in this campaign and, if so, in what proportion. In 1987 Senator Tate said&mdash;and he will be reminded about this&mdash;that two-thirds of the Government's education campaign would be on those first two elements. When I challenged Senator Tate about that he took a great deal of umbrage before this chamber. He criticised me for daring to suggest that the Government was on the wrong track.</PARA></TALK.START>

In fact, I believe that it is assisting in setting in place a regimen which will guarantee the continuance of AIDS in this country. But again I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, given the incidence of AIDS and the particular high risk activity that is involved in homosexual anal sex, where in any of the Government's campaigns is a warning given to young people that such activity is a deadly risk?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Notwithstanding the strong views that Senator Harradine holds about this matter and the fact that fundamentally at the end of the day we will have to agree to disagree about the best way of conducting campaigns to warn people about the dangers of AIDS, the evidence appears to be that Australia has been relatively successful internationally in the campaign to contain the spread of AIDS.

I understand the genuineness of Senator Harradine's concern, but I think that the course of action he is recommending is ill-conceived and ill-considered and would not achieve its objective.

Is he saying that the Government is not giving any warning to young people in its education campaign on AIDS that it is a deadly risk indeed for them to experiment in anal sexual activity?  Is he saying that the reason that the Government does not do that is that it might make people complacent about heterosexual sex?  Is that what he is saying?  If so, where is the logic in that given the fact that the overwhelming majority of AIDS cases, and indeed of AIDS deaths, are a result of that type of activity?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question, based on advice from Telecom. In giving me a response to the honourable senator's question, Telecom has also provided the following background information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 7 of the Telecommunications (Interception) (T(I)) Act permits employees of Telecom to record and/or listen to a communication passing over a telecommunications system in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) the installation of any line, or the installation of any equipment, used or intended for use in connection with a telecommunications service or the operation or maintenance of a telecommunications system; or</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to (i), this has covered situations such as:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) the inadvertent overhearing of a conversation in relation to the installation of a particular service or the restoration of a faulty service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) listening to conversations at a telephone exchange in order to find and rectify any abnormal fault condition on a particular customer's service. This procedure is now only carried out where the customer is aware that his/her conversations are being listened to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) the use of Call Charge Analysis Equipment (CCAE) as part of the operation and maintenance of the telecommunications network. This includes day-to-day maintenance activities and the use of CCAE in relation to billing disputes. The use of this equipment does not involve listening to conversations. In the case of billing disputes, it is used to record such details as the type of call (local, STD, IDD), time of call, duration and cost and, in effect, establish the integrity of the metering equipment of a particular service. The normal length of time CCAE is on a service is two to three weeks. The records created are often used to discuss the calling patterns with the customer. The use of CCAE for billing disputes does not necessarily involve the consent of the customer; however, initial use of the equipment is often at the customer's request or with his/her knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to (ii), this has related to the use of CCAE to identify persons in the circumstances outlined and covers cases such as menacing, harassing or offensive calls or interference with telecommunications services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent advice from the Attorney-General's Department has been to the effect that the T(I) Act does not govern the use of CCAE i.e. its use does not involve the recording of a communication in its passage over a telecommunications system. However, Telecom has no plans to extend its use beyond the circumstances described above. Further, it is expected that the use of CCAE to resolve billing disputes will decline as Telecom continues with its plans of providing itemisation of STD, IDD and 0055 calls on customers' bills. All customers on Telecom's Cellular Mobile Telephone Service receive itemised bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having regard to the foregoing, Telecom has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Telecom does not `covertly intercept and monitor, without warrant'. There are no warrant provisions in the T(I) Act relating to any Telecom actions permitted under Section 7(2) of that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom is aware of cases occurring in the period up to 1986 where `loudspeaker' monitoring took place without a customer's knowledge at a telephone exchange in order to rectify particular faults. Two cases in particular were subject to detailed investigation by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The length of time involved in monitoring of the two cases was 26 days and one week. The practice did not contravene the T(I) Act but the Ombudsman's investigations led to the current procedures being introduced whereby customers are now informed if any such monitoring is to take place. Telecom pointed out that this monitoring procedure is now rarely used in view of more sophisticated techniques being available to locate and rectify faults.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (2) Section 597 of the Corporations Law provides for public examination before a court, upon application by the ASC or a prescribed person (usually a liquidator or receiver), of a person or persons, concerned in the affairs of a corporation, who are suspected of misconduct in relation to that corporation. Section 597 may also be used to examine a person or persons who may be capable of giving information about the promotion, formation, management and affairs of a corporation. The Court may, on the application of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) or prescribed person, if it thinks fit, order that the person(s) attend before the Court to be examined on oath as to the affairs of the relevant company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 13(1) provides for general investigatory powers of the ASC. The ASC may under Section 13(1) make such investigations where it has reason to suspect that there may have been a breach of the Corporations Law or a breach of other laws where the contraventions concern the management or affairs of a company or involve fraud or dishonesty and relate to a company. Once the ASC has made a decision to conduct an investigation under section 13, a number of additional powers are available to it under the ASC Law and the Corporations Law, including the power to examine persons, the power to inspect documents, the power to compel the production of documents and the power to apply for a warrant to seize a document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the section 597 examination can be used by the ASC in other circumstances, it is used most commonly by liquidators to obtain evidence in respect of the affairs of a corporation. The ASC has broad powers of investigation and information gathering under Part 3 of the ASC Law and usually does not need to have recourse to the provisions of section 597. Although the ASC has decided to embark on a section 13(1) investigation, it would not be precluded from making an application to the court under section 597 if it considered it necessary or desirable for its examinations to be held in public. The provisions of these two sections are not mutually exclusive. However, the need for a s.597 application becomes somewhat redundant once a s.13(1) investigation has been commenced.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In view of the rapid deterioration of the Soviet economy and thereby one of Australia's major commodity export markets, the Government initiated several steps from the beginning of 1990 to facilitate food and other exports to the Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1990, the Australian Government signed a Commodities Agreement with the Soviet Union, which, together with the Fisheries Agreement also signed at that time, provided a commitment to a wider, more substantive relationship, providing a reliable framework within which Australian and Soviet concerns could negotiate long term contracts. The structure upon which the Agreement is built consists of a Schedule which lists indicative targets for agricultural and resource products including wheat, sugar, butter, mutton, wool, barley and protein crops. Despite the Government's effort to encourage food exports to the Soviet Union through this medium, actual export figures have rarely reached quantity indicator levels, largely owing to Soviet economic and political disarray and hard currency shortages. In consequence, provision of credit has become the central issue in fostering agricultural trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1990, in order to assist the Soviets in resuming purchases of Australian agricultural products, the Government underwrote two credit facilities administered by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. The first provides $100 million credit on 2 year terms for the sale of 1 million tonnes of wheat and barley, and has been fully utilised. The second is a $400 million, 240 day rollover credit facility to support traditional trade with the Soviet Union, and has been almost fully utilised to cover wool and meat sales. The Government is continuing to monitor the credit situation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increased competition from imported food products generally have been widely reported recently. In particular, competition from a number of our Asian neighbours which have the advantage of low labour costs and concessionary tariffs under the Australian System of Tariff Preferences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important, however, that these imports be put into perspective.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Action to explicitly restrict imports would be contrary to the Government's industry and international trade policies and could result in retaliatory action which would clearly be to Australia's detriment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of Australia's internationally competitive primary industries which export to the region are located in Queensland and thus it would be against the interests of the wider community to increase controls on imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that the pineapple industry is concerned about the increasing level of imports of canned pineapple over recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation appears to have followed a decision by Australia's only pineapple cannery, Golden Circle, to not supply `generic' labelled product to Australian supermarket chains. The supermarket chains subsequently placed orders with overseas suppliers who were prepared to meet their requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in import levels in recent times coincides with a shortfall in the availability of Australian canned pineapple due to adverse weather in 1989. Golden Circle management say this situation will not be rectified until 1992 at which time, with increased supplies of raw product into the cannery, I hope that Golden Circle will consider possibilities to increase exports and to improve its competitive position.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question alleges that imports from the region are subsidised.
