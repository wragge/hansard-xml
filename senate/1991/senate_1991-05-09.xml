<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA>The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA>That the right to life to all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA>That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>
<PARA>That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.</PARA>
<PARA>That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA>That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA>Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.</PARA>
<PARA>And your Petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Australian National Maritime Museum Regulations, Statutory Rules 1991 No.10, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 7 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>In all of the various offence provisions of the Regulations the penalty is fixed at $500. This appears reasonable in most cases but your advice would be appreciated as to whether it is a suitable penalty for a parking offence under r.7(1). The Committee believes that it is a breach of personal liberties if penalty provisions are unreasonably high. </PARA>
<PARA>Regulation 15(1) provides that a person must not, without consent, make, use, print, publish, sell or offer for sale any replica, photograph, representation or copy of any maritime historical material in the ownership or control of the museum. As such material is by definition historical it is possible, and even likely, that there exist photographs or copies of material that is in the Museum. It would seem possible for a person innocently to reproduce or publish such material without knowing that it was a breach of r.15. The Committee believes that it may be appropriate in this case to include a defence of knowingly breaching the regulation. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 11 March 1991 about your Committee's concerns with the Australian National Maritime Museum Regulations, Statutory Rules 1991 No. 10. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to regulation 7(1), I am advised that the Museum has only very limited facilities for vehicular parking. Moreover, the land between Pyrmont Bridge and the Museum building is a key egress area in Darling Harbour for crowds of up to 100,000 on normal weekends, rising to 300,000 in peak holiday times. To deter people from blocking this access to emergency vehicles and thus endangering public safety, it was considered essential to have the capacity to impose a fine of some deterrent value. However, in view of the Committee's concerns I am prepared to amend the regulations to reduce this particular penalty to $100. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to Regulation 15(1), I take the Committee's point that such an offence may occur quite innocently. I therefore propose to amend the regulation to confine the offence to `knowingly' breaching the regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>I have instructed my Department to arrange for amendments to the regulations along these lines to be prepared. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 16 April 1991 on aspects raised by the Committee of the Australian National Maritime Museum Regulations, Statutory Rules 1991 No.10. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted your undertaking to amend the Regulations to remove the strict liability aspects of r.15(1), which meets its concerns about this regulation. Your cooperation is appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also noted your helpful undertaking to reduce the parking penalty in r.7(1) from $500 to $100, and your advice about crowd numbers and emergency and safety aspects. This valid and significant advice assisted the Committee. However, your further advice would be appreciated about whether consultations have been held with the NSW State authorities responsible for traffic in the Darling Harbour complex and with the NSW police about the level of penalty and whether they have any objection to the proposed level of penalty of $100. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 19 April 1991 seeking further information about the proposed parking penalty for the Australian National Maritime Museum provided for in Regulation 7(1) of the Australian National Maritime Museum Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>I am advised that the Museum has held formal discussions with the Darling Harbour Authority, the Darling Harbour Rangers, and the New South Wales Police concerning the proposed parking penalty. No objection was raised by any of these interested parties to the proposed penalty of $100, notwithstanding that the penalty applying under the NSW Road and Traffic Authority Act in the Darling Harbour area is $81. </PARA>

<PARA>The Hon David Beddall MP</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Small Business and Customs</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1990 No.460, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 7 March 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>There is an important discretion provided for in the regulations. In the definition of ``exempt firearm'' in r.2(1), paragraph (b) gives these discretions to both a Federal Minister and to State and Territory Ministers. This discretion is very wide, apparently open-ended and appears to have no criteria to guide and control the Ministers in the exercise of the powers conferred. There is no right of review apparent on the face of the instrument nor does there seem to be an explanation of review rights, if any, in the Explanatory Statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee appreciates that there may be review rights in the parent Act or in other provisions of the principal Regulations. In these cases, such a right of review should be advised in the Explanatory Statement. </PARA>
<PARA>In the present case, the Committee believes that the purpose of paragraph (b) may be to exempt handguns for competitive shooting or for collectors, some of whom possibly earn their living by importing such weapons, although the Explanatory Statement does not appear to advise on this point. In these cases the Committee believes there is a strong case for independent review of such a wide discretion as this one. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee may also write to you again about these regulations, in respect of possible retrospective effect even though the regulations formally came into effect on gazettal. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to my letter of 11 March 1991 on aspects raised by the Committee of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1990 No.460. In the last paragraph of that letter I advised that the Committee may write to you again about the Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether any Commonwealth, State or Territory legislation makes it an offence to possess the articles which were prescribed as prohibited imports by the present set of Regulations, or provides for seizure of such goods. The Committee seeks your advice on whether the position is that articles which were previously lawful to possess and which may have been in a person's possession for many years, were effectively made unlawful to possess by the Regulations. The Committee assumes that this is not the case, as the Explanatory Statement does not mention such an important effect. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also raises the question of articles, the importation of which was prohibited by the Regulations, which were in course of transit to Australia or awaiting customs clearance, when the Regulations came into effect. What is the position of the owner of the goods in such cases? If such owners are disadvantaged it appears that the Regulations may be retrospective in effect although formally they only come into operation on the date of gazettal. </PARA>
<PARA>Your early advice would be appreciated. </PARA>

<PARA>Chair</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letters of 11 March and 11 April 1991 concerning your Committee's various concerns and inquiries following its consideration of the amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations contained in Statutory Rules No 460 of 1990, which were Gazetted on 21 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>These Statutory Rules implement new controls over the importation of firearms, and give effect to the resolution of the Australian Police Ministers' Council concerning firearms control, which was settled jointly by the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments at the 19th Meeting of the Council in Alice Springs on 22 November last year. </PARA>
<PARA>In your Committee's two letters, concerns have been expressed about an apparent unlimited and unreviewable discretion vested in Commissioners of Police to exempt one category of firearms (ie handguns) from the import prohibition (your 11 March letter refers), and about a possible retrospective effect of the amendments (your 11 April letter refers). </PARA>
<PARA>I am also aware that these two issues were the subject of your 14 March 1991 Notice of Motion on behalf of the Committee for the disallowance of these Statutory Rules, which must be called on or withdrawn on or before 28 May 1991. I trust the following will address your Committee's concerns, so that the Notice of Motion can in fact be withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA> (i) The unlimited discretion vested in Commissioners of Police to exempt handguns from the import prohibition</PARA>
<PARA>The firearms control regime which Statutory Rules No. 460 of 1990 has introduced is essentially an absolute import prohibition of all ``firearms'' (defined broadly in sub-regulation 2(1) to include all but a very limited number of special purpose guns), unless the firearms are ``exempt firearms'' (item 24 of Schedule 1 refers). </PARA>
<PARA>The three ``exempt firearm'' categories defined in sub-regulation 2(1) give legislative effect to the policy desire of the Australian Police Ministers' Council that the new firearms controls specify the categories of ``permitted imports'' to this country. Such permitted imports of firearms must satisfy the definitional requirements pertaining to that particular category of firearms, and all such firearms must satisfy safety requirements, as prescribed in Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations, unless the firearms come within one of the limited classes of exemptions to the safety testing requirement (item 5 of Part 1 of Schedule 3 refers). </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the three defined categories of ``exempt firearm'', your letter of 11 March drew attention to the second category, paragraph 2(1) (b) of the definition of ``exempt firearm'', relating to handguns. </PARA>
<PARA>That paragraph purports to exempt handguns from the absolute import prohibition on firearms where either the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or a Commissioner of a State or Territory police force has certified that the relevant police force has no objection to the handgun's importation. </PARA>
<PARA>Your Committee was rightly critical of the apparent lack of independent review of this discretion. That criticism was repeated in your 14 March Notice of Motion, together with a further concern that the discretions were vested in persons not all of whom are Commonwealth officials, which could render independent review unenforceable on jurisdictional grounds</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's comments in this regard are well made, and its concerns well taken. In fact, the purpose of the certification by a Police Force Commissioner was intended to do no more than evidence the fact of whether or not the intending importer is licensed or authorised to possess the handgun in the jurisdiction into which the handgun is to be brought. That evidentiary requirement existed for handguns prior to the new control regime (the B709 Weapons Import-Police Endorsement), and was meant to continue under the new regime. </PARA>
<PARA>I concede however that as presently drafted the paragraph is not so restricted; indeed the objection which a Police Commissioner might take is apparently open-ended. I consider this issue can be satisfactorily resolved by an amendment to the Regulations to make the pre-condition for ``permissible'' imported handguns rely not on a Police Commissioner's discretion, but rather, on the fact of whether or not the importer is licensed or authorised to possess the handgun. A certificate from the relevant police force to that effect would involve no administrative discretion, and therefore should allay the Committee's legitimate concerns on this point</PARA>
<PARA>I undertake also to make that amendment retrospective to the 21 December 1990 commencement of the Principal Regulations the subject of your Committee's concerns, although the administration of this paragraph has proceeded on the basis of whether the importer in fact has a relevant licence or authority to possess the handgun, and not on the basis of any discretion. I have instructed officers of the Australian Customs Service to process the above change in the next available Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Possible retrospective effect of the amendments</PARA>
<PARA>In both your Notice of Motion in the Senate, and your second letter of 11 April 1991, you have raised on behalf of the Committee concerns about a possible retrospective effect of the new firearms prohibition, especially with regard to firearms imported prior to 21 December 1990. Your Committee has sought advice as to whether firearms lawfully imported prior to 21 December 1990 can be made subject to seizure action or pecuniary penalty for unlawful possession on the ground that such firearms now might be prohibited imports (ie since 21 December 1990). </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to seizure action under Commonwealth legislation, I am advised the relevant provisions for your Committee's information are sub-section 203(2) and paragraph 229(1)b of the Customs Act 1901; the first provision provides the general right to seize any forfeited goods, or any goods that an officer of Customs, police or the Defence forces believes on reasonable grounds are forfeited goods, and the second provision ``defines'' prohibited imports as one of the categories of forfeited goods. </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Act 1901 provides an express head of power in Section 50 to enable the prohibition of the importation of goods into Australia to be done by Regulation. As a consequence of this being effected by subsidiary legislation, any such prohibitions are expressly prohibited from operating retrospectively by sub-section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA>In the instant case, as Statutory Rules No. 460 of 1990 introduced a new regime prohibiting the importation into Australia of certain firearms, I am advised it is expressly caught by the prohibition against retrospectivity in sub-section 48(2); the new firearm control regime can therefore only attach prohibited imports status to firearms imported on or after 21 December 1990. The corollary to the above is that the seizure power referred to earlier can only lawfully be exercised under the new regime over firearms imported since that date, where such firearms come within the terms of the new regulation. In short, the Regulations cannot retrospectively make firearms imported prior to 21 December 1990 prohibited imports, and as such there is no Customs Act power of seizure over such goods on that ground. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to penalty action for the unlawful possession of prohibited imports under Commonwealth legislation, I am advised the relevant provisions for your Committee's information are paragraph 233(1) (d) and Section 233 AB of the Customs Act 1901; the first provision provides the offence for the unlawful possession of prohibited imports, and the second prescribes the pecuniary penalty applicable to that offence. </PARA>
<PARA>Your Committee in the second paragraph of your 11 April 1991 letter has quite correctly assumed that articles which were previously lawful to possess and which may have been in a person's possession for many years, cannot be effectively made unlawful to possess by Regulations. The event of importing goods which are not ``prohibited imports'' at that time brings with it the right to possess those goods. It is giving the Act and Regulations quite inappropriate retrospective operation to treat the legislation as intending to alter that right by changing the position of the law in relation to that event at a subsequent point of time. </PARA>
<PARA>For the information of the Committee, I have attached a copy of an opinion from the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney-General's Department on this very point, which was provided to the Shadow Attorney-General, the Hon Andrew Peacock MP, following his similar question on this Regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>Counsel's advice both on the question of whether</PARA>
<PARA> (a) paragraph 233(1) (d) applied to the possession in Australia of goods that had never been imported,</PARA>
<PARA>and whether</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the paragraph applied to the possession in Australia of imported goods that are ``prohibited imports'' at the time of the possession but were not ``prohibited imports'' at the time of importation,</PARA>
<PARA>was an emphatic No. </PARA>
<PARA>As a final matter, your Committee has raised in the final paragraph of your 11 April letter the question of whether the new import prohibition applies to goods which were in transit on or after 21 December 1990, or awaiting Customs clearance on or after 21 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>I am advised these two scenarios are no different to those which apply every time a prohibited imports or exports control is introduced or amended. In the first scenario, in transit goods are subject to any new control, for the simple fact that such goods have not yet been imported into Australia. It would be a curious result indeed if having determined goods to be undesirable in this country, we were obliged to let into the country a quantity of such goods, simply because their journey to this country had commenced. </PARA>
<PARA>In the second scenario, (ie the goods awaiting customs clearance) the opposite result applies, this time because the act of importation has been completed, and therefore, because at the time of importation the importation of the goods was not prohibited, nothing subsequent to that fact can be done by Regulation to alter that result. </PARA>
<PARA>I trust the above addresses the concerns of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That Regulations 13 to 20 inclusive of the Austudy Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1990 No. 443 and made under the Student Assistance Act 1973, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>I must stress at the beginning that this is an urgent matter. We cannot delay yet another year and wait for the 1992 regulations before dealing with this issue. As the rural crisis deepens, those students who have moved into upper secondary education, and particularly those students who have moved into tertiary education from rural Australia, are going to be asking, `Can we continue? ', `What is our future?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is of the essence. We do need to remove the assets test. The greatest benefit from removing the assets test will be to farming families and we must act now. If we wait until 1992 to act then another year level of students will be uncertain of their future and, indeed, many of them will miss out on an education. Those now in year 10 in most States will be looking towards work experience. What particular job will they be looking towards? Can they set their sights high or, indeed, will they be looking at not continuing at all? Those in year 11 are looking to setting courses for year 12. Those who are now attempting to complete year 12, with the already enormous pressure the rural crisis is placing on them, have to consider whether it is really worth it because they may not be able to continue on to tertiary study. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who have risked it now and are in tertiary institutions are finding that they are not able to get part time jobs in the cities. They rely more and more on their families, and those families are facing greater and greater hardship. We simply cannot watch as many of our most talented students from country areas-and it is really irrelevant how talented they are-simply miss out. We cannot stand by and witness what is a loss to all Australians as this group of very talented young people are forced to discontinue their education.</PARA>
<PARA> There are also many additional costs that face farming families. This move has generated some criticisms and I agree with those people who say that this move is not the only answer. If those concerned are unable to at least get Austudy, it is certain that the vast majority of them will not be able to go on. There have been a number of reports of late that have dealt at length with this problem, and I shall be looking at only two of them today. The first is the March 1991 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into student financial assistance. The finding in paragraph 3.10 is:</PARA>
<PARA>Rural Australians have lower participation rates in education and training than their metropolitan counterparts. Sheer distance, low population densities and widely disparate populations make it difficult for many people outside capital cities or major urban centres to gain access to education and training. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy stated that Austudy has a vital role in facilitating the participation of rural students by easing the financial strain associated with study. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues in paragraph 3.11:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Primary Industries and Energy stated that the assets test has been a constant source of frustration for agricultural producers. Agricultural industries in 1989/90 were estimated to have had a rate of return, excluding capital appreciation, of 2.5 per cent. This means that in spite of having significant assets holdings many farmers have low incomes. Farmers have little or no control over the prices they receive for their produce. The Department advised that for 1990/91 the net value of production will fall between 60 and 65 per cent. This is mainly due to falls in commodity prices which are determined by overseas markets. The Department concluded that fluctuations in world markets are likely to continue while the international trading environment remains distorted. </PARA>
<PARA>Then paragraph 3.12 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>A report on rural Austudy concluded that the claim that the introduction of the assets test could be justified for reasons of equity requires more careful investigation from the point of view of people living in rural areas, particularly farmers. The report commented that there was cause for concern when farmers and owners of small businesses in rural areas were entitled to Austudy payments for their children on the basis of income tests but did not receive them because their assets were reported to be over the limit. </PARA>
<PARA>The last quotation from the report is from paragraph 3.15 which looks at the contribution of the National Farmers Federation to this inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federation stated that the assets of a farm and many other small businesses are not readily divisible or saleable as a means of providing living expenses. Sale of part of a farm may render the remainder too small to be viable. In a recessionary environment business assets, especially in agriculture, may not be readily saleable at any realistic price. Seventy-five per cent of farms have net assets exceeding $400,000. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also points out that about 50 per cent of farms have net assets in excess of $700,000-in other words, out of the Austudy requirement-and the average net asset is $910,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report to which I wish to draw attention is a project carried out in Victoria entitled Austudy-Rural Inequities. It was a joint project of the Country Education Project at the Office of Rural Affairs and the Victorian Country Youth Affairs Network. I quote from page 47 of that report:</PARA>
<PARA> If the assets limit is exceeded then students receive no Austudy allowance. There is no provision for partial allowances as with the income test. In addition there are no hardship provisions or concessions where the assets limit is exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA> Cases of particular concern are those where farmers or owners of small businesses have assets worth more than $645,500 but have low annual incomes, that in the absence of the assets test would entitle their children to receive Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the assets test in 1989 is perceived by farmers particularly to be inequitable. One parent expressed her frustration with the assets test as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the assumption that is made that landholders are wealthy-you can't eat dirt and buildings. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said by a parent from the Wimmera. Examples such as this were encountered many times among farming families interviewed during the data collection phase of this project. </PARA>
<PARA> A rural counsellor working in north-western Victoria provided several instances of families who were entitled to Austudy on the basis of their incomes, but received no entitlements due to the assets test. Three examples of farming income are included in this report, which show incomes on a three-year average as low as $6,000 and $7,000. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Students in this study commented:</PARA>
<PARA>``Farmers' have assets but they are tied up in land and stock. (AUSTUDY) doesn't take into account that farms need a lot of assets just to function normally.''</PARA>
<PARA>``As it may seem that the parents received a very high income much of those funds may have to be directed elsewhere such as supplies, fertilizers, seeds, etc. Or they may have to pay large sums for natural disasters and disease etc.''</PARA>
<PARA>I must add that this report was written in particularly good times-times that are rapidly deteriorating. </PARA>
<PARA> Farm incomes are now indeed minimal if not negative. I have just spent some time travelling through rural South Australia. In particular, I spent several days on Kangaroo Island. On the island more than 90 per cent of farmers are almost totally reliant on wool. Incomes for this year are expected to be as low as one third of last year, and severe financial difficulties are being experienced by the majority of farmers on the island. Stock agents often have first call on any income, the banks are closing off cheque accounts and local stores have stopped credit facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I spent some time talking to the rural counsellor. He told me of more and more cases coming before him where extreme hardship is being experienced. His comment was that many people are really leaving it too late to get in touch with him. He had arrived on one farm to find that the owners had absolutely no food in the cupboards. Fortunately, the Minister's fraternal on the island now has a small fund where the council can draw up to $100 for emergencies such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> Families are finding that they cannot pay fuel bills. This not only inhibits work on the farm-indeed, some of them are going back to working their properties on horseback-it also means that farming families cannot get into town. They are cut off from social contact and, as one of the ministers pointed out, they can no longer go to church. Businesses in Kingscote, Penneshaw and Parndana are in financial trouble as farmers cannot pay accounts. The assets test is particularly crucial to farmers on the island because it not only excludes them from Austudy but also excludes families from any support under the family allowance supplement or unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Students now in years 10 and 11 will be asking themselves a number of questions. Where should they be looking for their future? Should they be looking to go on to agricultural college and then move back onto the farm? Unfortunately, more and more of them are finding that there is no place for them on the farm. The option of staying on the farm is no longer viable, certainly not for more than one child in the family. Often the family can simply not afford to keep all its young people at home. However, if these regulations stay in place and young people move off the farm and go to Adelaide and then seek Austudy, they still do not qualify because the value of the farm stays with them until they are 25. So one way or another they will not be able to get an education. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some suggestions that we need another review to again look at the problems and to start talking about providing hardship provisions. These are long term suggestions. I argue that they will not be nearly as effective as removing the assets test now. We cannot wait until 1992 to try something else and to look at this problem again. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, what is needed now is the removal of the entire assets test. But that is simply the legal requirement. We in the Senate cannot amend; we must either allow or disallow. Therefore, we are asking that the Government rewrite these specific regulations in a form that provides that specifically farming families, and also small business families-although there will not be nearly as many of those affected-are excluded from the assets test for Austudy. It is very easy to do. Indeed, we would be more than happy to volunteer to assist with the rewriting of those specific regulations. But we have no choice at this point, other than to disallow them, to exclude tools of trade from the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other problem relating to the assets test, and this is the problem of revaluation. At the time a family actually fills out the application forms for Austudy nowhere does it say that the valuation must be done by the Australian Valuation Office (AVO). Family after family has got in touch with us in Adelaide and shown that, despite the fact that they had put down their best possible estimate of the market value of their properties-and they had relied upon reputable organisations, such as Elders, to come in to do a valuation for them or they had looked at their State valuation or council rates; in short, they had done the best they possibly could-over and over again, in fact in the case of about one-third of the revaluations which were done in South Australia, farming families, despite having qualified previously, had been cut off. Not only had they been cut off, but also they had been asked to repay up to $16,000. </PARA>
<PARA> These AVO checks have apparently been done-some information was provided by Senator Bolkus's office yesterday-on 618 families. The assets of 208 families-that is over one-third-have been valued at just above the limit and the families have, therefore, been cut off from Austudy. In many cases, people have been asked to repay money. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that land values are falling rapidly, the AVO is not taking this into account-or it certainly was not throughout last year. I will give some specific examples from South Australia where the majority of the revaluations took place. For example, in the mid-north of South Australia a family with two children, on the advice of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, valued its farm assets as per the local council rate notice-that is, less than the replacement insurance value of the house plus curtilage. However, the Valuation Office revalued the property as being over the limit and all payments were asked to be repaid within 14 days. The Commonwealth valuation was 22 per cent higher than the State valuation and the value of the home was deemed to be less than 50 per cent of its insurance value. </PARA>
<PARA> In another case near Kimba in South Australia, a family had its land valued by Elders at $68 per acre. It was revalued at up to $120 per acre, despite the fact that forced sales in the area at the time were getting no bids, no offers, and the latest sales had realised only $25 to $40 per acre. Their children have no choice; they have to go away to complete schooling after year 10 as the local school only goes to year 10. Therefore, these children will be precluded from upper secondary, let alone tertiary, study. </PARA>
<PARA> There were also other problems with this valuation. In this case wool on the sheep's back was valued whereas it should have been only a carcass valuation. In other words, 18 months worth of wool was included in the valuation. An extremely small value was put on the family house. For those people who are wondering about the importance of this, that amount is actually taken off the total value of the farm. So by valuing up the stock and valuing down the house, one can see that the gap widens and widens. I know of several cases in South Australia where the valuations have been up to 79 per cent above the State Valuer-General's valuations. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that land values are falling rapidly, many farming families will not risk applying for Austudy. In fact, farmers have said precisely that to me. They will not risk it because they are near the $700,000 limit and they are worried that they could be faced with a revaluation at any point in time. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, this points to the fact that we cannot wait. The situation in rural Australia, as I have heard many honourable senators outline in this place, is serious. We cannot leave young people literally on the scrap heap for another year. It is a matter of justice. Why should young people-I stress again that this is young people up to the age of 25 years-be prevented from continuing their education purely because of the value of their family farm? This group of young people includes many whose families will be forced off the land. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote from an article which appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser on Tuesday of this week. Mr Blevins, a Minister in the State Labor Government, said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . two-thirds of South Australian steel workers had been forced to leave their industry and the State's farmers had to be prepared to do the same. </PARA>
<PARA>Two-thirds is the suggestion coming from a Minister in the South Australian Government. Whatever the figure, some people will certainly be affected-but let us hope it is nowhere near that number. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the very people who need an education most urgently. It is essential that they get a chance to study now and that they are not forced into the cities and into poverty. If compassion is not enough then hopefully economic argument will be. We need to look at the overall cost to this country of losing these talents and of then having to support these young people for what may be a considerable period of time. In the long run, we will all be the losers. </PARA>

<PARA> `40.(1) The President may, by signed instrument, delegate to the Vice President all or any of the President's powers under this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> `(2) If the President delegates a power to the Vice President under subsection (1), he or she may, in addition, delegate that power to a Senior Deputy President to be exercised when the Vice President is unable, for any reason, to exercise that power personally.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Essentially, we are moving two amendments but there is a consequential amendment, so there are three amendments before the Committee. Our amendments are directed at two elements of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment (No. 2) Bill. Honourable senators will be aware that the new model of industrial relations was put in place by the enactment of the Industrial Relations Act in 1988. Substantial amendments were made to that Act in 1990, and in many respects we are now putting the finishing touches to that model. Much of what is before the Committee today is designed to strengthen the structure of the Industrial Relations Commission, which we have always argued is the cornerstone of the centralised model. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, when we had an urgency motion before the Senate two days ago, in some respects it was gratifying and yet a little confusing to hear Senator Durack saying on behalf of the Opposition that the Opposition also believes in a strong and independent Industrial Relations Commission. Yet we will find that when the Opposition is put to the test, probably in a few minutes from now, it will not support amendments which are designed to strengthen both the role and the independence of the Industrial Relations Commission. I viewed a debate on a Special Broadcasting Service television program last night. The shadow Minister for industrial relations, employment and training, Mr Howard, quite clearly reinforced yet again the position of the Opposition, which is essentially to emasculate the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill which is now before the chamber puts in place the recommendations of the Gleeson Committee. The Democrats have reservations about two of those recommendations, and that has become the basis of these amendments. The Bill implements the Gleeson Committee's recommendation that there be a new position of Vice-President. Certainly, we endorse that. In its report the Gleeson Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the establishment of the position of Vice President, with the functions and responsibilities proposed, continues to be appropriate, particularly for the reasons articulated in the Hancock report. [The Committee] believes-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Gleeson Committee-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that the personal load on the President is undesirable and that a formalised structure ancillary to his power of delegation is highly desirable.</PARA>
<PARA>The Gleeson Committee made particular reference to the 1985 report of the Hancock Committee of Review of Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems. The report of the Hancock Committee recommended the creation of the office of a Vice-President in the then proposed Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That Committee noted the growth in the size of the tribunal over the years and the increased scope and complexity of its work, with a concomitant increase in the President's workload. On page 400, paragraph 8.51 of the Hancock Committee report, it is recommended that the legislation designate as special functions of the Vice-President the provision of administrative support for the President, as well as certain other functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, apparently in the interests of managerial flexibility, does not specify the relationship between the President and the Vice-President, and our amendment seeks to elaborate on that relationship. The Minister addressed this matter in his second reading speech, observing that the Vice-President would assist the President, including in relation to the more important matters in the Commission's operations. Even so, it would be preferable to support this role in legislation. To do so, in our opinion, would be more consonant with the objectives of the Gleeson Committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> As already mentioned, such an approach was also recommended by the Hancock Committee. We believe that the words of the Australian Democrat amendment are in the spirit of the recommendations of both Gleeson and Hancock. In addition, given the seniority of the position and its intended role, it is entirely appropriate that, as is done in relation to the office of President, there be a legislative statement of the Vice-President's role. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, we are proposing amendments which will clearly recognise that the office of Vice-President is to be an important element in the effective management of the Commission's business. This will be achieved by providing expressly that the President is to be assisted by the Vice-president in ensuring the orderly and quick discharge of the business of the Commission. This is covered in an amendment inserting a new section 19a in the Industrial Relations Act 1988. That is the essence of the amendment that I am now speaking to. The new provision will not, of course, preclude the Vice-President's involvement in other aspects of the Commission's work. </PARA>
<PARA> Complementing this amendment, it will also be provided that the President may delegate to the Vice-President all or any of the President's powers under the Act. To address the possibility that the Vice-President is unavailable to exercise a delegated power, the President will also be able to delegate that power to a senior deputy president, who will be able to exercise the power in such circumstances. These arrangements are covered in the proposed replacement section 40 of the Industrial Relations Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In this way, the aims of strengthening the Commission and providing the President with high level support will be more clearly and effectively achieved. That is the essential intention of the first of the Australian Democrats' amendments, and it gives rise to the third amendment, which is consequent upon what I have just said. It is worth noting that in the last 12 months the President, Justice Maddern, was forced, due to illness and other circumstances, to be absent for six months of the last year, which tends to emphasise the importance of this new role of Vice-President. That is also a reason for this amendment of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the second of the amendments which have been moved simultaneously. This relates to the structure of benches. The proposed amendment to section 30 (2) gives effect to a recommendation of the Gleeson Committee that greater flexibility in the constitution of full benches in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission be permitted. Regarding the composition of full benches, the Gleeson Committee report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government proposal provided for a more flexible approach to the composition of Full Benches since its proposal no longer required two Deputy Presidents and allowed the work to be shared by Presidential Members and more experienced and skilled Commissioners. Members of the AIRC have argued that this would diminish the authority with which decisions of Full Benches are viewed and this could result in a greater incidence of challenge to decisions of the AIRC. The Committee cannot accept this point. The authority of the decision of the Full Bench stems from the fact that it is a decision incapable of further repeal. Although the Committee does not support the creation of offices of Senior Commissioner, it considers that there would be advantage in increasing the President's flexibility in constituting Full Benches. There may be merit in changing the minimum requirement for constituting a Full Bench to not less than one Presidential Member and two Commissioners. This would not, of course, prevent the President from including more than one Presidential Member when considered appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>It is recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA>- consideration be given to providing greater flexibility in the constitution of Full Benches. </PARA>
<PARA>That is from the Gleeson Committee report, which is being fully endorsed in the Bill before us. The Government has chosen to endorse all recommendations of the Gleeson Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though flexibility in the affairs of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is to be supported, in our view the proposal has some notable drawbacks. This is clear when the range of matters which a Full Bench is permitted or required to deal with is considered. All are significant and warrant a highly qualified Full Bench. I shall give some examples: national wage cases under section 106; appeals under section 45; referrals by the President of matters of industrial dispute under section 107 (2); reviews of awards, et cetera; consideration of proposed certified agreements which under the general thrust and the spirit of enterprise agreements, section 105, assume special importance; review of the operation of certified agreements, likewise under section 117, but in the spirit of the new found identification with enterprise agreements; and the cancellation of awards. </PARA>
<PARA> There are various other provisions where a matter may be directed to a member in the Industrial Relations Commission or to a full bench normally depending upon the seriousness of the matter, for example, orders changing an organisation's representative rights under the Act, the insertion of bans clauses in awards, the authorisation of stand downs and the ordering of secret ballots. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gleeson Committee correctly noted that the particular significance of a full bench derives from the fact that there is no further appeal from its decisions. This contrasts with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), for instance, which permits the Tribunal to be constituted by a presidential member and two other members. Not only is the nature of the matter dealt with by the AAT different but also there is provision for appeal to the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers the importance of the matters coming before full benches and the absence of further appeals, it is difficult to foresee situations where it would be appropriate to have fewer than two presidential members sitting on the bench. That is what we are attempting to acknowledge in this amendment. To provide otherwise, as in the Government's proposed amendment, invites challenges of full bench decisions by prerogative writ before the High Court of Australia. Unsuccessful parties are likely to take the view, even if unfounded, that a full bench with one presidential member on it is a second class bench. This is particularly so given that presidential members have the standing of judges. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other anomalies. For example, in the case of an appeal from a presidential member, it is possible to envisage a situation where a majority of two commissioners could overturn the original decision, even though the presidential member on the Full Bench agreed with it. In other words, two commissioners on the Full Bench could overturn a decision which had the support of two presidential members, namely, the original decision maker and the appellant presidential member. Accordingly, on balance, one must conclude that the desired flexibility is impractical and inconsistent with the underlying objectives of the establishing Full Benches. It is in the light of these observations of the potential inadequacies of those bench structures that the Democrats put before the Committee the second of our three amendments, in accordance with the observations I have just made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not support the Australian Democrats' amendments. As I have already indicated, we believe that this whole section of the legislation should be excised from the Bill. We sought to do that with an amendment which we moved previously but which did not receive majority support in the Committee. Therefore, given our opposition to the propositions in this part of the schedule, we can see no good reason to support the minor tinkering which the Democrats' amendment involves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of the Democrats, Senator McLean, in arguing that the coalition should support this amendment, sought to misinterpret comments that he claims Senator Durack made a couple of days ago, to the effect that the Opposition supports a strong and independent Industrial Relations Commission. That may well be the case, because even under our policy, which will offer the opportunity for employers and employees to conclude by voluntary agreement their own deals with regard to wages and conditions, those deals will nevertheless remain subject to a minimum hourly rate of wage. Therefore, it should be noted that it is not the law of the jungle that applies under our policy, which the Minister has often claimed and which he has again claimed in this debate, because a minimum hourly rate will be required in any such voluntary deal that is agreed on. That is spelt out very clearly in the coalition's industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, there will be a continuing role for the Industrial Relations Commission in at least determining that minimum hourly rate, even when, as we believe, the vast majority of employers and employees opt out of the general centralised system and go to voluntary agreements and genuine enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> So on that basis we certainly believe in a strong and independent Industrial Relations Commission. What Senator McLean fails to recognise is that this legislation has nothing to do with a strong and independent Industrial Relations Commission. What it is about is laying the groundwork for the future establishment of a labour court. As I have said in earlier remarks in debate on this legislation, the coalition will not have a bar of the establishment of a labour court. We will therefore not support legislation to facilitate that development. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook said last night in debate on earlier clauses of the Bill that we ought to support this legislation on its merits and not look to some future possibility that the Government is going to introduce a labour court. Again, though, what he ignores in saying that is that, if this legislation lays the groundwork for a labour court, as it does, then it is incumbent on us to oppose it. Why would an Opposition which opposes that direction want to assist the Government in laying the groundwork and providing the preconditions for the establishment of that court, when we oppose its establishment? For that reason, I reinforce our opposition to this part of the legislation and, in particular, to the amendments moved by the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three amendments have been moved by the Australian Democrats to change the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) as presented by the Government. Although the amendments have been described by the Opposition spokesperson for this Bill in the chamber, Senator Chapman, as being minor tinkering, they go to important functional aspects of how the Australian Industrial Relations Commission operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I turn to discuss the merit of the proposals and give the Government's response to the proposals that have been put, I categorise the types of views that have been put by the major parties. The Opposition is opposed to the whole section. Now that the second reading has been carried, the Opposition does not choose to do what is not unusual in events of this nature: concede that it has lost the argument that the whole section should be removed and then look at how, from its point of view, the functioning of the section can be improved. It is still a flat-footed blanket opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats, who have supported the Government in recognising the merit, worth and value of the findings of the Gleeson inquiry, have turned their minds to seeing whether, qualitatively, those amendments provide the best on balance consideration functionings for the Commission and whether they can be improved. The Australian Democrats have come up with two areas in which they believe the functionings can be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> It has to be said, from the starting point, that the Democrats have taken a constructive view and the Opposition has taken a negative view in this debate. The Opposition has justified its negativity on the basis that things may happen in the future which are not related to this legislation now. I guess that things will always happen in the future which are not related to particular issues before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments spring from a report by three eminent Australians-experts in their field and independent of government-who have fearlessly and properly discharged their charge of office and examined what is the proper and reasonable functioning of a commission and made recommendations accordingly. The Government accepts those recommendations and we seek to translate them into law. For the Opposition to besmirch or discredit these findings on the basis that `Something else is intended somewhere down the track which may or may not happen but if it does we are opposed to it' is to take a head in the sand view. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I turn to the amendments, I say one other thing about the Opposition's case-it is a very interesting reflection. We have just heard from Senator Chapman that my remarks about the Opposition's industrial relations policy being the law of the jungle are not true and that it would allow the Commission to determine minimum hourly rates-I think they were the words he used-and that that would be a role for the Commission. The Opposition supports, in the terms presented by it, a strong and independent commission. That is a very interesting juxtaposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Two or three weeks ago I participated in a debate with the official shadow spokesperson, Mr John Howard, on the 7.30 Report, under the chairmanship of Paul Lyneham. On that occasion, Mr Howard said that the Opposition, if it were elected to government, would legislate a minimum wage for Australia, which did not seem to suggest, since the Parliament would take that responsibility unto itself, a role for the Commission at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to hear today that perhaps Mr Howard was wrong in what he said, that Senator Chapman is right and that the Commission will now have a role in prescribing minimum rates. If the Opposition ever gets into government, we will look forward with rapt interest to see what becomes of its industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the amendments moved by the Democrats; there are two substantive ones. The first amendment is a consequential amendment to rectify other provisions in the law should the merit of the second amendment be adopted. With regard to the first amendment-the duties of a vice-president and delegations to the Vice-President by the President-the Government has taken the approach, in drafting the amendments relating to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, that there should be considerable flexibility available in the arrangement of the business of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that the Government decided not to spell out in the Bill the respective roles of members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Instead, that was to be implied from the purposes of the legislation, the relative seniority of the members and the various provisions of the Act. In addition, the President was to be left to perform the statutory duty of directing the business of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as those things, I made some observations about this matter in my second reading speech which I am sure would be recognised by all of the parties in these circumstances. I recognise the interest and enthusiasm of the Democrats to provide a provision here which is more explicit than the one we have provided. Looking at the terms of their provision, I have to say that it is a more reasonable expression than the terms of some of the earlier provisions that I saw. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances the Government accepts, for the reasons advanced by the Democrats, that there is merit in specifying the administrative responsibility of the Vice-President, particularly in light of the standing of that office in the Commission. Accordingly, the Government will accept the Democrats' proposals for doing so. The Government reiterates that, under section 36 of the Act, the ultimate responsibility for directing the business of the Commission remains with the President. For those reasons I will accept the amendments moved by Senator McLean. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the second amendment, which concerns the composition of full benches. The Democrats' view on this has been set out very fully in the speech to the motion. In that speech there are a number of comparisons, which I think are weighty and significant, as to how the importance of a full bench ought to be viewed given, in this case, that there is no appeal from that, as that is the ultimate body of decision. On this point the Gleeson inquiry talked about greater flexibility for the Commission. In effect, the Democrats' amendment would return the position to the status quo. In weighing the findings of the Gleeson inquiry, one could say that, reasonably, the inquirers would not be offended by the observations made by the Democrats and in fact could see the merit of the Democrats' view. The Government certainly sees the merit of it. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the Gleeson committee recommended that consideration be given to providing greater flexibility to the constitution of full benches. The committee pointed out that the authority of a decision of a full bench stems from the fact that under the Act it is incapable of further appeal. This point was made by Senator McLean. Moreover, the Government's proposal would have left it to the President to determine how a full bench should be constituted. Nevertheless, in view of the argument put, we accept the amendment and on that basis would be prepared to vote for it and thus amend our Bill accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA> 1. On the day on which section 80 of the Industrial Relations (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988 is amended by this Act, the heading to the section is altered by omitting `Deputy Presidents' and substituting `Presidential Members'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments insert in the schedule of the Bill a new part 3 containing amendments to the Industrial Relations (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988. These amendments are necessary as a consequence of the provisions in the Bill which will create the new positions of Vice-President and Senior Deputy President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments are proposed to section 4 (2) and section 80 (1) of the consequential provisions Act to include references to the proposed new positions. These amendments are required to ensure that any Deputy President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission who formerly held the position of Deputy President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and who is appointed to one of the new positions will not be disadvantaged. These provisions of the consequential provisions Act which are to be amended continue the rights of some current Deputy Presidents to retire at age 70 and also concern the designation of certain presidential members. Amendment No. 5 merely makes a necessary consequential change to the heading of section 80 of the consequential provisions Act. I commend the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on the first reading of this Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91 to protest as loudly as appropriate in this chamber about the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) calling on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to review the guidelines for the conduct of ambassadors. It seems that this is being done because one ambassador has brought great disgrace on the ambassadors and high commissioners who represent this country in other places. The Government seems to be trying to cover up for Mr Burke's behaviour by bringing this to the notice of the people of Australia and putting all ambassadors under the spotlight. I regard it as absolutely outrageous that it should seek to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am thinking in particular of some of the former members of this Parliament who have represented this country as ambassadors, including the Hon. Sir Robert Cotton, the Hon. Douglas McClelland and the Hon. Don Grimes. All are former members of this chamber who have represented Australia overseas with great distinction. I am also thinking of the present head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Richard Woolcott, who was formerly Ambassador to the United Nations. I could take the rest of the morning listing names of very distinguished Australians who have served overseas, representing their country as ambassadors and high commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government now seeks to cast a slur over all of these people by suggesting that there is something wrong with the conduct of ambassadors. Most of those who have served their country have been in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for a very long time before they are ever appointed to the position of ambassador or high commissioner. They have gone in as young men and women and they have served their country overseas in a number of positions before they ever get to that stage. They know perfectly well how ambassadors and high commissioners behave and our country has been served well by them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely offensive in the extreme to suddenly suggest that there is something wrong with the way ambassadors behave by wanting to review guidelines for their conduct. They know how to conduct themselves. But because one, whom the Government is seemingly trying to protect, has been behaving in a way in which I regard as reprehensible, considering some of the admissions that he himself has made to the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters, it is very clear that he has no idea how an ambassador should behave. One might even go so far as to say that he has no idea how a Premier should behave.

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time</PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1990-91</PARA>
<PARA> Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 5) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the Additional Estimates for 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1990-91 under Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1, 2 and 3) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Budget figuring contained allowances for prospective wage and salary increases, those amounts were not then appropriated, and funds are now required to meet increases resulting from the Structural Efficiency Principle and other award decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the additional appropriations in the three Additional Estimates Bills totalling $1,000.2 million, $723.8 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 4), $274.4 million in Appropriation Bill (No. 5) and $1.9 million in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2). </PARA>
<PARA> These amounts are offset, in part, by savings in the Appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) 1990-91, reflecting the Government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs. These savings, amounting to $270.5 million, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document ` `Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations, which has been distributed to Honourable Members. </PARA>
<PARA> The appropriations now sought represent a net increase of $729.7 million in payments to be financed from annual appropriations in 1990-91, an increase of 2.3 per cent on the amounts made available at the time of the 1990-91 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Including Appropriation Act (No. 3) 1990-91, which provided additional sums resulting from the Gulf War, the total gross additional appropriations for 1990-91 amount to $1,234.3 million. In net terms this is $963.8 million, or 3.1 per cent of the initial annual appropriations made available for this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I now outline some of the main areas for which the Government has found it necessary to seek additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> $119.7 million, or an increase of 1.3 per cent, is included for increased running costs, of which some $65 million is to cover the costs of the Structural Efficiency Principle and other award decisions, while the balance is mostly the result of various minor initiatives and transfers between financial years. </PARA>
<PARA>Gross additional estimates of $278.2 million are sought for the Defence Portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). </PARA>
<PARA> The gross figures include:</PARA>
<PARA> - $32.2 million for running costs, reflecting costs associated with the Gulf deployment, approved civilian and service salary increases and increases in certain allowances for Defence Force personnel;</PARA>
<PARA> - $206.3 million which largely reflects adjustments for price movements and variations in progress on a number of projects, including payments for ANZAC Ships and submarine refit;</PARA>
<PARA> - $29.6 million for defence facilities, attributable to greater activity levels due to economic conditions and price increases; and</PARA>
<PARA> - $6.8 million for Defence Housing, reflecting an increase in the capital subvention to the Defence Housing Authority as part of the Government's commitment to spend $750 million on Defence housing over 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Taking account of all transactions contributing to the Defence function, including offsets provided from increased revenues and a reduction in the provision for contingent salary and related increases, total Defence Outlays are estimated to increase by $181 million. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> - a further $29.6 million to meet insurance claims associated with defaults by Iraq on credit sales by the Australian Wheat Board insured under the National Interest provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act;</PARA>
<PARA> - $19.1 million to pay out borrowings by Austrade on behalf of the Commonwealth to finance National Interest claims for rescheduled Iraqi cheese debt;</PARA>
<PARA> - an increase of $5 million for emergency aid to meet needs arising from the Gulf War. This amount includes a $2 million contribution to the International Committee of the Red Cross, a $1 million contribution to the United Nations and $0.5 million for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for emergency assistance for Palestinian Refugees;</PARA>
<PARA> - $41.3 million for the increased demand and fee increases for non-departmental hospital care for veterans, together with increased costs in Veterans' Medical Services;</PARA>
<PARA> - $23.0 million for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, including $8.2 million for Community Development Employment Projects, and $9.0 million for the National Aboriginal Health Strategy;</PARA>
<PARA> - a further $12.9 million for trade training, of which $10 million is for additional pre-vocational course places at TAFE Colleges and $1.8 million for Out-of-Trade Training Centres;</PARA>
<PARA> - an additional $28.7 million for AUSTUDY, reflecting increased numbers of recipients in the latter half of 1990, together with an anticipated increase in the first half of 1991; and</PARA>
<PARA> - $22.6 million for a major new overseas marketing campaign by the Australian Tourist Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>These additional appropriations are required to meet commitments that have been made by the Government since the Budget, as well as un- avoidable cost and price increases and other parameter changes since the Budget was prepared.</PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Appropriation Bills that the Senate is now debating-Appropriation Bills Nos. 4 and 5 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2)-comprise the Additional Estimates. They appropriate funds for certain proposed expenditure in addition to the amounts proposed by Parliament at Budget time last year. They provide additional funding for government expenditure to get the Government through to the end of this financial year on 30 June.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Appropriation Bill (No. 4) seeks ad-ditional appropriations of $723.8m to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of government. That amount is additional to the $234.1m that was sought recently in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) for the Gulf involvement and for the national interest insurance claims for Iraqi wheat payment defaults. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriation Bill (No. 5) seeks ad-ditional appropriations of $274.4m for capital works and services, payments to the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, advances and loans and other services. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) seeks additional appropriations of $1.9m for recurrent expenditure of parliamentary departments, including increased costs of televising parliament. No doubt later in this debate other speakers from the coalition will go into more detail on some of the items of the appropriations. I do not propose to go into detail. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that the Opposition does not oppose these Appropriation Bills but, while supporting them, we continue to be appalled at the Government's continuing fiscal irresponsibility and economic mismanagement. For that reason, on behalf of the Opposition, I move the following amendment to the second reading motion:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``but that the Senate condemns the Government for its economic mismanagement and fiscal irresponsibility which has resulted in a severe and protracted recession and led to</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a substantial shortfall in Commonwealth revenues for the year ending 30 June 1990-91:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a major increase in Commonwealth expenditure for the year ending 30 June 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a reduction in the Budget forecast of an estimated $8.1 billion surplus to a possible deficit for 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) an increase in the public sector's call on national savings of up to 3 per cent of gross domestic product in 1991 compared with the Budget forecast of a zero requirement; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) an expected deficit starting point for the 1991-92 Budget based on the existing Forward Estimates''. </PARA>
<PARA>These Appropriation Bills for the Ad-ditional Estimates come at a time of a major unravelling in the Government's 1990-91 Budget which was introduced last August. Indeed, the degree to which a Budget outturn for the end of the year will be so different from the outturn forecast in the Budget itself is unprecedented. The Budget forecast for this year announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his Budget Speech in August last year was that there would be a surplus of $8.107 billion this year. That figure, we knew, was ridiculously and unrealistically optimistic at the time, and every event since then has simply confirmed the Opposition's view, which was stated loudly and clearly on Budget night, that the $8.1 billion surplus prediction was highly unlikely to be achieved; indeed that it was almost impossible for its achievement given the economic circumstances facing Australia at the time. Our predictions have been confirmed week by week, month by month since then. </PARA>
<PARA> The net result is that the Government is estimating for the year as a whole that, instead of the $8.1 billion surplus, there will be a surplus of the order of $1.7 billion, which is a major deterioration. That figure of $1.7 billion is itself likely to be optimistic. There is a very real prospect that, far from having a surplus of that magnitude, there may not be any surplus at all this year. Indeed, it is not impossible that, come 30 June, the Government Budget could be in minor deficit. Whether it is minor deficit or minor surplus is irrelevant to the fact that there has been a major deterioration in the fiscal position. </PARA>
<PARA> That has enormous consequences for the overall finances of the nation. At the time of the Budget the Government predicted that the public sector borrowing requirement, that is, the call that the public sector as a whole-Commonwealth, State, and local government-might make on national savings this year would be zero. The Treasurer rightly said in his Budget Speech that the spending would have to be kept in check for a substantial period to create an exportable surplus in our national production. He said, though:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . these goals can only be accomplished if broad economic policy is kept tight. This Budget will more than uphold its end of the bargain. </PARA>
<PARA>That has not happened, nor have many of the States been able to maintain the degree of financial tightness and discipline that would be required for the public sector as a whole not to have to draw on the savings of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that blow-out at both Commonwealth and State government level, but particularly at the Commonwealth Budget level, the public sector will this year make a call on the savings of this nation of the order of $10 billion or thereabouts-a figure not far short of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. That requirement by the public sector stands in the starkest possible contrast to the correct statement that the Treasurer made to the Premiers at last year's Premiers Conference:</PARA>
<PARA>It is very important for Australia that . . . the public sector has not got its hands on the savings cookie jar of Australia . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What has happened this year has been that the public sector has once again put its hands into the cookie jar of national savings at the expense of the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, one of the Treasurer's much vaunted claims to his title as a respectable Treasurer over recent years has been his boast that for three years in a row-including this year, 1990-91-the public sector as a whole would be either in surplus or not in deficit. In fact, in only one of those years-the first of the three-will that objective be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the role of the public sector in terms of Australia's overall economic structure. Over recent years and, indeed, throughout most of the 1980s, it has been in absolutely the wrong position for what was required if it were to play its part in stimulating and encouraging an environment for private sector growth in investment and employment output. As I said before, throughout virtually all the period of the Hawke Government, with one minor exception, the government sector has been a major drawer on the savings of this nation. That, perhaps more than any other factor, is the reason why this nation has become increasingly uncompetitive, why there has been no increase in productivity during the period of this Government and why we have an economic recession which is deeper than at any other time since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy is more recessed now than it has been for virtually 60 years. One only has to have a look at some of the statistics to confirm that. In the last 12 months unemployment has increased in this country by 263,000 or 51 per cent. Indeed, figures that will be released in less than 10 minutes time will almost certainly confirm another leap in that listing of human misery and hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of unemployment in the last 12 months has increased from 6.2 per cent to 9.2 per cent. In two States of Australia the figure is already officially over 10 per cent. If one talks about figures in the private sector and in government, there is no doubt that the real unemployment figure in Australia as a whole is already well over 10 per cent and rising. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of recipients of unemployment benefits over the last 12 months has gone up by 200,000 or 52 per cent. Job vacancies are down 52 per cent. There are now 28 people unemployed for every job vacancy. Only 12 months ago the number of unemployed for every job vacancy was about 9 1/2. In other words, the ratio has gone out in the wrong direction by a factor of almost three in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the inflation rate in Australia has come down and will probably continue to do so for the next few months. But if a country as recessed as Australia did not have a falling inflation rate, the situation would be even more damning than it is today. Despite the fact that we have the greatest recession for 60 years, the great concern we all ought to have is that our unemployment rate is still higher than most of our major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> No changes have been made in the structure of the Australian economy to give one any confidence. When the economy recovers-as it inevitably and surely will at some stage, although I do not believe that it will happen for another 12 months; the Government has done little to change the basic underlying structure of Australia to get an improvement and a solution to the problems facing this nation-there is no doubt that the inflation band wagon will take off again. I believe that if any one factor above all else is incumbent on the Government, which is supported by business, the unions and every member of the community, it is to engender in Australia a psychology of an anti-inflation bent. We have to develop an anti-inflation culture in this country. We have to develop a pro savings culture and a pro productivity and competitiveness culture. Unless we do that, we will continue on the boom and bust road that we have had for many years now-a road which has been made increasingly bumpy by the incredibly incompetent mismanagement of the Hawke Government over the last eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment no long term joy can be derived out of the inflation rate, encouraging though the downward trend temporarily is. The economy has been in a negative phase of growth-depending on how it is measured-for four out of the last five quarters. Motor vehicle registrations are down annually by a figure of almost 36 per cent, dwelling approvals are down 13 per cent, manufacturing production is down 6.3 per cent and new capital expenditure is down almost 10 per cent. How will we get increasing productivity and a more productive climate in this country if we have the continuing downturn in real investment and capital expenditure that we have seen so sadly and eloquently demonstrated in the last year or so?</PARA>
<PARA> The state of the economy is of great concern. It is delusory on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer and the Leader of the Government in this place, Senator Button, to talk about the worst being over. One would hope that the worst is over, but the worst is not over. There is more to come. I regret that there is a great deal more hardship and pain to be sustained by the Australian community before we start to see a sustainable upturn in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst we could do would be to get an overstimulatory response to the present situation without at the same time tackling the fundamental problems that exist. That was the great tragedy of the so-called industry statement of 12 March. It was the Government's last chance to attempt to really tackle problems in a meaningful way in terms of creating a productive and competitive environment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government blew the opportunity that it had. It did admittedly take a decision to reduce the level of tariffs, but that decision only went along the route that had been advocated by many, including the coalition, for a lengthy period before that. That decision to reduce tariffs was correct. Where it went off the rails, though, in policy terms was that it was not in any way accompanied by the other measures to reduce costs and improve productivity and competitiveness in such a way that the need for continuing tariffs of existing levels was required. </PARA>
<PARA> The great difference between this Government and the Liberal and National parties is that the coalition has a package of economic policy measures of which tariff reduction is only one. But the package as a whole is designed to encourage the greater flexibility and the more efficient use of resources in Australia, which is the only route that can be taken if we are to have a long term and sustainably competitive future for this country, including all sectors of the economy and, most of all, our manufacturing sector. Under this Government the manufacturing sector has taken a beating that it has never taken in the history of our nation. The number of jobs that has been lost in manufacturing unnecessarily because of incompetent economic management in the last eight years is the greatest in our history. It is a shocking indictment of this Government that that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturing industry in this country ought to have a great future; just as there ought to be, and will be, a great future for the mining industries, the great rural industries of this country and the growing tertiary sector. But that will not happen-indeed, the opposite will happen-if the right structures of government are not put into place. For those reasons we in the Opposition are very concerned at the way the economy and the fiscal position of the Government have deteriorated over the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the starting point for the next Budget-the Budget for 1991-92-will be extraordinarily difficult. There is now no doubt at all that the starting point for the next Budget will be one of significant deficit. For the Government to get its Budget structure for 1991 into the right phase it will have to take decisions which will require a degree of courage and fortitude which this Government has shown patently over the last eight years that it lacks almost entirely. So the problems and the prospects for the 1991-92 Budget look extremely difficult from a government fiscal position. The task ahead of the Government in the months ahead-to get an economically responsible and respectable Budget-is a very difficult one indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Those government decisions need to foster various things. The first thing the Government needs to do is adopt policy measures which reduce costs in Australia. If the Government continues to take bad decisions, or fails to take decisions that do lead to reduced costs and greater competitiveness-particularly in the area of the labour market, land transport, rail transport, the waterfront and shipping industries-and if it continues to stall on structural reform in those areas there is no way in which we will become sufficiently cost competitive and restore our international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> I interrupt myself and return to my earlier comments about unemployment. The figures that have just been released in the last five minutes confirm my earlier remarks. Seasonally adjusted unemployment in April has increased by 66,900 to make a total of 844,000 unemployed people. That is the largest monthly rise in unemployment ever recorded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys. That seasonally adjusted estimate of the unemployment rate for April has brought a rise of 0.7 percentage points to now make the official unemployment rate in Australia 9.9 per cent. In fact, in five States of Australia seasonally adjusted unemployment exceeds 10 per cent. For the Government to say that the worst is over is a criminal delusion of those persons who have been thrown onto the unemployment scrap heap by this Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic policies of this Government have caused this recession, this misery and this hardship. Not in one instance have those policies produced any hope that there is a better way or that there is any light at the end of the tunnel. The debate on these matters over the months ahead will be highlighted by several key issues. The key issue facing this country is: how will we adopt policies at the government level which will halt the hardship and the misery which are being caused?</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the cruelest statistic is unemployment, but it is not the only statistic. In the last 12 months bankruptcies have increased by 53 per cent. The profits of most companies have plummeted, as has their cash flow situation, because of an interest rate policy which, despite the fall in nominal interest rates, still has real interest rates at a level of almost 10 per cent-at the moment the figure is about 9 per cent. The Government's economic policies, which cause real interest rates to be at that level, automatically mean that businesses will fail and people will go out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a prospect that real interest rates will rise in the months ahead. As inflation, as a result of the dramatic recession that we have, causes perhaps further falls in nominal interest rates-the fall in nominal interest rates will not be sufficient to be able to match that temporary fall in inflation-so real interest rates will rise. The only way that can change is if the Government takes hold of its Budget decisions and takes measures throughout the economy in the areas of industrial relations, wage reform and structural reform which will allow us to get our real interest rates down. So the prospects in that area are of great concern also. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for those reasons that, whilst the Opposition does not oppose the Appropriation Bills-of course, Additional Estimates Bills are ones that, traditionally, are not opposed by the Opposition-we wish to use this occasion as a vehicle to draw attention to the criminally incompetent mismanagement of this Government. This mismanagement has now brought misery to 844,000 people officially and to well over one million people, if we really look at the figures that are involved. It has produced a massive rise in bankruptcies, corporate difficulties and has created problems for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> That situation does not need to exist. We have great prospects in Australia. We have the skills, the people, the natural resources and the technology to enable us to be a vibrant nation again; to be a competitive and a growing nation-particularly within our own region. There is no need for us in Australia to think that the recession we now have ought to have occurred. It ought not to have occurred. It occurred simply because of government mismanagement. This situation does not have to continue into the future and it will not continue provided that we have a government which is prepared, and able, to take the decisions that will lead to the great potential and capacities of our nation-our people, our resources and our prospects-being realised. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the task for the decade ahead. It is the task for the months ahead because, whilst we have long term potential for a good future, if we do not take the approaches now that are necessary in order to capitalise on our great opportunities we and the Government of the day will stand rightly condemned in the eyes of the Australian people. The only way we will solve our problems at a government level-given the fact that this Government has had not far short of a decade in which to try to run this country and has produced the greatest disasters in this nation's history-is to have a change of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 4), the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) and the Appropriation Bill (No. 5), I endorse the comments of my colleague Senator Short and take the Senate back 12 months. It was approximately 12 months ago that a number of new members entered this Parliament. Prior to their entry, during the election campaign, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and others consistently said, `There will be no recession' and, amongst other things, `We are on top of the economy'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet today Australia faces the worst economic situation since the 1930s, and in many rural areas it is even worse than then. On a comparison of the claims made by the Government during the last election campaign with what it said in November when Australia suddenly had the recession that we had to have, that is one of the greatest lies ever perpetrated on the Australian community. I am sure the Australian public will long remember that lie. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very sad and disappointing for the honest, average Australians who get up every day to do a good honest day's work to find themselves in the situation where they do not have a clue where they will be in one month, two months or six months because the Government's economic policy is totally devoid of direction and new ideas. Every time somebody comes up with some idea to reform Australia's industrial relations system, the taxation system or the method by which social problems are handled, all those opposite can do is knock, knock, knock. </PARA>
<PARA> Three key factors-not the only ones but the important ones-are used to measure the state of an economy. The first is a comparison of how the country is going with the Budget presented at the commencement of the financial year. That measurement of economic performance applies to a government in the same way as it does to a businessman or any householder-how one is travelling now as compared with the estimates made at the beginning of the year. Currently, under the management of the Hawke-Keating Government, Australia is travelling very badly. </PARA>
<PARA> The second factor is the condition of the current account. Once again Australia is heading into a current account deficit of approximately $17 billion to $18 billion before the year is out. It has continued in this vein for a significant number of years with very little improvement. The Government's only way of bringing about any improvement in the current account-and probably the net result at the end will not be much different-is to screw people into the ground and destroy producers with an overemphasis on monetary policy. That overemphasis on monetary policy has sent many good Australian businesses broke.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short referred to the number of bankruptcies in the past 12 months or so. That number is running at a record level and will continue to do so. Only last week when I came through my home town of Ravensthorpe I was met by a couple of people, and on that very day the one bank in the town had issued 12 letters of demand against 12 businesses in the district. That was just one day of this year in one little town. The Government has a lot to answer for because people in towns like this have done nothing wrong. All they have done is work their butts off and try to produce as much as they can, not only for themselves but also for the Australian economy. Had they not been forced to pay interest rates of the order of 28 per cent many of these people would still be in business today. There is nothing wrong with their business management or their output but their costs were blown right out of the sky. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about reliance upon monetary policy and interest rates we must remember that it is not just the direct costs that are affected. The service industry has to hand those costs down through the system. The transport costs go up, the cost of parts goes up and the cost of every other aspect of the operation goes up. </PARA>
<PARA> The third factor used to measure the state of an economy is unemployment. I have just heard the latest figure-9.9 per cent as of now. In my State of Western Australia the unemployment figure passed 10 per cent last month and it is probably over 11 per cent now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Short. The present unemployment rate in Western Australia is 11.1 per cent. The most resource-rich State in the Commonwealth-Western Australia has everything-has an unemployment rate of 11.1 per cent. One cannot ignore the impact of this Government's relationship with its mates in Western Australia over the past few years not only in terms of its financial mismanagement but also in terms of the destruction of Western Australia's reputation as being a good place to deal with. I suggest that anybody who does not believe me should take a trip to Asia. Asian business people describe Western Australian business people as the cowboys of the world. That is an absolute indictment of the performance of the Burke, Dowding and, more lately, Lawrence governments of Western Australia. The fact that Brian Burke continues to hold his ambassadorial position can be described as nothing but a disgrace and absolutely pathetic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have identified three key factors in the measurement of the performance of an economy: how we are travelling against the Budget, the current account and unemployment. Of course, many other things could be used to measure such performance but those three are the key ones. This Government's performance, as measured against all of those factors, fails dismally. </PARA>
<PARA> I now look at a few figures in relation to the Bills before us. The additional appropriations for 1991 are about $963.8m net. That is an increase of 3.1 per cent over the projected figures. Appropriations for 1990-91 in net terms are approximately $30 billion. While all other members of the business community are having to tighten their belts and cut their expenditure in an endeavour to survive, we see the Government bringing before us an increase in its requirements. One must ask why there cannot be a little more fiscal management in order to bring this under control. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the sector that I have been involved in all my life-that is, the farm sector-we see that farmers have had to cut their budget expenditure by up to 50 per cent. They cannot ask the taxpayer for a bit more money. Why can we not apply some of those business principles to government management?</PARA>
<PARA> If we look at some aspects of what has occurred through this mismanagement, we find that net pay-as-you-earn estimates for the eight months to February this year are $1.65 billion behind Budget Estimates. If we go further, we find that for prescribed payments in the same period there is a shortfall of $247m. We see that company tax receipts are down $377m. One could argue that, because of that, the Government can legitimately say, `We have to recover or offset that loss'. That is a nonsense argument. </PARA>
<PARA> If this economy had been managed in any sort of a responsible manner, we would find that those figures would be up; productivity would be up. If we had addressed our industrial system and put a little emphasis on getting productivity up and running in this country, those figures would be up. There would be no need to come back here asking for more money. We could, in fact, produce a very large and real surplus. That is where the crux of the problem lies. This is what happens when those people who produce, who ultimately pay tax-and I include employees and employers in that-are screwed into the ground. We have seen today that there are some 844,000 people without jobs now. If we had a properly managed economy, those people could be out in the work force being productive and paying tax; but instead we have things back-to-front. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now make some comments about our current account deficit, which is currently running at approximately $13 billion. As I have already said, it will end up at somewhere between $17 and $18 billion a year. Last year at the debt summit, it was identified that to stabilise our debt in this country and to get on top of our current account deficit, we needed a net growth of about 4 per cent in export earnings for the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> What has this Government done to facilitate that situation? The situation will not be improved by screwing people into the ground deeper and deeper, but it will be improved if incentives are provided for people to get out there and do things. In providing incentives, a number of areas in particular must be addressed. The first one has to be the taxation system. The taxation system in this country penalises anybody who has a go. It penalises exporters, the very people whom we need to bring about a net growth of 4 per cent each year for the next 10 years for Australia to get on top of its financial problems and return to being the country it was some 40 or 50 years ago. That should be a challenge that everybody in this place, the other place and throughout the Australian community should accept willingly. </PARA>
<PARA> But when we have a government with policies which create a situation whereby exactly the opposite happens, how can we criticise what is now quoted readily-that Australian quote, `She'll be right, mate.'? Of course `she'll be right' if there is nothing in it at the end of the day for the individual. We must give a little incentive, the opportunity to perform, and some reward at the end of the day. We only have to look at how our sports men and women perform. If we give them a bit of encouragement, they are as good as or better than anybody else in the world. Certainly, when it comes to determination and application, there are none anywhere who can match our sports people. </PARA>
<PARA> There needs to be a drastic and radical overhaul of our taxation system. We must put incentive and reward back into the taxation system, so that those people who do a little or a lot extra are encouraged and so that those people who invest are encouraged to do so. I have mentioned in this place before that our sales tax regime penalises our exporters who are in competition with other countries around the world-particularly America, Canada, Europe, Argentina and, shortly, I would imagine, South Africa-which do not penalise their exporters through their taxation systems, giving those exporters an enormous advantage over the Australian exporter in the marketplace. This will become more and more important as protection is reduced in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now on a course of the reduction of protection, which I welcome. It is unstoppable. But, as that protection drops and we see our growing manufacturing industries hopefully moving towards becoming internationally competitive, they will not want any government imposed penalties to be placed on them through the taxation system when they are competing out in the real world. They will want the removal of much of the unnecessary regulation and duplication that occurs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention one budding industry, particularly in Western Australia, which is affected by that regulation and duplication-the flower industry. Those people moving into the export of flowers, particularly to Asia, have to get a certificate of inspection, which costs $35 for every half-hour spent inspecting the flowers, even though the certificate has no commercial value. If the inspection goes one minute over that half an hour, the price goes up to $70. When the flowers get to markets in Japan, Korea and other Asian countries, the certificate has no value at all. The inspection is done all over again by the country of entry. Yet, because of our export regulations, those flowers are not allowed to leave the country before being inspected. It is ludicrous-and that is just one example of the sorts of regulations we have in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to raise a couple of points which came out of the Estimates. Although I will be pursuing them in the committee stage, I want to identify them in this speech. Before I do that I shall make a few comments regarding the tax that is about to be imposed on the wool industry. I have been provoked to do this by that incredible answer given to us yesterday in this place by Senator Cook and that incredible interview given by Minister Kerin on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio yesterday. I shall read part of the answer. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The imposition of a 15 per cent tax rate, rather than the 12 per cent recommended by the Vines committee, will result in a tax higher by hundreds of dollars-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the word `hundreds'-</PARA>
<PARA>rather than thousands of dollars. At a time when growers will already be experiencing very tight incomes, our view would be that a few hundred dollars extra will not be the decider in terms of bankruptcies, as the honourable senator's question implies. The difference between a 12 per cent and a 15 per cent levy on growers' viability is also, in our view, insignificant . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What an incredible statement! When things are tight, the cents count. Here we have the Minister talking about hundreds of dollars not being significant. The sad part about this answer is that it is a damned lie, an absolute total lie. Let us look at the actual figures in the average situation for woolgrowers in this country. I state quite categorically here, to put it on the public record, that in net terms the difference between a 15 per cent tax rate and 12 per cent tax rate is $4,126. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall withdraw the remark; I did say it. The difference is $4,126. It is not the couple of hundred dollars that the Minister says; it is 41 hundreds. If we put this into gross terms, we have to add more than another $2,000, or another 20 hundreds. It has to be realised that, to produce a 15 per cent tax which the Corporation keeps, costs one half of one per cent. We are looking at a situation whereby that 15 per cent tax, in terms of the gross impact-I am glad that Senator Button has walked into the chamber-is 22 1/2 per cent. If we reduce that tax to 8 per cent, the gross impact is 12 per cent, and we are talking about many hundreds of dollars, in fact thousands, not the couple of hundred that Senator Cook talked about yesterday. If we look further at its impact on the pre-tax net returns of growers last year-I am talking about woolgrowers-that tax is 16.7 per cent this year. One can only estimate what the income of a woolgrower will be. The difference in that 3 per cent could well be 50 per cent of the total net income of woolgrowers. It is not insignificant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to raise other points in the committee stage but I shall give notice of them now. One relates to the flock reduction scheme which for a variety of reasons caused a lot of heartburn for many people, including me. Yet I did support it and I am quite willing to say that. If we look at it, between 13 1/2 million and 15 million sheep would have been taken out by this scheme at an average cost of about $3.80 per head; certainly less than $4 per head. Until the scheme is completed we will not know the final price. Yet on questioning of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Australian Wool Corporation, we find that no cost benefit analysis has been done on that particular scheme. I find that absolutely extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA> My next point relates to the fact that at the Estimates Committee hearings last year I raised the issue of farm plans in terms of getting tax deductibility for conservation work on properties. We still do not have a satisfactory answer to that. One must question why, in what is a taxation provision, somebody has to come in to authorise the farm plan. Surely the taxation laws are sufficient in this country that, if the provision is abused, action can be taken within that arena. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall conclude my remarks by re-emphasising the three points I raised at the beginning of these comments. First we need to measure how we are going-whether it relates to a government, a business or a household-compared with the initial budget. Secondly, we must look at how the current account situation is going. Thirdly, we must look at how the unemployment situation is going. In each of these three measures, the Government has failed dismally. Unless there is a rethink about the direction that must be taken to resurrect this country, we will keep on sliding down the road which we are now on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91, which is in the package before us. I want to talk about the Department of Defence Supplementary Estimates, which include the expenditure of $68.882m in relation to the Gulf, principally for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) contingent that served there. At the outset I pay tribute to the members of the Australian Defence Force who served in the Gulf. They were, in the main, the crews of the RAN ships, but they also involved RAN divers who did what I regard as one of the most unpleasant tasks that befell the lot of any servicemen or women who served in the Gulf. The waters in which they were operating and the conditions under which they were operating, with the booby traps, the mines, and the underwater defences in the harbours around Kuwait, were distinctly unpleasant and distinctly dangerous, to say the least.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also had a number of exchange personnel, who had been posted to friendly countries, serving in units which were transferred to the Gulf, and we had a large medical contingent on the USS Comfort. All of the Australians who served in the theatre of operations acquitted themselves well and brought very favourable comment for their country. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the medical personnel who served there were reservists. One of the problems that has emerged with the reserve medical component and the dental component-it is something for which the Government has proposed no solution at present-is the great loss of income that a great many of these people suffered by being called up for active service. They are all prepared to do this or they would not be members of the reserves, but it really does cause acute hardship. These people are mainly self-employed, sole traders, whose overheads are quite considerable. The overheads continue while they are on duty and the recompense they get in respect of their service in no way meets their outgoings. Call up for a period of continuous service costs them a great deal of money. This is the problem that the Americans have experienced also, because their medical services are largely dependent upon reservists. </PARA>
<PARA> The way the world is, with volunteer armies, we must rely very heavily on reserves. This problem has to be overcome, and it can be overcome only by the allocation of some financial recompense for those who are genuinely out of pocket as a consequence of service. However, I digress there. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the expenditure of $68.882m, which the Government had to make to get the Navy into the Gulf. That money should have been spent years and years ago. In other words, the ships were not equipped to operate in a hostile environment in a combat role. Money was spent on infra-red sensors for mine detection, on beefing up communications systems, for close-in weapons systems, and on other items of equipment which were essential. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the expenditure of what is a relatively large amount of money-$68m-only four ships out of the whole of the Royal Australian Navy were equipped to operate in a hostile environment as a consequence of that expenditure. As I said before, that money should have been spent years ago, to maintain a threshold degree of preparedness in the Navy, and a similar argument applies in relation to both the Air Force and the Army. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Gulf war started we simply had no force in the Australian Defence Force that we could have sent there for immediate service. The Navy required a considerable expenditure of money to get a small number of ships ready. The Air Force similarly required tens of millions of dollars in expenditure on electronic welfare capability, the purchase of precision guided munitions and the training in the use of those munitions, before it could have gone to the Gulf on an active service basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Army, despite being the largest of all three services in Australia, whatever the amount of money we have spent on it, simply could not have taken a place with a formation in a conventional modern land battle. Our personnel are trained for light infantry tasks. The operational deployment force in Townsville, for example, is a very highly trained unit, but there is very little place for it on the modern battlefield. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has to address the problem of what it wants the Australian defence forces to do and to equip them with a central professional capability in all three combat arms-Army, Navy and Air Force-so that they have a degree of readiness. We cannot have the whole of the defence forces in a high state of readiness because it is economically impossible. No country does that. Neither the United States nor Israel, the two principal countries with a demand for defence forces being in a high state of readiness, does that. With our economic base, it is impossible for us to have more than a limited level of readiness. But at present we have a total inadequacy with respect to readiness and that must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary reason for this is the fact that the defence budget is so low. We are now spending about 2.3 per cent of what is a very low gross domestic product (GDP), the lowest for more than 40 years. The mandarins in this town who seem to know everything are talking quite confidently of the percentage of GDP going to defence being reduced to 2 per cent. I have even heard figures of 1.5 per cent and even lower in five or six years time, if the policies presently followed by this Government are kept in place. If we reach that situation, we simply should not be spending anything at all on defence, because it would become just farcical and be a waste of money. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the disturbing things in relation to defence expenditure at present is the Force Structure Review Committee, the findings of which are due to be announced in this Parliament on 6 June. This is a major cost cutting exercise, which will have enormous consequences on the capability of the Australian defence forces. It will bring on for the Government the biggest fight since conscription for overseas service in Australia. It has never been debated in this Parliament because very little information is available on it, but there has been a series of selected leaks that have come from the offices of the two Ministers responsible, that of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) and that of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). Whenever members of the press pick up the two Ministers on this and ask for further details, or start to question them on it, further debate is denied on the grounds that the matter has yet to go to Cabinet and they are told that it will be announced and made clear on 6 June. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the leaks do have a degree of veracity. The origins for this review are very obscure. There is certainly no protest out there in the Australian community about the amount of money we spend on defence. In fact, in the last three or four weeks a survey came out that showed that 61 per cent of Australians are not satisfied with the level of defence capability of this country. They do not think the Australian defence forces are able to defend the country to the extent that the general population expect. My assumption is that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said to Mr Bilney, who is a very charming eccentric, that something ought to be done. I say that with respect, Minister. I enjoy Mr Bilney's company enormously. </PARA>

<PARA> I am alarmed at the projected cuts in the combat capability of the Australian defence forces, particularly the proposal that they are going to create an emergency reserve, which is something that was tried in the 1960s. It does not work. It cannot work. There is not a pool of youths in the Australian community who are prepared to do 12 months of continuous training, followed by four years with a commitment of at least two months in the reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> What we want in the Reserve forces is the brightest and the best. One of the central lessons of the Gulf war was the importance of having highly trained, high quality personnel using high quality weapons systems. We cannot get that if we are recruiting our reservists, who are the first line of supplementation for the Defence Force, from the unemployed or the unemployable, which is what the emergency reserve proposed by the present crew at Russell will do. Australia will be very badly served if that happens. </PARA>
<PARA> If that goes ahead we will see a very marked reduction in the minuscule combat capability of the Army and the Air Force. We will also see the complete devastation of the reserves in the Army that have never had a fair go because of the budgetary constraints that have been placed upon them. But with a shrinking budget it is inevitable that a new emergency reserve will bite very, very deeply into the resources of both the Army and the Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no objection at all to the taxpayer getting value for money and, indeed, it is obligatory on all of us in this Parliament to ensure that they do. There are examples of waste and inefficiency in the defence forces. They ought to be cleaned up. But after seven years on the job we do not see any of that coming from this Government. We still see a vast degree of overmanning and overranking in the Australian defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in 1987 the defence committee of this Parliament produced its report Management of Australia's Defences and took to task the great degree of overranking that exists in the Australian defence forces. Nothing has been done about that. For example, the Australian Army has one officer to every six other ranks-that is, 16.6 per cent. The comparable figure for the United States is 13.3 per cent. Putting it another way, the Australian Defence Force has a proportion of officers of general rank-that is, one star and above-to all personnel of 1 : 456. In the United States it is 1 : 2,020. </PARA>
<PARA> It costs a great deal of money to keep a general by the time we pay his DFRDB-Defence Force retirement and death benefits-and all the other expenditures that are associated with having senior officers. As our report in 1987 showed, the number of senior officers in the Australian Defence Force has virtually doubled since the early 1960s and for no real purpose at all. Part of it, of course, has come about through inadequate salaries paid to Defence Force personnel. One of the ways of overcoming that is to promote them; but to do that is bad management practice and, of course, it generates greater costs in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Gulf expenditure. There were many lessons in the Gulf operation of value to the Australian defence forces. Characteristically, the Government and the Department of Defence have pretended that the Gulf operation did not occur, and the only statement we have had has been the statement read by the Chief of the Defence Force, a ministerial statement at the air power conference some months ago, in which, inter alia, the Minister said that we really have to be very careful about looking at the Gulf because it is not Australia; different circumstances apply here. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a different geographical circumstance but it really was the first large-scale example of the exercise of armed forces in all three combat arms-Army, Navy and Air Force-that we had seen for nearly 45 years, since Korea. There were a lot of lessons that came out of that in relation to Australia's needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank the Minister for Defence at this point. When the operations started in the Gulf, the Minister took to Cabinet the proposition that the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade make an official visit to the region. That was accepted by Cabinet and I think it was of great value to the Parliament. Mr Ted Lindsay from the House of Representatives and I went along, he as the Chairman and I as Deputy Chairman representing the Senate. I am grateful to the Government for affording us that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> We arrived in the theatre of operations four days after the cessation of hostilities. We were able to meet all the senior commanders in the headquarters groups. I would like to record my appreciation for the way in which those visits were arranged. I thank the people who did that. I would also like to thank our hosts, the various senior officers in the headquarters group. We were all enormously impressed with the professional capability of those men and women. The professionalism, the intelligence and the capability of the headquarters staff were really outstanding. We had every confidence in them. </PARA>
<PARA> They extended us as much time as we wanted for interviews. We were a small group-we were only three-and we were the first civilian group from outside the theatre to be there meeting with them. We met with senior commanders and we had at least three-quarters of an hour with them, just in a small group-the three of us and one or maybe two of them. Nothing was off limits. We could discuss whatever we liked. We gained a great insight into how the operations were conducted and how the war was won. </PARA>
<PARA> The first visit we made was to General Waller, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. He was brought in by General Schwarzkopf from Centcom, the American headquarters that ran the whole operation. He had overall command of the operations under General Schwarzkopf. While we were with General Waller he talked about the overall perspectives of the campaign as he saw them: the great way in which all three combat arms combined; the joint operations between the Air Force, the Army and the Navy; and the very high degree of interoperability between the three services and between the coalition groups. Probably the great genius of General Schwarzkopf was shown in the time he expended in diplomacy, in bringing into unison a group of more than 30 nations who had armed forces in that theatre, all working together for the common aim and support of the United Nations resolution. That did not happen easily. There were a great number of cultural differences between the forces involved, between the Western and the Arab nations. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also a great disparity in experience between the forces. Countries such as Saudi Arabia had never operated with the force structure and the number of troops involved in the Gulf operation. That was all accomplished without any difficulty at all, and it is a tribute to not only General Schwarzkopf but also all the senior planners that agreement was reached through discussion and everyone was brought to agreement without anyone feeling that he was being badly treated or left out of planning or that his national interests were not being considered. Under the stress of a combat situation, that is no mean achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> General Waller told us of the deception plan: the way they built on the perception of the Iraqis that the main attack on Kuwait would be from the Gulf by way of an amphibious landing; how they maintained that through military means through the dispatch of more and more marine amphibious units to the area, the generation of signal traffic, helicopter lifts and all the rest of it. They were so successful that up to four days before the start of the land operations on 24 February the Iraqis dispatched another three divisions into the south-east corner of Kuwait. Right up to the cease-fire time the Iraqis still maintained that the principal attack would come from the coast. Of course, it never could have come that way. There were some very good technical reasons which prevented a mass landing being made of the dimensions needed to evict the Iraqis from Kuwait on the coast there. </PARA>
<PARA> From General Waller we went to Admiral Sharp, who did the overall planning for the operation. Admiral Sharp was accompanied by Colonel Purvis. Colonel Purvis, a graduate of Fort Levenworth Staff College and a very brilliant mind, came with three majors and they did the operational planning-that is, the defence of Saudi Arabia. It is interesting that the defence plans for Saudi Arabia took something like four months to put together because of the need to educate and bring along all the coalition partners in the nature of the operation that was being run. Yet all of the mass of detail for the offensive campaign was written in only four weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> Colonel Purvis took us through the deception plan again in much greater detail and the huge logistic problems that were involved. There was a precondition for the land operations that at least 60 days supplies were in the field before the land operation could begin. That involved something like 30 million gallons of fuel alone. All of this was held south of Kuwait because until the air war started on 16-17 January the Iraqis could observe what was going on south of the border and the planners wanted to maintain the deception that the primary attack would come from an amphibious landing plus a breaching of the border between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. </PARA>
<PARA> Until 15 January the Soviets were selling the Iraqis satellite information of the area. After 15 January the satellite information stopped and then the logistic suppliers could move to the west of Wadi al Batin and into the area where 7 Corps and 18 Corps ultimately made the attack which defeated the Republican Guards, which was the principal objective of the land operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The logistic supplies and the logistic planning were enormous and the UN forces were aided there by the great degree of overdevelopment of the infrastructure within Saudi Arabia itself. One of the principal ports used in the Gulf was Al Jubayl, which has 17 miles of dockside. That enabled all the supply ships to come in and unload thousands of tonnes of supplies onto the dockside, onto the acres and acres of concrete there, and that all went up the single road from Al Jubayl to al Batin. There was something like 42 miles of convoys a day moving up there, with 400 heavy armoured vehicles. The degree of planning that went into the logistics was enormous, as was the degree of detailed planning that went into the operation itself. When the combat started with the air war on 16-17 January, it all rolled according to plan and everything worked out very well. </PARA>
<PARA> All the headquarters people to whom we talked put great emphasis on the success of the air war. The air war really was the dominant factor in the campaign. I said a few minutes ago that there were 60 days supplies as a precondition for the land battle. There were also preparations for 20,000 to 30,000 casualties for the land battle on the hospital and medical teams side. So there was a huge degree of preparation there. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the best of analysis, the expectation was that the land operation would run for weeks and that there would be tens of thousands of casualties. In the event, such was the power and precision of the air war that the land operation was over in 100 hours. It is a matter of history that the UN forces lost fewer than 200 killed. With the numbers of personnel involved-over half a million on each side-the huge amount of weaponry that was involved, the open nature of the terrain and all the rest of it, it was one of the great feats in history that an army that was experienced and well equipped in the way the Iraqis were, was defeated in 100 hours in a land battle for the loss of probably 120 to 130-I do not have the precise figures-of the UN forces. </PARA>
<PARA> A large part of the credit for that goes to the way that air power, using high technology, and using it in the correct way in accordance with modern doctrine, had such a dominating effect. That is very important for us in Australia because we have tended to assume that we will always have air superiority in this country. We have fought under air superiority in the engagements we have been involved in, probably since 1943. But if we do not have the means of obtaining air superiority in this country and if we are opposed by an opponent who has the means of using modern technology in the air against us, the ability to conduct operations on the ground no longer exists. One cannot operate on the ground if one is opposed by someone using modern technology and controlling the air space. And, as that decimation of the convoy on the Al Mutla Ridge showed, one cannot even run away if one does not enjoy some degree of air superiority. </PARA>
<PARA> After we talked to planners in the Central Headquarters, the staff of General Waller and Admiral Sharp and Colonel Purvis, we then moved to the British Forces Middle East Headquarters. We had a session with the Chief of Staff of--</PARA>

<PARA> We then met with Prince Khalid, the Commander of the Arab Forces. Then we met with Brigadier-General Glosson, who ran the air war for General Horner. Glosson and Purvis were the two really outstanding minds in the whole campaign. I say that with full respect for the intelligence and the professionalism of all the other people we met. They were an exceptional group of people, but in my judgment General Glosson and Colonel Purvis stood out. It was one of the most absorbing of all the interviews we had. General Glosson would not have us at Air Force Headquarters. He said `No, I will come to you'. He came to the Australian Embassy in Riyadh and he gave us a couple of hours, in great detail, of how the whole air campaign was put together. That was of great value to us. </PARA>
<PARA> We then went down to Bahrain and we went on to the RAN ships, Sydney and Westralia, and met with the crews there and saw them at sea; they were still patrolling. We met with Admiral Arthur, who was the navy commander for all the forces in the area, on Blue Ridge at Bahrain, and met with his planning staff. We then went to Kuwait City itself and saw the effects of the occupation on that city. We also saw the oil fires. </PARA>
<PARA> While we have watched on television, on our screens at home, those plumes of smoke on the horizon, until one sees the extent of the atmospheric pollution that is coming from it one simply cannot credit it. It depends on the wind velocity, the wind strength and the atmospherics of the day, and it changes from time to time through the day. But in the middle of the day, in what is a tropical setting, it was almost as dark as night for about an hour. It was quite scary to be there in those conditions. The major priority, I believe, and of far higher importance than any of the politics in the area, apart from saving the lives of the Kurds, is cleaning up and putting out those fires before anything else is done. </PARA>
<PARA> We then went to Cairo and met with the director of military intelligence in the Egyptian Army. The Egyptians had the second largest land force in the area, with two divisions and about 18 artillery battalions there, a commando brigade and a big logistic component. Then we went to Israel and talked to the Israelis. We inspected a Patriot detachment and talked to their military intelligence, as well as meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister Netanyahu and the Defence Minister, Mr Arens. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of points out of all this that have to be emphasised in relation to Australia. The first is the matter of intelligence. There is no such thing as warning time; that is one of the things that the Gulf showed very clearly. We, therefore, do need to have a degree of readiness. It cannot be extensive but we do have to have something that is ready to go in the defence forces. We do have to have highly trained people, and we have to have high quality equipment. It is the only way we can fight. We have to have a degree of interoperability, because we are going to be involved in operations with other nations under the aegis of the UN. I think it is unlikely we will be fighting alone in any future conflicts, so the matter of interoperability is important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the course of the debate that essentially covers the full range of Government activity, I wish to focus upon the lamentable failure, over six months, of the Hawke Labor Government to protect the good name of Australia in regard to the continued tenure of Brian Burke as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. The fact that Mr Burke remains employed by the Commonwealth of Australia until 31 July is an indictment of the courage of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in refusing to dismiss him for now admitted impropriety and possible illegality and a reflection upon the whole ethos of the Hawke Labor Government in putting cronyism above diplomatic standing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is such a shame that Senator Button has also bought into this. I would have thought he would have a higher position on this than his mates. Really, Mr Burke should have gone a long time ago. The honourable senator knows that, we know that and so do the people of Australia and the people of Ireland. It is very sad that he has condoned what his colleagues and the Prime Minister have done. Way back on 19 December last year I raised a number of issues about Mr Burke and the appropriateness of his remaining in the position; yet we were stonewalled then and we are stonewalled now. Over successive weeks of questions on the continued suitability of Mr Burke to remain as Ambassador, I summarised my concerns when speaking on the adjournment. The questions that I raised then--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Button" NAMEID="4F4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I missed that speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a real shame that Senator Button missed that, because it was a burster. All of those questions remain unanswered today. The publication of the diaries of the convicted phone tapping investigator, Robert Smith, raised, even then, a serious question as to the high character as ambassador of a person who appeared to have ordered spying on political opponents. Such an action, according to the honourable member for Stirling, would have justified the resignation of a Premier, to say nothing of what should happen to an ambassador. What a pity the Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister did not share the honourable member's judgment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, I asked why the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not investigate just who did pay for the dirty tricks campaign and the spying by Mr Smith, if only to assure himself and the Parliament and the people of Australia that one of Australia's diplomats is above and beyond reproach. He has not done that, even today. I also asked why it had been necessary for the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) to be briefed six times in a matter of days by the Australian Federal Police in 1988 about issues concerning phone tapping and the possible connection with Mr Burke. We still have not got an answer to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Were the then Attorney-General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs briefed as to the contents of the now famous blue file marked `Government' which was seized from Mr Smith? Why did the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs refuse to obtain an answer as to why all documents taken from Smith on 6 December 1988 were not on the property seizure record? None of these things seems to be important to the Government. It has simply brushed them under the carpet and said, `It does not matter. This is cronyism at its best and we will protect Mr Burke come hell or high water'. </PARA>
<PARA> Those were the questions that I asked. No Minister and no member of the Hawke Labor Government has been prepared to answer them. I did not ask about a breach of law at that stage, but it was the business of the Senate to know whether Ministers were aware of possible impropriety by the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. The Minister has not made it his business to clarify whether or not there has been any impropriety or illegality. He continues to say that it is rumour and innuendo. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not rumour and innuendo. It is now based on the very evidence that Mr Burke himself has provided. But cronyism reigns supreme. Sadly, neither the Minister for Foreign Affairs nor the Prime Minister wished to clarify the position of their little mate, and their little mate rolls on at the taxpayers' expense and to the detriment of the international reputation of Australia. From his answers at the time we can only deduce that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade did not consider political surveillance to be improper. He obviously still does not consider that to be improper. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, one can only ask: what does he do and what does this Labor Government do about their political opponents? If they do not consider it improper in Western Australia, they probably do not consider it improper anywhere. The answer emerged in the media on 27 February 1991 that the now celebrated leader's account controlled by Mr Burke had been used to pay for the surveillance. While this may not be viewed as illegal, to most people it would surely be seen as highly improper. No answers have been forthcoming from this Government as to any questions. We may have to await further evidence in the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The publication of the McCusker report on the collapse of Rothwells has raised five specific questions which I posed on 19 December as to the role of Mr Burke and his consequent fitness to serve as Ambassador. Was Mr Burke a de facto director of Rothwells in his last three months as Premier through the appointment of public servants Lloyd and Edwards to the board? Was Mr Burke aware of the memorandum of 13 November 1987 stating that Rothwells was again insolvent? Was Mr Burke instrumental in having another $50m injected into Rothwells on 16 November 1987 through the purchase of Broken Hill Propriety Co. Ltd shares by the State Government Insurance Corporation? Did Mr Burke supply a character reference to the late Bill Burgess as Chairman of Rothwells to allay suspicion by the National Companies and Securities Commission as to the $500m worth of non-performing loans in Rothwells? Did Mr Burke hold out the offer of a senior government position to Mr David Hurley in December 1987 to induce him not to resign as the one Rothwells director with banking credibility? I also asked what knowledge Mr Burke might reasonably have been expected to have of payment of bribes to the Stirling city councillors when his brother, Terry, taped a conversation and his long term adviser, the late Jack Walsh, was involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only was Mr Burke aware of all of these things, but also so was Senator Beahan. Senator Beahan has sat in here with his lips zipped for so long, knowing full well that he knows that tax was not paid and knowing full well that bribes were given to people to vote in a certain way in a local council decision; but he is not prepared to come out and put the facts straight. </PARA>
<PARA> All these questions, based upon substantial evidence, needed to be answered. Presumably, we will have to wait until answers are obtained through the Royal Commission because this Government has been derelict in attempting to have the situation clarified in order to avoid any further international embarrassment. They were questions that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should have asked an ambassador so implicated, and that should have resulted in that ambassador being stood down until they were refuted. Of course, the Hawke Labor Government was going to protect its mate being warehoused in Ireland prior to resuming a political career. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A matter of public interestwhich I think should be of concern to the nation is that of the future direction of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). That organisation has been changing direction over the last three or four years and the Opposition has been generally supportive of its new direction. Yesterday in the Senate the annual report of the DSTO Commercial Activities Trust Account was tabled, and I would like to take this brief opportunity to make some comments on the commercialisation of DSTO.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although these are still the early days of the commercialisation and new direction of the organisation, valuable progress has already been made. The annual report does not yet give a profit and loss statement, although I understand that will be provided next year. I was particularly interested to study the analysis of the trade debtors as at 30 June last year and to notice that, compared with the previous year, the Government has become a much better payer of its debts. I say this because in 1988-89 debts owing by government to DSTO for 90 days or more totalled nearly $35,000, whereas in 1989-90 debts of 90 days or more were nil. This is certainly a move in the right direction and I hope it is one that will be maintained. In fact, outstanding government debtors had reduced from nearly $138,000 last year to just over $18,500 this year. </PARA>
<PARA> By comparison, however, private trade debtors reflected the problems which we are seeing in the wider community. Ninety-day debtors last year were nearly $17,000 and for this year they were up to $83,000. Where private debtors last year were nearly $87,000 in total, that had blown out this year to $244,000. I recognise that there has been greater work done with the private sector this year, but close attention will have to be given to control over debtors in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pleasing to see the growth in commercial receipts over the 12 months. In fact, the total commercial receipts doubled over the previous year. Areas of especially good growth were consultancies, which had grown from $117,600 to $290,000, and also testing and analysis, which grew from $69,780 to $495,260. I presume that this will be the trend for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunities available to DSTO are many and varied. They range from some unique capabilities such as wind tunnels and testing facilities for engines, structure and materials, to information technology, special material techniques and testing. Some work being done in the Surveillance Research Laboratory will have a substantial overseas military market, and of particular value should be work being done in infra-red sensor materials. Other commercial opportunities include software applicable to air traffic control, in new computer architecture, and the application of optical fibre technology.</PARA>
<PARA> These are exciting areas, and Australia should be proud to have scientists and engineers of the calibre we have, working generally out of sight in DSTO. Unfortunately, over the years, much of their work has not been recognised and in some cases it has even been lost to Australia. That can no longer be allowed to occur. Therefore, it is extremely important that these highly trained and able people have their work translated effectively into benefits for this country. That is why I believe it is so important that we also make sure that we have equally skilled people available to develop and manage the commercial side of the organisation's work. </PARA>
<PARA> There are negotiations to be undertaken, joint ventures to be set up, contracts to be written, business plans to be established and intellectual property safeguards to be implemented. There are licences and licensees to be dealt with. Scientists are renowned for not usually being comfortable in these areas. It is absolutely critical that people of a high calibre are available to DSTO to harness the maximum commercial benefit for the organisation from its scientists' and engineers' achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> The limitations on the work that can be done are twofold. One is the lack of capital. The cap on funds from DSTO is one per cent of total DSTO funding. There is an urgent need for capital to be supplied by industry partners and, of course, increasingly from ploughing profits back into expansion of the work. </PARA>
<PARA> The second limitation is inevitable, and that is that the commercial activity needs to be consistent with defence objectives. There are obviously constraints on what information can go outside the Organisation. Defence work must take priority and our national security and procuring processes must not be jeopardised. Inevitably, we are restricted by the size of our domestic markets and by limitations on defence exports. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be a great help if Australian industry were to become more aware of the valuable resource to which it has access in DSTO. Australia could truly be brains driven with more input into industry from the research work done in DSTO. It is my understanding that DSTO is still lagging the field in terms of commercialisation in similar organisations such as the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and the commercial arm of the AMC. </PARA>
<PARA> The achievements during the year are significant and exciting, but I believe they are just a taste, a forerunner, of what can be done by this organisation in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe the honourable senator should start taking an interest in a thing or two. I should like to raise a few matters relating to what has become known as the Meatgate saga. I refer to the situation which has developed in the Harrison inquiry. This has now become a merry-go-round of deception and inconsistency. Unfortunately, I suspect it will end in failure. It is an absolute tragedy for the Australian meat industry and the chances of reform in that industry. Whatever measure we place on it, the cost of our slaughtering and processing is totally uncompetitive when compared with costs in other countries. What has occurred in the last two or three days is indeed unfortunate. We now see that the commitments made by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) to play the game while the Harrison inquiry was on are once again being totally ignored. We have seen the situation two days ago, I believe, when the AMIEU and the ACTU, with three days of the inquiry left, walked out from the Government's own umpire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the inquiry was set up principally at the request of the ACTU and the AMIEU-certainly with a degree of pressure from the ACTU. The inquiry was designed to address the long term structural problems in the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the efforts of Minister Cook and congratulate him on trying. He endeavoured, through a very strongly worded letter, to get those parties back into the inquiry. But what have they done? They have just turned up their noses at the Minister and virtually have told him to mind his own business. That is well documented in articles in the Australian today. It is worth looking also at an article in the Australian today, under `Analysis' by Shane Green. I would commend this for reading to all in this place. It is headed `Slaughter of an industry'. It appropriately describes what is happening in the meat industry in this country-an industry that was worth $3 billion of export income to Australia. </PARA>

You think it is fine for you to introduce it and I am not supposed to respond. It would seem to me that the Minister is treating this subject rather lightly when it is a very serious and important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Continuing with another undermining that has occurred: we see through the documents that I have here that the deception in Meatgate, through the Victorian Government, has continued. David White, Minister for Manufacturing and Industry Development, has joined that. He has misled the Victorian Parliament in terms of the input of his Department. We see changing stances between the position of the Minister for Labour in Victoria, Mr Pope, and the whole sorry mess of the Harrison meat inquiry continuing to get worse. </PARA>
<PARA> We have now seen that extend, once again, into the State of Western Australia, where people at Robbs Jetty, in support of their colleagues in Victoria, took action just last week over structural reforms which occurred over there some five months ago-an absolute nonsense. Of course, when there is some sign of a little bit of recovery in Western Australia-and I emphasise the words `little bit of recovery'-we see that being disrupted through nonsense action. </PARA>
<PARA> The real question is: What is the course that is now open? The AMIEU and the ACTU were the ones who requested this inquiry and fought for it. It is an inquiry that has cost, I would suggest, very many millions of dollars. Yet when I asked for the costs of the inquiry at Estimates last week, and what the costs were of the additional hearings because of the abuse to that inquiry, I was told they were not available; you could not get them; they were not recorded. That in itself is a matter of concern. The question we have to ask now is what are the options to overcome the impasse and the wastage occurring in our meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The only course that is now left open in terms of this latest walk-out, after those millions of dollars have been spent and with just three days to go, is to immediately proceed with the deregistration of the AMIEU and to open up the meat industry and give those people who wish to work the opportunity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> Look at the contempt that has been shown to Commissioner Harrison in this inquiry. His endeavours to get on top of this subject are genuine. He has been undermined firstly by the AMIEU, despite the commitments that were made, and secondly by the performance of the Victorian Government in terms of leaving out crucial statistical data. In response to a question that I asked here some time ago, I acknowledge that in the latest submission that was put by the Commonwealth, which I also have with me, that statistical data was put in there. Now we see that the ACTU, which also made a commitment to that particular inquiry that there would be no disruption during the time of the inquiry, is leading the walk-out. </PARA>
<PARA> The only option left is the deregistration of the AMIEU and, as I said, opening up the industry in Australia so that people who wish to work can work. That will enable those who have made a significant investment in the meat industry, in terms of abattoirs and infrastructure to get the product offshore, to get on with the job. The time has come for this Government to join with those employer organisations that are now seeking to have the AMIEU deregistered, as it did with the Builders Labourers Federation in the building industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise the situation of the Australian Capital Territory electricity supply from the Snowy Mountains scheme. It is a matter in which I know the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, has an interest, and I am glad that he is here for this discussion. The ACT has received electricity from the scheme from its beginning and has a very direct interest in a review, currently under way, of the finances and operation of the Snowy Mountains scheme being conducted by representatives of the Commonwealth Government and the New South Wales and Victorian governments. The review was initiated by the Prime Minister in 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier this year, I think in February, Senator McMullan, Mr Langmore and I visited the scheme and saw over it so that we had a greater comprehension of what it provides and its importance to this Territory. We get 30 per cent of our electricity from the Snowy Mountains scheme. New South Wales gets 6.3 per cent of its electricity from it and Victoria 3.8 per cent. Those figures indicate the extent to which the ACT has a very legitimate interest in the review which is being undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACT Government should be there too because the power which was provided to the Commonwealth is now provided to the ACT Government. The Chief Minister of the ACT has written to the New South Wales and Victorian governments and to the Prime Minister. He has sent copies of an ACT submission to the inquiry to the New South Wales and Victorian premiers. As I understand it, as of now, there has been no agreement that the ACT has a legitimate place in this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> What I find most remarkable is that the Prime Minister, having initiated this inquiry in 1989, did not insist at the time that the ACT should be a party to it. The Commonwealth ought to cancel the inquiry and withdraw from it until such time as New South Wales and Victoria agree that we do have a legitimate place at the table of this inquiry. I am at a loss to understand why we have been excluded. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences to the ACT could be an increase of up to 20 per cent in overall electricity costs and it is, of course, for that reason that the representatives elected by this community have expressed an interest in what is going on. The ACT had legally enforceable rights in relation to the Snowy Mountains scheme. The 1973 agreement provided for the Snowy to supply 670 gigawatt hours of electricity, currently at the rate of 3.5c a kilowatt. The New South Wales Electricity Commission charges 6.9c a kilowatt for power delivered to the ACT Electricity and Water Authority. As a result of this review, the ACT may have to relinquish its entitlement to the cheaper electricity and purchase from New South Wales at a greater cost. </PARA>
<PARA> How can anybody deny that the ACT has a legitimate interest in the review? I am inclined to wonder why the Prime Minister set it up and how it is that he was advised to do so without the ACT Government being present. There are a number of aspects to the way the Commonwealth has treated the ACT in financial matters since the ACT obtained self-government that are worthy of comment, but in the interests of the bipartisan way that this matter has been treated to date by Senator McMullan, Mr Langmore and myself, I shall not reiterate them today. I have dealt with them previously. </PARA>
<PARA> We three, having returned from a visit to the scheme, wrote to the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) on 4 March. I should say that Senator McMullan wrote the letter and Mr Langmore and I signed it. We told him that we had enjoyed the inspection of the scheme and had benefited from the understanding of it which we obtained. We said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are most concerned to learn that the Australian Capital Territory has been excluded from participation in the panel (the Commonwealth and the states of Victoria and New South Wales) reviewing the financial and institutional arrangements of the Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter went on to point out the amount of electricity we received from the scheme and how much greater the impact of a change would be on the ACT than on the other two States involved. We said to the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>Now that the ACT is a self-governing territory, we find it inconceivable that it is not represented, in its own right, at negotiations that have the potential to force ACT total electricity costs up by as much as 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>We pointed out to him the effect that this would have on our constituents and on the commercial and industrial development within the Territory. To my knowledge, the Minister has not provided us with a reply to that letter. That is surprising seeing that it is dated 4 March, and I am very disappointed that that is the case. I raise this matter in the bipartisan way that we have proceeded with it so far because our constituents and the commercial viability of Canberra depend on getting electricity and the sort of increase which may flow from this would be quite disastrous to our local economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chief Minister has not been able to get a response. I do not know that the Prime Minister has given any explanation as to why he initiated an inquiry which excluded us and I think the time has come for us to speak up and ask the Government to make a statement as to why the matter is being dealt with in the manner that it is and why it is that we are not getting answers to the correspondence which has been written about a very legitimate matter of concern to constituents and business in the ACT. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject I want to speak on in this matters of public interest discussion is a bit of a smelly one, I guess. It relates to the export, or potential export, of seaweed from Australia to South East Asian markets. One of my constituents, an entrepreneurial Western Australian, has to help overcome what has been in recent years a terrible fall in the reputation of that class of people from Western Australia. Of course, Western Australia has been renowned for producing innovative and entrepreneurial types. The tyranny of distance ensures that Western Australians, both in politics and in business, are innovators and entrepreneurs and often do things in that remote environment which produce great benefits for the whole of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important at this time in Australia's economy, when we are in this very deep recession and also when there has been so much focus on problems in Western Australia and on the businessmen of Western Australia, that we focus on some positives. There are people like Ralph Sarich who continues with thedevelopment of his engine and his fuel injection system, which in the long term will produce income for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The person I want to talk about today has a proposal before the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to export seaweed to established markets-markets he has firm orders from-in Japan and other South East Asian countries. The story I want to relate is, in a micro-sense, very comparable to the continuing debate over the mining of Coronation Hill. The gentleman I refer to, my constituent Mr John Horobin, has been seeking for a number of years to work his way through the mire of red tape and government bureaucracy with his proposal to harvest seaweed from the Swan River particularly, and the Peel and Harvey estuaries, broadly speaking, have it dried and then exported to South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> One could imagine that a proposal such as that would be fraught with all sorts of dangers, when we think of the myriad environmental concerns such a proposal would cause. Basically, the proposal simply seeks to extract seaweed, particularly from the Swan River, which has already broken away from the ground and more often than not floats up onto the beaches of the Swan River. I guess SenatorMcMullan would be familiar with these beaches from his younger days. The seaweed would then be dried on racks in a fairly prehistoric way, put into plastic bags and sold to the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia had an export market in seaweed in years past-there are documented figures on the tonnages and so forth-but export has waned over the years. There is a very clear demand for it and for the product known as gracilaria, which is used to make a product called algar which can be used in a number of downstream processes, such as pharmaceutical uses and food uses. It can also be used in the plastic industries. It is a product which has relevance to the manufacture of microchips and other high-tech substances. It makes the mind boggle to think of sea weed coming out of the Swan River and ending up in a microchip in a complicated computer, but so be it. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem that Mr Horobin and his company have is that they had to fight over the years to get the relevant approvals from State and local authorities, but that has now been achieved after their battle. He has an approval from the Waterways Commission in Western Australia which basically allows him, almost on a pilot basis, to take the broken away seaweed from the shallows by hand. This is a fairly low-tech way of harvesting the seaweed. In the long term, Mr Horobin would envisage having some sort of mechanical harvesting. He recognises the potential environmental impacts and wants to start off on a small scale and then allow the various authorities-local, State and Federal-to monitor the effects on the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal is now before the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Mr Horobin is seeking an export licence under the relevant Act, the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. It was referred to that Service many months ago. He has had correspondence with the Service and has sought further information. That information has been supplied; indeed, the latest submission that Mr Horobin has made to the Service has been sitting in the intray of that bureaucracy for a number of months without even a recognition or any sort of response whatsoever. Mr Horobin has made repeated calls to the Service, seeking to have some sort of answer. Like so many struggling small business people, he has become frustrated with the red tape he has to go through to get what would seem to be a very positive industry which will employ many young Western Australians and produce export income for Australia-from a product which is at the moment taken out of the Swan River as a form of pollution, at great cost to the relevant authorities, and dumped in tip sites around Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we have a product here which is a form of pollution, which is extracted at great expense, which Mr Horobin, through his process and through employing young Western Australians, can extract, process and export and thus earn export income. He already has letters of intent, in fact firm contracts, with some companies in South East Asia to export it. The problem that he is now faced with is in dealing with the Federal bureaucracy, which is thousands of kilometres away from where he is trying to get this activity off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> The bureaucracy's recognition of the urgency of the matter is obviously a low priority. A bureaucrat sitting in Canberra does not have to feed that man's wife and family. A bureaucrat sitting in Canberra does not really have to worry about whether he deals with the submission from Mr Horobin today, tomorrow, next month, or next year. But to young Western Australians, of whom nearly one in three, and one in four in some areas, are out of work, it does matter. I think a new sunrise industry such as seaweed export would be a very positive occurrence for those young people. It would give them some hope for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I wish to make is that clearly, as is the case with Coronation Hill and so many other resource projects, we have here a micro-example of the problems that always face Australian business people who want to exploit Australia's natural resources. We have an approval process which discourages people from even getting to first base. This gentleman has been waiting for years to get this industry off the ground. After finally getting approval in principle from the relevant authorities in Western Australia, he is now faced with telephoning the National Parks and Wildlife Service in Canberra to try to move his application up the in-tray of the particular bureaucrat who is handling it. I certainly hope that the department responsible will consider this proposal expeditiously. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently there has been some focus on the problems of the Swan River. It has a nutrient problem which the State Minister, Ernie Bridge, believes comes from all the septic tanks around Perth but clearly it also comes from the non-point of source pollution from fertilisers in the Avon Valley. Part of the effect of that nutrient problem is, of course, that seaweed and kelp in the Swan River are growing at rates much higher than would normally occur without those nutrients. Mr Horobin's proposal has the side benefit of enabling us to remove some of that seaweed and, I guess, allowing new seaweed to propagate and soak up some of thosenutrients in the Swan River. I think the proposal has merit. </PARA>
<PARA> The question I ask in this matter of public interest is this: how far does someone like Mr Horobin have to go to get what seems to be a very sensible, small business idea off the ground? Most Australians would have given up months or years ago and would not have been so tenacious in moving their proposals forward. I commend his proposal to the Senate. I encourage the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to expedite the consideration and approval of Mr Horobin's proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. How much worse does he expect unemployment to get in Australia following today's appalling unemployment figures which reveal a 322,100 or 60 per cent increase in the number of Australians out of work-the biggest ever 12 months increase in unemployment-lifting the adult unemployment rate to 10.2 per cent and the youth unemployment rate to the worst ever April level of 25.8 per cent, worse than one in four? Does the Minister now accept that the Government has made serious mistakes in its economic policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two parts to that question, apart from the rhetorical recitation of figures. The first asks me to make a forecast about unemployment, and I have continually declined to do that. The unemployment figures in terms of the recession are always lagged figures, and Ministers, including myself, have said for some time that we anticipate unemployment figures remaining and continuing high even though some other signs of the recession bottoming out might become apparent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other part of the question relates to whether the Government admits, or I admit, that it has made serious economic mistakes. I think the question was couched in those terms. I have said on previous occasions that the Government recognises and very much regrets the disadvantages that have been caused to so many people as a result of high levels of unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to answer a serious question, not indulge in point scoring. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer on several occasions have made statements about the misjudgment in the fundamental indicators of the Australian economy in terms of the recession. On the advice that was given at the time to the Government, which was being tendered by a great variety of people, the Government's actions were correct and not dissented from by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> There are a number of factors which are contributing, apart from any blame which may attach to the Government in terms of the domestic recession, to labour market conditions. Not only is there the question of the health of the Australian economy, to which I have referred, but also there is a major slowdown in the growth of other world economies. There are also very depressed market conditions affecting many rural industries. A combination of factors is contributing to the present situation. In answer to the second part of the honourable senator's question, that is all I am prepared to say. In answer to the first part of the question, I will not indulge in forecasting.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has his attention been drawn to a statement by the Australian Democrats spokesperson on industrial relations concerning the right to strike in Australia? Does this statement propose that the Government legislate for the right to strike and suggest that, if the Government does not appear serious about it, the Democrats will do the job instead? Can the Minister advise honourable senators what the Government's reaction is to this Democrat proposal?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3038" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received a copy of a media release under the title of Senator Paul McLean, the Australian Democrats spokesperson on industrial relations, dated yesterday and headed, `Democrats challenge Government to legislate ``right to strike'' now'. According to this press release, the Democrats are proposing that, if the Government does not move on this fundamental issue, they will introduce legislation in the autumn session of Parliament and that that legislation will deal with issues such as sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am asked by Senator Sherry what my attitude to this statement is. I am pleased to see that the Democrats have given, as I understand it, quite a deal of detailed consideration and analysis to this issue. As I have said, it is a fundamental issue in industrial relations in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> As for what the Government will do, I have in recent days often stated the position of the Government. The Government's position is that we resumed our review of the Industrial Relations Act in January this year. Last year in the Senate we enacted some amendments to the Industrial Relations Act on union amalgamations. In January this year we resumed our review of the balance of the Act. That review was being conducted by the industrial legislation subcommittee of the National Labour Consultative Council (NLCC). I remind honourable senators that the NLCC is a tripartite body of employers, unions and the Government. That subcommittee is examining all of the other proposed amendments to the Industrial Relations Act. Some of those amendments go to the issue that the Democrats press release has referred to and to other issues, such as legal framework.</PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the entry into this debate of the Australian Democrats and the way in which they have done so. The Government is committed to tripartite decision-making, and we will see through the discussion in the NLCC without making any pre-emptive undertakings. We would like the social partners-the employers and the unions-to examine and come to a consensus, if at all possible, on this matter. We will see that process through, and when it has culminated I will be in a position to say what the Government is likely to do.</PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year the United Nations industrial relations agency, the International Labour Organisation (ILO), under the freedom of association laws, had the matter of the air pilots dispute in Australia in 1989 referred to it. While its finding exonerated the Government from any breach of freedom of association legislation-and that was endorsed by the United Nations body-it did say that there was a significant question of the state of labour law in Australia regarding the right to strike. It referred that question to its standing committee of experts for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> When that report has been finally approved by the ILO, we will have an expression from that United Nations agency on its views of the state of labour law in Australia. Along with the Democrats intervention in this matter, that will be a significant contribution to forming what I hope will be a generally consensual view in the community about what we should do on these matters.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Is it the case that he has asked his Department to examine the need for a new code of conduct for ambassadors? Just because one of the Government's political appointments has behaved in an improper way, why is it necessary to tarnish all former and current professional officers with his misbehaviour and the Minister's failure to remove him from office?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3039" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No-one is tarnished by a code of conduct relating to his behaviour any more than public servants in the whole Public Service system are tarnished by the existence of Public Service guidelines and their liability to observe the standards of behaviour that are applicable under the Bowen Committee's code of conduct. The point simply was that it became apparent, as we were looking at some of these things for the first time in the context of a certain matter, that these other provisions-the Bowen Committee code of conduct with its pecuniary interest declaration and so on, and the Public Service guidelines applicable to such things as political activity-were not formally applicable to ambassadors, simply because of the nature of ambassadorial appointments, terms and conditions, arrangements that govern those appointments and their distancing from the rest of the Public Service system. In the first instance, it was simply a matter of formalising and making appropriate adjustments for all those other provisions as they relate to ambassadors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, since the question of political appointments will no doubt continue to arise from time to time because that has been quite common throughout the whole history of diplomacy in this country on both sides of the Parliament, it did seem appropriate to pay some attention to particular issues that might arise in the context of political appointments in the future; just to ensure that the ground rules were perfectly clear perhaps to a greater extent than was the case on this occasion. There is no hint or suggestion in any of this that anyone is particularly in need of closer instruction in this respect. It is just a natural thing to attend to in the aftermath of issues coming to light in the way they have.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce seen recent newspaper reports of comments made by the Director of the South Australian Department of Industry, Trade and Technology, Dr Peter Crawford? Dr Crawford is saying that manufacturing companies must band together to compete in international markets. In light of the importance of improving Australia's competitive position internationally, can the Minister inform the Senate of initiatives taken by the Government to promote networking by companies?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3039" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see Dr Crawford's comments, which are not a revelation to me. In an economy of this size the more that companies cooperate in seeking international markets the better. But in terms of Senator Schacht's question as to how the Government views this, I point out that Dr Crawford was in fact speaking in a seminar organised by the Australian Manufacturing Council; a seminar which is also supported by my Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This was one of a number of seminars held around the country in the past two weeks on networking or the process of building relationships between firms to improve competitive capabilities in both the domestic and export markets. The reason is that in world terms many Australian companies are too small to compete. Companies which get together and network will often be better able to take advantage of the opportunities in the international marketplace. Enterprises which form strategic networks and joint ventures with other complementary companies can collectively break into key markets. To assist this the National Industry Extension Service (NIES) has been piloting a range of enterprise network approaches. These pilot projects are identifying successful models and looking at what makes them work.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Manufacturing Council, supported by NIES, organised seminars on networking in Adelaide, Sydney, Queensland, Melbourne and Perth in response to growing interest from manufacturers and State governments. There will be another seminar in Hobart next month. More than 120 people were involved in the Melbourne seminar and about 80 people were at some of the others. The President of the United States Garment Industry Development Corporation came to Australia to speak at the seminars and a number of highly qualified people participated in them. I think that these seminars have proved such a success that they will probably be an ongoing activity. It is a pity that it is necessary for governments to sponsor them, but we will continue to do so.</PARA>

In the Minister's statement to the House on 12 March this year reference was made to the need for Australia to lift its exports of high value added goods and services and to participate in the fastest growing sectors of world trade.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall that I did say something like that on 12 March; it seems a long time ago. This country is well placed to take advantage of growth in this market segment. In 1989-90, we exported $260m worth of software and another $260m in information technology (IT) services, which is helping to turn around the balance of trade in the information technology figures. I believe that we will see much improvement in this export trade in the next few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> High quality innovative Australian companies, such as Computer Power Pty Ltd, Aspect Computing Pty Ltd, the Co-Cam Computer Group, Ferntree Computer Corporation Ltd, Moldflow Pty Ltd and the Paxus Corporation, are all out in the international marketplace marketing skills in this area. I do not want to mention particular companies at length, but, for example, Computer Power is now a world leading software products and services company with a turnover of over $250m a year and has more than 100 offices around the world.</PARA>
<PARA> IBM Australia Ltd has been a considerable contributor to this export activity. Its programming centre last year exported some $57m worth of software. In that centre it employs 155 IBM staff and engages 320 contractors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Reynolds for her question, which obviously comes from her association with the provision of services to the rural and provincial areas of Australia, particularly in north Queensland. It is a fact that the Prime Minister, in his statement on 8 March last year, announced an increase of around $15m over three years to assist marriages and promote family stability. I believe that the provision of family counselling, marriage education and mediation services to those underserviced areas of rural and provincial Australia will be a fulfilment of that undertaking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular, we are trying to ensure that disadvantaged families in those non-metropolitan areas of Australia do obtain access to these services in a way which those in the suburban and metropolitan areas take for granted. We will certainly ensure that that occurs. In particular, I have asked for submissions from the peak organisations of the family counselling and other like organisations Australia-wide with regard to the provision of these services. I believe that the encouragement and fostering of good relationships between the Department and these peak organisations has been very fruitful in bringing forward submissions which I am sure will help to fulfil our objectives. Indeed, the relationships between the peak organisations themselves-which have been fostered in the past year or so-will, I am sure, lead to the provision of services in those rural and provincial areas of Australia which will well serve the people in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to marriage counselling, that is well understood. But the major effort at the moment is to provide mediation services for separating couples because, quite clearly, if a traumatic dispute over custody of children or property can be resolved without a court-imposed solution-where the people in dispute are brought together by a neutral mediator in a way which allows them to devise their own solution to the property or custody disputes-then that is likely to be a more enduring solution. It will certainly reduce the trauma associated with the break-up of a marriage. Of course, it will also reduce the legal costs, which can be very burdensome for those people involved in this process.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reynolds will be pleased to know that, not only in north Queensland but also in other areas of Australia which are outside the major metropolitan areas, these services will be provided in a way which I believe fulfils the undertaking of the Prime Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I ask whether the Government intends to stand by its intention to pay $28,000 to Mr Burke as a so-called termination payment. If so, in light of the Minister's argument of yesterday that the payment was lawful by reason of, firstly, the authority conferred upon the Minister by the Governor-General to determine the terms and conditions of Mr Burke's employment and, secondly, clause N of Mr Burke's written contract of employment dated 20 July 1988, and noting in passing that the preamble to Mr Burke's contract of employment states that the terms and conditions contained therein are made pursuant to an approval by the Governor-General of Mr Burke's appointment-such approval being dated 9 March 1988-will the Minister now advise the Senate whether the authority conferred upon him by the Governor-General is an authority to determine the terms and conditions of Mr Burke's employment at the time of his appointment, or does the authority confer a power to vary, alter or add to those terms at any subsequent time? Is the authority contained within a written instrument? If so, can the Minister table the written instrument? Having regard to clause N of the contract, what specific provision of the Public Service rules, or what reserved power of the Department of Industrial Relations, is relied upon to support the payment? Finally, will the Minister table the advice from the Attorney-General's Department to which he referred in his answer yesterday?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that I have all of those things written down. It is certainly my understanding that the authority of the Governor-General of 9 March 1988 to Mr Hayden, whose successor I am as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, is such as to confer a right upon me-the Foreign Minister-not only to determine terms and conditions at the outset of a period of office, but also to vary or add to those conditions as appropriate at any time while Mr Burke continues to hold the position in question. I think that is a fair reading of the language of the instrument, which I will table if it has not been already-I do not think it has been tabled in the Parliament-and it is also a straightforward application of first principles that govern these things, which I am sure a court would have no difficulty in construing that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked for the advice from the Attorney-General's Department. That is in the form of a short question briefing note to the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, and I table that as requested.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the basis in the terms and conditions document itself-it is not a contract; it is a determination of terms and conditions that govern these things-I do not rely on anything in paragraph N that is vested in the rules applicable in respect of officers of the Public Service which are subject to administration by the Department of Industrial Relations. I rely, rather, on the general residual power that exists in that particular clause to make determinations leaving aside the context of matters which are within the scope of the normal Public Service guidelines-in which case I am exercising the authority that would normally be exercised by the Minister for Industrial Relations. Those situations apart, there is a residual capacity to otherwise determine matters. So that is the particular phrase I am relying upon there. That is, in effect, as was set out in the advice from my Department and that is, again, perfectly straightforward.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the termination payment-its status now in the context of the resignation being brought forward-that termination payment will continue to be made and it will be varied slightly in accordance with exactly the same formula being applicable. It will now be equivalent to 18 weeks and five days salary; that is to say, on the same pro rata basis as was originally determined on 31 July, but going through to the period ending 5 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA> I point out that the extra four weeks salary Mr Burke would get under this is just one-third of the payment he would have received had he stayed in office until 31 July. I point that out in case Opposition senators are unable to follow the arithmetic of these things-I thought I would do it for them. And it is exactly what Mr Burke would have got if he had been dismissed today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like everybody else, the Australian Government is becoming increasingly concerned about the deteriorating situation in Yugoslavia. The incidents of violence, which before this month were of a sporadic and isolated nature, are now becoming more frequent and widespread. A very serious incident occurred in the Croatian town of Borovo Selo where at least 15 people, including 12 Croatian policemen, were killed in a gun battle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Yugoslav National Army, as most honourable senators would have seen from the press, is now moving to take up positions in the areas of greatest tension. But it is not clear that this is going to have a calming effect. Indeed, some fear that the Army's presence may provoke further violence. Yugoslavia is, of course, a federation comprising six republics, some of which are calling for the establishment of a looser confederal structure and are threatening to secede if no new arrangement can be negotiated. Members of the Federal Presidency are continuing to meet in emergency sessions to try to resolve Yugoslavia's problems, so far without conspicuous success.</PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Australian Government, while recognising that it is, of course, up to the Yugoslav people to decide their own future political organisation, I nonetheless call upon them in the strongest possible terms for the solution to Yugoslavia's problems to be achieved through peaceful and democratic means. We say this not only as a fellow member of the international community but also as the adopted home of hundreds of thousands of Australians of Yugoslav origin who are watching developments in Yugoslavia with mounting anxiety.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the recent deterioration in the situation in Yugoslavia, I should say that my Department is now advising people to defer non-essential travel to Yugoslavia. This travel advisory will be kept under daily review.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Parer is flogging a dead horse here. The reality is-I will give Senator Parer a full and comprehensive answer if he will wait-that I was motivated in this matter, unlike Senator Parer's colleagues in Queensland, to ensure that we got three objectives: one, a fair tendering process; two, value for money for the taxpayer; and, three, that Australian suppliers not be disadvantaged. They have been the three motivations, which at the end of this process have been vindicated. They have been my guiding motivations at all times, and at the end of the day we have been vindicated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Parer has put to me part of an interview with Paul Lyneham. He quotes from the review team's report, claiming that the Australian public have been mislead. He knows full well-it was explained to him quite well, but I have been noting his actions consistently; I can see why he is no longer in the private sector and is now sitting there with his colleagues-that the reality is that that review team was reporting to my departmental officers. Those departmental officers met with me. I will quote to Senator Parer in full their advice to me. When I talk about departmental officers, I mean the Secretary to the Department, the Executive General Manager, Government and Corporate Services Program and the Executive General Manager, Supply Services. They said:</PARA>
<PARA>Maintaining the status quo is not appropriate. Our review has pointed to some major deficiencies in the process. Whilst there is no suggestion of bias in the process, by not deciding and notifying in advance the criterion to be used and the relative weights that might be applied in the evaluation, potential bidders did not know clearly and consistently how the evaluation process was to be conducted. This could have affected their price offering. Furthermore, the application of the basket approach which was applied in this case does not give best `value for money' in every case.</PARA>
<PARA>They then went through a number of options. I repeat: they said, `Maintaining the status quo is not appropriate'.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer makes some point about the Paul Lyneham report. I answered a question the other day from Senator Parer, a question to which I was keen to give a full and adequate answer. Senator Parer may not remember that answer. It was two days ago, so I will make a concession for him. But, in the context of that answer, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . importantly, the review team reported to the Secretary that, although these problems had occurred, it did not believe that the value of correcting the deficiencies warranted cancelling the contract.</PARA>
<PARA>I made that very clear at the start two days ago when Senator Parer asked his first question on this matter. He should not accuse me of misleading the public; he is the one who is doing that. I also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Secretary and other senior officers considered this advice and, on their own assessment, advised me that leaving the matter as it was, taking the `do nothing' option, was inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>If Senator Parer wants to come in here and ask a question or make some points, he should get his facts right. He should not accuse me of misleading the public when he is the one who has this inherent incapacity to get it straight.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that the best way to respond to Senator Parer is not to say anything further, but let me make a couple of points with respect to the supplementary question. First of all, it was Senator Parer and Senator Hill who came in here yesterday and accused me of giving the interim report of the review team to Mr Lyneham. Had that been right, then I presume that Mr Lyneham would not have made such a mistake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those senators have come in here today and taken completely the opposite point of view. They have said that I completely misled him by maybe not giving him the report. Firstly, they should get it right. Secondly, the relevant section of Paul Lyneham's interview states:</PARA>
<PARA>And now you've had--or they've had an independent internal inquiry that says basically you were right and they were wrong. How independent was this? I mean, any ministerial fingerprints on it anywhere?</PARA>
<PARA>I then say:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, let me say the matter was brought to the attention of the Secretary, and Deputy Secretaries involved. They went through it with me very exhaustively and I think they felt very strongly that, in fact I'm sure they felt very strongly, independently of any view that I might have had, that the process really had to be looked at. That led to the review team, was set up by the departmental Secretary and I think it's fair to say that . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In response to Mr Lyneham I said that it was a departmental secretary and senior officers who discussed it with me. They are the ones who put a view to me.

Secondly, in view of today's horrific unemployment figures, will the Government take immediate steps to reduce the waiting and deferment periods, to ensure that those people who are the innocent victims of the Government's engineered recession will receive their payments as soon as they need help and do not have to resort to reliance on welfare agencies?

These hardship provisions are not used sparingly by the Department. When people demonstrate genuine need, the Department acts quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the honourable member's question about how people survive during the waiting periods, I point out that the waiting periods, such as those established for people with cash in the bank, for instance, are there because the Government believes that if people have sufficient resources they can for a limited period look after themselves. At the moment I am looking at the question of waiting periods in general for the preparation of a Budget submission. Over the next few months the Government will, no doubt, have some discussions about them.</PARA>
<PARA> I caution Senator Lees and, indeed, the Brotherhood of St Laurence on that point. It is the operation of hardship provisions that eases hardship for many people who are having problems with waiting periods.

Since unemployment began to climb last year there has been some variation in the relative rates of unemployment among young people and adults, and the increase in youth unemployment has been more dramatic than the increase in unemployment for adults. Just the same as when unemployment was going down very rapidly, the lagged effects of youth unemployment followed adult employment downwards. I do not know of any particular programs that have been directed to the question of youth unemployment, apart from the normal programs administered by the Commonwealth Employment Service, but I will make some inquiries about that and give Senator Harradine an answer when I can.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3049" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of an anonymous note addressed to the Western Australian royal commissioners which alleges that $153,000 was sent to Ambassador Burke from the office of the Secretary to my Department. I note that the officers named in the allegations about money laundering, namely, Mr Woolcott, the Secretary to my Department, and Mr Forrester, the head of the Corporate Management Division, categorically deny the claims made in the note.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Department has conducted an investigation of a diplomatic bag sent to Dublin and carried by Mr Shane Carroll in the period just before the alleged report to Mr Forrester of September 1989. My Department found that Mr Carroll did indeed transit New York in August 1989 with a consignment of diplomatic bags, including one for the Australian Embassy in Dublin. The bag for Dublin weighed six kilos and contained the following items: a box containing three Chubb locks with packing which together weighed 3.2 to 3.5 kilos; two batches of classified cables-the exact weight of those two batches is not available but the weight of such batches ranges up to two kilos each; and a letter to Ambassador Burke from the acting head of a branch in the Americas and Europe division of my Department. That letter, which has been identified as classified, contains nine sheets of paper. The Department's records, which are in very good order, are able to account for the contents of the bag in question and manifestly give no credence whatsoever to the allegation.</PARA>
<PARA> If one goes beyond the details of the rather bizarre claims made in this anonymous note, there are important points of principle and procedure involved here. There is a well-established mechanism in my Department for handling allegations of fraud or misconduct; mechanisms which do protect the position of those who are genuinely concerned about unmasking such activity. The procedures include referral of concerns in confidence to the Department's fraud prevention and discipline section and, in cases where officers feel their concerns are not being properly dealt with by the Department, the procedures also provide for referral in confidence to the relevant outside authority.</PARA>
<PARA> Neither I, nor my Department, will support officers who bypass those procedures and make spurious allegations in the public arena or personal attacks on colleagues. To do so anonymously, as in this latest incident, only compounds the transgression. But to further place these latest allegations in their proper context, I should point out that they are based on claims made by an officer of my Department, Mr Shane Carroll, whose name features prominently in the document in question. It should be said that Mr Carroll had been charged, quite a time before this, with eight charges of improper conduct. These charges included attempts by Mr Carroll to gain personal advantage through threats that, if he did not get the preferment he sought, he would continue to make allegations about corruption and maladministration in my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> An inquiry officer from outside my Department was appointed to investigate those charges. She completed her inquiry on 16 April 1991 and directed dismissal of Mr Carroll in respect of each such charge. The inquiry officer's report referred to `a web of misconduct on the part of this gentleman'. In fairness, I should add that he has lodged an appeal with the Merit Protection and Review Agency against the inquiry officer's direction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is something awfully self-evident about the continuing human tragedy and misery of the appallingly high level of unemployment brought about by the recession that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said we had to have. The dreadful thing about it was perhaps outlined best by the response to Senator Harradine's question a few minutes ago, when the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) acknowledged the fact that last year it had become evident that there were increases of a substantial nature in youth unemployment and that, nonetheless, the Government had, in effect, done nothing-I underline that-to correct what was happening. It had not changed its basic policy stance. On the contrary, in terms of labour relations it seems to have adopted much more of the tactic of doing exactly what the Australian Council of Trade Unions wants, which bears a greater relationship to the role of people in jobs than the needs of people who are out of jobs and therefore apparently no longer contributing members of the unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the extent of the disaster is something that the people of Australia have been slow to comprehend, largely because of the volume of deliberately misleading propaganda coming from the Government benches. The full horror of the unemployment figures is now beginning to sink in. The figures themselves can no longer be discounted, discarded, or ignored by this Government. The figures are too horrendous to be ignored and dismissed. We do not know-we have no idea-what level of unemployment the Government now expects will occur under these policies which have so disastrously failed Australia. Some time ago the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that it would not exceed 10 per cent. Senator Button today, when asked, would not venture a view. He certainly did not defend Mr Hawke's forecast, but replaced it with nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen next is a question that can be fairly asked in view of the fact that what is happening now was denied by the Government. It said that it would not happen. It was like the recession that we were not going to have, which magically turned into the recession we had to have. That is what is happening in unemployment. These are the unemployment figures, to extend Mr Keating's expression, that Mr Keating says we had to have, because that is what this recession means. These unemployment figures can be pinned directly to the Government's failed economic policies, to its failure to respond, as was established by the response to Senator Harradine's question, to the problems when they first emerged. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), who I note is to follow me in this debate, that last year when I raised this matter with him, particularly youth unemployment, he indicated that his advice was that youth unemployment appeared to have bottomed and was trending the other way, I think was the expression. That has turned out not to be true. One wonders whether it reflects on the merit of the advice or the determination of the Government to pretend that things that are nasty do not exist. I do not mind if the Government and the Ministers want to fool themselves, but what bothers me is when they see what is happening and refuse to take action to fix it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that we are in an economic recession, the depth of which is unnecessarily severe because of the Government's failure to take the sort of fiscal measures that we have been advocating for years and because of its enormous reliance on monetary policy which the Reserve Bank of Australia was telling it for years was the wrong thing to do. The blame must be laid exactly where it belongs. </PARA>
<PARA> We even had high commodity prices and a longstanding world boom at a time when Australia was frankly doing badly economically and going further and further into debt. The Government tried to buy its way out of the high unemployment figures of 1983 and 1984-I stress that the 1984 figures for unemployment, well after the Fraser Government had gone, were appallingly high; they were higher than under the Fraser Government-by encouraging huge foreign debt through its economic policies. Our foreign debt is now five times what it was when this Government came to power. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot keep living on borrowed money. The time of reckoning eventually comes, and it looks like the time is now. The people who are carrying the burden of that time are not the members of this Government-they will carry it at the next election-but the people of Australia who have lost their jobs. That is why I want to dramatise just how severe this problem is by looking at the number of people who actually have lost their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's horrific unemployment figures, before seasonal adjustment, reveal that in April 856,000 Australians were looking for work. At the same time last year, 534,200 Australians were looking for work. In other words, in the latest 12 months, 322,000 additional Australians were looking for jobs that they did not have. To the best of my knowledge, having looked through the figures, that is the highest ever increase in one year. It is a 60.3 per cent increase on the previous year. To my knowledge, these are unprecedented figures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will go to the Victorian situation shortly. We have this huge increase in total unemployment and an enormous increase in youth unemployment. In fact, the unadjusted 25.8 per cent youth unemployment rate for April is the highest April unemployment rate for young people on record-at least on the figures that I can find.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am stating all these figures-and I know that it might sound boring-because people have not recognised or understood how horrific and awful they are. For example, there has been a 57 per cent increase in the number of 15- to 19-year-olds who cannot find their first job and who are still looking. This time last year only 29,500 were looking for their first job, but now there are 46,400. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures go on in an awful and an horrific way. This latest month has seen, I understand, the biggest monthly rise in unemployment, seasonally adjusted, on record. The total unemployment figure for one month, seasonally adjusted, is 66,900 people. Of course, the 27 per cent unemployment rate among people aged 15 to 19 years, seasonally adjusted, is the highest ever April figure for young unemployed people. As one goes through this dismal booklet put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, one sees horror mounted upon horror. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn to the youth unemployment situation in Australia because there we see, for example, that, seasonally adjusted, the number of unemployed young people-that is, people aged between 15 and 19 years-has risen in the last 12 months by 29,600. In just the last 12 months, that is a 35 per cent rise in the number of young people who are out of work. The worsening in the number of unemployed persons, and this includes adults, of 322,100 which I mentioned earlier is-and this has now been confirmed by statistics I have received from the Parliamentary Library-the biggest rise in unemployment ever recorded for a 12-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the plight of young people aged 15 to 19 years, in the last 12 months the number of young Australians in jobs has fallen by 11,600. That is the biggest ever fall in the number of young Australians in jobs since these statistics began to be collected. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely, I could not agree more. It is interesting to note that there are now 196,000 fewer young people at work in Australia than there were in the same month under the Fraser Government. To an extent, that is because there are much greater secondary school retention levels and I think that should be acknowledged. Even though there is no doubt that the extension of Austudy to secondary students is of great benefit to some of them who will now have the opportunity of being paid to get qualifications that will improve their productivity and their chances of getting jobs, for many young Australians this is no more than a teenager-sitting exercise which gets them out of the dole queues and the unemployment figures so that this Government can dress up the figures to try to make them not look as bad as they really are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are extraordinary gimmicks-for example, the statistical trick of now no longer recording as being unemployed someone who works for one hour per week for no pay. Those people are no longer listed as being unemployed; they are now included as being employed part time. So if someone who is unemployed takes on a work experience job for no pay that person disappears from this Government's unemployment statistics. Of course, if people work on the family farm-and this might explain why the rural figures are not as bad as I thought they would be-for one hour per week for nothing they are no longer listed as being unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite those gimmicks and stunts under this Government, we still have these worst ever youth unemployment figures. I sincerely hope that things will catch up with this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The total number of young people who are unemployed, full time and part time, is also the worst April figure ever, at 178,700. It just seems to go on and on. I have already pointed out that the unemployment rate for April, at 25.8 per cent unadjusted, is the worst April figure ever. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This shows, for example, that the unemployment rate in April 1991 in New South Wales was the lowest of all the States at 8.6 per cent. In Victoria it was 10.5 per cent; Tasmania, 10.8 per cent; Queensland, 10.7 per cent; South Australia, 10.3 per cent; and Western Australia-where the politicians on the Labor side are generally regarded as `Burkes'-11.1 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We can see what has been happening in these Labor States. In Victoria the rise in unemployment in the last 12 months has been over 100 per cent-117.7 per cent; in South Australia, 52 per cent; in Queensland, 44 per cent; in Western Australia, 57 per cent; and in Tasmania it went up by only 29 per cent this year because it had gone up by so much the previous year. Here is a clear indication of the sorts of disasters and the difference in the levels of disasters in the Australian States. As I said, where one has the double whammy of State and Federal Labor governments there is the double disaster of huge unemployment rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I will leave it to some of my other colleagues to outline the specific problems in their States. I want to concentrate now on what the Government has to do and what it refuses to do. It is surely clear that, with the great bulk of job losses in Australia coming from young people, the Government has to recognise more than it did in answer to Senator Harradine's statement that it is not just a question of youth employment going up faster when things are good and going down faster when things are bad. Are we going to have youth in the firing line of economic change all the time? Are the young people under this Government going to be the cannon fodder of economic mismanagement? That is what has happened so far-youth are in the front line. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest figures show that adult unemployment is catching them up nonetheless. Adult unemployment in most States is still only about one-third of the youth unemployment rate. It is clear that if the market is telling the Government, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Industrial Relations Commission and others-the people who appear to be running the show-that young people are the most likely to get the chop in a recession, that employers cannot afford to employ them, there is no point in thinking we are solving the problem for all time by shuffling them out of the statistics, by finding holes where we can shove them. There is no doubt that a whole new approach has to be adopted to youth unemployment in particular. For example, a training wage is obviously the way to try to resolve this gross imbalance. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, this nation needs a massive redirection of its economic policies. The present ones have failed. Senator Button skirted around this today at Question Time, but by his whole approach there was a clear concession that Senator Button's and the Government's policies have caused this disaster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That human tragedy and misery exist in times of high levels of unemployment cannot be denied by anyone in the chamber, least of all by anyone speaking for the Government. Only a fool would deny that today's unemployment figures mean more tragedy for more people. I certainly would not deny that. Although I think the question for all Australians to face, irrespective of their political allegiances, is why we are where we are and how we might best get out of, not just this recession, but a period where for decades we have gone up and down in economic cycles. We must try to make sure that we have an economic base for our future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that there is not much point in Senator Baume saying, as he has done for quite some time now, that his recession is better than our recession. I do not think that either one was too hot but I would not claim, even for a second, that Australia's fundamental economic problems lie with decisions taken by the Fraser Government. Sure, when we got into office, times were pretty tough in Australia, not just with the recession, but also with that huge deficit with which we had been left. But they are not the reasons why Australia today faces serious structural problems. Those reasons go back much further. </PARA>
<PARA> They go back to the period after the Second World War, through the 1950s and the 1960s, when successive governments in Australia-and, I might say, quite often with the complicity of oppositions-were able to believe that the good times would last forever: that if you could grow it, dig it up or chop it down, it would be good enough; that the sheep's back, the quarry and the forest would get Australia through its future; and for decades it worked. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem was that other countries did not waste those decades in the 1950s and the 1960s. Japan, all the countries of Europe including Germany, and the United States, actually used that period to plan, to get ready for a future. They did not think a good future would just fall into their laps. They knew that they had to earn it. Unfortunately, that is a lesson that the generations that ran Australia in the late 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s never understood. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, when we have hit the 1980s and the 1990s, the problem is that those commodities face uncertain times. Senator Baume raised debt as a problem. Looking at the figures, even from the other day, one finds that it is extraordinary that even in recession Australia manages to spend at the moment a billion dollars more each month than the value of its production. That is a worry for all of us. It ought to be a special worry for our kids. They may well be left with a problem unless Australia can face it now. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing about the figures is that export volumes are up, but once again Australia, just as it did six years ago, has faced another downturn in its terms of trade. Because we relied on commodities entirely, because the basis of the economy, as a result of decisions taken 30 and 40 years ago, is almost all in that primary sector, almost all in commodities, we do not have any other weapons. So, when the world turns off the high price commodity tap, there is no water in the well for us. Australia needs different patterns of investment and a real manufacturing base to complement the natural advantages that we have with our ores and our primary produce. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the real reasons why Australia has a problem. We can score points forever against each other about who has the best recession. The truth is that Australia will be vulnerable to those recessions until those investment patterns change and until we, as a nation, understand that you cannot spend a billion dollars more each month than the value of the goods which we produce. Those are lessons that I hope all Australians can learn. Over the course of the next few years when making decisions at elections-elections which Senator Michael Baume wants to lead us to-Australians will not simply believe the snake oil salesman who tells them that all can be cured tomorrow afternoon. No-one can do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming to the crux of today's debate, it disappoints me to hear Senator Baume disparaging the very successful efforts that the Government has made with Austudy and with student payments in the past few years. It is not a matter of hiding unemployment figures. It has to be remembered that when we came to office retention rates for secondary schooling were under 40 per cent; they are up to 60 per cent now. I hope that, as a result of the active employment strategy that will go through this place in the next few weeks, not only more of our young kids but also more of our work force who are unemployed will undergo training to improve their skills. That must have some effect on Australia's future. The skills of the work force will mean everything to us. If they remain low, Australia's future prospects will remain low. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that Senator Patterson interjects that they must have job prospects. Surely in a recession when the numbers of unemployed are very high, as Senator Michael Baume has pointed out, our job is to make sure that, when the recession is over, those people who have been disadvantaged have at least used the time of that disadvantage to improve their skills so that they can take advantage of the upturn more quickly, can benefit and can get jobs better than those they have had before. That has to be the aim of everyone in this place, not just the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It disappoints me to hear Senator Michael Baume refer to this strategy as dressing these people up. It is not a matter of dressing anyone up, if I can use his words; it is really a matter of getting those people to a position where they will not be vulnerable in future recessions because they will be so valuable to their employers. That is what Australia must be about. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) talked about the clever country. It is not clever to have a work force that is unskilled. It cannot be. Our efforts to try to improve the skills of the work force during the past few years have been very successful. They will be more successful still after the active employment strategy is introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> By the way, it should not be assumed that tough economic times are only occurring here. Even with a manufacturing base, the United States is in a recession. One wonders whether George Bush's head will be called for because of that. If one looks at Great Britain, one will find millions of people on the dole. I doubt very much whether Senator Baume will be calling for John Major's head for that. In the United States there is not even a national social security net underneath anyone who is displaced. Most of the support is either insurance based for individuals or run by individual states. In fact, states are cutting back on social welfare support because people from states with lower benefits are moving to those with better benefits. Rather than some states increasing the benefits, all states are reducing them to make sure that no flood of unemployed comes across the borders. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia does not have that sort of system. Here we have one of the most ordered and effective social security systems in the world. In fact, officials from our Department of Social Security have been invited to go to Canada and the United States in, I think, October this year to give some lectures on how their systems might be improved. Around the world it is recognised that the system here to meet the needs for those who are unemployed is far better than it is in other places. I note that the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson-I hope that everyone notes that I have finally said `doctor'; I have been trying to remember to do so for months-was in New Zealand recently. </PARA>

In a press conference in New Zealand on 26 April, Dr Hewson said that his aims were to ensure that the money goes to those in need and that those who should not get it or who in some way are sponging on the system get excluded.

It does not have a policy in respect of health, tax or social welfare-mind you, we are waiting.

That is what the Liberal philosophy is. After nine months people will be executed if they are on the dole. The Liberals would say, `We don't want to care about you any more; you are on the streets'. One wonders what kind of society Australia would be to live in if that happened. If it does happen, the fair play ethic which has been a part of Australian thinking over the past 100 years will go out the window.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today Senator Baume made much of youth unemployment. He also raised this matter in a press release that was put out some little time ago. He did not tell all the story, of course, in the press release. He certainly did not talk about the level of youth unemployment in March 1983 when this Government came to power. The level then was 28 per cent. The figure today is 25.8 per cent. I do not pretend for a second that I am proud of a 25.8 per cent figure; it is awful. But it is, of course, much better than that which was left to us. One wonders why Senator Baume could be so selective in his press release as to leave out what I would have thought was an incredibly important fact. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to arguments over how the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures are calculated and who is included and who is not included, one has to look at this a little more deeply. The first point is that the Government does not determine what the statistician does with those figures. We do not instruct the statistician what is to go into them and how they are to be compiled. He is independent and he makes up his own mind. So, it cannot be a case of any sort of Government fiddle. That is a nonsense and, of course, a gross insult to the Australian Bureau of Statistics which is collecting those statistics. It has never been the case that the Government has directed it in the way that those figures ought to be prepared. </PARA>
<PARA> When talking about figures concerning youth, we have to look at the number attending school or who are in tertiary institutions. We also have to bear in mind the decline in the proportion of people aged 15 to 19 in our population, which is a reflection of the slowdown in the birth rate that has been occurring for some time. I would have thought that the increasing numbers in schools and tertiary institutions and that decline in the proportion in the 15 to 19 age group would account for all of Senator Baume's alleged hiding of unemployed youth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has continued to attempt to assist teenagers in their efforts to get jobs. The announcements that we have made, even as recently as earlier this year, further that. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) was able to have included in the March statement a whole range of measures which will involve more and more training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> An extra 55,000 or 56,000 training places will be made available as a result of those programs. That is on top of all those programs that are in place at the moment. So a whole host of people get new opportunities to improve their skills. They will not be dressed up but will be made into more effective, more skilled workers to benefit Australia both now and in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of young people receiving apprenticeship training and Austudy educational allowances has jumped significantly since 1983. Many things have jumped since 1983. When one looks at that 1982 recession, the situation we inherited when we came to office, it has to be remembered that the real value of unemployment benefits then for a single adult as compared to now was 26 per cent less. The real value of those benefits has increased by 26 per cent during the eight years of this Government. Although I might not be proud of the unemployment figures, I am certainly proud of what the Government has been able to do for those people who are unemployed. Their lot has been very significantly improved every year by this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Hardly anybody got rental assistance in 1983. Rental assistance has been a creation of the last eight years. Brian Howe, during his stewardship of the portfolio I inherited from him, was able particularly to bring about massive increases in rental assistance-increases hitherto unthought of. For some, there have been increases of up to 79 per cent in real terms, which is an enormous jump. Of course, rental assistance during Brian Howe's time was extended to unemployment beneficiaries who rent private accommodation. That had not been the case before. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it is all that fair, and one would imagine a tad rich, to be preached to by Senator Baume, who as Mr Baume was a member of the Fraser Government, when one looks at the miserable rates that that Government was paying for unemployment benefits at the time of a recession and at a time when rental assistance was not paid to unemployed people. At least some compassion has been shown by this Government. At least we have acknowledged where the suffering is. </PARA>

All the Opposition wants to do is cut them out. The Opposition should not lecture us on how appalled it is about misery and tragedy when all it wants to do is add to it: make it more miserable for more people.

<PARA> In a press release of 7 April Senator Alston spoke of an employment strategy for the unemployed based on supplying them with `the right incentives'. The right incentives will come down to the stiff medicine that Prime Minister Bolger called it in December of last year in New Zealand. As Senator Baume and others cast admiring eyes over the cuts that the New Zealanders have made, I hope that all those in Australia presently unemployed understand what that will mean for them. It will mean a throwback to the uncaring attitudes of colonial Australia, a throwback to the worst of the bad old days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is today once again discussing, on a matter of public importance brought by the Opposition, the damage done not only to our economy but to the people who are thrown out of work by the Government's engineered depression. Once we have reached that point, we should look at the victims. Before the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) leaves the chamber, I express some appreciation of the comments that he addressed to the Opposition's more draconian proposals on the active employment strategy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be pleased to address my remarks through the Chair. It is obvious that the Government, in its failure of its economic policies, has had to rely on the support of the coalition parties, who have refused to assist the Australian Democrats in opposing some of the measures which would have reduced the suffering of those Australians who are now bearing the brunt of the recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of Australians suffering as a consequence of the recession, one could ask: where has the Opposition been on the issue of income support for young, unemployed and homeless people; on the removal of the assets test for farmers seeking family allowance supplement and Austudy; on increasing the waiting period for unemployment benefits? The Australian Democrats have moved amendments to shorten it, but where have the coalition parties been on this issue?</PARA>
<PARA> The high interest policy instituted by the Government was supported by Dr Hewson, who believed that that was indeed the only economic policy that could be applied to remove the imbalance in our trade figures. The Government, aided and abetted by the Opposition, is committed to dismantling all protective barriers to Australian industry while our competitors, in many cases, are increasing the assistance provided to their industries, especially their primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the benefit to low income families and rural Australian families in policies that call for the total deregulation and privatisation of our transport, health, financial and communications systems? Where is the benefit to them in having unemployment benefit cut off after nine months-the stated policy of the Opposition? Where is the benefit to them in a consumption tax which will reduce the sales tax on Rolls Royces and place it on bread and milk? Where is the benefit to them in massive cuts in public expenditure?</PARA>
<PARA> I am not saying this to let the Government off the hook: the Government should be deeply ashamed of the effects of its economic policies on those people who have always given the Australian Labor Party their support on the understanding-obviously false-that it would protect the interests of ordinary Australian workers. Those who are disillusioned with the Government should not expect the Opposition parties to rally to their cause. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the damning figures released today on the current state of employment in Australia. In this respect we are talking about people who want to work and who cannot find work. A record number of 844,000 people are now unemployed, which represents a record increase of 66,900 since last month. One year ago the figure was 524,700, which means that there has been a 60 per cent increase in the last 12 months. Currently 9.9 per cent of the population is officially unemployed, the highest figure since April 1984. I believe that we can add at least another 50 per cent to this figure, as Senator Baume demonstrated earlier this week, because of the hidden unemployed. There are 616,000 people on unemployment benefits. So the Government's Budget figure of 475,000 people receiving unemployment benefit has been well and truly exceeded. The record is the 1984 figure of 619,000, which will probably be exceeded next month. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the States, Western Australia had the highest unemployment rate at a seasonally adjusted 11.1 per cent; followed by Tasmania with 10.8 per cent; Queensland, 10.7 per cent; my own State of Victoria with 10.5 per cent; South Australia, 10.3 per cent; and New South Wales, 8.6 per cent. As usual, the Australian Capital Territory has the lowest rate of 6.6 per cent. Public servants and politicians do not easily become unemployed or affected by either the Government's or the Opposition's economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most worrying figure is for the seasonally adjusted teenage unemployment rate, which rose from 25.8 per cent to another record high of 27 per cent. One year ago, the figure was 17 per cent. Once again our young people are bearing the brunt of the economic policies of the Government and the Opposition. Since the cut-backs to income support for young people-again, I might add, supported by the Opposition last year-we can safely assume that the vast majority of the young people who cannot find work are now living in poverty. What an indictment of this Government. What an indictment of both old parties. So much for caring for young people as one of our most precious assets and so much for our future, which I believe is severely endangered by these policies. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the lessons to be learnt in Europe, where in Germany record high unemployment figures have seen the rise of fascism and Nazism. We should learn from those experiences and ensure that social dislocation of that nature and the human misery that goes with it does not occur in this country. The figures shatter once and for all the myth that people on unemployment benefit are dole bludgers. It is now very clear that there are simply not enough jobs to go around, yet the Opposition proposes to terminate the payment of unemployment benefit after nine months. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the active employment strategy. What does the Government do in the midst of this rising unemployment, hardship and despair? It introduces this so-called employment strategy which will compel unemployed people to enter into an agreement with the Government in order to receive unemployment payments. The strategy provides for the abolition of unemployment benefit from 1 July 1991 and its replacement with a two-tier payment system which is dependent on people abiding by directions given to them by public servants standing behind a counter. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Government is trying to sell this strategy as a positive and active program. We should remember that these people are not given the choice to work or to seek training; they are being forced to do so. Training for what? Is the evidence not on the table today that jobs are simply not there? Yet we are going to force people to undertake training or to lose unemployment benefit for jobs that are not in existence. </PARA>
<PARA> This strategy is fraught with problems, of both a philosophical and practical nature. It has already attracted widespread criticism-correctly-from a variety of quarters, including the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Council of Social Service and many other community and welfare organisations. Whilst I do not have time to go into the numerous technical and practical problems with this package, I foreshadow once again the amendments that the Australian Democrats will move to make this strategy more humane and more constructive. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Government should demonstrate that those people who are out of work are given a genuine chance through an economic strategy which will create jobs. I refer to an article published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 4 May 1991 headed `Forum calls for Federal initiatives'. The article refers to a report entitled An Australia that Works: A Vision for the Future by the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia (CEDA). In quoting from that report, the article states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Picking winners is not always an undesirable project, as the success of Singapore, Korea and Japan suggests; intervention by government is not always `shooting ourselves in the foot' as the successful interventions that occur in all those countries demonstrate,'' the communique says. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The overall scale of markets in an economy like Australia can be stimulated by government use of market access, purchasing and offsets to secure competitive advantages.''</PARA>
<PARA> The CEDA conference called upon the Government to focus its policies on a number of key areas:</PARA>
<PARA> * improvements to the education and training system to create a more productive work force;</PARA>
<PARA> * bringing about a rise in the proportion of Australia's commodity exports shipped abroad in a higher value-added form;</PARA>
<PARA> * renewed commitment to the manufacturing sector; and</PARA>
<PARA> * reform of the institutional and constitutional framework to remove counter-productive Federal/State divisions. </PARA>
<PARA> It found that the key areas of value-added growth in 21st century would include areas such as telecommunications, education, health, development and research, and tourism-all heavily dependent upon government programs. </PARA>
<PARA>It is time that the Government and the Opposition accepted that it is no longer acceptable to pursue economic policies which are based on a dog eat dog, totally deregulated free market. We must look to the Government to take interventive action to ensure that those industry sectors which can provide employment do so. </PARA>
<PARA> It is urgent that the Government look at some of these measures that are now necessary to achieve the aim to provide work for all those who want to work. I cite a few points from the policy of the Australian Democrats: a reduced payroll tax; a 5 per cent bounty on new exports-and I emphasise new exports; a further lowering of the home loan interest rate; faster depreciation for new investment in productivity enhancing equipment, in contrast to the token adjustment in the Government's industry statement; a slowing down of tariff reductions while other countries are increasing the barriers against our products; and increasing expenditure on public transport and public housing. Immediately everybody will say, `But where is the money coming from?'. These costs could easily be covered by a 2c per litre additional petrol and diesel excise, which would yield $460m; a 40 per cent increase in the excise on tobacco and alcohol, which would yield $1.1 billion; and increased withholding taxes on foreign loan interest which has recently been the subject of the Martin report, which would yield $600m. </PARA>

<PARA> The last election was won by the Australian Labor Party on the issue of unemployment. This Government will sink or swim on its performance in providing jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: this Government will sink or swim on its performance in providing jobs. Let me just say that the word `providing' is the key to the difference between Labor and Liberal.

This is preferable to going out and falsely boosting jobs. As a result of the Government's trying to provide jobs, we have seen an increase in the public sector and now we are seeing the real unemployment, the true unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> We are debating today the continuing human tragedy and misery of the appallingly high level of unemployment brought about by the recession that the Treasurer, Mr Keating, said `we had to have'. Often the suffering and human tragedy being experienced by Australians as a result of the recession `we had to have' is reduced to headlines and statistics. I just give some examples of these headlines: `Record job plunge a test of Government's resolve'; `Jobless hits 9.2 per cent and worse to come'; `Unemployment tops one million'; `Victorian apprenticeship vacancies down by 43 per cent'; and `Minister predicts more jobless'-that was Senator Richardson on 2 February; he was right for once. I suppose he was getting us all prepared. The final example is: `State's dole numbers soar'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well as we sit back and look at those headlines. I suppose that one of the headlines tomorrow will be `Record unemployment rates for two months in a row'. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security have all recognised the seriousness of Australia's unemployment problem but they have no choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Today at half past 11 we had unemployment statistics which were unambiguously bad. In April, a new record was created-844,000 people unemployed. This followed an old record-it has taken only a month to break it-of 770,100 unemployed in March. In April, the unemployment rate rose from 9.2 per cent to 9.9 per cent with 66,900 more Australians joining the dole queues. As Senator Baume has said, this is the largest monthly rise recorded by the survey. When we think about that and divide it by 30, that is some 2,500 people a day, seven days a week over the last month, who had no jobs. These were people who fronted up to their work to be told, `You're finishing up on Friday'. These are people who work in manufacturing or in the local shop in High Street, Malvern or wherever else. In Victoria, the unemployment rate rose from 9.7 per cent in March to 10.7 per cent in April, with 28,700 Victorians joining the dole queues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Victoria has gone over the magical 10 per cent. Between April 1990 and April 1991 the unemployment rate in Victoria rose from 4.8 per cent to 10.5 per cent; more than double. The number of unemployed people rose from 106,000 to 230,000 in one 12-month period. That is what has happened in my State since the last election; double the number of people unemployed because of the folly of the Victorian State Government and the folly of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In March, there were 1.05 million Australians registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service looking for work; a million people out there searching for jobs-and they are the registered ones. The number of people working dropped by 82,400 in March, which represented the biggest ever monthly employment decrease-Senator Baume mentioned that. Youth unemployment rose from 14.6 per cent in April 1990 to 27.4 per cent in April 1991. In March 1991, 35.6 per cent of Australians under 20 were looking for full time work. In Melbourne, a massive 45 per cent of young people under 20 were looking for work. That is nearly half of the kids under 20 looking for jobs. Over the last 12 months, approximately 190,000 jobs have disappeared from the labour market; 150,000 of these in the past three months. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not difficult to become complacent and blase when one is inundated with one set of bad economic statistics after another. From the relative comfort of employment-which those of us here in the Senate, our staff and the staff of the Parliament enjoy-it is easy to insulate oneself from the despair, the helplessness, the frustration, the bitterness, and the financial and emotional suffering which characterise the tragic human face of the unemployment figures; that is, the people behind the figures. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about 844,000 Australian families whose goals and aspirations have been shot down by a recession which the Treasurer claims `we had to have'. These are 844,000 Australians whose confidence and self-esteem is gradually being withered away as they apply, but are rejected, for jobs which they are more than capable of performing. These are the 844,000 Australians with mouths to feed, families to clothe, mortgages or rent to pay and no foreseeable means of meeting these responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I will try to provide the Senate with an insight into the human face because we have talked about statistics. Senator Richardson talked about statistics and he talked about what the Government was doing. But he did not talk about the people. Let me just tell the Senate about James from Kings Cross in Sydney. We can read about him in the Burdekin report:</PARA>
<PARA>James is a 19-year-old youth who presented to us on 2 September, homeless and unemployed. He was not streetwise and needed a bed until he could find a job and get a place to live. He was exceptionally motivated and made every attempt to find work . . . However, we could not find accommodation for James outside Kings Cross because generally refuges do not accept people over the age of 18. As disillusionment with his failure to get work grew, James became more acquainted with the Cross, more acquainted with the street life and he began using drugs . . . On the 26th of the ninth, this is three and a half weeks after arriving on our doorstep, James left us to go to a squat. In three and a half weeks that highly motivated person was on the street using drugs . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is how long it takes-3 1/2 weeks. Senator Richardson stood there telling us that when the recession was over there would be training programs and people would get employment. Well, in 3 1/2 weeks the damage can be done; we do not have the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Gavin is another example. Gavin is 17 years old and has left school. He refuses to accept unemployment benefits because he does not believe that he should get something for nothing. He wants to be an ambulance driver. What can he do in the interim? He has gone off to get his driver's licence, to improve his first-aid skills and to continue his voluntary work with the State Emergency Service until he is 19. He has found a way of coping, but it is not really satisfactory for him. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell honourable senators about Nadia who, last weekend, stood in a queue of 5,000 people. I remember looking at photographs in old newspapers of people in long dole queues during the depression. On this occasion there were 5,000 people seeking a job in a Japanese-owned department store which is to open in Melbourne in five months time. Nadia, with an honours degree in art history and a graduate diploma in museum studies, has spent the last five months looking for a job and has said she would take anything. She believes that what is happening is disheartening and demoralising. That was Nadia last weekend looking for a job. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another letter which covers two States. It is a letter I pulled out of a newspaper and gave to a couple of my colleagues because it demonstrates two things. First, it deals with the human face of unemployment and, secondly, it deals with the other people involved-the parents. The parents of these young people who are unemployed had aspirations for their children and indeed have worked their insides out to give them the very opportunities that they as parents did not have. They are now watching those kids being consigned to the scrapheap of life. Mr Taylor of Toowoomba says:</PARA>
<PARA>My son, Andrew has just been retrenched-yesterday. He is 23 and has an agricultural science degree from Queensland University. It took Andrew six months to find a job after graduating at the end of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> He put a huge effort into job-hunting. He did not at any stage go on the dole as he thought that was a bit defeatist and his mother and I were perfectly happy to sustain him. </PARA>
<PARA> There were only eight students in his year who majored in Animal Production-eight. From a highly regarded faculty in one of the country's premier universities, eight graduates B.Ag.Sc. looking for jobs . . .</PARA>
<PARA> But Andrew found his job-in the dairying industry in northern Victoria. A small, lean, competent cooperative involved in herd improvement and increased efficiency in dairying. </PARA>
<PARA> All about productivity and being clever, in fact. </PARA>
<PARA> He loved it . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to talk about Andrew and his job there. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>But the export-orientated farmers in northern Victoria have been squeezed dry . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The father then talks about the business declining. He continues in the letter:</PARA>
<PARA> When he had to be retrenched, his boss, the chairman, and the past chairman were all there-the hardest thing his boss has had to do in 30 years in the industry. The toughened chairman had tears in his eyes. When it was over, his boss suggested to Andrew that he ring home- `Stay on the phone for half an hour if you need to, Andrew'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the boss said to this Queensland boy who had got a job in Victoria. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Andrew is devastated. `I didn't regard this as just a 9 to 5 job, Dad, and I'm leaving when I know there is a lot more I can do here.'</PARA>
<PARA>Then the father makes the comment:</PARA>
<PARA> So while the thugs in the trade union movement continue to run Australia on the basis of the maximum wages and rorts for the minimum of effort, this country burns. While the social security industry blossoms and is deliberately nurtured by Government policy, industries haemorrhage. While other countries dump their produce in Australia, ours rots. What a clever country!</PARA>
<PARA>That is the human face of unemployment. I have told only a handful of 844,000 real life stories which illustrate the pain and frustration borne by those who have felt the brunt of the Treasurer's engineered recession, but they are real stories involving real people. </PARA>
<PARA> The time for fiddling with levers has passed. That is what Treasurer Keating has been doing. What is needed is tax reform, labour market reform, and transport and waterfront reform. Confidence needs to be restored so that businesses are prepared to invest in Australia, with jobs being created by that investment. That is what we need. I want to remind my colleagues on the other side of the chamber what Senator Richardson said in October 1983:</PARA>
<PARA> I might say that the Labor Government was elected primarily on the issue of unemployment. It recognises its responsibilities in this area and if it fails over the years to meet the problem of unemployment it will not be elected again . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that he said in those circumstances this Government `will not be elected again'. He then added, `and it will not deserve to be'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some considerable regret, in the two meanings of that word, that I rise to speak in this debate today: first, because it is a debate that has been run on a number of occasions in this place, and I do not think the Opposition is persuading me in any way that if and when it ever got to be in government it would understand what a human face was about; and, secondly, because it is quite clearly a matter of regret for me and for government, as has already been said by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), that there are that number of people unemployed. It is a matter of great regret and requires us to have taken more heed of what the Minister said about the best way to tackle this. Brawls about which recession is best probably are not very constructive, nor are people who want to claim that they have a monopoly on compassion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know how Senator Patterson defines compassion, or whether it is that she has 800 letters. I suspect that Senator Patterson is worthy of more regard than that. It is to me a matter of real concern to wonder how one describes compassion if one is in government. If one is in government compassion has to be assessed, judged and described by the programs one implements to address the problems of unemployed people, not by articles of faith. A faith-led recovery I do not believe would be persuasive. I am not quite sure what Senator Patterson believes because it is very difficult to find out what Opposition members believe. It is very clear that they have some claims. Perhaps a declamatory-led recovery may be another way of putting it. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there was the suggestion that we should attract investment, which would create jobs. Senator Patterson, in making that claim, I believe, is suggesting that this Government has not provided jobs. That is a gross misrepresentation of the facts and indicates that Senator Patterson does not have a very good understanding of the 1.6 million jobs that have been created. Unfortunately, in the past 12 months, some of those have gone. But they were not provided by government. They were created by the Government at the time, setting the parameters that allowed for that growth to happen. We know the benefits. We have argued so often in this place the benefit of people finding their income security in the preferred way, that is, through employment. </PARA>
<PARA> It was said in the last debate on this issue by Opposition senators, and it is said from time to time by them, that they object to women in the work force, to women exercising their option to take up jobs and to seek their income security in this way. I believe, Madam Acting Deputy President, that that is not your view, because I understand that you have said so in certain places, including this chamber. It is curious that Opposition senators would want to say in this chamber that what we need to do is to give everyone jobs but on other occasions take the view `Yes, but we do not really mean women'. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know their view on employment or the role of women in employment. I believe that they are not clear about it. Senator Patterson may frown, but the record shows what she and some of her colleagues think about women in employment. The challenge for anybody listening to this debate is to try to find out what the Opposition would do to address the challenge of such high unemployment. It is quite clear what the Government has done and is doing. That is the difference, and that is what this debate comes down to. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume has asked us today to debate the continuing human tragedy and misery of the appallingly high level of unemployment, but he finishes with dot, dot, dot, with no suggestion at all about what he or the Opposition will do. When Senator Richardson suggested that Dr Hewson had views about what the Opposition would do, Senator Michael Baume wanted to object to those things. I can quote Dr Hewson following, I think, a visit to New Zealand, but I cannot be absolutely sure about that. This is a transcript of an interview with Mr Matt Abraham on 6 May 1991. Certainly Dr Hewson was giving the interview on that day. I cannot say where he was, but I suspect he was back in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> When asked what he thought about the dramatic cuts of up to 10 per cent or more in pensions, medical subsidies and so on and the rise in prescription charges in New Zealand under the Bolger Government, and whether he was persuaded or attracted to follow in kind, Dr Hewson said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, we are not necessarily picking up any of their welfare cuts, although in principle personal financial responsibility originating with the family and the targeting of welfare are key elements of our approach. We have already identified some of the decisions we would take in that regard, although we do not mirror in a sense the New Zealand approach. Sure, we need to keep a tough line on that, on welfare spending, to make sure it hits the target . . . We need to keep a tough line on welfare spending to make sure that it hits the target, to make sure that those who shouldn't get it don't get it or shouldn't get it to the extent that they get it, well, we will have to cut that back.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Michael Baume seems to be objecting that Dr Hewson will not be cutting back on welfare. On the next page Dr Hewson says, yes, that he anticipates that cuts in welfare would be about $1 billion. That is a pretty exciting achievement! That is what the Opposition is telling people who are unemployed. We will look forward to a Hewson government: it will cut welfare by $1 billion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does Senator Michael Baume understand the achievements of this Government, which has actually cut expenditure in welfare and at the same time increased every payment because of targeting? Why would he not want to endorse that achievement? If our approach is not his, how does he intend to do it differently? Why does Senator Michael Baume object to the Government's achievements in this area and suggest that he can do better if targeting means that after nine months unemployment people will lose any further assistance under the Hewson proposals? Is that called targeting or is that called marginalising?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that we can take any comfort from what the Opposition is proposing to do. Dr Hewson says, `We will stay tough on welfare, we will find $1 billion worth of cuts in welfare and we will make sure that people look after themselves after those nine months'. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Opposition is proposing some amendments to the Job Search and Newstart legislation that actually modify that position just slightly. But the principle remains the same: the Opposition will not support people on the unemployment benefit after nine and possibly 11 months. That is in such contrast to what this Government is doing. As I have said in this place on previous occasions, this Government is concerned about unemployed people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. The point I want to make-as I have said, I have made it in previous speeches-is that it has not only been in times of recession or high unemployment that the Government has actually designed and delivered programs that assist people who find themselves unemployed or, for that matter, dependent upon social security for their income maintenance, whether it be through pensions or benefits other than the unemployment benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government is concerned to see that people on benefits or pensions in this country are not forgotten. That has been the practice in the past. The Government has focused on counselling skills, training and projects to encourage those people to feel part of a system, to undertake training, to develop their skills and to gain the confidence that is certainly likely to slip if they are unemployed. That is all recognised and understood. That is why these government programs are in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like the Opposition to tell me-I can never get this information-whether it will cut out these programs and abandon the training schemes. Will it say, `It is not a matter of training; all you have to do is create employment and people will know how to get the jobs'? Does the Opposition recognise that the nature of jobs and employment in this country is changing and must continue to change in the direction of a more skilled work force? I do not understand how Opposition senators can argue against those government proposals and at the same time say that they have a compassion for people who are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Minister Richardson took issue with Senator Michael Baume about his claims that the Government is fiddling the unemployment figures. That is something that I, too, would like to pick up. Senator Michael Baume's speech in this place on 11 April 1991 conveys to me that he does not understand what the figures are about and that, if he does, he is not prepared to let the facts interfere with his preferred fiction. He talked about how governments fiddle statistics and seemed to quite ignore the fact that these statistics are collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). If he means that there is a fiddle on, he should take it up with the ABS instead of making vague smears and indulging in innuendo. Senator Michael Baume went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This is apart from the enormous fiddle involved in the statistics by the extension of Austudy to secondary schools which, as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) said, in many instances may prove enormously beneficial in the long run to some people who would be given opportunities to get better education and training. </PARA>
<PARA>What is Senator Michael Baume saying? Is he saying that the statistics are being fiddled? Is he saying that the country is being deluded about the state of unemployment because people are exercising their choice to take up Austudy? Is he saying that people who exercise their option to take up Austudy and not receive the unemployment benefit are daft? Is he saying that he does not believe that people should have the right to take up Austudy? Is he saying that these figures are really just a deliberate attempt by government to hide unemployment?</PARA>
<PARA> This Government and I are proud that there is no longer an incentive for people to receive the unemployment benefit instead of Austudy. This Government has taken away the incentive for young untrained and unskilled people to go directly to jobs instead of staying on at school where they can study and train. Is Senator Michael Baume saying that he believes we should do away with Austudy and that people should not have that training? If he is not saying that, he should stop suggesting that the ABS is fiddling statistics. The fact is that Australians prefer to take up the option of Austudy rather than receive the unemployment benefit. It is the direct policy and aim of this Government that this should happen. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government does not want to see what happened under Mr Fraser. Mick Young has written about the tremendous loss in terms of skilled personnel that results from a time lag of at least five years that is needed for training. It is a comfort, albeit minimal, that this Government is saying to people, `If you are forced to be unemployed for a short time, do not waste your time. Make use of that time to train, to maintain your skills, to be retrained or to upgrade those skills so that when the opportunities for employment re-emerge, as they certainly will, you will be well placed to take up those positions'. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed that, during Minister Richardson's speech, Senator Michael Baume and Senator Patterson wanted to interject, `What is the point of going to school or getting training when there were no jobs?'. I hope that they do not really believe the implication in that kind of question. If the virtue of education, training and skills is not clear to Senator Michael Baume and Senator Patterson, I wonder about the seriousness of their claims of compassion and concern for the unemployed. They cannot tell me that they would continue the Government's programs that have been set in place. It is all very well to speak in the Senate or out in the community about their concern and compassion. But that concern and compassion must be reinforced by setting in place programs that will actually put them into existence. </PARA>
<PARA> We fall back on, and we are prepared to argue for, compassionate programs and policies for the unemployed that will help and assist this country to get through this very difficult and hard period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The trouble with what Senator Crowley has just said is that what Senator Patterson and Senator Baume have said about education training and skills is exactly how young Australians in schools and young unemployed Australians feel today. All around Australia-in Cairns, Townsville and Mackay when I was there last week and also in Western Australia-young people have said to me, `What's the use of having skills and what's the use of going to school if there are no jobs?'. That is exactly how young Australians feel. There is no hope for the future under this Government. Young Australians are depressed and this lack of morale is evident.

<PARA> In her contribution Senator Crowley referred to what the Opposition would do when in government. She asked us a series of questions. She said, `The Opposition never tells us what its policies are' and she spent the last 15 minutes of her speech discussing that with the Senate. But the real question is: what is this Government going to do about it? After listening to Senator Richardson and Senator Crowley today the Senate is no better informed. We look forward to hearing Senator Giles's contribution as to how this Government hopes to solve this crisis of its own making. The matter of public importance says--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. We want to know how the Government will solve this crisis. The matter of public importance says that this is a recession that `we had to have'. Senator Crowley also dealt with the Opposition's views on women in the work force. Our position is quite clear: women should choose their position in the work force. We do not believe in the Australian Labor Party's policy of pushing women forward. We believe that the people who are best qualified for the jobs should get the jobs. We do not believe in that sort of discrimination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Richardson, in his comments, asked the Senate to ignore the question of whose recession was the worst. Of late, the Government has been comparing the current recession with the recession which occurred in 1982-83. I do not wish to do that, but as the comparisons and the figures get worse, month by month, Senator Richardson has invented a new strategy-to go back and blame Robert Menzies. He cannot blame Malcolm Fraser any more so he is blaming Robert Menzies for our current state of affairs. I guess that shows how far Senator Richardson has got to go. </PARA>
<PARA> We should perhaps look at the state Australia was in during the years of Robert Menzies. Of course, taxes were a hell of a lot lower than they are now and it was a lot easier to start a new business in those days when we had far less government intervention and far less Federal intervention in the affairs of state. Indeed, if we had an economic environment today which is similar to the economic environment of the Robert Menzies years-as many older Australians will remember, but I cannot-perhaps we would not be in the mess we are in. Later in my remarks I will refer to the human tragedy and how it affects older people. I am sure that many of those older Australians think back to the Menzies days and compare them with the days of the Hawke Government-the second longest serving Prime Minister. What a terrible comparison that is. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson also referred to Australia's reliance on our resources industries. He has been known to advocate that Australia should not be reliant on its resources and he, more than any other Australian, has done much to ensure that Australia can no longer rely on its resources. During his term as the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories he had the dubious distinction of stopping many resource projects which could now be contributing to our national income. This is the problem that this Government's strange policies have inflicted upon Australia-policies which change from month to month and week to week--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good comment. Indeed, Senator Richardson and his mate the Treasurer, Paul Keating, have put this country into the red to the tune of about $132 billion-a debt that my children and my children's children will be paying off long after I am pushing up the daisies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point Senator Richardson made-which was repeated by Senator Crowley-concerns the question of work force skills and skills training. He talked about the Government's great record in trying to train the work force. I put it to the Senate and to the Australian people that when Federal and State governments-particularly Labor Federal and State governments-start trying to come up with training schemes and skills schemes in order to fit Australia's youth and unemployed people for employment, one should really start to wonder about the `picking winners' approach. If I had to leave it to someone to train my children, or any children, in order to increase their skills so that they could participate in the work force, the last people I would leave it to would be those in the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems which the next Hewson Liberal Government will solve is that private enterprise is given a greater incentive to become involved in that training-not through forcing compulsory levies upon it or forcing the Government's own ideas about training and skills upon it and trying to pick the direction of the economy, but by allowing the private sector to really get involved. If government got off the back of business and allowed business to do its own training to increase the skills of the work force through the private sector, the work force would become skilled far more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> The comments made by Dr Hewson whilst he was in New Zealand were referred to. I heard them repeated by Senator Crowley and Senator Richardson. Quite frankly, the comments Dr Hewson made were quite sensible. He is talking about cutting out benefits which are going to people who do not need them. If one were to walk down the main streets of our capital cities, stop Australians and ask them about the problems that need to be solved in the Australian economy-as I do quite regularly and as I have done through a recent survey of young people in Australia-one would find that they always comment that we have to stop wasteful government expenditure and stop paying the dole to people who do not need it. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess that is cheap political rhetoric these days, but we do need to cut out wasteful government benefits. That is all that Dr Hewson has been saying. If Senator Giles or anyone else wants to dispute what Dr Hewson is saying, let them do it. They should not repeat only the quotes that suit them; let them come up with solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The other furphy put forward by Senator Richardson was the nine-month idea; that is, that the Liberal Party of Australia would leave people who have been unemployed for nine months out in the cold on the scrap heap. That is absolute rubbish and Senator Richardson knows it. It is a disgrace that he would come into the Senate and continue to mislead the Senate and the Australian public about this matter. Policies are always under review after an election, but the policy as it stands at the moment is that a special benefit would apply after the nine-month period. Eligibility criteria would be tightened up and these criteria would relate to outside assistance and an activity test, as to what sorts of activities people were undertaking when looking for a job. I do not think any Australian would deny that that is an appropriate response. People who have been unemployed for nine months should, clearly, have to face other eligibility tests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Patterson has said, the comments of Senator Richardson and Senator Crowley were mischievous and designed to mislead the public. At the end of Senator Richardson's contribution-if one could call it that-he resorted to the class struggle. He resorted to the fact that the Liberals do not care about unemployed people; that we would put them onto the scrap heap. He said that the Government cares more about the unemployed than we do. Of course, that is an absolute load of rubbish. It debases the political debate if we have to resort to saying, `We care more than you do'. Senator Spindler went down that same track also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Young Australians and unemployed Australians do not want money thrown at them; they do not want to become dependent on the Government. They want a healthy economy, some hope for the future and some hope that they will be able get a job. If they cannot get a job they want to know that they have a government which is prepared to put in place a safety net which will encourage them to go out and look for work. The Liberal Party will never resile from that commitment. Our commitment to helping the less fortunate is well documented and well understood and it is on the record. It does not need to be questioned by Senator Graham Richardson or anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to refer to my home State, where the rate of unemployment leads Australia. We lead Australia in many areas, but this is one area where no Western Australian would be proud to claim leadership. In the last 12 months the level of unemployment in Western Australia has risen from 60,200 to 94,200 people who want work but cannot get it. </PARA>
<PARA> As to regional areas, in the northern metropolitan division, which takes in the electorates of Stirling and Cowan in particular, the increase in unemployment has gone from 8,500 individuals to 19,200. It is a 125 per cent increase. I guess many people in those electorates who voted for the Labor Party or the Australian Democrats at the last election would feel a bit stupid now, and what a shame. The situation in the southern suburbs is no better. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Patterson referred to some remarks by Senator Richardson when the Labor Party came into power in 1983, where he said that this Government would sink or swim on job creation. The only job creation that this Government can claim real credit for is the job creation for its mates. On the latest count, Labor Party mates have been given 872 jobs by the Hawke Administration. Clearly, the most obvious one at the moment is the job given to Ambassador Burke. Of course, that has gone by the wayside today but former Labor members of parliament, such as Barry Cunningham; John Brumby; the former New South Wales Labor Minister for Roads, George Paciullo; Jim Spiegelman; Pamela O'Neil; and Peter Cleeland, among 872 mates of the Labor Party-are in cosy government jobs. They do not feel threatened by this unemployment crisis. They do not feel threatened by not being able to buy their children shoes to wear to school tomorrow. They are safe, they are sound, they are the mates of this Government and theirs are the only jobs that this Government can claim are permanent jobs-it has jobs which are safe from the cool winds of this economic recession. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not want to concentrate all of my time on the negative aspects of this. I want to finalise my contribution today by looking at some of the things that Australia needs to do to for young Australians, young families, middle aged Australians who are out of work, the farmers, the pastoralists who have had their chequebooks taken away from them and the elderly people who sit in their homes, who have been through the Great Depression, been through the war and watched politics in Australia unfold during the 1980s with a sinking heart. If I were a 70- or 80-year old looking at what has happened to Australia under this Hawke Government, with all the great hope that it came to power with in 1983 and seeing what has actually happened, I would think back on my life and think what a great waste of all of Australia's great resources and natural talent have been frittered away. When those old people see what is left for their grandchildren and their great grandchildren, one would really have to be concerned for how they will leave Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians need some hope and what needs to be done is to change the policies of this Government. We need to ensure that mining and exploration for minerals does carry on, that Australia's great natural resources are not wasted and that our secondary and tertiary industries are able to succeed but that in the meantime we do not make it so hard to get a new mine off the ground, such as is happening in the Kakadu National Park at the moment, that our national income deteriorates. </PARA>
<PARA> There are so many other industries, such as tourism, where we are constrained by the regulation on international flights, by the moribund decision-making process about the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport; by development approvals for tourism developments; by stupid Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines which make it very hard to make a tourism development viable these days; and, of course, by the airports' holiday leave loadings and penalty rates, which make the tourism industries non-viable at the moment. There are many areas of reform required. This Government has had eight years to put things right. It has not put them right and the Australian people are looking forward to hope for the future. That hope is Dr John Hewson's next Liberal Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the penultimate speaker in this matter of public importance this afternoon I find that we are going over ground that has been quite thoroughly worked in various similar debates over the last two or three months. There is not very much enlightenment from the Opposition as a result of its initiative in raising the issue again, although I am not denying for a moment that it is an extremely important issue. I should have thought, though, given the opportunity for these frequent debates, that we might have some indication of some really splendid policy development. Unfortunately, once again we are disappointed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have emphasised every time I have spoken on this issue that we are a very different society from the one that the Hawke Government inherited in 1983. There were inferior income supports; an inequitable tax system in which many of the wealthiest barely and rarely paid tax; a low school retention rate; failure to index benefits; household incomes which had grown by only 5 1/2 per cent in eight years; and a poorly administered and taken up family income supplement scheme. There was no national scheme to ensure that non-custodial parents complied with court orders for maintenance. There had been repeated attacks on what had been a universal health scheme-Medibank-and many people lacked medical coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> In the intervening years there have been substantial income improvements at the household level across the community generally. Real household disposable incomes per capita grew by 12.4 per cent between March 1983 and September 1990, comparing with a growth of only 5 1/2 per cent for the previous seven years. Child poverty has been at the forefront of many of our initiatives. At present more than half a million families, including 1.2 million children, are being helped with family allowance supplement payments or the equivalent in extra pensions and benefits. As I have noted before, the average payment to families who are entitled to this payment is something like $50 a week tax free. That payment is indexed, as are all our social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensions and benefits have increased in real terms, and the tax burden on pensioners has been reduced. The pension is now worth slightly over 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The value of the single pension has increased by very nearly 10 per cent in real terms since March 1983, and the majority of age and service pensioners were freed from tax liability from July 1990. This is very easy to forget unless one happens to be in that particular group. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation has been made a great deal more equitable. Pensioners and families on low incomes have benefited from the increase since 1983 of the tax-free threshold and the reduction in the lowest marginal rate from 32 to 20 per cent. A great may more people are actually paying their tax and we are seeing a degree of redistribution from the wealthy to the most poverty stricken-the lowest income groups in this country-that many of us would not have thought possible a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Health care has changed considerably, Medicare being the cornerstone of our health policy with nearly two million people who previously had no health cover now being protected by Medicare. School retention has already been mentioned this afternoon. If there is one policy which is going to make a long term difference to the opportunities of Australians of every age, it is that there are far more people staying within the school system and improving their employability. Over 60 per cent of children now stay on to year 12, and in 1982 only 36 per cent of students were in that category. </PARA>
<PARA> We have introduced considerable reforms into the housing sector: a new Commonwealth-State housing agreement; rental rebates are going to public housing tenants in quite substantial numbers-they have been increased from 52 per cent in 1981-82 to 72 per cent in 1987-88; and dwelling commencements have averaged 142,000 a year since the Australian Labor Party came into office, considerably more than the average during the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA> People with disabilities are the beneficiaries of an improved set of policies introduced by Government and considerably increased education, training and employment opportunities-a matter which is of great importance for that particular and quite substantial sector of the community. Our child support scheme has also made an enormous difference to the living standards of those very many families where the non-custodial parents managed to avoid their responsibilities until quite recently. </PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon in this debate reference has been made to participation rates. I would like again to emphasise the fact that, amongst the coalition and also the Australian Democrats, there seems to be a fair amount of confusion about, first of all, who collects the data that is used and distributed monthly in the unemployment statistics; secondly, what the statistics mean; and, thirdly, what their significance is in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> For a start it is not the Government which collects these statistics; it is not the Commonwealth Employment Service which collects them; nor is it the Department of Social Security. The Australian Bureau of Statistics collects the figures. Therefore, these figures result from household surveys and other such methods of collecting from sample groups. Those people who do not seem to understand still apparently assume that we finish up with a big question mark about the statistics, which are said to fail to represent the hidden unemployed. The figures that we have these days are much more accurate and reliable than they have been in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Although we are once again seeing an increase in unemployment, we are also seeing a slight increase in employment participation rates-that is, rates representing those individuals over 15-years of age who are in the work force, regardless of whether they are employed or unemployed. Again in seasonally adjusted terms, the figure, in total, is 75.4 per cent. For females, there has been a continuing increase from 51.8 per cent in April last year to 52.3 per cent in April this year. The total increase for persons has been from 63.5 per cent in April 1990 to 63.7 per cent in 1991, which indicates that there has been a substantial increase in those who identify with the work force. There also has been, in real terms, an increase in the number of people in the work force. The Government is particularly pleased with its success in achieving and maintaining high labour force participation rates, even though the unemployment rates do not look good at all. </PARA>
<PARA> High job growth since 1983 has encouraged people to enter the work force; to identify with the work force; and, in many cases, to enhance their employment opportunities. As I said before, the labour force participation rate now stands at 63.7 per cent-3.3 per cent higher than when this Government came to office and 0.2 per cent higher than it was in April 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that keeps confusing the Opposition is that of unemployment among young people. Just because people between the ages of 15 and 19 are not in the work force, it does not necessarily mean that they are unemployed. Some of them certainly are, but, as we have pointed out time and time again, the number of young people who are staying within the education system has been greatly enhanced. Over the 12 months to March 1991, 39,000 more 15-to 19-year-olds attended school or a tertiary educational institution full time-an increase of about 5 per cent. Along with the decrease of 30,000 in the 15-to 19-year-old population, reflecting the slowdown in Australia's birth rate in the early 1970s, this accounts for all of Senator Michael Baume's `hidden unemployed'. They are not hidden at all. They are there in the statistics in relation to those in full time or part time education. </PARA>
<PARA> A decline in full time employment of teenagers over the last year does not represent a rise in unemployment among teenagers. The calculations that have been used by Senator Baume and others in the Opposition do not consider the number who may have returned to school, who may be employed part time, or who are otherwise outside those technically employed. It is very foolish of Senator Baume and others to simply rely on the figures and not to look at the definitions at the beginning of every document that comes from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> As have others, I have recently been in New Zealand. I was very interested to hear the reference that has been made this afternoon to the Opposition's plan to end entitlement to unemployment benefit after nine months. This is exactly the phenomenon that is apparent in New Zealand where, unlike the Australian Labor Party or the New Zealand Labour Party, the National Party Government's response to recession has been to reduce benefits generally by 10 per cent. That usually represents up to $30 a week. In some circumstances, a waiting period of 26 weeks has been imposed. I was interested to see in the Wellington newspaper, the Dominion, on 2 May 1990, the headline `More get special benefits after cuts'. The article read:</PARA>
<PARA>More beneficiaries have been receiving special benefits to top up their income since basic benefits were cut on April 1. </PARA>
<PARA>This is exactly what we are saying in response to the coalition's plan to cut out unemployment benefits and to make people rely on special benefits. They say that people are not going to starve; they are not going to be without income. But let me tell you why special benefit is a totally inappropriate form of income support for the unemployed. It is not linked to labour market assistance, it is not work tested, and it is not subject to an income test. Therefore, it completely discourages part time and casual employment. As I have commented before, the Opposition has also offered nothing concrete in the way of labour market training for the unemployed, although, during the last election campaign, it stated that it would reduce labour market program expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether the coalition also has in mind some of the other recent measures that have been taken by the conservatives in New Zealand. Along with cutting back on social security benefits, the New Zealand `economeritricians', as I like to call them, have simultaneously introduced a new employment law-the Employment Contracts Act. This has meant that low income earners-from the less skilled, poorly organised sectors of the work force-particularly those employed by small business, are now expected to bargain on equal terms with their employers. All the tired cliches are being invoked-the ones that we hear from the Opposition in Australia: `a level playing field', `freedom of association', `the rights of the individual'-but very few are impressed by such obfuscation. </PARA>
<PARA> In a widely distributed document, a group of New Zealand Catholic priests expressed deep reservations about the new legislation. Freedom of association, they said, really meant freedom to dissociate. According to the bishops, the emphasis on freedom of choice failed to balance this concept with concern for the common good-that is, the public good. They could not accept the legislation:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . secondly because it emphasises the rights of the individual without their accompanying duty to act in solidarity and without giving any corresponding rights to the groups. </PARA>
<PARA>The bishops are in no doubt that this industrial measure is extremely harsh, extremely inequitable and, in their words, extremely unchristian. The only protection for the least well qualified is a set of poor minimum standards. For those under the age of 20, there is not even a minimum wage. </PARA>
<PARA> Is that what the Australian conservatives are planning-a system without a proper safety net? We have heard nothing about their safety net; nothing about their plans to stimulate the labour market; and nothing about their plans to train, to retrain or to educate. We deplore this recession and its effects on individuals and families as much as the Opposition does. Our system of income maintenance supports and education and training are the best responses in the long term to the needs and aspirations of Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The world's greatest Treasurer, Mr Keating, once spoke about `a beautiful set of figures'. They were not these figures, because the figures that we have in front of us are a particularly ugly set of figures. I have spoken about them in that way in another context earlier today. They are ugly because they reveal this Government's comprehensive inability to deliver a bright future for the young people of Australia. The young people of Australia have spent their lives listening to excuses, to explanations of why last year's plan has created this year's lost opportunities. I tell this Senate now that the patience of those young people has run out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the past few months I have spoken to thousands of these young people. They are angry; they are angry across the whole country; they are angry because they have a common fear that they are being forced into study or training programs with little prospect of employment after years of subsistence living as a student. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the matters raised by Senator Baume are true and are worthy of our great concern. Of particular concern to me is a problem with the definition of what is employed and, therefore, what is unemployed. If, as Senator Baume says, a person engaging in voluntary work or work experience for as little as one hour a week is regarded as being ineligible for the unemployment benefits that should be paid to such a person, the policy or definition that establishes that idea is stupid. It defies common sense and defies the capacity of a young person to increase his or her employability. </PARA>
<PARA> I also agree that many students are what could be considered as hidden unemployed. On the basis of the accuracy of the statistics issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which I think were compiled by the ABS in household surveys, Senator Giles challenged that. We did not hear a proper exposition of the definition of employed or unemployed. I mean, and common sense dictates, that the hidden unemployed are those who are unwillingly classified as students or as being in the voluntary work force but are really unemployed but not counted as such. They are hidden because they are falsely described as students or voluntary workers. That is what I mean by hidden unemployed and commonsense would agree with that definition. </PARA>
<PARA> The young people who are so affected are not stupid enough to put themselves in that classification and not stupid enough to accept what I previously described as a stupid definition. They are people who know that the process work, the assembly jobs, and the packaging jobs are being exported while we in Australia sit on our hands and watch the ridiculous dismantling of our tariff structures. We are exporting jobs overseas. These young people have quickly understood that this Government has failed in its responsibility to use wisely this country's physical and human resources to guarantee a prosperous future for its youth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At a time when the figures show the greatest increase in monthly unemployment since the series began, the Senate has had to witness today a response from the Government which, I say, has been disgusting.

Then two other backbenchers-Senator Crowley and Senator Giles-came in and attempted to defend the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was surprised to hear Senator Giles say that employment had increased. She is half right. Part time employment has increased but full time jobs have been slashed. That is the disheartening factor about all of this. We are getting under-employment impoverishment. The fact of the matter is that the policies pursued by Senator Giles and persons like her push mothers into the paid work force, and create a situation where families have to rely on two incomes, and perhaps three, to make ends meet. Those are their policies. That is the problem. She and the Government are as guilty of discrimination against women employed not in the paid work force but in the home, and those who, having been forced into the paid work force, are now forced out of it and left for dead by the Government. </PARA>

I seek leave to have a ministerial statement made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) relating to the Royal Commission incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The report I have just tabled is an historic document. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a report which must command the attention not only of the Governments and the Parliaments of Australia but of the nation itself. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commission evolved into an unprecedented national inquiry into the conditions of Australia's indigenous people operating under Letters Patent issued by the Governor-General, Governors in all States, and the Administrator of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The 11 volumes of the Report, ranging over 5,000 pages and containing 339 recommendations, provide an agenda for the nation over the coming decade. </PARA>
<PARA>As Honourable Senators are aware, one of the priority objectives of this Government has been to build a movement of cross-party and community support for initiatives in Aboriginal Affairs. This objective will take on greater significance as Governments across Australia respond to the Royal Commission Report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commission was established on 16 October 1987 and inquired into the deaths of 99 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the custody of police, in prison or in youth detention institutions. It also investigated action taken by authorities subsequent to these deaths. </PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry was established with the support of the Federal Opposition and, as the direct result of the perception of both Aboriginal and nonAboriginal people, that Aboriginal deaths in custody were both far too common and the public explanations too sketchy to discount the possibility of foul play. </PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner James Muirhead QC was requested to report by 31 December 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The huge scale of this task became evident only too soon. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth and State Letters Patent were subsequently amended to increase the number of Commissioners to 5, to extend reporting deadlines and to extend the Royal Commission's jurisdiction to the important social, cultural and legal factors contributing to the deaths. Mr Elliott Johnston QC became National Commissioner in April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>At the outset I would place on record this Government's appreciation of the work of Commissioners Johnston, Muirhead, Wyvill, O'Dea, Dodson, Wootton and their staff. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commission has examined in close detail both the lives and the deaths of the individuals concerned, and the huge range of social and historical factors operating to produce the situations these people faced. Public hearings were held, families were represented by legal counsel, relevant people were interviewed wherever possible, and all aspects of custodial care and legal processes were examined. The views of Aboriginal people were sought, particularly through the work of the Aboriginal Issues Units. Reports on the circumstances of individual deaths have been presented in the relevant jurisdictions and tabled as they became available. </PARA>
<PARA>I know I can speak for the Parliament in expressing on this occasion the deepest sympathy to the relatives of the deceased. </PARA>
<PARA>Although some individual reports recommend consideration of further action against individuals, the Royal Commission's Final Report does not accord with initial expectations of foul play. The Commissioners have not found that any deaths were the result of deliberate unlawful violence or brutality by police or prison officers. To that extent, families and friends in their continuing grief and anger have found the findings of individual reports difficult to accept. But, they cannot, I think, doubt the sincerity, dedication and compassion with which the Commissioners have carried out their task. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, the Report stands as an indictment of the operation of the legal and corrective services system in respect of the most disadvantaged group in Australian society, and of our society itself in allowing that situation to develop and to persist. The Royal Commission finds that there has been a failure to live up to the standard of care owed to those in custody; it has found many system defects and many individual failures to exercise proper care and basic human compassion. </PARA>
<PARA>Particularly prior to the establishment of the Royal Commission, in very few cases were initial investigations into deaths other than perfunctory and limited in focus, leading inevitably to deteriorating relationships between Aboriginal people and the broader community; to increased anguish and cynicism on the part of families and friends; and to neglect of opportunities to avoid future deaths. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report contains an extensive charter of law reform relating to the criminal justice system, police and prison authorities which falls primarily within the responsibility of State and Territory Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>The recommendations range through the full extent of the criminal justice system to include: diversion from police custody; imprisonment as a last resort; reform of police and prison practices; and reform of custodial health and safety practices including a formal recognition of the States' duty of care to those held in custody. The Report also makes wide-ranging recommendations about future post-death investigations and the independent monitoring of deaths in custody. </PARA>
<PARA>On all these issues, I must stress that this Royal Commission Report must not be seen as some prison officer or police bashing exercise. It is not. The Report puts forward constructive and practical proposals for law reform. Significantly, it acknowledges that improvements have already been made in Aboriginal-police relations and puts forward proposals to further advance this process. </PARA>
<PARA>It is vital that Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal organisations such as Aboriginal legal services play a key role in developing these reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to Commissioner Johnston's consideration of the issues underlying Aboriginal deaths in custody. In response to this aspect of its work, the Royal Commission has proposed a transformation of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal community relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>Put simply, too many Aboriginal people are in custody too often. They are over-represented in custody at a rate-calculated nationally-of 29 times that of the general community. In some States this rate is considerably higher. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result Aboriginal people die in custody at rates that have been the focus of international attention. The circumstances of these deaths are set out in Chapter 3 of Volume 1 of the Report. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirty of the 99 deaths resulted from hanging. In those 30 cases, the following objects were among those used for suspension: strips of sheeting, strips of blanket, football socks, a length of electric flex, a belt, the sleeve of a jacket, a shirt, a mattress cover, a shoelace, the sleeve of a cardigan, a bandage, and a pair of jeans. </PARA>
<PARA>Other deaths occurred as the result of shocking self-mutilation such as a razor to the throat and the driving of a paint brush into the eye. </PARA>
<PARA>I give these examples not to sensationalise or shock but to bring to the Senate a sense of the human tragedy which underlies a death in custody. </PARA>
<PARA>The finding that foul play on the part of authorities was not a factor in the deaths in no way diminishes the standing of the Royal Commission or undermines the reasons for its establishment. </PARA>
<PARA>History will record that the Royal Commission has played a vital role in laying open before us the harshness and oppression experienced by so many contemporary Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Consider this damning picture of the lives and deaths of these 99 predominantly young Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>- The average age at death was only 32 years. </PARA>
<PARA>- Of the 99 Aboriginal people who died, 43 had experienced childhood separation from their natural families through intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>- 83 of the 99 were unemployed at the date of their last detention. </PARA>
<PARA>- 43 of the 99 had been charged with an offence at or before the age of 15. </PARA>
<PARA>- Only 2 of the 99 had completed secondary schooling. </PARA>
<PARA>- 43 of the 99 were taken into custody in the period immediately before their deaths on matters directly related to the over-use of alcohol and, in the remaining cases, the Royal Commission concluded that alcohol was a contributing factor in their being taken into custody for the last time. </PARA>
<PARA>- The Royal Commission concluded that the standard of health of the 99-whose average age was 32-varied from poor to very bad. </PARA>
<PARA>The average age of those dying from natural causes was a little over 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA>There are many reasons why I am proud to be Australian but these statistics can be no source of pride for any of us in this Parliament, to any elected representative at any level of Government in the country or to any non-Aboriginal Australian. </PARA>
<PARA>Fundamentally, the disproportionate number of Aboriginal people in custody stems from the underlying factors which bring Aboriginal people into contact with the law in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report finds that the single most significant contributing factor to incarceration is the disadvantaged and unequal position of Aboriginal people in Australian society in every way, whether socially, economically or culturally. </PARA>
<PARA>Much of the National Report, and the associated regional reports, is devoted to demonstrating the existence of that inequality and disadvantage. The Report documents, in a way never before achieved, the impact of European settlement upon Australia's indigenous peoples, their dispossession and subordination within a dominant and often hostile society frequently motivated by self-interest, the development of racist attitudes both overt and hidden and the way in which these attitudes became institutionalised in the very practices of legal, educational, welfare and Aboriginal assistance authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>That these attitudes were themselves the product of a particular time and society, and often well intentioned, does not excuse our society from attempting the task of reconciliation and redressing disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report documents the impact of these things upon the lives of individual people, and the way that impact continues to be felt and demonstrated today, especially where Aboriginal people have lost their way and where despair and hopelessness have been bred of the destruction of Aboriginal culture and the stifling of independence and initiative. The Report demonstrates the close link between this continuing inequality and disadvantage and the refuge sought in alcohol over-use, and high custody rates for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>It refutes at every level the myth sometimes put forward that the special assistance available for Aboriginal people has put them in a position above that enjoyed by other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>It is evident that there are no quick and easy answers to these continuing problems. </PARA>
<PARA>There is, however, one principle which looms large as central to change for Aboriginal people. The Royal Commission describes as fundamental the issues of empowerment and self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA>As a senior and experienced lawyer with considerable knowledge of Aboriginal issues, Commissioner Johnston acknowledges that he had no real idea of the degree of ``pin pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference'' which confronted Aboriginal people in their everyday lives, with no personal control over one's own children, one's employment, personal savings and decisions as to whether to buy a car or other personal belongings. He points out that communities today are still faced with a multiplicity of grants which effectively mean that agendas are being set elsewhere, that assumptions as to what is best for Aboriginal people are made elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner Johnston highlights what he describes as the first prerequisite of the empowerment of Aboriginal society-the will for renewal and for self-determination. He also stresses the important role played by Aboriginal community-based organisations. The role of these organisations is continually emphasised in the recommendations of the Report. </PARA>
<PARA>At every level, control of lives and communities must be in Aboriginal hands, in the same way that non-Aboriginal Australians expect to control their lives and communities. </PARA>
<PARA>For this to happen, the Report makes clear, Aboriginal Australians must themselves have the will and capacity to put an end to their disadvantaged situation, and to take charge of their lives. Commissioner Johnston quotes impressive evidence of the efforts being made all over Australia by Aboriginal organisations and communities, at the local and wider levels, to demonstrate that this can be done, indeed is already being done. Aboriginal people do have the determination and capacity to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA>A prerequisite for Aboriginal self-determination is the creation of conditions which will eliminate the systematic and entrenched disadvantage which permeates every aspect of Aboriginal life. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commission's Report contains detailed and comprehensive recommendations to address that disadvantage which are directed to Governments at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA>Within the time available to me it is obviously not possible to refer to the hundreds of recommendations to Governments directed towards overcoming the continuing and critical disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>However, to convey some understanding of the breadth of those recommendations I note that they include, in no order of priority:</PARA>
<PARA>- A national survey of Aboriginal population and infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>- Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments to develop a system of single block grant funding for Aboriginal communities with a model accounting system.</PARA>
<PARA>- Triennial funding of Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA>- The Commonwealth to negotiate with the States and Territories to achieve the equitable distribution of local government funds to Aboriginal residents, as a condition of funding. </PARA>
<PARA>- The development of codes of practice by media industry and media unions. </PARA>
<PARA>- A progress report on the Australian Law Reform Commission's Customary Law report. </PARA>
<PARA>- The urgent provision of funds to enable implementation of the National Aboriginal Health Strategy (and I note that the Commonwealth has already made a significant additional allocation for this purpose). </PARA>
<PARA>- Review of liquor licensing legislation, notably in the Northern Territory, with a view to reducing the availability of alcohol and meeting the needs of Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA>- Support for the Aboriginal Employment Development Policy, including specific inter-government agreements on objectives and outcomes, and the establishment of a peak industry body and local industry, community and local government groups to promote employment equity in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>- A review and extension of the Community Development Employment Program, including to rural towns with large Aboriginal populations. </PARA>
<PARA>- The Commonwealth to act to provide a right of individual appeal on human rights violations to international committees. </PARA>
<PARA>- Funding be provided to organisations such as Link-Up for the purpose of allowing Aboriginal people to re-establish links with families separated by past Government policies. </PARA>
<PARA>- The establishment of a national task force on alcohol abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>- An urgent requirement for Governments and Aboriginal organisations to negotiate to devise strategies for Aboriginal youth to reduce the rate at which Aboriginal juveniles are involved in the welfare and criminal justice systems. </PARA>
<PARA>- Aboriginal communities to be given equitable access to ongoing expenditure by the Commonwealth, State, Territory and local authorities on roads. </PARA>
<PARA>- The Department of Employment, Education and Training be responsible for the development of a comprehensive national strategy designed to improve opportunities for the education and training of those in custody. </PARA>
<PARA>- High priority be accorded to the development of social, economic and cultural development plans by Aboriginal communities on a local and a regional basis. </PARA>
<PARA>- Recognition that the success of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy will depend on the success of pre-schooling initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>- The establishment of a small unit of Aboriginal people from Northern Australia to study the means of achieving greater self-sufficiency in remote northern communities. </PARA>
<PARA>- The implementation of a strategy for the training of Aboriginal people to build and maintain essential community infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>- All jurisdictions, where this has not already occurred, to provide a comprehensive means of addressing the land needs of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to the critical issue of the process to be adopted by Governments in responding to the Royal Commission Report. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia has a commendable international human rights record and acknowledges that human rights issues are of international concern. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs acknowledged at the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations in Geneva last August that the Government is aware that the Working Group, Amnesty International and other international non-government organisations will be monitoring the implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>In a very real sense the world is watching. </PARA>
<PARA>However, our motivation in ensuring a co-ordinated and comprehensive national response to the Royal Commission's Report will not be, and should not be, international scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the historic and comprehensive nature of the Royal Commission Report, and our commitment as Australians to a fair go for all, which should drive us to ensure such a response. As a nation we must not squander the opportunity presented by the Royal Commission's Report to act on an agenda of reform in Aboriginal Affairs for the coming decade. </PARA>
<PARA>Prior to receiving the Royal Commission's Report the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs had already indicated his predisposition to support an open and publicly accountable process to monitor the response of all Governments to the Report. </PARA>
<PARA>He was, therefore, gratified that the very first recommendation of the Report proposes a public and comprehensive reporting process by the Commonwealth, States and Territories in consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner Johnston also stresses the need for extensive consultation with and involvement of Aboriginal people in the implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a matter of the utmost importance for me to emphasise that the Royal Commission Report does not impact solely on the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio at any level of Government. The Recommendations are addressed to the whole range of Government departments at Commonwealth, State, and Territory levels. </PARA>
<PARA>It will be necessary, therefore, for there to be a response from the whole of Government in each Commonwealth, State and Territory jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>I report to the Senate that the Prime Minister has asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to assume responsibility for co-ordinating the Commonwealth Government response across all portfolios, supported by the Aboriginal Reconciliation Unit within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Senators, this Report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody demands careful consideration by all Governments. Its recommendations have implications for a range of government activities, from Australia's international obligations down to the everyday contacts of individual police, prison, hospital or welfare officers with Aboriginal people and for every Australian. I do not pretend that all the changes proposed can happen quickly, even though a number of recommendations may be capable of relatively rapidly implementation. The recommendations reflect the linkages between many areas of policy affecting Aboriginal people, and point to the need for co-ordinated action between and within Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has already set in train a process for consideration of the Report which acknowledges the status of the Royal Commission as a joint Commonwealth-State investigation, and the overlapping nature of responsibilities in many areas. The Prime Minister has written to Premiers and Chief Ministers of every State and Territory seeking their co-operation in a joint strategy of response. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will be meeting with Ministers from those portfolios most immediately concerned in the near future to discuss the implications of the Report and to agree on a timetable for implementation. The need for empowerment is at the heart of many Recommendations, and Governments will need to allow adequate time for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves to consider the Report and formulate a response. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to what is the final and perhaps the most important Recommendation of the Report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I appeal to all Senators and to the wider community to give this section of the Report deep consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>As Honourable Senators would be aware, last December the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs issued a Discussion Paper as the basis of future legislation to enable our nation to embark on a process of reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, it has been a fundamental objective of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to create a climate of cross-party co-operation in and community support for significant progress in Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>He was, for this reason, delighted by the final Recommendation of the Royal Commission Report which states:</PARA>
<PARA>``that all political leaders and parties recognise that reconciliation between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities in Australia must be achieved if community division, discord and injustice to Aboriginal people are to be avoided. To this end the Commission recommends that political leaders use their best endeavours to ensure bi-partisan public support for the process of reconciliation and that the urgency and necessity of the process be acknowledged.''</PARA>
<PARA>In discussing the framework of the Report and the other Recommendations in the Report, the Royal Commission describes the reconciliation process as ``the fundamental backdrop to reform and change.'' The Royal Commission further states that reconciliation of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities must be an essential commitment of all sides if change is to be genuine and long term. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Royal Commission observes, the process of reconciliation proposed by the Government will have as a principal focus the need to educate nonAboriginal Australians about the cultures of Australia's indigenous peoples and the treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by European settlers and their descendants. This sad history-which includes the dispossession and dispersal of Aboriginal people, confinement in reserves, removal of children from their families and the destruction of much Aboriginal culture-needs to be recognised as a primary cause of the current disadvantaged position of Australia's indigenous peoples. All Australians need to understand this country's past and the place of Aboriginal people in it. This would have the objective not of creating guilt, but of building compassion and empathy for Aboriginal people and their disadvantaged position in society, as well as appreciation of Aboriginal cultures and achievements, and the unique position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the indigenous peoples of this continent. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commission recognises, as does the Government, four key issues essential to the process of reconciliation:</PARA>
<PARA>- the taking of concrete measures to tackle disadvantage and establish self-determination as being essential building blocks of the process of reconciliation;</PARA>
<PARA>- the reconciliation process must have cross-party support and support from Aboriginal people;</PARA>
<PARA>- the focus should concentrate on the process of reconciliation and not on a document or instrument which might be one of the outcomes; and</PARA>
<PARA>- the process should not be impeded by either Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal people setting pre-conditions in advance. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report suggests that, if we are to remove the cause of distrust and enmity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people and build good community relations, we must not only eliminate existing disadvantage but also recognise Aboriginal rights, cultures and traditions. This process of reconciliation must carry with it a complete rejection of the concepts of superiority and inferiority which have informed Australian society over the past 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Importantly, the Royal Commission's Report emphasises the extent of past cross-party co-operation in Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report traces the history of Aboriginal Affairs policy and recognises that the first step in the reconciliation process-and the one which received the clearest endorsement from the Australian people-was the 1967 referendum. </PARA>
<PARA>In the words of Commissioner Johnston, ``since 1967 there has been an evolution of thought on the part of non-Aboriginal Australians which has been reflected in the actions of successive Commonwealth Governments irrespective of party composition.''</PARA>
<PARA>In the final chapter of the Report, the Royal Commission chronicles in some detail the changes which have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report also recognises the widespread community support which, at the time of writing, had already been forthcoming for the process of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA>I can report to the Senate that the groundswell of support for the reconciliation process has continued with endorsement coming from a wide range of Aboriginal organisations and individuals as well as from diverse sections of the non-Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a responsibility on the occasion of the tabling of this Report to invite the Opposition to join with the rest of the Australian Parliament and give unanimous backing to the proposal for the Process of Reconciliation endorsed by the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>I embrace wholeheartedly the concluding aspiration of the Royal Commission, that ``in the end, perhaps together, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, the situation can be reached where this ancient, subtly creative Aboriginal culture exists in friendship alongside the non-Aboriginal culture. Such an achievement would be a matter of pride not only for all Australians but for all humankind.''</PARA>
<PARA>If Australia, as a nation, had been able to achieve this recognition and reconciliation before this date, these tragic deaths may have been prevented. We might have been able to spare families the suffering they have experienced.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not too late, however, for other deaths to be prevented. The Royal Commissioners have given us their insights, their advice and a clear direction for change. </PARA>
<PARA>The families of those who have died, and indeed all Australians, have a right to expect that governments at all levels and of all political persuasions will act together to ensure that change takes place. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the ministerial statement that have been presented to the Senate today are indeed historic documents. They are also very disturbing documents and they contain issues and matters that should preoccupy the attention of this Senate, this Parliament, State parliaments, the Parliament of the Northern Territory, and the Parliament of the Australian Capital Territory for some time and in some considerable depth. They demand close attention by anyone who is involved in public administration and in ensuring that community relations continue to operate in a satisfactory and impartial manner throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we talk about deaths in custody it is very easy to put the problem aside because the preoccupation in the media on this issue in the past number of years has dealt almost exclusively with deaths in custody of Aboriginal people. It would be very concerning if, because of the depth of this particular inquiry, the attention it has received and the information that is in the document presented here today, which all relate to the deaths of Aboriginal people, that was the entire focus of policy changes and revisions in the next few years. We must be aware that there are deaths in custody of other members of the community as well as those of Aboriginal people. We need to state from the outset that this issue, whilst it is terribly important to the Aboriginal community in Australia, is a much wider problem and should not be dealt with exclusively as an Aboriginal problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the particular report and document that have been presented today will not just get filed away in parliamentary libraries or become documents that are suitable for academic research in future or for public service departments and bureaucracies to quote back at us from time to time when they want justification for a line of expenditure in a Government department. It is very easy to hide issues such as this and to ease our conscience by knowing that there is a significant report and, knowing that the report is there, to put it aside knowing that someone else will deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of preparing this report for this Parliament is $31m. That is an extremely high cost for the value. Unfortunately, I believe, like many other senators and many other people that, when the report was instigated a number of years ago, a number of us stood back and said that there would be a certain predictability about the recommendations that would arise, that nothing new would be learnt and that, essentially, the problem for the Aboriginal community was alcohol related. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, all those things are true. The predictability of what has emerged in the recommendations was well stated before the inquiry got under way. I have been unable to glean anything new from an initial reading of the ministerial statement or from a cursory glance at the 11 volumes of the report. Certainly, the relationship between alcohol and the problem has been acknowledged in the ministerial statement. We are told on page 4:</PARA>
<PARA>Forty-three of the 99 were taken into custody in the period immediately before their deaths on matters directly related to the overuse of alcohol and, in the remaining cases, the Royal Commission concluded that alcohol was a contributing factor in their being taken into custody for the last time. </PARA>
<PARA>What a damning statement of the problem in our community. There is a recognition that, for every one of the 99 cases that were investigated by this inquiry, alcohol was found to be either a primary cause or an associated cause of the death of the person. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the report has always looked at the issue from the perspective of the Aboriginal victim. I hope that when we have the time to look through the 11 volumes, we will try to assess their contents from the basis of looking at the wider issues in the community generally. Certainly, there are issues concerning the past treatment of members of the Aboriginal society in Australia over the past 200 years. These issues have been recognised and picked up by the various Commissioners who have looked at this report. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to highlight the fact that, after spending $31m of taxpayers' money on a major inquiry of this nature, it is very interesting to note that the reports have concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Although some individual reports recommend consideration of further action against individuals, the Royal Commission's Final Report does not accord with initial expectations of foul play. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that the Commissioners were able to identify the finding that no deaths were the result of deliberate, unlawful violence or brutality by police or by prison officers is something that we need to recognise. We must recognise that through the course and conduct of this inquiry the police or apprehending authorities were often taken to be the guilty parties. The media concentration on the role of the police was in fact far too extensive and far too problematic in proposing what the issues really were. </PARA>
<PARA> There are over 300 recommendations in this report. They range through the full extent of the criminal justice system, and include: diversion from police custody, imprisonment as a last resort, the reform of the police and prison practices and the reform of custodial, health and safety practices, including a formal recognition of the State's duty of care to those held in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, this whole report highlights the extent of the human tragedy. Not only the Federal Government but State and Territory governments must look closely at each and every recommendation and quickly define where the areas of responsibility must lie. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in my opening remarks, it is interesting to note that the Minister has set out in his statement a series of pictures with regard to the 99 deaths. The average age at death was only 32 years. Of the 99 Aboriginal people who died, 43 had experienced childhood separation from their natural family; 83 of the 99 were unemployed at the date of their last detention; 43 of the 99 had been charged with an offence at or before the age of 15; and only 2 of the 99 had completed secondary education. I highlighted the point earlier that all 99 deaths were in some way alcohol related. The Royal Commission concluded that the standard of health of the 99, whose average age was 32, varied from poor to very bad. </PARA>
<PARA> If a similar study was done of all deaths in custody across Australia, we would probably find that conclusions of a similar sociological pattern of definition would be drawn. Therefore, the Aboriginal community should not be identified and singled out as having problems peculiar just to deaths in the Aboriginal community. I believe that a study of deaths in custody in the Australian community would also show a similar pattern in relation to problems relating to the person who committed suicide or died in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some reservations about a couple of areas in the ministerial statement that was made today. The Minister seems to be concluding that there is a need for more bureaucracy. We are told that the need to address land rights or the land needs of Aboriginal people is crucial to solving this problem. Towards the end of the ministerial statement, the Minister also says that the issue of a treaty or the issue of an instrument of reconciliation seems to be a way in which the problem can be addressed. That is not the only issue that needs to be addressed. There should not be a preoccupation with limited views that will solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Those issues on their own will not solve the problem. They are not the major issues. Land rights, bureaucracy and phoney treaties will not result in fewer deaths of Aboriginal people in custody. Those issues must be taken into account in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio, but people should not conclude that simply pursuing those areas as a matter of policy will achieve a lower rate of Aboriginal deaths in custody. I come back to the strong statement that was made with regard to the alcohol problem. It is interesting to make a comparison between Aboriginal deaths and other deaths of people whilst in police custody. A number of studies were done on this several years ago. As I said, very similar patterns emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> As parliamentarians, we have to question whether the same result could have been achieved with less expenditure. The amount of $31.802m is a high price to pay for a report that has been tabled in this place. There has been a degree of predictability in the resulting recommendations in terms of the need for change in the Aboriginal community-in lifestyle, in health, in education and in welfare; in relation to all of the issues that contribute to Aboriginal deaths in custody. Probably at least some $25m of that $31m has been wasted, in my view, and would not have resulted in one less death. </PARA>
<PARA> I know I am harping on the issue of Aborigines and alcohol, but I believe that this is the most important and fundamental issue to be addressed if we want to guarantee that there will be fewer deaths. I quote from the editorial of the Australian of 15 April 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>Alcohol is killing the Aborigines. Drunk Aborigines, most often men, are killing each other. Men abandon the wives and children of the ` `dry'' communities of the north for the alcohol-flush towns. Or else sly grog seeps into the communities. Too many Aborigines are perpetrators and victims of violent crime. Their health ruined, their families and tribal discipline in disarray, too many Aborigines are dying young. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on, the editorial says:</PARA>
<PARA>The statistics are stark. In Alice Springs, where 25,000 people live, perhaps 6000 of them Aboriginal, 7000 people were detained for drunkenness in 1988. Last year, 12,770 were detained. Last year, too, there were 12 murders in the town. All involved Aborigines and alcohol. In the Alice, a person is seven times more likely to be murdered than killed on the road. The victim is likely to be Aboriginal and-the figures show quite clearly-so is the killer. Across the nation, Aborigines in their young adulthood through to middle age face mortality rates up to 10 times higher than those of other Australians. Alcohol must bear much of the blame. </PARA>
<PARA>Errol Simper's article entitled `Toll soars in battle of the bottle' in the Australian of 13 April 1991 reports the Assistant Commissioner of the Alice Springs police force, Andy McNeill, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Most of our work involves alcohol and Aborigines. Sexual assaults, criminal damage, drink-driving, stolen vehicles, prowlers, excessive noise. I'm afraid the bulk of it is attributable to drunken Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA>I represent the Northern Territory and the dilemma of this problem worries me daily. I am related to Aborigines. I have Aboriginal nephews and a niece. Because some 25 per cent of my electorate is exposed to this problem and all the other associated areas, I cannot walk away from it. The evil is alcohol. Whether we relate it to deaths in custody or to Senator Richardson's portfolio of Social Security, from where the basic primary income of Aboriginal families is derived, we do need to look at the policies that impact in so many of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I am critical that Senator Richardson has, with the wipe of a hand, walked away from looking at reasonable changes and the way in which money is paid through the social welfare system in Aboriginal communities, which is so necessary to the well-being and lifestyle of Aboriginal people. But the majority of the cash ends up often being spent on grog and results in the custody of Aboriginal people and the death of Aboriginal people. Unless we get back to some of those fundamental areas of change that are so necessary, although this report and the various commissioners have commented across the whole range, I am concerned that there seems to be a preoccupation in the report with policies for indigenous people, with fundamental changes that will not result in the necessary support systems for social areas that need so much change. </PARA>
<PARA> This report, as I said at the outset, is terribly important. It has cost us an arm and a leg. It has cost the Aboriginal community not just the 99 deaths that have been investigated but many more than that. The number of Aboriginal people who die in custody is small compared to the number that die in hospitals, hostels, homes and humpies, yet we have had as a focus of attention in the media for the last decade this constant preoccupation with the criminal system and the penal system. It is much wider than that; it is out in the community. There are many more fundamental problems underlying all of the issues that I do not believe this $31m report has gone anywhere near addressing. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we all must accept a degree of responsibility for the past, we must also look to the future and guarantee that Aborigines are not, by the policies we make, being locked into the nineteenth century. That is where the preoccupation with treaties, land rights and spirituality issues, which also arose yesterday in the debate on the report of the Resource Assessment Commission, would tend to take the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The young Aboriginal people in my constituency, hundreds of whom I meet every month, and in the communities that I walk around, want to participate fully in two cultures: in their own inherited culture and in the society in which they are presently placed. They want to live with dignity and integrity in the twenty-first century. Nothing is going to come from cocooning people in the past. I am concerned that the Minister's statement does not pick up this challenge with sufficient priority or urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I offer my congratulations to the main author of the national report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, Commissioner Elliott Johnston, QC, the other commissioners, Muirhead, Wyvill, O'Dea, Dodson, Wootten, and their staff, for the production of this historic document. We owe them a great debt of gratitude for providing us with a master plan for the conduct of Aboriginal affairs in this country as we approach the centenary of Federation. As a master plan, this report is comprehensive, fair, positive and constructive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have done some postgraduate studies in Aboriginal history and Aboriginal education. I have read some excellent books on Aboriginal issues. However, this report could replace the majority of well thumbed text books in its depth of understanding and its positive suggestions for future action. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset, I make a plea for all of us as human beings, for all governments at all levels, to take this opportunity to build upon this $30m investment in Australia's future. Contrary to Senator Tambling's view, I take the view that $30m is a small investment in social cohesion, equality and justice. </PARA>
<PARA> We paid a high price in Queensland for the Fitzgerald inquiry and we are in the process of doubling our return on that investment in far-reaching changes to basic institutional structures. </PARA>
<PARA> The report established that a major reason for Aboriginal deaths in custody is the grossly disproportionate rate at which Aboriginal people are taken into custody. It is more than 20 times the rate for non-Aboriginal people. But the report goes on to highlight that, although something can be and is being done to reduce this rate by law reform and changes in policing strategies, there are still issues underlying the alienation of Aboriginal people and their continuing conflict with the law which cannot be solved by police and Aboriginal people alone. I quote from the preface of volume one of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>The key is to be found in the hearts and minds of all Australians. It lies in the recognition of the Aboriginal people as a distinct people, the indigenous people of Australia who were cruelly dispossessed of their land and until recent times denied respect as human beings and the opportunity to re-establish themselves on an equal basis.</PARA>
<PARA> I was most interested to note that Commissioner Muirhead, at the outset of the Royal Commission, announced that he saw his job as being not merely to understand how each person died-which may simply be of alcohol related causes-but why that person died. Thus this investigation into the deaths of 99 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the custody of police, in prison or in youth detention institutions was extremely thorough. In Commissioner Muirhead's words, `No effort was spared to get to the truth'. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only the cause of death but all aspects of custodial care and the orders binding on custodians were critically examined. It is important to raise, as others have, the fact that the commissioners did not find that the deaths were the product of deliberate violence or brutality by police or prison officers, but did find that generally there appeared to be little appreciation of and less dedication to the duty of care owed by custodial authorities and their officers to persons in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> The commissioners found many system defects in relation to care, many failures to exercise proper care, and in general a poor standard of care. The commissioners acknowledged that deaths in such circumstances breed anguish and suspicion. I join with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) in making a public expression of sympathy to the relatives of the deceased. I hope that this most thorough and open process of inquiry will have helped to allay those suspicions. </PARA>
<PARA> This inquiry has been unique in Australia's history because of its comprehensiveness and because the whole range of societal and historical factors which impact on Aboriginal lives came into focus from the many investigations into the deaths of so many of them which occurred whilst ostensibly under the care and protection of the State. I now turn to some of those societal and historical factors. </PARA>
<PARA> I go firstly to role of history. I share the view of Commissioner Johnston that little of Aboriginal history is known to non-Aboriginal people. A knowledge of any people's history is a key factor in assisting an understanding of those people. What we are now is not isolated from where we began. Many Australians know that Aboriginal people were dispossessed of their land without benefit of a treaty, agreement or compensation, but most of them do not know of the widespread violence and brutality associated with that dispossession. Our school textbooks did not consider that to be relevant history. </PARA>
<PARA> From this history, many things flow which are of central importance to the issue of this ministerial statement. The first thing is the deliberate and systematic disempowerment of Aboriginal people, starting with their land and proceeding to almost every aspect of their lives. They were made dependent upon government or non-Aboriginal pastoralists or other employers for every basic human need-for rations, clothing and living places. Decisions were made about them, for them, and imposed upon them. The extent of control of their lives seems incredible today, yet I can still remember the incredulity and shared outrage I felt about 15 years ago when an Aboriginal friend of mine in Queensland could not visit a relative on a reserve because the superintendent would not give her permission. </PARA>
<PARA> A knowledge of the history of the pattern of State intervention in and control of Aboriginal lives assists us to understand how a loss of independence leads to a loss of self-esteem. It helps us to avoid the convenient response of blaming the victim or blaming alcohol. I agree with Commissioner Johnston when he says that what is remarkable and what must command the respect and admiration of fair-minded people is that Aboriginal society survived all the assaults upon it. In addressing the symptom of the disproportionate number of Aboriginal people in custody, Commissioner Johnston highlights the more fundamental question-the empowerment and self-determination of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner outlines three essential prerequisites to the empowerment of Aboriginal society: the will to renewal and to self-determination; the role of the broader society; and the policy of self-determination. With respect to the first of these prerequisites, I have just returned from an site inspection of Cape York and Thursday Island by a subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We visited the Injinoo, New Mapoon, Umagico, Seisia, Bamaga and Thursday Island communities. In each case I am confident that the enthusiasm, the determination and the will to take control of their own lives which was evident will continue to grow. It is my view that recent local government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission elections have had a significant role to play in this feeling of empowerment at the local level. </PARA>
<PARA> The second prerequisite is the role of the broader society. I think Commissioner Johnston issues a real challenge to us here: a challenge to avoid simplistic assertions about alcohol, for example; a challenge to understand why our support of this process is necessary; a challenge not to retreat into hysterical stereotypical responses at the mere mention of Aboriginal people and land. </PARA>
<PARA> We must acknowledge that the economic base of Aboriginal people was completely destroyed by their being dispossessed of their lands. Their treatment since then has been such that, except to a limited extent in recent times, it has been quite impossible for them to achieve any economic base. That is why our support and government initiatives to legislate that support in respect of land is crucial and totally relevant to the issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> Here I make a brief comment about what is happening in my home State of Queensland. In one of his final reports on individual deaths, Commissioner Lew Wyvill says that the relationship between the Aboriginal community and land is `seen to be fundamental to their well-being'. He says that people in the Lockhart River community, where one of the deaths occurred, have been experiencing sudden and multiple pressures on their traditional relationships with land from development proposals for tourism, mining, space base development and freeholding and from already established restrictions on their hunting and gathering and on other uses of national parks. Part of the re-empowering process must involve the restoration to them of the power to draw upon those resources that come from their traditional attachment to the land. </PARA>
<PARA> The third prerequisite to the empowerment of Aboriginal people that Commissioner Johnston mentioned is self- determination-having in place an established method, a procedure whereby the broader society can supply the assistance I have referred to and the Aboriginal society can receive it, whilst at the same time maintaining its independent status and without a welfare dependent position being established between the two groups. Self-determination means that Aboriginal people determine their own priorities and set their own agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> I was most interested in Commissioner Dodson's words on this aspect of the report. Commissioner Dodson stresses that after what has happened to Aboriginal society people need space, time and distance to think out very carefully what they want to do with their own communities and their lives. He speaks of the need for a maturing of the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people; a deeper understanding of how each sees the other and why; and a bringing out of the common ground between us-the centrality of being human beings. </PARA>
<PARA> Commissioner Dodson suggests that, as Aboriginal people need time, space and distance for thinking through their position, perhaps non-Aboriginal Australia also needs to take some time to think through its position in relation to Aboriginal people and to ask ourselves whether we have not stereotyped Aboriginal people, whether as noble savages, scroungers, horsemen, childlike persons, servants or people addicted to alcohol. In the ultimate, self-determination is basically about people having the right to make decisions concerning their own lives and their own communities, the right to retain their culture and to develop it. </PARA>
<PARA> The report makes 339 recommendations and I can say that I have read them. The Minister has listed many of them and I will highlight others which are of importance to me. The fact that some of the recommendations are predictable, as Senator Tambling implied, merely underlines the fact that we have failed to tackle the fundamental issues in Aboriginal affairs over the past two decades in particular. It is absolutely superficial to isolate alcohol as a cause. Alcohol, and the resort to alcohol, is merely a symptom of fundamental causes such as the dispossession of an entire people. I turn now to some of the recommendations. The very first recommendation is an interesting one. The Commissioner recommends:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government and State and Territory Governments, in consultation with ATSIC, agree upon a process which ensures that the adoption or otherwise of recommendations and the implementation of the adopted recommendations will be reported upon on a regular basis with respect to progress on a Commonwealth, State and Territory basis.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, let us act on these recommendations; let us not lose them yet again; and let us report back to parliaments not less than annually. Other recommendations include:</PARA>
<PARA> That police standing orders or instructions provide specific directions as to the conduct of investigations into the circumstances of a death in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> That Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments provide access to all government archival records pertaining to the family and community histories of Aboriginal people so as to assist the process of enabling Aboriginal people to re-establish community and family links with those people from whom they were separated as a result of past policies of government. </PARA>
<PARA> That government and funding bodies reflect the importance of the National Aboriginal Language Policy in the provision of funds to Aboriginal communities and organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> That Police Services take all possible steps to eliminate:</PARA>
<PARA>a. Violent or rough treatment or verbal abuse of Aboriginal persons, including women and young people, by police officers; and</PARA>
<PARA>b. The use of racist or offensive language, or the use of racist or derogatory comments in log books and other documents by police officers.</PARA>
<PARA>When such conduct is found to have occurred, it should be treated as a serious breach of discipline. </PARA>
<PARA> That Aboriginal people be involved at every level in the development, implementation and interpretation of research into the patterns, causes and consequences of Aboriginal alcohol use and in the application of the results of that research. </PARA>
<PARA> That in responding to truancy the primary principle to be followed by Government agencies be to provide support, in collaboration with appropriate Aboriginal individuals and organisations, to the juvenile and to those responsible for the care of the juvenile; such support to include addressing the cultural and social factors identified by the juvenile and by those responsible for the care of the juvenile as being relevant to the truancy. </PARA>
<PARA> That the provision of housing and infrastructure to Aboriginal people in remote and discrete communities, including the design and location of houses, take account of their cultural perceptions of the use of living space, and that budgetary allocations include provision for appropriate architectural and town planning advice to, and consultation with, the serviced community. </PARA>
<PARA> That, in jurisdictions where drunkenness has not been decriminalized, governments should legislate to abolish the offence of public drunkenness. </PARA>
<PARA> That legislation decriminalizing drunkenness should place a statutory duty upon police to consider and utilize alternatives to the detention of intoxicated persons in police cells. Alternatives should include the options of taking the intoxicated person home or to a facility established for the care of intoxicated persons. </PARA>
<PARA> That governments which have not already done so should legislate to enforce the principle that imprisonment should be utilized only as a sanction of last resort.</PARA>
<PARA>There are many recommendations to the effect that units of Aboriginal history should be included in media studies, in school curricula, in police training units and in courses for journalists. I want to turn to the final recommendation. Recommendation 339 states:</PARA>
<PARA> That all political leaders and their parties recognize that reconciliation between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities in Australia must be achieved if community division, discord and injustice to Aboriginal people are to be avoided. To this end the Commission recommends that political leaders use their best endeavours to ensure bi-partisan public support for the process of reconciliation and that the urgency and necessity of the process be acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats acknowledge that urgency and necessity. We accept the Commission's description of the reconciliation process as the fundamental backdrop to reform and change. We have publicly supported the Government's initiation of such a process and we acknowledge how crucial cross-party support is to the success of this process. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal people have been dispossessed; that is a fact. Aboriginal people have been imprisoned at a disproportionate rate; that is a fact. Ninety-nine Aboriginal and Islander people have died whilst in prison, in custody or in youth detention centres; that too is a fact. Aboriginal and Islander people have a right to know why this has happened and they have a right to expect that such an incidence of death will not continue. </PARA>
<PARA> This report gives such answers and assurances for constructive action. Aboriginal people do not expect us to walk around with our heads hung in shame, but they do expect us to acknowledge our role in their past and their right to control their own future. It is with this in mind that I conclude with the moving words of Commissioner Johnston in the preface to volume 1 of this report:</PARA>
<PARA>If other Australians can, in a spirit of justice and humanity, accord Aboriginal people this recognition, give them freedom to determine their own future and find their own place as a distinct people within Australian society, and provide them with the resources that are necessary to overcome the handicaps they suffer as a result of what has happened in the past, there can be hope of a freely negotiated reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Then there may be an end to the situation where so many Aboriginal people live and die in custody. </PARA>
<PARA>It is my view that Aboriginal people are entitled to that hope. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody involves problems that we, as a nation, really must try to resolve. One of the problems that emerges from this report is that our honesty, in examining our problems in public, creates an increasing perception internationally that we are a racist and intolerant nation. We are even equated by some people with apartheid in South Africa, particularly as a result of the activities of some extremist activists. This report is largely about perceptions. It is about perceptions of injustices and it is about attitudes. It is an important report in relation to perceptions in the sense that it is seen to have examined the problems of black deaths.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that there has been political bipartisan support for firstly, the inquiry itself and secondly, for the search for solutions to what is, in so many instances, a disastrous problem. It is important to establish first of all that in this report-which, as I said, is to a large extent about perceptions as well as providing a whole range of possible actions that may be taken-the commissioners have not found that any deaths were the result of deliberate, unlawful violence or brutality by police or prison officers. This report is not a police or prison officer bashing exercise and any attempts to either paint it as such or use it as such must be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Royal Commission did find that there had been a failure to live up to the standards of care owed to those in custody. It found many system defects and many individual failures to exercise proper care and basic human compassion. That, I understand, is equally true of white prisoners and so to that extent it is a general problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission noted that, prior to its establishment, in very few cases initial investigations into deaths in custody were other than perfunctory and limited in focus, leading inevitably to deteriorating relationships between Aboriginal people and the broader community, to increased anguish and cynicism on the part of family and friends, and to the neglect of opportunities to avoid future deaths. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one of the problems of perception that this report has helped to resolve, and I hope that it has. I hope that the Aboriginal community will read this report and look at it in that sense and not take the view, as some people have, that this is some kind of cover-up. In other words, we have two extremes of potential attitude. One is that it is a police and prison bashing exercise, and the other that it is a white cover-up. I believe that this report is very important. The fact that it acknowledges that improvements have already taken place in Aboriginal-police relations is also important. I hope that everyone involved-the whole of the Australian community-will seriously look at the proposals that are aimed at resolving the problem of Aboriginal deaths in custody which, quite frankly, stems from the fact that there are too many Aboriginal people in custody too often, as the Minister said in his tabling statement. There is no doubt that the causes of this relate to a status in society. Low status, low self-esteem, leads to these problems involving a higher proportion of Aboriginal people than whites being in custody in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that it is important to see, as the Commission has established, the extent of the disadvantage of the 99 people whose deaths were investigated. Quite apart from the questions of childhood separation and so on which were raised by Senator Kernot, the facts are that: 83 of the 99 Aboriginals were unemployed at the date of their last detention; 43 had been charged with an offence at or before the age of 15; only two had completed secondary schooling; 43 were taken into custody in the period immediately before their deaths on matters directly related to the overuse of alcohol; and in all the remaining cases the Royal Commission concluded that alcohol was a contributing factor in their being taken into custody for the last time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling dealt at some length with the question of alcohol abuse. The big question that arises is whether alcohol is the cause or the result of the problem. Is it the consequence or the cause of the disaster? That is a problem for which there is no ready, simple answer. We cannot say, `Okay, all that has to be done is to wipe out alcohol and all will be resolved'. If the basic cause of the problem is a loss of self-esteem, another method of salving the hurt of that loss presumably will be sought. On the other hand, there is a clear relationship between alcohol and every one of the problems outlined in the deaths of these 99 people. It is ludicrous to pretend that alcohol has nothing to do with the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The royal commissioners say that the single most significant contributing factor to incarceration is the disadvantaged and unequal position of Aboriginal people in Australian society in every way, whether socially, economically or culturally. I think that leads to another question. Is it possible to remove that inequity for people who prefer to live a tribal existence away from what so many consider to be the marks of advantage in our society? There is a clear question that needs to be resolved. Is there a conflict between a traditional, tribal lifestyle and the factors that are seen as being of importance and of advantage in the Australian community? As I stressed earlier, there is no simple solution. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that it all stems from the dispossession, by the settlers, of the Aboriginal people is a matter that has gone and which cannot be resolved. As the report says, the Aboriginal people have lost their way, and despair and hopelessness have been bred of the destruction of Aboriginal culture and the stifling of independence and initiative. Does that mean that they are gone forever, or that there are ways of resolving it? One would hope that emerging out of this report there will be ways of resolving that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> However, one of the ways of resolving it is not simply by throwing money at it. That is one of the interesting points made in this report. The Commissioner points out that communities today are still faced with a multiplicity of grants which effectively mean that agendas are being set elsewhere and that assumptions about what is best for Aboriginal people are made elsewhere. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interjection was that that is precisely what ATSIC is doing . The question is much more complicated than that, in the sense that there were large sections of the Aboriginal community who found that that solution was not the one they wanted. The more we look at the report the more we see how difficult it is to find appropriate solutions. As the report makes clear-and the Minister refers to this in his tabling statement-Aboriginal Australians must themselves have the will and capacity to put an end to their disadvantaged situation and take charge of their lives. The disaster is that they cannot do that while dominated by alcohol, while alcohol plays such an enormous role in so many of the problem areas of Aboriginal life-not over the whole of Aboriginal life, but over that part of it which is dealt with in this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What bothers me is that while the report says that Aboriginal people should take greater control of their lives, indeed that they should take charge of their lives, the report recognises that there will be a need for external control because it calls for a review of liquor licensing legislation, notably in the Northern Territory, with a view to reducing the availability of alcohol and meeting the needs of Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA> A clear example of the difficulties to be faced can be found where the commissioners say, on the one hand, that there must be greater capacity and freedom for the groups to look after themselves and, on the other hand, that we must take a paternalistic view about liquor licensing regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that interjection. However, having an Aboriginal commissioner does not mean that the Aboriginal people will then have control of their own destinies. I am just using this as a clear example of the sorts of problems that emerge in trying to resolve a massively difficult situation. No matter what some Democrats think, there is no simple, easy answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The nature of the problem tends to be underlined in the hundreds of detailed and comprehensive recommendations that the Commissioner has made in his report. One recommendation that I totally support is the establishment of a national task force on alcohol abuse. I would hope that something will be done and is capable of being done. But I underline the fact that it cannot be done without the support, will and determination of the Aboriginal people themselves in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I very much agree with the Minister's response to the Commissioner's report that as a nation we must not squander the opportunity presented by the report to act on an agenda of reform in Aboriginal affairs for the coming decade. That does not necessarily mean that in all instances we should blindly accept the Government's agenda. There is no doubt that there has been a very considerable level of bipartisanship. </PARA>
<PARA> But the process of reconciliation-which the Commissioner says is the fundamental backdrop of reform and change-may have many forms. There is certainly scope for different views about how to do it. For example, some people feel that an instrument of reconciliation is what is required. Others take the view that an instrument of reconciliation will divide the society more than unite it. Once again, this is a major problem. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Commissioner points out, the sad history of dispossession and so on needs to be recognised by all Australians as the primary cause of the current disadvantaged position of Australia's indigenous peoples. As he says, all Australians need to understand that the objective should be not to create guilt but to build compassion and empathy for Aboriginal people and their disadvantaged position in society. That should not lead us to the view that the Aboriginal people should not of themselves show a determination to assist in emerging from that disadvantaged position. That is why I would certainly be a strong supporter of increased participation by Aboriginals in determining their own fate on as many issues as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the Commissioner and his report are clearly less enthusiastic than the Government has been about creating a document or instrument of reconciliation. The report says that the focus should concentrate on the process of reconciliation and not on a document or instrument, which might be one of the outcomes. I must say that I agree very strongly with that. I would hope that the Government would not seek to impose upon the Parliament and the Opposition, in terms of seeking to maintain a bipartisan approach, some document or instrument which the Commissioner has said really should not be the main element of the process of reconciliation, although it might be one of the outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that bipartisanship has been an important element in past years. I remind the Senate that the slow but, nonetheless, steady improvements in the situation of the Aboriginal people since the 1967 referendum took place under a coalition government. I join with the Minister in saying that the families of those who have died, and indeed all Australians, have a right to expect that government at all levels and of all political persuasions will act together to ensure that further changes take place. I regret that I am not confident about the nature of the changes that will bring improvement. Change of itself is not necessarily for the better. I hope that the changes that will be taken will be for the better. But I stress that throwing money at the problem has been demonstrated to be not the right answer. I hope that, in examining the recommendations of the Commissioner, that will be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> We all want to see the resolution of the disastrous problems of the Aboriginal people. No-one has any sole right to compassion on this matter. It is extremely difficult. To the extent that this report has focused attention on the problem, it will ultimately have been proved to be worthwhile. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by congratulating Senator Kernot on her excellent speech on this very important subject, both in terms of the detail with which she covered the subject and the very perceptive way in which she understands the undertone which runs through this report. Reconciliation is really the matter that I want to pick up. Senator Baume concluded his remarks by talking about the disastrous Aboriginal problem. Quite clearly, this is a problem for Australian society; it is no less a problem for white and quasi-European Australian society than it is for the Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ministerial statement presented by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) pointed out that, while this began as an inquiry into Aboriginal deaths in custody, it then evolved into `an unprecedented national inquiry into the conditions of Australia's indigenous people'. It is important that we grasp this when we deal with this matter. Such a detailed understanding and insight into what has happened, what is happening and what needs to happen in this area is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go back to the debates which surrounded the passage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation, honourable senators will recall that at that time the Government sought to include a preamble in the legislation which dealt with this matter of dispossession and alienation and the recognition of those things. As I pointed out at the time, that preamble had very little direct relevance to the particular legislation and, with the support of the Opposition, we moved an amendment which removed that preamble. But at the time I made a very strong plea that in its place a far more important document should be prepared and that should be an instrument of reconciliation and understanding, negotiated between the indigenous people of Australia and the non-indigenous people of Australia. I understand that that process is now in train. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly agree with Senator Baume that it is not the document-it is not the words which will be written down on a piece of paper; it is not the legal importance or significance of such a thing-that is important; it is the process of reconciliation which must touch every single person in Australian society, whether Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal. </PARA>
<PARA> Dispossession does not mean just dispossession of land; it is dispossession of culture. It results from an arrogant disrespect, by mainstream Australian culture, for the values of Aboriginal culture. That is what lies at the heart of dispossession. Just as drunkenness is a symptom of some of the things that are wrong in this situation, so too dispossession of land is a symptom of dispossession of culture because land is such an important symbol in Aboriginal culture. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to introduce a term which I think is very valuable in describing what has been going on. We are all familiar with the term `racist' and the term `sexist'. I think it is useful to introduce the term `culturist' because I think the fault in Australian society lies in its inability to recognise the legitimacy and the value of other cultures-in this case, the culture of its own indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been incredibly arrogant in our disregard for the values of Aboriginal culture and that is where we nonAboriginal people need to begin and, indeed, conclude that process of reconciliation. We need to give back to Aboriginal people a sense of the real value of their culture, both to them and to us. We need to do that because, as I will attempt to show later, the essential elements of Aboriginal culture-caring for land and caring for each other-are elements which are under-represented and less important in our society than they need to be for our own survival. We need their culture just as much as they need it. That process of recognition of the value of their culture will, I believe, give back to them some sense of the worth of that culture. I think that is the process of reconciliation that needs to progress.</PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to draw attention to an article by former Senator Stone which appeared in today's Australian Financial Review because, in my mind, it exemplifies precisely what is wrong with our attitude to Aboriginal culture and why we cannot address this problem as long as we have those attitudes. In this article Mr Stone is talking about Coronation Hill and the argument concerning whether that area-which is recognised in a report which I thought we were going to deal with yesterday-is recognised by the Jawoyn people as an important sacred site. He is talking about the question of Aboriginal land rights in the context of the broader subject of Aboriginal affairs. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>That includes the vexed question of Aboriginal land rights (so-called) and the associated question of Aboriginal ``heritage''. </PARA>
<PARA> My own position on these matters can be straightforwardly stated. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal Australians are, like the rest of us, Australians. They are no less so because of their ancestry, but no more so either. We simply don't have Australians of different ``classes''. </PARA>
<PARA>Leaving that point aside, we do have Australians of very different cultures. Speaking specifically of the Coronation Hill site and the Aboriginal cultural associations with that site, he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>When grown men, such as RAC Commissioners, seriously tell us that the major impediment to developing Coronation Hill is the asserted existence of some superstitious mumbo-jumbo dignified as Aboriginal ``culture'', I rub my eyes and ask myself if I am dreaming. </PARA>
<PARA>One could not have a clearer definition of the impediments which lie in the way of reconciliation between Aboriginal people and mainstream Australian culture. If one wanted to look for another example of the arrogance which we show towards Aboriginal culture, imagine, if you will, Madam Acting Deputy President, an Aboriginal person outside this country seeking to come into this country as an immigrant. I strongly suggest to you that that person would not be allowed into this country. The criteria which we have set in place, at least in the main part of our immigration program, are designed to attract people to this country who, culturally, have an exploitative attitude to the environment and to each other which is precisely that of the mainstream. We do not seek to attract to this country people who might have a different culture-a culture similar to that of our indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of reconciliation, which I have said must permeate the whole of society and not just be simply a document-the document will be perhaps the ultimate stamp, the conclusion of that process-must involve mainstream Australian culture recognising the intrinsic value of Aboriginal culture for its own sake. That does not mean, as it has meant so far, simply allowing Aboriginal people to perform dances at concerts for money or allowing their art to be hung on the wall and sold for many hundreds of dollars. That is accepting Aboriginal culture on our terms, not on their terms. That is squeezing their culture into ways of recognition which we regard as legitimate, not the ways that they regard as legitimate. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to return to the question of the value of Aboriginal culture to the rest of Australian culture. This Government has said that it is committed to a process of establishing ecologically sustainable development-in other words, a form of civilisation in Australia which is capable of surviving in the long term without seriously damaging the environment in which it lives. The only objective evidence we have of a civilisation which has lived in this country, albeit with some damage but not such that it tested the ability to survive, is that of the Aboriginal people who have lived here for perhaps 40,000 years or more. </PARA>
<PARA> They have demonstrated, through their cultural approach and attitude to land and resources, the sorts of religious views that one needs to adopt if one is going to build an ecologically sustainable society. It is at that point that I think the mainstream, largely European, society can link hands with Aboriginal culture and say, `Yes, what you have in your culture is not only worth while and important to you-it is not only legitimate in terms of your own history or perhaps your own future-but there are also elements in that culture which we must adopt if we are going to survive as a civilisation'. </PARA>
<PARA> In that process I believe we can give great legitimacy to the Aboriginal people-give back to them their self-esteem. That is far more important than even the economic factors which Senator Baume mentioned. There is a great deal to be learned from indigenous cultures around the world. One thing which greatly disturbs me in relation to the Government and the Opposition's unwillingness to embrace the private member's Bill which I have put up in relation to the importation of tropical rainforest timbers is that there are in the world a thousand cultures already surviving or still surviving in rainforests-cultures which have unique abilities to survive in those situations, to preserve the environments in which they live and to live in those environments indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in the process over the next couple of decades, unless we rapidly change, of totally destroying those cultures. They are cultures that we desperately need to preserve not just because it is humane to do so but because we need to understand what it is in some detail which has allowed those people to survive in that way. My God, we will not be able to survive if we continue down the road we are now following, with our profligate use of resources and our destructive approach to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very important report in considerable detail, as Senator Kernot has pointed out. It fleshes out in detail the sorts of things which I have been trying to discuss by way of overview. The process of reconciliation is one which must permeate the whole of society if the specific problem with which this inquiry began and the many other problems which beset Aboriginal and mainstream society are to be satisfactorily solved both to the benefit of Aboriginal people and, very importantly, to the benefit of mainstream society.</PARA>

<PARA> The infant mortality rate-a very good measure of a community's well-being-for all Australians is 9.6 per 1,000. For Aboriginal people it is 29 per 1,000-three times as bad. Income per head of all Australians is $9,395; for Aboriginal people it is $4,829. There are other statistics which I could cite but will not due to time constraints. However, it is on the record that the Aboriginal community as a whole is solidly disadvantaged-that they who were the original owners of this country are living in our midst in a state of social dislocation and alienation, which is reflected in these deaths in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the report, I find that much has been made of the fact that there was no intentional foul play, and we can be gratified that this is so. But people who take solace in that should have read a little further and should also have read the next comment that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) made, which summarises some of the findings of the report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, the report stands as an indictment of the operation of the legal and corrective services system in respect of the most disadvantaged group in Australian society, and of our society itself in allowing that situation to develop and to persist. The Royal Commission finds that there has been a failure to live up to the standard of care owed to those in custody; it has found many system defects and many individual failures to exercise proper care and basic human compassion. </PARA>
<PARA>The way our legal system is currently operating with respect not only to Aboriginal people but to almost all those who find themselves in contact with the corrective system needs a thorough look and overhaul. If this report is the first step to doing that, it has achieved one of its major and most valuable objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons that was cited in the report for the high incidence of death among members of the Aboriginal community has been the disproportionate representation of Aboriginal people in our prison population. I turn to a recent book by Fay Gale, Rebecca Bailey-Harris and Joy Wundersitz, entitled Aboriginal Youth and the Criminal Justice System. The Injustice of Justice?-a book I had occasion recently to review for the Journal of Social Alternatives. The authors demonstrate the stark facts: compared with other youth entering the legal system, Aboriginal youth is much more likely to be arrested in the first place, 43.4 per cent against 19.7 per cent; more likely to be referred to court rather than to the children's aid panel, 71.3 per cent compared with 37.4 per cent; and more likely to be sentenced to detention, 10.2 per cent against 4.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In all cases the comparison was made on the basis of offences or the suspicion of offences which were similar. The study examines decisions made at three critical points: police deciding to apprehend by arrest or by report; screening panels deciding whether to take any action, and, if so, whether to refer the case to a children's aid panel or to the Children's Court; and the Children's Court deciding on the various options of detention, bond, fine and discharge. The authors concluded that the racist orientation of people in the legal system was, in at least half the cases concerned, a major factor in determining the decisions thus made, and this is one of the messages of this report that we as a community, as Senator Coulter has outlined, must change. We must reach a point where we recognise Aboriginal rights, Aboriginal culture and Aboriginal traditions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was talking about the need for the Australian community to recognise that Aboriginal people can offer us cultural values that we need in the development of our own community. I believe that we do not have any right to be patronising about our culture as it compares with that of the Aboriginal people-their values and their spiritual understanding of the land that they occupied before we did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some years ago, I had the privilege of living for brief periods in a number of Aboriginal communities, and I learned to appreciate their honesty, their essential humanity, their tolerance and their lack of acquisitiveness-values that we could learn from and that we would do well to adopt. Yet we find that the Aboriginal community is living, within the greater community of Australia, in the most disadvantaged position of any group, and despite the well-meaning efforts of some, compared with the disregard of many others, we have not been able to offer them an equal place, their rightful place, in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, of course, not only a matter of money, as somebody said here before. Sometimes it is, and I would like to emphasise again that I for one and the Australian Democrats as a whole do not begrudge the $30m that was spent on this report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I believe that it is money well spent if it makes our community sit up and take notice, if it shames us into taking some effective action. While it is not only a matter of money, material activities must be undertaken to enable Aboriginals to enjoy the same sorts of opportunities, the same sorts of life expectancies, that we in the rest of the Australian community have. </PARA>
<PARA> From my experience, mainly in the Northern Territory, I offer the comment that we, as the greater Australian community, should pick our best people-our best minds, our people who understand, who have sensitivity and who also have the capacity-to bring about a merging between the two communities in order to enable the Aboriginal community, over time, to become an equal partner in our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Land rights and a treaty would be a starting point, but certainly that is not where it ends. Many of our laws need to be adjusted to fit in with Aboriginal culture and customs, and we should have the intelligence, flexibility, tolerance and capacity to bring this about. We have done it on one or two occasions in the past-for example, when the community development employment program and our notions of the unemployment benefit were adjusted to enable us to pay bulk amounts to Aboriginal communities so that they, in turn, could administer those funds in line with their own customs and concepts of authority and cooperation. We may need to do that again, and we should not get away with the idea that our laws are wise, all embracing and all powerful and that we can disregard different cultures and different values which we would do well to adopt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which was tabled in this chamber today. First of all, I will say something in response to Senator Spindler. He said that he did not resent the $30m that had been spent. I resent the fact that we had to spend $30m simply to demonstrate symptoms which are well known. That $30m could have been constructively put towards ensuring that the inevitable, obvious and clear symptoms crying out for attention were addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing I want to say is that I personally have no guilt-a feeling which seems to pervade debates of this nature-about what happened, about the events that took place at the time of the Napoleonic Wars; but I do have a sense of subliminal anger and resentment at what I see happening today, driven by an all knowing white community. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing is clear about this report: it epitomises, highlights and crystallises the results of 200 years of white settlement in Australia. It demonstrates the results of 200 years of various on and off social experiments by the community as a whole or, more particularly, in many cases, by various succeeding Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs. What it demonstrates, what it highlights, are the tragic and wretched circumstances in which so many Aboriginal people live today. It shows the despair at the lack of hope and the evaporation of any likelihood of improvement. It certainly does not point to any future light on a hill. It is not startling to anybody in this chamber to read that the average age of those Aboriginals who died in custody was 32 years. I shall quote from the ministerial statement on the report:</PARA>
<PARA>Of the 99 Aboriginal people who died, 43 had experienced childhood separation from their natural families through intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Without question, those people in State authorities, missions or other institutions were doing what they felt overwhelmingly to be right, what they believed to be in the interests of the Aboriginal community. In the overwhelming number of cases, they were categorically wrong. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . 83 of the 99 were unemployed at the date of their last detention. </PARA>
<PARA>43 of the 99 had been charged with an offence at or before the age of 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Only 2 of the 99 had completed secondary schooling. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commission concluded that the standard of health of the 99-whose average age was 32-varied from poor to very bad. </PARA>
<PARA>The average age of those dying from natural causes was a little over 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that my guess is that those statistics are not unique to Aboriginals who die in custody. They are probably not far from the norm for Aboriginals in society, as a result our best endeavours, as a result of billions of dollars being spent, as a result of pious, well-meaning, know all white people-zealots from the Left and the Right, zealots generally, who know no wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> We seem to believe that we have a prescription for the Aboriginal community that will solve all their problems. As is the case with so many issues that we are confronted with in this chamber, nobody has a mortgage on compassion and nobody has a mortgage on wisdom, but I suspect that the overwhelming majority of Australian people do have a deep sense of care and commitment to ensuring that all Australians have an acceptable standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say that, in my view, the problems will not be solved by treaties, documents of reconciliation, or makarratas. That says it all because a makarrata is the expression used by a group headed, as I remember, by `Nugget' Coombs. It is an East Arnhem Land word which means the coming together after the letting of blood. Invariably it does not extinguish the conflict between the two waring groups. Perhaps more than anything else, it epitomises the difficulties that the Aboriginal community have had cast on them by us. </PARA>
<PARA> Land rights, makarratas, treaties and reconciliations will not help undernourished children get well. They will not help old people who are blind with glaucoma see again. They will not help old deaf Aboriginal women hear again. They will not give young people hope for an education. They will not give young Aboriginal teenagers a job, but they might give a warm inner glow to people who think that a piece of paper changes the social structure of society. Yet that is where we spend the energy, that is where we spend the money and that is where we spend the time. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those in our society who believe that will cleanse and expunge the sins of past events. Invariably those who push those issues so hard have a predetermined, preconceived notion about what is right and what is good, they know what is right, and there is nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what is right. I have to say that I find it almost frightening, certainly most disturbing, to watch zealot bigots in various spectrums of the political arena preaching their panacea, invariably dripping with sanctimonious self-righteousness or bigoted anger. Whatever direction in the spectrum they are coming from, they reek of some emotion which gives them a mortgage to know what is right for these people. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy is that these people inevitably treat the Aboriginal community in a manipulated sense. The Aboriginal community, as we have so often seen and as history has demonstrated, becomes the tool of these crusades. The Aboriginal community become the instrument of other people's causes. They become subject to that over which these white people's commitments are fought. They become the forgotten victims of the struggles between capitalists and socialists. They become the deprived victims of struggles between developers and anti-developers. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps there is no better example, without wanting to get into the politics of it, than Coronation Hill. I went to Coronation Hill. I took evidence, with a committee, from the Jawoyn people in what I would describe as a very relaxed, informal, natural environment. The three elders to whom Mr Justice Stewart now refers as the custodians-Peter Jetbulla, Nipper Brown and the third member whose name escapes me at the moment-said in a very relaxed but articulate and persuasive way that they had no objection to mining Coronation Hill. They had no problem with talk of a sacred site, no fear of a Bula in the area. Yet after the influence, the persuasion, and the interference of some, including a fellow named Cooper from the Northern Territory Sacred Sites Authority who from that point was determined to change their minds, we now find it alleged by Mr Justice Stewart that they do not want mining. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that I had no vested interest, nor did the committee, in persuading them in one way or another; rather we wanted to hear their evidence. Months later we find that they have become the forgotten victims who have been used, manipulated, intimidated, threatened and finally caused to take a different view from that which they instinctively wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document refers to drinking rights. I remember being in the north west of Western Australia on the very day on which the Aboriginal community got their drinking rights. Prior to that, as Senator McMullan would know, in Western Australia Aboriginals had to get citizenship. Citizenship was invariably granted to the Aboriginal community members on the basis that they wanted a right to vote. They would come before the magistrate or the justice of the peace who would examine their application. On examination, the Aboriginal applicants would always say that they wanted citizenship in order to vote, and never to drink. As I recall, the Constitution was changed so that Aboriginals could get automatic rights, and so they should have. The tragedy is that the battles for drinking rights, which now in some respects we are trying to retard, are fought over individual rights. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those who are saying that Aboriginals are not born equal but we will make them equal. They are not concerned with the effects, the ramifications or the consequences of providing a community, thus far denied alcohol, with the right to drink. They are determined to ensure equality of rights as though that gives some blessing and no pain, no distress and no destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the same problem effervescing in education where there is a determination to make sure that there is access to equality, but not to equality in education. In parts of the north, where it would be sensible to provide a special English teaching category for Aboriginal children because they do not properly handle English, Aboriginal children were put into a class with white children to show that there was no discrimination. That simply meant that they bobbed and floated like jetsam and flotsam through their years of education, not understanding the language, never mind being able to read and write and learn. This happened because of bigotry from both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen how often money has been used as a substitute for constructive improvement in the quality of the lives of Aboriginal people. At the end of the day we can all see with clarity the consequences and the effects of these issues. We see Bob Collins take an Aboriginal group to demonstrate outside the Australian Labor Party convention in Hobart in support of mining in Kakadu National Park. I think Jabiluka was the mine. There were tens of billions of dollars in it for them, which they judged rightly to be their entitlement but which had been locked up because other people thought they knew what was in their best interests. Then we see the Northern Land Council running a different agenda for the Jawoyn people who can get equal rewards from the benefits that would flow from Coronation Hill. It just depends where one's politics are at the time as to the depravation that is caused to the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> The real tragedy is that those matters that are capable of being addressed are not addressed, and are submerged in the virile and vigorous but quite unhelpful debate over land rights, treaties and reconciliations. One has only to go through the country areas of any State to see the level of health care that is available to the Aboriginal community. One has only to look at the number of Aboriginal children in country hospitals who are suffering from malnutrition, underdevelopment and deprivation. One has only to look at the disability inflicted as a result of illnesses such as glaucoma, trachomas, ear infections and the like. The necessary services and facilities are not available. Social diseases, like venereal disease, exist in these places because of a lack of proper education and a lack of concentration of care-frankly, a lack of interest in the well-being of these people and in keeping them healthy. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk about futility and yet we do not provide an education system that in any way enhances their skills. If they go through the process of education, what jobs are offered? For the past 100 years they have been leaving school with no English, no arithmetic-no basic learning. They simply go back to the station to ride the horses. But even that has now been taken away from them. So why in their own hearts and minds would they want to be educated when they know that at the end of the day they are not going into a job? There is no benefit to be had-there is no incentive, no reward. There is no cause for them to care whether they pass or fail, whether they go to school or do not go to school, whether they get pregnant at 14 or whether they get drunk at 13. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no incentive, and do we provide one? No. What we do is provide the ways and the means to ensure that there is everything else but an incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk about the alcohol problem. What one of the Australian Democrats said earlier was quite correct: it is simply a symptom. That is not unique to the Aboriginal community. It is universal for society generally. It is a symptom of a latent, deep-seated problem of another nature. Modest as my knowledge is, it seems to me that most people who commit suicide seem to be in some way in total despair, lacking hope, self-respect and any prospects in their own heart and mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, in many respects that epitomises what the Aboriginal people are offered for tomorrow: despair and no hope, and very often no reward for endeavour. It is acknowledged overwhelmingly by those vaguely informed that alcohol is a serious problem. But what would I get if I asked either the State governments or the Federal Government to give me a list of facilities or institutions that provide for members of the Aboriginal community who have an alcohol problem? I would receive an absolutely zero response. If one is an Aboriginal with a drinking problem, it is just too bad, mate. The Government's solution is to give the person another cheque. And yet, alcohol is seen to be a chronic cause of their problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The ministerial statement that I have read ever so briefly talks about reviewing the drinking laws. Quite frankly, we cannot legislate to stop drinking. The Dog Act still prevails for Aboriginal people and white people in Western Australia. Under that legislation, after a number of alcohol offences a person can be banned from licensed premises. Does anyone think that that ever stopped one single drunk from getting a drink? Of course it did not. It is social engineering to imagine that we can change people's lifestyles by law. I am reminded of the Soviets who tried to stop the sale of vodka because they thought the people were becoming alcoholics. What happened? The people cornered the sugar market. There was a shortage of sugar in the Soviet Union because all the moonlighters, all the bootleggers, had bought it all. So, the authorities had to allow the people to revert to their original hours of consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not stop the alcohol problem amongst Aborigines simply by changing the licensing laws. I am not suggesting for a moment that this should not be done or that licensees who pour alcohol down the throats of either black or white people who are clearly intoxicated should not be prosecuted. It is already an offence under the licensing Act. However, there is absolutely no infrastructure at all to give assistance to those people who might want it. There is absolutely no counselling at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we need to acknowledge-which we presently do not do-the values, the views, the aspirations, the wishes, the wants and the lifestyle that members of the Aboriginal community want. That is what will give them some help and some hope-not our own social engineering, not our determination to make them appear to be equal, through dollars and cents. We must understand what it is that they want for themselves, their children and their extended family. We must make sure that in a proper and constructive way they contribute to that decision-making. Somebody said that it was intended that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) would do that. Frankly, I could provide a persuasive argument that it does the contrary. I fear that it does not provide for immediate, on the ground and close-to-home decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that this report deals with the tragic deaths of 99 people and that it cost $30m plus, I hope that some good really does come out of it. I hope that it is not just another statement about contemporary Aboriginal society. I hope that it is not just a collection of hypocritical words designed to soothe the deep inner feelings of those who purport to have a mortgage on compassion but rather a starting point in beginning to acknowledge what some of the fundamental problems are. Having read the ministerial statement, I have to say that, to my mind, it does not go to the heart of those matters that are intrinsic to a greatly enhanced lifestyle and future for the Aboriginal community. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak tonight on the Industry Commission report No. 10 on statutory marketing arrangements for primary producers. The report, which is dated 26 March 1991, follows a reference to the Industry Commission to investigate Commonwealth, State and Territory statutory marketing authorities for primary products, excluding mining and forestry. In the report, the Industry Commission has taken a general approach to primary products and their statutory marketing authorities and makes very broad economic conclusions, as opposed to the recommendations on specific primary industry statutory marketing authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In this general climate of deregulation, any changes that may follow from this report should be assessed from the standpoint of current arrangements. Many findings in the report are causes for concern, particularly from the point of view of individual rural producers dealing with the concentration that occurs in Australia with processors, suppliers and retail chains. In many cases, statutory marketing arrangements are the only thing standing between a fair market price and the exploitation of individual farmers in a market dominated by three or four major players. </PARA>
<PARA> I take as an example the grocery industry: 70 per cent of the Australian grocery market is in the hands of three major grocery chains. Because of their vast buying power, they can force growers and processors to give discounts and other up-front markdowns that reduce prices to below the cost of production. The countervailing market power of these statutory marketing bodies becomes even more important when the amount of brand ownership and vertical integration of these groups is taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The report makes the assertion that statutory marketing authorities raised consumer prices by about 0.3 per cent and taxed users and consumers of food products directly by some $550m. Relevant to the Commission's figures is the fact that the non-farm index-the consumer price index-has increased over the last 30 years by 755 per cent while farmers have received a price increase of 348 per cent in the same period. This means that consumers are getting a very low commodity price and very cheap food. </PARA>
<PARA> Another position that we must take into consideration is the threat of imported products being brought into Australia by major marketers and chains. The report also points to the productivity and efficiency gains that have been made by Australian farmers over the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> The report raises the question of trade practices protection for rural producers to countervail buyers' market power as opposed to the use of statutory marketing authorities. The report specifically questions the limitation under the Act which restricts the authorising of voluntary recommended price arrangements between fewer than 50 parties. I do not think that there would be too many statutory marketing authorities that would have less than 50 members. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to replace statutory marketing authorities with trade practices protection-it is quite obvious that at the moment the Trade Practices Act is the weakest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and will not provide that protection to rural producers-the Government must address this problem before it exposes rural producers and primary industry, to the market forces that are concentrated in Australia more than in any other OECD country. We will never see the amalgamations or the aggregations of companies to the extent that we see in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Report on Schooling in Australia, put out by the Australian Education Council, is a very valuable document. The document contains excellent data for understanding what is and what is not happening in Australian education. In the time allowed, it is possible to address only a few of the issues raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to place my remarks relating to the report in the context of the call of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for the need for Australia to become the clever country. I was pleased to read in the report that the very first goal for schooling in Australia is:</PARA>
<PARA>To provide an excellent education for all young people, being one which develops their talents and capacities to full potential, and is relevant to the social, cultural and economic needs of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>I searched the document in vain to see how, in the light of this goal, the Federal Labor Government was promoting that through programs to help the gifted and talented children of this nation. There were, quite properly, programs for a wide range of disadvantaged groups; but for the gifted children there was nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> This appalling gap in our national priorities was brought home to me during questioning of the officials from the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) at the recent Additional Estimates hearings. The Department revealed that the Federal Government was providing no funding in this area. When I started to question the senior DEET officials about this matter, Minister Bolkus stopped me, saying that such general questions were outside the ambit of the Additional Estimates hearing. Honourable senators can be assured that I will ask the same questions during the Budget Estimates hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> The highlight of the report was the section that outlined the initiatives in the area of excellence in education in my own State. The Government of New South Wales, like the Federal Government, has set out as its first goal for education to promote and reward excellence in all aspects of schooling and to provide parents with increased choice in schooling. But, unlike the Federal Labor Government, the Greiner Government has done something about it with its excellence and equity policy. Section 4 of the report on New South Wales, headed `Major Policy Initiatives', addresses freedom of choice and the pursuit of excellence. Among the initiatives relating to this goal are: basic skills testing program; assessment and reporting of student progress; dezoning of schools; the creation of selective high schools; senior high schools; high schools for the performing arts; technology high schools; and centres of excellence. </PARA>
<PARA> I take particular pride in the creation of centres of excellence in New South Wales schools, as I wrote the seminal paper on this for the then shadow Minister for education, Dr Terry Metherell. It is pleasing to see that so many schools are specialising and building their expertise in areas such as the performing arts, music and languages, just to name a few. As a result of these initiatives, parents have a greater opportunity to fulfil their aspirations for their family by sending their children to schools which better match their needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pay tribute in this place to the courage and tenacity of Dr Terry Metherell, who will go down in education history as the watershed Minister who turned the education system around against the entrenched interests of the New South Wales Teachers Federation. I am pleased to see that the current New South Wales Minister for Education, the Hon. Virginia Chadwick, is not retreating from the policy position which Dr Metherell established. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the Australian Labor Party is not proposing to abolish any of the initiatives that I have mentioned in its policy for the New South Wales State election. Where would it go? Would it follow the disastrous initiatives of the Victorian Government's education policy? I do not think anyone would be game enough to follow the Victorian Government on anything at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I will track with interest over the next few years the educational outcomes in the Victorian and New South Wales systems as Labor pursues in Victoria the cult of mediocrity with its philosophy of levelling down and as New South Wales pursues policies which move towards helping children achieve their potential. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Federal Labor Government doing in this particular area? Three years ago the Senate Select Committee on the Education of Gifted and Talented Children brought down its report. What has the Federal Government done about it? According to the national report on schooling, it has done nothing. That is a national disgrace and it makes the Prime Minister's call for Australia to become a clever country very hollow indeed. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This report discharges a reference arising from the October 1989 report of Estimates Committee E. That Committee was critical of aspects of explanatory notes it had received and had broader concerns about the accountability of trust accounts and special appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry into the matters raised by Estimates Committee E took longer than was initially expected, mainly because of delays resulting from the 1990 Federal election and the almost total change of Committee membership that followed it. The duration of the Committee's consideration of the issues also reflects the importance of the subject matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee took a broad approach to review of the Estimates process. The resulting report has two major aims. The first is to propose changes to Estimates documentation and procedures which the Committee members agreed could provide more effective and better focused Estimates hearings within the current scrutiny process. A second and more ambitious aim is to contribute to a larger debate about the effectiveness of the Estimates process and the use made of information provided to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedural changes proposed in the report should draw wide support. The Committee recommends that scheduling of Estimates hearings be made more certain by setting firm commencement times, by requiring that no hearing extend beyond midnight, and by scheduling hearings in the same weeks each year. The Committee has also suggested that the possibility of scheduling hearings in non-sitting weeks be considered on the basis that moving Estimates hearings to non-sitting weeks should not increase the number of weeks that senators are required to spend in Canberra. The Committee also recommends a firm but achievable deadline for the tabling of explanatory notes. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation proposes measures to reduce the huge volume of paper associated with the present Estimates process. The Senate might be surprised to learn that the explanatory notes, Hansards, and volumes of additional information produced in the last Budget Estimates process totalled almost 15,000 pages, all printed in multiple copies for uses that are mostly ephemeral. </PARA>
<PARA> A further change in Estimates procedures which could improve the quality of information available to Estimates committees would be for Ministers from the House of Representatives to have carriage of their portfolios' estimates at committee hearings, if they wish to do so. The Committee recommended that the Government consider allowing this to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that the explanatory notes provide a misleading picture of the operations of quasi-commercial bodies operating on an accrual accounting basis under group two trust accounts. These bodies have become more significant in the Budget with the commercialisation of the administrative services portfolio. The Committee has recommended that Estimates committees have access to financial information on group two trust accounts, segmented to the level of business units within each trust account, regardless of whether the information has been audited at the time of Estimates hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also recommended that financial information on trust accounts, segmented to business unit level, be published after it has been audited. Another recommendation in this area seeks to remove an ambiguity in the principles for provision of services to government agencies by the Department of Administrative Services which might limit the Auditor-General's access to the records of trust accounts. It appears that no such limit was intended or has been applied, but the wording is susceptible to misunderstanding. </PARA>
<PARA> The various detailed recommendations in the report would make the existing Estimates process more tidy. I have argued elsewhere that the process could benefit from more substantial reform. It seems to me that the current process compresses too much of the necessary parliamentary scrutiny into the Estimates framework. It thrusts a mix of urgent and non-urgent tasks onto committees which have little continuity of membership or staffing. </PARA>
<PARA> Parliamentary scrutiny of the Executive surely would be served better by some separation of the various functions currently lumped together under the Estimates scrutiny label. I believe that the development of standing committees and the extent to which they now shadow ministerial portfolios justifies giving those committees the task of Estimates scrutiny. This would allow a more even spread of scrutiny work over the year. It would encourage standing committees to undertake more systematic monitoring of performance, based on annual reports as well as the Estimates documentation. </PARA>
<PARA> Standing committees could apply the current Estimates procedures just as easily as Estimates committees. All the aims of the present system could be achieved in that way with the added advantages of better-focused scrutiny by committees with greater continuity of membership and staffing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was not able to agree on the significance of the problems with the present process or on major changes that could be made to the process. The nub of the argument, I believe, was summed up in a discussion paper prepared by the clerks for the Standing Orders Committee in 1985, which commented:</PARA>
<PARA>If [Estimates] Committees are seen simply as a more convenient method of conducting the examination of the estimates which used to be conducted in the Committee of the Whole, with the added advantage of questions being put directly to departmental officers, [the] Committees as they currently operate could be seen as entirely appropriate. If it is considered that the Committees should be undertaking a more intensive examination of the estimates, this would tend to lead to the conclusion that the task should be undertaken by the standing committees. </PARA>
<PARA>I am inclined to favour accountability mechanisms which will encourage public servants to be responsive to elected governments. I doubt that the structure of separate standing and Estimates committees which emerged as a by-product of political deals in 1971 is the best possible way of doing this, especially given the vastly greater amount of information routinely made available to committees 20 years later. An important chapter of the report deals with the limitations of the Estimates committees in reviewing performance of departments and agencies. It will be clear from the report that members of the Committee differed on such issues. Members differed especially in the weight they placed on the object of the Estimates process and on the effectiveness of the current process in auditing or evaluating program performance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee did not consult widely on major changes to the process and such changes deserve careful consideration and discussion by all senators. For those reasons, the final chapter of the report presents options and recommends that the Senate debate the Estimates process and possible changes to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The report was adopted after a rather long debate within the Committee. Although Committee members differed on the need for extensive change to the Estimates process and on the types of improvements possible, we did agree that Estimates scrutiny is important. The Committee was keen to achieve a compromise position on recommendations and I particularly acknowledge the efforts of the Deputy Chairman, Senator Watson, in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Committee, I also thank the staff who worked on this inquiry, especially Barbara Allan and Peter Hamburger. Dr John Uhr of the public policy program at the Australian National University, and formerly an officer of the Senate, helped the committee to clarify its ideas on these issues. The Committee is also grateful to numerous officers of departments and agencies for their work in producing substantial written submissions and for their oral presentations. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Estimates processes are a valuable link in the accountability chain that ensures that public administrative practices are open, honest and efficient. The Senate Estimates provide an important link between the people, the Parliament and the public sector. Some of the various roles of the Estimates scrutiny processes, including the monitoring of performance, the gathering of information and being a forum for debate during the committee stage of appropriation Bills may at times seem to be conflicting roles. Also, to the casual observer, the Estimates processes frequently give the appearance of being unstructured and on occasions give the appearance of being politically charged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was against this background that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, under the chairmanship of Senator Coates, embarked on its inquiry arising from the request through Senate Estimates Committee E whereby there was an implied need to improve some aspects of the form of the program, management and budgeting presentations and other matters. Reviews not infrequently lead to change, but in recent years there has been a tendency to assume that all change is desirable. Opportunities occasioned by a reference such as this can often lead to a dramatic change. </PARA>
<PARA> I use this opportunity to add a word of warning that there is, nevertheless, a degree of responsibility required of senators to ensure that we do not discredit valuable and timely systems of checks and balances built up over many years to meet a problem in a particular area. That is, that we build on what has been constructed rather than overthrow something which has stood the test of time. By this I do not wish to denigrate in any way the scope of the inquiry. Indeed, quite the reverse, because the adequacy of the presentation of departmental explanatory notes and the monitoring by the Department of Finance is really the linchpin for senators' evaluations. The operation of trust accounts in many senators' minds has been less than desirable, and hence there has been a concern that the use of trust accounts at times can provide a vehicle where there is less than adequate scrutiny by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The evaluations by the Senate, particularly of departmental reports by various committees, has really been quite uneven across the spectrum. I remind honourable senators that there is an unwritten obligation on the part of us all to apply very thorough analysis and scrutiny to all reports that come before this place. To do this appropriately will require a degree of specialisation because there is always a tendency that the more politically sensitive areas will demand the greatest degree of attention to the detriment of others. There does need to be a coordinating body within each Party to ensure that parliament's role in reviewing the various operations of government is adequate and that it does not pass these jobs off to other entities including the Auditor-General, the Department of Finance, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet or other such agency. </PARA>
<PARA> The report before the Senate was indeed a difficult one. I commend all the members who were prepared to compromise their earlier bolder resolutions to enable a report to be tabled without a minority addendum. The report now before the Senate indicates that there was not always unanimous agreement to all the suggestions that were put forward. But this is always inevitable in a report of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> One issue farther down the track, which I believe I have a responsibility for signalling now, concerns the further evaluation of what I might term policy outcomes. While it is quite appropriate, for example, that the Auditor-General should report on the quality of the externally set indicators and provide information on how successful each program's goals have been, further intrusions into policy areas by external evaluators outside the parliamentary chambers could be dangerous. I suggest that it could leave such respected office holders as the Auditor-General open to claims of political bias if we pursued the matter too much further. </PARA>
<PARA> Such policy evaluations, I believe, are best kept within the chamber or within the political forums. The Auditor-General is widely respected across political parties and is one of the few officers in the public area who commands universal respect. I do not believe that we can afford to put a new responsibility on him or his office that could diminish in any way this built-up respect and impartiality. </PARA>
<PARA> A more current issue that has some relevance to this report is the forthcoming report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts concerning the scrutiny of government business enterprises (GBEs)-a matter which this report dealt with-and the manner in which these enterprises be subject to regular review. Parliament's evaluation of government business enterprises is essential despite their enhanced independent audits. The role of the Auditor-General is critical. This was recognised in the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report 296 which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . where the Federal Government has a financial interest in GBEs the Auditor-General should be the final auditor. The other device of assuring accountability is to establish social responsibility criteria including community service obligations on all GBEs.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the views of the Committee that the Senate Estimates process has succeeded over the years. As a demonstration of this progress, departments and agencies have become more careful and informative in their reporting. However, the Committee was mindful of an emerging problem which exists beyond the quality of reporting-that is, the question of the cost-effective use of the information of the Estimates data. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee trusts that the report will provide an injection of some Senate enthusiasm for further constructive debate on improvements to the Senate Estimates scrutiny processes. However, the Senate must not in any way weaken the strengths of the existing system and improvements that have occurred since their inception. I wish to thank the Chairman, Senator Coates, for his forbearance, all members of the Committee, the Secretary, Peter Hamburger, and his staff for their tolerance, forbearance and resolve to produce a good report. </PARA>

<PARA>TABLING STATEMENT FOR SENATOR DEVEREUX</PARA>
<PARA>Thursday 9th May 1991</PARA>
<PARA>CONSTRUCTION OF AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY COMPLEX, JAKARTA, INDONESIA</PARA>
<PARA>The report that I have just tabled deals with the construction of a new Chancery and associated recreational facilities in Jakarta. The Committee has concluded that there is a need to provide a purpose-built complex for the Australian Embassy in Jakarta to enable the mission to fulfil representative functions. The new complex is also needed to provide cultural activity space and staff amenities. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed complex will be built on a recently acquired site in the Jakarta central business district. The limit-of-cost estimate for the work when referred to the Committee was $11.6 million at December 1990 prices. Because of the unexpected need to provide for on-site power generation, the estimated cost at the time of the public hearing in February 1991 had increased to $12.4 million. However, while it appears that on-site power generation will now not be required, the Overseas Property Group wishes to retain the additional cost in the estimate until this is confirmed. The Committee also recommended a further cost of $880,000 be allowed for expansion purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>In recommending that the work proceed, the Committee recognises Australia's need to develop a positive and constructive relationship with Indonesia. Although the relationship between Australia and Indonesia has not been easy for either country in recent years, there is an interest and willingness on both sides to improve those relations. We believe it is important that, as the relationship continues to grow in substance and depth, the Embassy remains capable of effectively monitoring and coordinating the full range of interactions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Embassy is currently located in two physically separate buildings in the central commercial district of Jakarta, now dominated by large multi-storey buildings. The Chancery premises-one owned by the Australian Government and the other leased-are separated by a very busy ten lane major thoroughfare. The owned accommodation-a five storey building opened in 1967-is located on a narrow site which is congested by open air carparking, maintenance workshops, store and plant rooms, and recreation facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>This building has been progressively supplemented with leased space in nearby premises, as the Embassy's functions and staff numbers have expanded over the past few years. As well as detracting from the Embassy's efficiency and cost-effectiveness, through the separation of functions and staff, the present office accommodation is inadequate to satisfy existing needs, provides substandard office accommodation, and is adversely affecting the ability of the mission to realise its goals and objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposal, therefore, is based on the need to house all Embassy staff in one building in an acceptable standard of office accommodation, to favourably reflect Australia's image in Indonesia, and to meet the Australian Government's obligation as an employer to accommodate properly its employees. </PARA>
<PARA>One matter of concern to the Committee was the proposed size of the complex. Because of the importance of Australia's relationship with Indonesia, it is inevitable that staff numbers will expand, thus requiring disruptive works to provide additional space. This was reinforced by the views of the Ambassador and staff in Jakarta. The Committee has, therefore, recommended that the project be expanded during the initial construction phase to include the shell of an additional floor and space for lateral expansion at a further cost of $880,000. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee concluded that the site chosen for the new Australian Embassy complex in Jakarta is in a suitable location for its representation and administrative functions. It has also requested that it be provided with a copy of the energy audit of the complex, which is to be undertaken following its completion. </PARA>
<PARA>Concerns were raised by the Ambassador and staff in Jakarta over the architectural merit of the proposed project. The mission did not believe the design of the complex adequately reflected the importance of Australia's relationship with Indonesia. While not wishing to enter into a debate on the architectural merits of this project, the Committee believes the design rationale for Australian embassies should be reassessed. In particular, the Overseas Property Group should determine what designs are meant to achieve, for example, a sense of Australian identity, a prestige image or merely a functional solution to suit a particular design requirement. </PARA>
<PARA>Due to the restriction in the Public Works Committee Act 1969 on meetings of the Public Works Committee outside Australia and its external Territories, the Committee was unable to inspect the proposed site or existing Embassy complex in Jakarta. This is completely contrary to the normal practice of the Committee, which has always regarded site inspections as an integral and extremely important part of its consideration of a project. This matter has been raised before, and the time will come-given some of the complexities of projects about to be referred to the Committee-that it will decide that, without a site inspection, it is impossible to adequately discharge the mandate given to it by Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that there are costs involved, but given the nature of some projects, it would sometimes be cheaper for the Committee or a sectional Committee to conduct an on-site inspection, than the present unsatisfactory arrangements which often require local embassy staff and design and construction personnel to travel to Canberra to appear at public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of the current Embassy project, due to the absence of a site inspection, the Committee was hampered in its consideration of the project, particularly in relation to the issue of size. The Committee believes that Section 12(1) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 should be amended to allow it to meet outside Australia and its external Territories. The Committee has approached the Minister for Administrative Services on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to this report, Construction of Australian Embassy Complex, Jakarta, Indonesia. I note the absence of Senator Devereux, but I am sure he would concur with what I am about to say. This particular construction is of significance not just to us but also to our relationship with the Indonesian Government. In my opinion and, I think, in the opinion of the Public Works Committee, it is long overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cost of particular complex has escalated from $11.6m at December 1990 to a figure approaching $12.4m in February 1991. As a result of consultations, our Committee also recommended that a further cost of $880,000 be allowed for expansion purposes. That was as a result of particular worries that the Ambassador in Jakarta had and which he conveyed to the Committee, because he believed that our relationship with Indonesia- a very important relationship, I might say-would lead to increased activity between our two countries. Therefore, this would lead to a need for extra accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Committee viewed this project and took evidence from those involved, we were of the opinion that the project could be expanded while the initial construction was going on-by a shell being constructed which could be fitted out at a later time. This would save us money and would allow for future expansion. There was some publicity about the site, but I must say that the site for the new Australian Embassy in Jakarta is in a much better position than the old Chancery buildings. The fact that the land belonged to President Suharto's son really does not have much to do with it. Everybody concerned believes that it is an opportunity that is too good to be missed. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just about to comment on that. The Chairman of our Committee, Colin Hollis, and all the members believe that when we have overseas projects involving large amounts of money-in this case $12.4m-then at least an executive group of the Committee, if not all the members, should be able to view the site and get a feel for what is really happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although I know people might say it is a rort, the fact is that for us to give proper consideration to this matter we had to view videos. People were sent away to make videos to bring back to show us. We had to bring people in from over there to give evidence about what was happening there. Frankly, although we have a roving commission in Australia to look at projects, for the small amount of money that is involved in a $12.4m project, I think that all of us on the Committee, from all points and parts of politics, would agree that at the very least the Chairman and perhaps one other, the Deputy Chairman, should at least have a chance to view the site. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether other members have taken notice of some of our overseas buildings in recent times. When I was in Japan on a parliamentary delegation on another matter, I had occasion to visit and attend functions at the new Embassy in Tokyo. Considering the relationship that we have with Japan, the amount of trade we carry out with that country, and the fact that we need to keep a very high profile there, I was disappointed with our new complex in that country. I do not think it reflects very well on our architecture nor on other aspects. It was, to say the least, nothing more than an elaborate bomb shelter. People might think perhaps there is a possibility that there could be conflict there in the future, although I do not believe so, but I must say it was very disappointing to an Australian in a place like Tokyo, where we have so much diplomatic activity, to see that building. I believe-this is a personal opinion but it is shared by quite a few of my colleagues on both sides of the House-that we could have done a little better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did and at a future date I will let Senator McKiernan look at it. The reception area in the Tokyo Embassy is similar to our squash court in this building in the recreation area. I am drifting away from the subject at hand, but the point I am trying to make is that it is all very well to look at plastic models that cost $5,000 or $6,000 each and to view videos that cost up to $4,000 or $5,000 each, but the fact is that if we, as the oldest Committee in this Parliament, are supposed to give approval to projects of this magnitude. Particularly given our relationship with Indonesia, I think it is very important that some consideration by the Minister be given to allowing a representative group from the Committee at least to view the site and to see what impact it might have on the whole project. I understand that our Chairman has taken up this matter most vigorously with the Minister concerned. I do not know what his success rate has been, but I am sure, knowing Mr Hollis, that he will beaver away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that I have said enough about this matter. The overall design of the building seems to fit in well with those types of architecture one sees in that part of the world. I think that those involved have done all they can, given the cost constraints and our situation and relationship with Indonesia. I hope that this new complex makes things easier for everybody concerned. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This is document No. 11 and relates to the report by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training on higher education funding. The Higher Education Council is required to report to the National Board twice each year, in February and August, on the operation of educational profiles and the impact of the higher education contribution scheme (HECS). I want to deal with the section of the report which deals with education profiles. I have to say at the outset that this aspect of higher education receives scant attention in the report. There are, in fact, only two pages which deal with educational profiles compared with 14 pages on HECS plus several more pages of statistics relating to HECS. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the Senate of the role of the Higher Education Council and its relation to the education profiles. The Higher Education Council has a legislative requirement to advise on two things: the principles on which funding decisions are made for higher education; and the detailed allocation proposals for funding to higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the very small amount of information which is provided in this report before the Senate. First, the report indicates that in 1990 visits to institutions were undertaken by three teams with up to eight people on each. Then there is a fair amount of detail about the composition of these teams. There were representatives from the Department of Employment, Education and Training; the Higher Education Council; and the Australian Research Council. Then the report talks about the favourable reactions of the institutions to their visits. On page three of the report the council reports on its important role as an adviser on funding in one sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>In carrying out these responsibilities in 1990, the Council advised the Minister on appropriate levels of growth and its allocation amongst groups of entrants and between undergraduate and postgraduate studies.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, we have three paragraphs which deal with the concerns of the council in connection with education profiles. I now indicate the total amount of information which is contained in the report about this. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The profiles process could be streamlined to allow more flexibility in the size of the teams and the duration of the visits. There needs to be broader agreement involving all team members on the procedures of the visits. The agenda for the visits needs to be carefully structured and tailored to the individual institution. There is a query on the need for annual visits to individual institutions; visits every two or three years may be adequate.</PARA>
<PARA>That is it. There is no mention of the concerns voiced by institutions which have arisen as a result of these visits. This skimpy report provides no information about the extent of government interference with and intervention into higher education which have had catastrophic results. We now have a bureaucratically administered system dominated by ministerial discretion on the advice of the Higher Education Council which can only report on how and with whom it undertakes visits to higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Education profiles are agreements which are negotiated annually between the Commonwealth and the institution, but the results of these profiles have been a disaster. The Government now has considerable scope in telling institutions what they can teach, what research they can undertake and how they should manage their affairs.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to address some brief remarks to the report on the death of Robert Joseph Walker by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. It is said by many that the death of Robert John Walker in Fremantle Prison should have been investigated by the Department of Corrective Services. The Royal Commission has suggested that such a course of action would be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that this prisoner died from a compression of his breathing apparatus after strong pressure was applied to his chest by several prison officers who objected to his singing and making music in his cell. It is admitted that he subsequently assaulted two of the officers. The Commissioner found that excessive force was used in subduing him and certainly in stopping him from struggling when he was face down on the ground outside. It would appear that at least two of the prison officers applied excessive pressure by sitting on his lower back while another prison officer compressed his chest. </PARA>
<PARA> This is another report in a long list of such occurrences. While we have heard today that the report of the Royal Commission contains no findings of intentional foul play in any of the incidents it reported on, there were numerous incidents such as this one where excessive force was used or where the Commissioners found negligence. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that this is one of a long list of cases in Western Australia in particular. I note in passing that there are four volumes of reports of incidents investigated by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody which have occurred in Western Australia compared with one volume for each of the other States. I believe that this lends considerable strength to the suggestion that an independent police complaints authority should be established in Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This report is not dissimilar to the previous one that we have discussed. It concerns the death of John Peter Pat who, after a fight in a Fremantle hotel, was taken to a juvenile criminal cell and met his death either shortly thereafter or as a result of injuries received in a scuffle with police officers following some arguments in the hotel bottle shop. The circumstances of this case indicate once again that the police force in Western Australia did not on this occasion exercise the care and responsibility that it should have in looking after prisoners in its care. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear from the evidence given that prison officers actually contributed to the cause of the altercation during which John Peter Pat received the injuries. Yet, subsequently the Police Commissioner refused to lay any further charges against the officers after they had been acquitted of manslaughter. It would appear that the force looks after its own and is not prepared to enforce the sorts of standards of care which we as a community can expect. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that this case was the one which led to the establishment of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. We have heard today that, quite apart from the judicial and legal system, this inquiry has opened up consideration of issues well beyond the legal system which certainly require reform. We as a community should look at the underlying causes which bring such a disproportionately high number of Aboriginal people into conflict with the law and, indeed, into custody. If the findings of that Royal Commission lead to our community reviewing the situation of our most disadvantaged group and community attitudes are changed to make Aboriginals equal, the deaths of these people and the work of the Royal Commission will not have been in vain. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak on the report on the operation of the War Crimes Act 1945 for the period to June 1990. This report is tabled pursuant to section 21 of the War Crimes Act 1945 which provides that the Attorney-General shall, as soon as practicable after 30 June each year, cause a report about the operations of the Act during the year ended 30 June to be prepared and cause a copy of that report to be laid before each House of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is almost the end of this financial year and it is almost time for the next annual report to be tabled. I wonder whether the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) might at some stage explain why it has taken some 10 1/2 months for this report to be tabled. The report is prepared in accordance with the War Crimes Act. It is prepared in a very easy to read manner. It is not a terribly lengthy report; it is not one that contains information that is particularly difficult to obtain. In fact, most of the information in this report is information that was subjected to examination at the Estimates committees in September last year. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder, then, whether the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has-as he is required to do by the War Crimes Act-in fact complied with section 21, which states that he has to, as soon as practicable after 30 June of each year, cause a report to be made and laid on the table. I would think that the Attorney-General has breached his obligations under the War Crimes Act. One might wonder whether one should not ask that the matter be referred to the Attorney-General to ascertain whether he has breached his obligations under the War Crimes Act. It would really seem that, by no stretch of the imagination, could the early part of May of the following year be considered to be as soon as practicable after 30 June 1990. I think that is something that should be looked at by the appropriate authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The War Crimes Act and the Special Investigations Unit that is set up under it is something that I have been somewhat interested in since coming to this Parliament. In the times that I have spoken on this matter I have said that we in this country should do nothing that would let criminals escape justice-particularly criminals involved in that horrific conflict which took place over the period from 1939 to 1945. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it has always seemed to me that the Special Investigations Unit will involve enormous expense for very little perceived result. I have heard on the radio that the head of the unit, Mr Greenwood QC-who I understand has a contract with the Government to head this Special Investigations Unit-has recently announced his resignation. I wonder what, if anything, prompted his resignation. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the costs of running the Special Investigations Unit for the period up to 30 June 1990 totalled some $7 1/2m. Additional money was paid in legal aid services. I calculated at the Estimates Committee hearing in September that if one added together all of the costs of the Special Investigations Unit-legal aid and the cost of other resources that have been made available by the taxpayer-some $16m has been spent. It seems to be a lot of money, as the expenditure of all of that money has resulted in only 12 cases which may proceed to prosecution. There has been only one prosecution brought forward to date, and that is subject to a challenge in the High Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders about the sensibleness of bringing forward legislation like this and instituting a Special Investigations Unit whose only tangible result seems to have been to pay a lot of lawyers, consultants and public servants a lot of money with very little result. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Paper No. 6 is the Industry Commission report on recycling, volume one. Other honourable senators have addressed this report and comprehensively considered its contents, but it seems to me that some other points are worth making. Even in glancing at the introduction I can see some outstanding points which should be brought to the notice of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the introduction to the report there is a graph which depicts the extent of recycling in Australia. At first glance it may seem that there are some discrepancies. For example, we wonder why domestic PET plastic is very low on the scale of recycling. The reason is that the recycling of that product means considerable net costs to society as the transport costs associated with this material are high. That is the sort of point which is made throughout this report and it is a point worth making. </PARA>
<PARA> I have seen newspaper articles about this report, the theme of which could be generally summarised as saying that not all recycling is necessarily good and not all recycling is the same as other recycling. This particular example of PET plastic is one reason why we should critically evaluate the concept of recycling to see what we are trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of fact, I think it would be more productive to consider recycling in a different light. Perhaps we could consider it as a productivity improvement. When the term `productivity improvement' is referred to in other spheres we quite often assume that it means achieving a greater degree of effort and energy from employees in an organisation. Similarly, if we are able to extract further productivity or more, or further, uses from any given resource, then that is a definition of recycling. </PARA>
<PARA> Further uses can be achieved from a raw material. Even after it has been used as one product, it is still possible to use that product again and achieve an increase in productivity from that raw material. With that in mind, a critical evaluation of whether that is worth while would include the close examination of the sorts of costs-both to society and the producer-that are associated with re-using that raw material. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I can make from a brief reading of this report is that major advances in recycling would accrue from the increased focus on industrial waste, organic materials and especially building materials. I am sure, Madam Acting Deputy President, that you would be familiar with the amount of land fill space that is occupied in municipal waste collection areas by building materials which could be re-used for all sorts of other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I am on that point I should mention that many local government authorities are still not charging enough to cover the real costs of disposal. Quite often the costs of establishing land waste disposal areas have been ignored by local government authorities. For example, some of the emphasis now is on kerbside collection. If the charges for household kerbside disposal are based on rates, rather than volume or value, then there is no incentive at the moment to reduce those amounts. But, thankfully, we are seeing a situation where in the near future it may be possible to charge households according to the amount of volume that they generate as waste and so encourage the kerbside separation of waste materials and increase their potential for recycling. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are looking at the actual costs of re-using raw materials and gaining greater productivity from them, it should be apparent that in outlying areas the costs of collection of waste paper, for example, often exceed the benefits. Therefore, we wonder whether those areas should not pay the recovery costs in the cost of the product itself when they purchase it. </PARA>

<PARA> That the resolution of the Senate of 31 May 1990 relating to the broadcasting by television stations of Senate proceedings be modified by omitting condition 6 in paragraph (3), which prohibits the broadcasting of the adjournment debate. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this motion is to make a change that perhaps we all should have made a year and a bit ago when we decided to allow television into parliament in a live sense. As we all know, Question Time in the Senate, and now having been followed by the House of Representatives-which is an appropriate order in which these things should be done--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hear, hear, says one of my colleagues. It is not called the lower house without good reason, some would say-although it would be unkind to say that at this hour of the night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the Senate decided before the House of Representatives that it was appropriate to let television cameras into this chamber. After all, representatives of the media can sit in the press gallery. Journalists from the print or the electronic media can repeat anything they have heard in this chamber and get a run with that in their chosen media. However, for a long time we somehow thought that, if proceedings in here were televised and people saw what really happened, it would be a bad thing. I do not want to dwell on this point because I am at a loss to explain why we thought that. I can see no cogent reason for coming to that conclusion-quite the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> I should have thought that, the geography of this nation being as it is, the concept of having a democratic parliamentary institution which people can enter, as some members of the public are here in the public gallery tonight, to see what is happening, would make it mandatory that we use television, a modern medium of communication-although not that modern-to ensure that those who could not afford to come to Canberra for the luxury of seeing whether their parliamentarians were doing the job could in another way see whether their parliamentarians were doing the job. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we have not encouraged television stations to take the access that perhaps they should. At the moment Question Time is televised on a rotational basis between here and the lower House on a one day on, one day off basis, and all the television stations are permitted to take excerpts from all the parliamentary proceedings, except for the adjournment debate. That is what this motion seeks to deal with: to allow the adjournment debate to be televised. There is no good reason at all why that should not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an extension of the original motion to acknowledge that the geography of this country demands that people have access to this Parliament. They do not all have the money to come here and see it happening on a regular basis-quite the opposite in the recession we needed to have. Therefore, Parliament should be accessible to the people through all forms of the media, including television. There is no reason why television should be disadvantaged over the radio and print media. That is why we have done this, and that is why I seek to extend the access of the television media to the adjournment debate. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that has been very noticeable with allowing television cameras into this chamber for the rest of the parliamentary proceedings has been the competition that it has introduced. No longer can Michelle Grattan, Paul Lyneham or someone else who is here in Canberra and has the opportunity to come and sit in the press gallery write a version of what happens with no fear of competition. Any journalist around the nation can turn on the television, see what happens at Question Time and write a competing article-and if not write a competing article, make a different assessment of what either Michelle Grattan or any journalist one likes to name has said-and, having made that competing assessment, share it with his or her colleagues so that we have some competition in the media. </PARA>
<PARA> Those in the Press Gallery of Canberra have had a monopoly on the proceedings in this place for far too long, and the televising of proceedings has put an end to that monopoly. It has allowed other people, albeit only on every alternate day, to see what is happening at Question Time. At least all Australians, and other journalists in the news and current affairs programs, can make their own assessment of what has been happening here. So the introduction of competition in the media has been a good thing. I do not see why television should not be introduced into the adjournment debate to encourage a bit more competition in the coverage of that as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The only change this motion would make is that it would let my mouth, your mouth, Mr Acting Deputy President, and Senator McMullan's mouth move. At the moment, if one of us wants to say something on the adjournment debate which happens to be newsworthy and which the electronic media wants to run first thing in the morning-a difficult thing to do at 10.30 at night-if we happen to strike it lucky and do that, a stationary picture of ourselves is put on the screen and a live tape of what has been said is re-run. </PARA>
<PARA> How can there possibly be a debate on this? I am amazed that we need a debate about simply letting the mouth and facial features on that stationary picture move so that people can see parliament live as opposed to just a picture of who said something and the words they spoke. I raise an example of where that is important. We all know that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has been prone, prior to developing aspirations to the Lodge, to call people sleazebags and scumbags and otherwise use what one might call, if one were in an ungracious mode, reasonably vitriolic language. </PARA>
<PARA> So it was with some pride that I watched the 7.30 Report with Paul Lyneham the other day covering the Hawke-Keating leadership crisis and battle, which played excerpts from Parliament of both these men. Instead of being told through the print media that Keating was a tough performer who used a bit of strong language to put people back in their box and that Hawke was basically pretty weak in defence of himself, the public could see the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) coming to the dispatch box in the lower House yet again-I think this was the second time this was shown-apologising for having made a mistake. The shoulders were down. They could see the body language; they could see the import of what was happening in a way that a print journalist tries to convey in his or her words but cannot always do. They did not have to read about it; they could see it. </PARA>
<PARA> When Paul Keating came to his defence and struck a chord amongst his colleagues because finally they had someone at the table who could do a better job than their Prime Minister of defending the situation that they were in, what did we see? We saw the Paul Keating we have all read about. I am proud that I moved the motion in this place that encouraged us to televise Parliament, which occasioned the House of Representatives to follow. Had that not happened, what we would not have seen was Paul Keating leaning over the table, almost climbing over the table towards his opponent, pointing his finger as though it were a dagger, saying, `You fraud' and pausing for a moment. Of course, we would not allow that in here, this being the upper House and called that with good reason. </PARA>
<PARA> He did not just call his opponent a fraud. He then came back and lunged forward again and said, `You disgusting fraud'. I am pleased that Australians were able to see that. This is the man who wants to run this country. I think it is a good thing that they can make their assessment, and not just of the substantive elements of policies that can be conveyed through the radio and print media. Through the television they can see some of the body language and some of the other aspects of a personality that can be conveyed through television which cannot be conveyed through radio or the print media. </PARA>
<PARA> So when I say that all this change will do is allow one's mouth to move if one happens to say something sensible enough on the adjournment to get coverage, that is true. However, I do not mean by saying, `all this change will do', that it is a small change in its impact, because it is a very big change. It will allow people in their lounge rooms, in milk bars, in hotels, in any place they choose to be where there is a television set, to see in part what is happening in their Parliament, and that is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people have raised with me the concept that if we allow the adjournment debate to be televised we will all be kept here until 1 o'clock in the morning because all the windbags in this place will speak ad infinitum, at length, until everybody is bored to tears, with the expectation that because they have spoken on the adjournment debate, and now it is televised, they will somehow get on television. You and I know, Mr Acting Deputy President, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) knows, that that proposition is rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA> The media will not cover a lousy speech simply because it can be run on television. There are thousands of lousy speeches made here and in the other chamber that do not make it to television for a very good reason, and the same criteria will apply to coverage of the adjournment debate. I do not make a case for saying that criteria is always the best. I have seen coverage of lousy speeches on television, but what I am trying to say is that the simple fact of televising does not ensure coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> What some then would say is, `But you are encouraging people to come in and do something dramatic that will get them on television'. People can do something dramatic now and they will get front page coverage in the print media and a hearing on the radio. There is little to be gained by diminishing one's standing amongst one's colleagues simply to get a short grab on a television program. I would have thought there was quite a lot to be lost in terms of career prospects. I think those people who raised those arguments are reasonably short-sighted. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another reason why we should allow the televising of excerpts of parliamentary proceedings to include the adjournment debate. I made that point the other day in a debate about Senator Bolkus's alleged improprieties in meddling in a tender matter-namely, it seems to me that a number of us here have lost sight of the fact that the whole purpose of this building, of the staff and the parliamentarians is not simply to have an Executive to shadow Executive bash. </PARA>
<PARA> There are individuals here, elected as parliamentarians, who have something to say. It may not be what the leaders or the executives of their parties want them to say. Like it or not, we are all elected by the same percentage of people. Some of the people on Senator McMullan's side might look at me and ask, `How did she get elected?'. Equally, some of us over here might look at some of the people on the Government side and say, `How did they get elected?'. But the bottom line, as drawn to my attention by the Clerk of this place when I joined the Senate, Mr Alan Cumming Thom, is this: all honourable senators are elected by the same percentage. Senator Hill, Senator Button, Senator Foreman and Senator Zakharov are not elected by a greater percentage than I am. We all have equal rights to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> We entertain this notion. I hope that it is eventually a reality. At the moment, most of the business in this place is Government Business, for good and proper reasons. Every now and then we have General Business, which is tick-tack between the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. But there are still individual senators who might have matters they want to raise that do not fit into Government Business or General Business because they are not endorsed by their own Party or by the Democrats. Heaven knows, it has taken a bit of time to get endorsement for this motion to become General Business. Perhaps I will not say any more about that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate that we have the adjournment debate televised. That is where people, who should have an equal right to express their views, can have their say. Why should those who, because of the vagaries of party politics and the party machines, have not been elected to the Executive, miss out on the chance to have their say on a matter that they think is important? Why should they have a lesser coverage of their matters than the matters that are dealt with up until the end of Senate business? No reason can be offered in answer to that. </PARA>
<PARA> If people want to say things in a stupid, outrageous and gaudy manner, simply to attract attention to themselves, they will be judged accordingly, not only by their peers in here-because we must not forget that this is not the most important place in the world-but also by their electorates. Let us encourage their electorate to see them behaving in this manner if that is what they are going to do. I am not prepared to say that that is what I think they are going to do. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, because the nature of the geography of this country is such that not all people can afford to come here at any time to see what is happening in their Parliament, it is very important that Australians around Australia have access to their Parliament, not only through the print and radio media, but through the television medium as well. I see no reason for distinguishing between that business which happens to be Government Business, or business organised through argy-bargy between the major parties, and that of an individual senator. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important to extend coverage to the adjournment debate so that the media are subject to the same competition in covering it as they are in covering the rest of Parliament. In one sense, I see not much to be lost by simply allowing someone's mouth to move, but, in another sense, I see an enormous amount to be gained in terms of what the public can assess through coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, I made the point of how important I think it is that individual parliamentarians have the right to be covered in the same way as the major parties, the Executive and shadow Executive. Lastly, I made the point that those who seek to disparage this move by saying, `You can't trust senators. They will not do the right thing. Covering this on the television will all end up in a disgraceful mess', do a grave injustice to their colleagues. In the event that they were right, which only putting this proposal to the test will tell, the right of televising an adjournment could be withdrawn. Let me conclude by urging all senators to support this motion, to put televising to the test and to give it a run. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Foreman says, especially the Whips. He is perfectly able to express that on his own behalf if he wishes. I am not so ambitious as to speak on behalf of such powerful people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to say a few things about the motion to express my own views, of course, but also, in some part, the views of colleagues because I know that there is an agreement that we will try to vote on this matter tonight. Not everybody will be able to express their views, so I will try to say some things on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> First, I want to express a concern about what this debate-not this particular motion-says about our priorities. We seem to have a great propensity to talk about ourselves all the time. I do not agree with Senator Macdonald's and Senator O'Chee's motions, but I accept that they are about issues of profound social importance. I think democracy and the operation of the Parliament are matters of importance also. But how is it that we spend so much time talking about ourselves and how we manage our business, when really we could be talking about much more important issues? I do not want to dwell on that at great length, but it seems to me that again and again we come back to a wonderful preoccupation with ourselves and with our enthusiasm for the belief that the rest of the people have to hear what we have to say. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on behalf of Government members I say that we at least appreciate the fact that on this occasion we have had some notice of this motion as against the ambushes that have taken place when such issues have been discussed in the past, and which have caused a little anxiety. To get to the substance of the motion, let me reiterate the principle which I put forward here on other occasions when the general question of the televising of Parliament was discussed. I have the view that the Parliament is a public forum; that it ought to be available to anybody who wishes to report, broadcast or telecast it; and that no-one should be required to broadcast, telecast or report it. </PARA>
<PARA> From that it is clear that I do not have fundamental in-principle opposition to what Senator Vanstone is saying, because, if someone happens to be in Canberra, he can walk in here and listen to what is said. Someone can sit up in the press gallery, on behalf of Australian Associated Press, and report the proceedings to everybody, so I am not vehemently opposed to television having that right to do that as well. The principle is that this is a public forum. If somebody wants to take photographs of it or to film it, they ought to be able to. That is the principle involved. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end, if there had been more time for me to talk to my colleagues, I might have been disposed to vote that way, but there are some points to the contrary which I wish to put about simply proceeding to make this small excision rather than dealing with a more comprehensive body of reforms, of which this might have been one. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remember that since 1946 when the initiatives were taken about the broadcasting of the Parliament, there have always been separate rules concerning the adjournment debate. It has always been considered to be different from the rest of the debates, not just because the Executive does not control it-I shall come back to this-but because there are a number of options for backbenchers in both the House of Representatives and the Senate to speak and be reported and, in these more modern times, to be telecast. I think that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been the view that the nature of an adjournment debate is somewhat different. In the three years that I have been here I do not think that any of the more outstanding and colourful adjournment speeches have come forward. Those of us who have been students of politics for a long time can remember people, such as the then honourable member for Hunter, Mr James, who was rather famous for colourful adjournment speeches. I am not so concerned that the telecast of them would have lowered the standard of the Parliament but his speeches did have the capacity to adversely affect some individuals. I think that a study of the nature of speeches in the adjournment debate has some significance as to why people tend to deal with it separately. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a different thing to be reported in the newspaper in the circumstance where one has equal opportunity to respond to a matter that is raised. In my experience, a journalist tends to give individuals a chance to respond before reporting a matter, but usually it is not so easy to have equal opportunity to appear on the television news in response to something that is a good bit of footage. We all know that inevitably-irrespective of whether it is quite proper-a bit of colourful footage is sometimes more likely to make the news than a substantial, considered response. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone referred to this. She did not agree with it, otherwise she would not be moving the motion, but it is true that concern has been expressed to me by a number of honourable senators about the impact that such a change might have on the duration and the nature of the debate taking place on the adjournment. I suspect that might be what my colleague Senator Foreman was referring to when he indicated that the Whips were less than enthusiastic about this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, while it is true that intelligent students of the media might realise that they would be much better getting up and making a short and effective speech rather than a long and windy one, we do tend to have colleagues-of course, none of us in this chamber at present would be included in that category-who think that all of their words are golden and therefore we have to hear all of them in half hour bursts in the adjournment debate regularly. The capacity to choose the most effective 150 of them to speak for a minute and a half does not seem to be the most pressing requirement and it does not seem to be--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Vanstone" NAMEID="7E4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator Vanstone</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vanstone might think that and I might think that, but my colleagues and I are not persuaded that those honourable senators will not think that. That is what is likely to affect their activities and their decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may affect not only the duration but also the nature of the speeches. A number of the speeches in the adjournment debate that are made are not designed, in a sense, for substantial media coverage. They are issues that people feel are important, but they are very much of local significance and honourable senators might consider that they do not have another forum in which to raise those issues, although there are other forums that can be used. The adjournment is one which is sometimes used. Speeches made in the adjournment debate also provide an opportunity for major policy statements by independent senators, for example, who otherwise may feel that they do not have the opportunity to get these things on the record so effectively. They make half-hour speeches that most of us might not wish to listen to. Under the Standing Orders, they have the right to make them, but I doubt whether they would make riveting television. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two concerns. One is about the distinction between the nature of the debate that takes place on the adjournment and the historic recognition that that has had, and the other is about the impact that such changes will have on the duration and nature of the debate. I do not want to go into that at great length because it would unduly take up the time of the Senate on a matter on which, as I said, we have agreed that we wish to get a vote tonight. If we are to look at these sorts of changes, we ought to be doing it in the context of a review about the way the whole of the adjournment debate operates in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree with the House of Representatives model where there are five-minute speeches and only six per night so that the business is guaranteed to finish at 11 o'clock. I do not think that restricting the number of people who can speak is appropriate. Apart from anything else, if the sixth person gets up and gives me a bucketing, I would not want to be unable to get up and reply. In the three years that I have been here, I know that honourable senators from both sides of the chamber have come down to speak in the adjournment debate, including Senator Foreman recently, and have responded to things that other honourable senators have said during the adjournment debate, and I think that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I do think that the House of Representatives has been sensible in reviewing the length of the speeches which people can make in the adjournment debate. The time when people need half an hour to speak in the adjournment debate, if it ever existed, has long passed. If a package of changes included a reduction in the length of time of speeches in the adjournment debate, part of it would tend to counteract any impact for more people to speak or for people to speak more often in that debate. That is not an unreasonable proposition to consider in the circumstance where we have proliferated the opportunities for back bench senators and independent senators to make contributions on issues that are not directly related to legislation before the Parliament. For example, we have the regular matters of public interest lunchtime discussions. It was originally considered that that was a time when non-controversial matters were to be discussed. That seems to me to be somewhat honoured in the breech. That does not horrify me. It is a forum that people are entitled to use. The distinction between that and the adjournment debate escapes me a little. </PARA>
<PARA> Because I do not want to speak for long on this matter, I shall sum up by saying that some of my colleagues are very strongly opposed to this proposition. I want to record that view on their behalf. I am not opposed to it in principle but I am concerned that it has been considered by committees of the Parliament on several occasions. In the time I have had to look at the proposition, I have seen that there was consideration in 1974 and again in 1986. The 1986 review did suggest that this question that Senator Vanstone has raised should be considered, not then in relation to television but in relation to the adjournment as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> We do seem to be getting into the position where there is one of these debates every session. We had discussions last May and last October and here we are again. I do not know whether that will be the case next October. I would prefer to see changes such as this made with a broader base of support than it looks to me is likely to occur on this occasion, as I understand the feelings of those in the chamber. If we are to make such a change I would prefer to see it done in conjunction with a package of changes, particularly as to the way in which we manage the adjournment debate itself so that we are not just having a change that will have one impact, which many people think is likely to be adverse, concerning the direction and nature of the debate without any compensating changes. </PARA>
<PARA> If this proposition was in a more comprehensive package of changes, we would be less concerned about it. For those reasons, although I am not opposed to this in principle, I am not disposed to vote for it at this stage. On behalf of most, if not all, Government senators I can say that to a greater or lesser extent that reflects the views of all my colleagues, many of whom are vehemently opposed to it and others who, like me, are not so vehemently opposed but are not convinced that in the absence of a broader package of measures, this is an appropriate motion to be passing at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Vanstone articulately and entertainingly summarised some of the main arguments in favour of the motion. I am of the view that all parliamentary proceedings should be televised live, and so I ask myself: under the present rules which apply, what is different about adjournment debates that we have every night and the rest of the day's debates?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, probably one distinguishing feature, to use Senator Vanstone's words, is that Senator Kemp's mouth moves every night. But apart from that, look at the other avenues we have. We have Question Time, which I find to be very rehearsed, very strictly controlled, with rigid formulas, too many dorothy dixers and too many vexatious points of order. Then we can look at the House of Representatives grievance debates on Thursdays and the matters of public interest debates in the Senate which are televised and can be used at the moment. One has to ask oneself how it can be logical to deny us the opportunity to televise the adjournment debates which can be very useful and can be used constructively. I can cite the way in which Senator McLean, having tried other avenues of parliamentary procedure, used the adjournment debate to bring the important matter of Westpac malpractice before the Parliament and, in that way, before the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But it is not just a matter of self-interest; I think it is a matter of public interest. It is in the public interest that politicians and parliamentary processes be exposed, warts and all, in graphic, visual form. I acknowledge that there was certainly a novelty effect when Question Time was first televised. It was very obvious that people had bought new suits, they were very conscious of their hairstyles and their colour combinations, and they were getting all sorts of advice on what coloured clothing clashed with the leather behind them. But, I think that novelty has worn off. In the same way, I think the novelty of keeping the Senate here until 1 a.m., 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. would soon wear off as well. That happens now. I do not think the televising of debate would cause an extension of that beyond the bounds of normal human endurance, and I am sure that we would all make a point to that effect if it were to go too far. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I am right in saying that there really is not, as Senator McMullan said, a different view on the treatment of adjournment debates-that there has always been the legal right for the print medium and radio to cover adjournment debates, and that the main reason Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio does not cover them at the moment is the nightmare of irregular finishing times faced by programmers. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan expressed some words of caution, which I did note and which I think we all should note. But I think his reliance on the fact that one has a right of response in the print media is pretty thin. It really does not happen for the majority of us. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just touched on his argument about the duration of the debate. I am attracted to his promise of a review of the whole adjournment process but I do not think it is about to happen in the short term. I suspect that we will be waiting a long time. I would like to ask him to review Question Time while he is doing it. In the meantime, we have this illogical constraint upon us. I guess I am summing up the Australian Democrats view that all parliamentary proceedings should be televised live and, therefore, we support Senator Vanstone's motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating a motion which seeks to amend a motion which was passed just on a year ago and which was amended in October last year. It makes me wonder why it has become necessary to seek to change the practice of televising Parliament when we have had so very little experience in this area. What is the hurry? I know of no clamour from people in the electorate who feel that they need to be able to watch the adjournment debate or excerpts from it. Like Senator McMullan, I can see the possible advantages and disadvantages that may arise from televised broadcasting of the adjournment debate but I do not think we need to make such a drastic and possibly costly change to procedures so early in our experience of parliamentary telecasts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps if Australia adopts cable television-and that is another argument-we may find, as has been found in the United States of America, a greater demand for such services. But I doubt it. I believe that it would have been more helpful if Senator Vanstone had perhaps referred the matter back to the Standing Committee on Procedure for reconsideration, rather than use the time of the Senate on what Senator Powell referred to in an earlier debate as `not the most gripping issue ever raised in the Senate'. She was talking about the much wider debate on the principle of televising Parliament, not just televising the adjournment debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It was Senator Vanstone who, to her credit I might say, moved the original motion to televise proceedings, including the condition that she now seeks to remove-that is, the exemption of the adjournment debate. In my view, her most compelling argument then was the argument on the right of the public to have access to the proceedings of Parliament, to see it as well as to hear it. But, to my mind, the right of access does not necessarily extend to the adjournment debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In support of that point, I would like to refer briefly to the history of parliamentary broadcasts in this country. We were one of the first countries, at least in the English speaking world, to take that up. The first broadcast of the Federal Parliament took place in July 1946 after a recommendation was tabled a few days earlier by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. The first mention of disagreement on the broadcasting of the adjournment occurred during debate on the report. I quote from the Hansard of 5 July 1946, when the late Mr Harold Holt, who had been a member of the Committee, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) that the exclusion of debates on the motion for the Adjournment of the House is undesirable-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Menzies had earlier referred to occasions, which we do not see any more, where the Prime Minister or the Minister on duty would actually adjourn the House early in order to allow for a particularly important adjournment debate. Those days have gone forever, I think. The quote continues:</PARA>
<PARA>but as many of the speeches made on that motion relate to one electorate only, and as the debates come on at a very late hour, it was thought that, at the beginning, at any rate, they should be excluded. It was also thought desirable that the listening public and the broadcasting authorities should know approximately when the broadcasting for the day would finish. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the point mentioned by Senator Kernot. That same Committee reported again a few days later, on 16 July, specifically on the matter that we are considering tonight. On that occasion, the Committee Chairman, who was the Speaker of the House of Representatives, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 2 of the First Report made it mandatory for the broadcast to continue until the adjournment is moved by a Minister. The committee examined the times at which the adjournment had been moved over a recent period of 12 months, and found that 47 per cent of the motions had been made before 10.30 p.m., 41 per cent between 10.30 p.m. and 11.30 p.m., and 12 per cent after 11.30 p.m. The committee also ascertained that the cost of extending the broadcast past 11.30 p.m., the time at which the second national stations normally close down-</PARA>
<PARA>which, of course, was a factor then, too-</PARA>
<PARA>would be approximately #50 an hour. </PARA>
<PARA>The sum of #50 an hour in 1946 was very big money. Further, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It was considered that, even though the number of occasions on which the adjournment is moved later than 11.30 p.m. is likely to be relatively small, the continuation of the broadcast to a late hour cannot, as a general practice, be justified. </PARA>
<PARA>That is still the position today. When Senator Vanstone moved the original motion a year ago she referred to the question of cost when she cited the investment that Parliament has made in installing the sound and vision system in the House and implied that, as the capital cost had already been met, the cost of televising would be minimal. One matter that needs to be looked at before extending the times would be the additional labour costs involved and the consideration of whether any benefit gained justified that additional cost. It may be that such calculations have been made-I do not know. However, they would have to be part of any consideration of this proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly those staff do, yes. The question of rising costs brings me to the issue over which I have grave doubts; that is, the possible effect of televising on the length and nature of the adjournment debate. Certainly that debate, as has been mentioned already, gives us the opportunity to raise matters that we cannot easily raise during the proceedings set down on the Notice Paper. There are also restrictions on what can be raised during the adjournment debate under Standing Orders. Much of what is raised is really parish-pump stuff, even in this chamber, aimed at a particular part of an honourable senator's constituency-whether that constituency be his or her State or Territory, part of that State or Territory, or a particular group in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can see the possibility of an exponential increase in the time taken in the adjournment debate, particularly as we allow a generous time for speakers on the adjournment. Instead of having to wait around until 11.30 or midnight-it is not only the Whips who have to wait around-we may find ourselves here more regularly into the early hours of the morning. Perhaps a condition of agreeing to broadcast the adjournment debate might be to shorten the time limit for speeches. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I note, too, that honourable senators seem to prefer the adjournment debate to the Thursday lunchtime discussion of matters of public interest, which often, as happened today, is underutilised. The adjournment debate is also the most likely occasion for controversial material to be raised. The thought of being on television might well encourage some of the would-be stars among us to further sensationalise. Thus the broadcast of the debate may provide a greatly increased workload for the Standing Committee of Privileges, as well as causing even longer debates, to which we are subjected already sometimes, either the same evening or the following evening when a claim made leads to a counterclaim or a defence-sometimes ad infinitum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This assumes that the electronic media will be interested in the debate. If they are not, what is the point of the whole exercise? I think a bit more thought and study needs to go into the motion before we vote on it. I think it is unfortunate that we are voting on it tonight. I would prefer a proposal to come from the Procedure Committee rather than have a motion from a senator who, to me, does not seem to have thought it through-there are arguments both for and against the motion we have before us tonight-or perhaps a modified version of the motion. I believe that the motion requires and deserves further consideration before a decision is made. </PARA>

<PARA> An interesting matter was raised in a committee meeting which I attended recently. Mr Hill from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) indicated, much to my surprise and the surprise of most members of the committee, that people meters show that the number of people watching Parliament Question Time varies from between 0 per cent, 1 per cent and 2 per cent. While that seems to be a very small number, if we calculate that out across the number of people in Australia, it is quite a large number. It is interesting, as Mr Hill pointed out, that the Australian-which is an quality newspaper read by people who are very interested in what happens in our society-is read by about 150,000 people. The ABC estimates that 150,000 people watch Parliament Question Time and that many of those 150,000 people prefer to watch the late night version, which comes on at about midnight, rather than the afternoon version.

<PARA> (a) notes that the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) said, at the time of World Heritage listing of the north Queensland tropical rainforest, that no one would suffer as a direct result of World Heritage listing;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes further that in the Courier Mail of 4 May 1991, notice was given of a total clearance auction of all sawmill equipment, mobile plant, motor vehicles, office furniture, computers, etcetera, at the APS sawmill in Ravenshoe;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) expresses concern that after an outlay of $7.6 million of taxpayers money the Federal Government has completely failed:</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) to achieve any single benefit or assistance for the town of Ravenshoe to compensate for the suffering caused as a direct result of the World Heritage listing; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) is of the opinion that an inquiry should be instituted into, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The economic and social impact of World Heritage Listing on the Queensland Wet Tropics Region,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) all matters involving and incidental to the giving of grants and loans to the operators of the APS mill at Ravenshoe and to the expenditure of the same,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the Government's management, audit, reporting and supervision of the expenditure of $7.6 million given and loaned to the owners of the APS mill at Ravenshoe,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the closure of the main employment source at Ravenshoe and the resulting social and economic effect on the town of Ravenshoe,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) the prospect of new Government funded projects which will provide employment for those displaced from the Ravenshoe Mill,</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) further Commonwealth Government assistance to alleviate the social, business and economic problems in the town of Ravenshoe resulting from World Heritage listing of the rainforests, including the results flowing from the closure of the mill. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion seeks to do something about the catastrophe that has befallen the town of Ravenshoe, to correct that catastrophe and to give some hope to the people who live in that community. My colleague Senator O'Chee was to move a motion also dealing with Ravenshoe which is complementary to my motion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite obvious, having regard to the time, that there will not be the debate on this particular motion that I hoped there might be. We had agreed, by arrangement with the Australian Democrats, that we would restrict our speeches to a certain time to give the maximum number of people the opportunity to speak. As we are starting the debate 10 minutes before the adjournment, it is quite obvious that there will be no opportunity for anyone to speak at length on it. There will not even be time for me to finish the restricted speech that I had planned to give on this matter, which I consider to be very important, as do the people of Queensland, particularly the people of north Queensland and the Atherton Tablelands. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion that I have moved asks the Senate to do four things. First, it calls upon the Senate to note that the previous Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, now the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, said at the time the World Heritage listing of the north Queensland rainforest was being introduced that no person would suffer as a direct result of the World Heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that promises made by Ministers of the Government, in implementing government programs, should be adhered to. It is a sad indictment of our political system in Australia that people have little confidence in the commitments and undertakings that politicians give because they are often broken. The comment of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that no child would live in poverty by the 1990 is a particular example of why people do not trust politicians any more. Senator Richardson's comment that no-one would suffer as a result of World Heritage listing is a very sour joke at the present time to the people of far north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> To walk down the streets of Ravenshoe and other towns in the area and suggest to those people that none of them has suffered as a result of World Heritage listing will bring a very angry and even aggressive response. As businesses close down and families lose not only their life savings but also their houses, cars and dignity, as unemployment queues continue to increase, as the people of Ravenshoe refer to themselves more and more as a social service community, as youth crime continues to increase, no person in Ravenshoe can accept that he has not suffered as a result of World Heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be unfair to blame all of the woes of the town on the World Heritage listing of the rainforest, but it is certainly a major cause. The people of Ravenshoe, in their current plight, believe that their situation is a direct result of World Heritage listing. It is not the case that anyone in Australia believes that we should not prefer our rainforests in far north Queensland and elsewhere, but the people of Ravenshoe believe that they have been unfairly treated in that their way of life, their employment, the sort of community they have known for many years, have all disappeared as a result of a Government decision. It is therefore important that the Senate should note particularly Senator Richardson's comment that no-one would be adversely affected by World Heritage listing and that that promise has not been adhered to and that Senator Richardson has not been able to deliver to the people of that community the commitment he gave at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the motion that I have moved tonight calls upon the Senate to note that an advertisement has appeared in a Queensland newspaper advertising a total clearance at auction of all sawmill equipment from the sawmill at Ravenshoe. That in itself is not an earth-shattering piece of news or happening, but it is the final death knell for the long saga that has been the Ravenshoe downward spiral since World Heritage time. I give credit where credit is due: the Government did in one way attempt to preserve the timber mill as an employment source in Ravenshoe but, in spite of this and all the other attempts, an offer made by a consortium backed by the Government to purchase that mill from the Westpac Bank, the mortgagee in possession, has been rejected. The Westpac Bank, through its receivers, has now indicated that it is no longer interested in selling the Ravenshoe Mill as a going concern and that it will be sold piecemeal. That means that the mill will never operate again and that the only regular and permanent source of employment in that community will be lost forever. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the motion asks that the Senate express its concern at the fact that, for an outlay of some $7.6m of taxpayers' money-your money and mine, Mr Deputy President, and the money of every other taxpayer in this community-that the Government has poured into Ravenshoe, not one iota, not one single benefit, has resulted. That is not a very good investment in anyone's language. It needs to be noted by the Senate with concern that the Government has spent $7.6m of taxpayers' money and has not achieved a single benefit for the town of Ravenshoe. The Government has failed to ensure the continued operation of the Ravenshoe Mill, which it was given $7.6m to do, and it has failed in any other way to achieve any single benefit. I think that needs to be brought home to the Senate, and the Senate should acknowledge that by expressing concern that that amount of money can be spent without any benefit at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the motion calls upon the Senate to express an opinion-only an opinion at this stage-that an inquiry should be instituted into a number of issues. I make the point for Senator Coulter's benefit that this is not a motion to refer the matter to a Senate committee but simply calls on the Senate to express an opinion that an inquiry should be held to look into a certain number of issues which are listed in the motion. One of them is the economic and social impact of World Heritage listing of the Queensland wet tropics region, a matter on which I intended to elaborate more fully, but time will prevent me from doing so. The motion also seeks to have the inquiry consider all matters involving and incidental to the giving of grants and loans to the operators of the APS mill at Ravenshoe and to the expenditure by the operators of the mill. It also seeks an inquiry into the Government's management-or should I say mismanagement-audit, reporting and supervision of the expenditure of that $7.6m of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken privately to Senator Coulter, who has some concern about this matter. I am sure that the Government, if it were to respond to this, would say that there has been a police inquiry instituted already and that the Director of Public Prosecutions is looking into the matter. Although the Government indicated as long ago as 16 October that this matter would be referred to the Attorney-General for investigation into what happened to this $7.6m of taxpayers' money, and that legal proceedings would be instituted if appropriate, nothing of any substance has been reported back to this chamber since that time. It is not for the want of inquiring. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a long list here, which because of a shortage of time I shall not read as I had intended to, of occasions since 16 October, when this matter was raised in this Parliament by me and my colleagues, particularly honourable senators from Queensland, on which inquiries have been made as to what has happened with the so-called investigation by the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions into what became of the $7.6m of taxpayers' money that the Government is suggesting has gone astray. I am really tired of waiting for the Government to do something. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, and her office keep telling me that something is about to happen, that we are going to be told something, that a report is about to come out and that the investigation is almost complete. I have been told that for many weeks and even months now. </PARA>
<PARA> Would you believe, Mr Deputy President, that the one person who could contribute the most to this investigation-the accountant at the mill through whom all the money should have gone and through whom all the expenditure should have gone-who would be quite crucial to any investigation, has not, even as late as yesterday, been interviewed by the Australian Federal Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Securities Commission or anyone else? That suggests to me that the investigation that we are being told about is not a very good one at all, and that is the most polite way I can put it. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator O'Chee gave a notice of motion in which the accountant's name is mentioned, and it is indicated there, as long ago as 11 April, that he had not been consulted. I had mentioned that in a speech in the Senate prior to that time. Even since then and since drawing the attention of the Senate to the fact that the most crucial witness had still not been approached, nothing has happened. It makes me think that the Government's suggestion that a proper, sensible and responsible inquiry is being held is not truthful and is not something that we can rely on any more. That is why I want the Senate to make its own inquiry into that particular matter and into other matters relating to the mismanagement, the fiasco, that the name `Ravenshoe' has now become synonymous with. </PARA>
<PARA> My time having almost expired, let me say briefly that the inquiry that I am asking the Senate to express its support for should look at some positive features of what we may be able to do to alleviate and overcome the distress that has been caused to the people of Ravenshoe. I ask that the Senate express an opinion that the inquiry should, as well as the other matters I have referred to, look at the prospect of newly-funded government projects and at whether further government assistance could be given to alleviate the quite substantial social, business and economic problems which have confronted the town of Ravenshoe since World Heritage listing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to refer to a matter of personal explanation that was made in the House of Representatives earlier today by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Bruce Lloyd. It is important to bring this matter to the attention the Senate. Earlier this week with regard to various questions and answers that were presented to Senate Estimates Committee D, a listing appeared for overtime payments for staff of members of parliament for the year 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1990 with a figure against Mr Lloyd's name of $84,795.64. That alerted Mr Lloyd to the matter. He knew it was obviously wrong because it did not accord with his records. He subsequently checked the matter with the Department of Administrative Services and was advised by a senior officer of that Department, Mr Paul O'Neill, that the figure was in fact wrong and that the correct figure was $38,424.46-a very dramatic reduction on the original figure which appeared against Mr Lloyd's name and very much in line with the expenditure that is normal for the type of office held by Mr Lloyd as the Deputy Leader of a parliamentary party. It is important that the Senate should note that quite serious affront and error which was on that occasion afforded to Mr Lloyd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the same information, I would also like to refer to figures that appear against the Northern Territory electorate with which, of course, I am very personally involved and in which I have some considerable degree of interest. With regard to the overtime expenditure for the year ended June 1990, it is very interesting to note that the figure was $11,535 for Senator Collins; $54,021 for the House of Representatives member, Mr Snowdon; and $13,590 for myself, also as a senator for the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> For the subsequent nine-month period of overtime expenditure to the end of March 1991, the appropriate figure shown for Senator Collins was $3,304.12. Of course, that takes into account the fact that during that period Senator Collins became a Minister and naturally his staff electorate figures changed. In the same period, for the member in the House of Representatives, Mr Snowdon, the figure was some $47,903.86 and for myself the figure was $12,779.38. </PARA>
<PARA> The comparative figures for electorate telephone costs in the Northern Territory for the same periods-that is the financial year ending June 1990 and the nine months to the end of March 1991-show that Senator Collins incurred costs of $14,034 and $10,924 respectively. For myself the respective figures were $16,973 and $16,113 and for Mr Snowdon, the figures were $40,491 and $43,762, showing him to be the highest spending member or senator in the Federal Parliament over those two periods. It is important to note that whilst Mr Snowdon enjoys a second electorate office and the provision of an additional member of staff, the increases are out of all proportion to the average figures reflected for these types of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures must also pose a number of serious questions. For example, with regard to the overtime expenditure I would point out that for the periods in question the President of the Northern Territory Labor Party, Ms Margaret Gillespie, was a member of Mr Snowdon's staff. Therefore, he should be asked to account in full for the figures that were applied there. Given the fact that, in relation to electorate telephone costs, Mr Snowdon is also listed as the highest spending member or senator in this Parliament, he should also be asked what proportion of the expenditure of well over $83,000 shown against his name in that period was for undertaking telephone polling. In fact, it is known that this is an activity that occurred from Mr Snowdon's office during that period. These are serious questions. I think the figures quite properly reflect that Senator Collins and myself are well within the appropriate average operating expenditures, but those shown against Mr Snowdon's name are out of all proportion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise briefly tonight some matters in relation to the Family Court in Adelaide. I notified the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, that I was going to raise these matters. He understands that and will look at the Hansard. I simply say that to make it clear that he has not left this place ignorant of the fact that these matters were to be raised. I think he understands how important these matters are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of the finer detail of this matter will be raised in the debate on the appropriations under Estimates Committee E, but there are certain matters that should be raised immediately which are perhaps not appropriate for the Estimates Committee report debate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President; I will remind you of that at the time, should you be in the chair. As I understand it from Estimates Committee E last week, Melbourne is still scheduled to get a new Family Court before Adelaide does. It is not just a new Family Court, it is actually a new Federal courts complex which will house the Federal Court of Australia, the Family Court of Australia and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Melbourne is now scheduled, although I do not think this was so originally, to get its Federal courts complex ahead of Adelaide. This was the case when I inquired in the Estimates in 1990 and it is still the case now; nothing has changed. This is despite the fact that it was made clear after the Estimates of 1990 and has been clear ever since that there are serious security problems with the Family Court premises in Adelaide. This is generated primarily by the fact that the court is situated on a number of floors of a public building. It is not a dedicated courts building and, as I understand it, there is some difficulty in sealing off the lifts, the stairwells and the fire stairs, et cetera. It is just impossible to seal this area off and make it a courts complex with access only through certain limited points. That has created certain serious problems that have been detailed here before. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate indicated in November 1990, when this matter was raised in the Appropriation debate, that the security problems in Adelaide were serious. It is obviously serious if judges lives are at risk-not that their lives are any more valuable than anyone else's. Nonetheless, it is a serious matter; just as it is a serious matter that lawyers, litigants and court staff may have their lives put at risk. Anyway, the Minister indicated that the security problems with the Family Court in Adelaide would be looked at and, to the extent that they could be, they would be attended to immediately. Also, these problems would be taken into account in any reassessment of whether Melbourne or Adelaide should get a new Federal courts building first. </PARA>
<PARA> Either the reassessment has not yet taken place because the situation has not changed and Melbourne is still going to get its Federal courts building before Adelaide does-the serious security problems which have been made clear to the Government in relation to the Adelaide Family Court should have occasioned a reassessment-or the reassessment has taken place and the Government has decided that the security problems in Adelaide are not serious enough to raise the priority of Adelaide over Melbourne. In any event, the Government is responsible for leaving the Adelaide court, its judges, lawyers, court staff and litigants at risk by not immediately beginning construction of a planned new Federal courts building in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> A site has been picked out in King William Street and it sits vacant. I suppose that some people are happy about that because it has been nicely grassed and the shrubs that were put there on a temporary basis are now beginning to look pretty close to a rainforest, they have been there that long. Nothing has been happening on this vacant site. The plans have been drawn, the professions have been consulted about the adequacy of the plans and the appropriate placement of various resources for the Family Court within those plans, and now the building must be built. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the offered excuses for Melbourne's dedicated Federal Court building proceeding first is workload. This is a load of rubbish. Any idiot knows that Victoria by virtue of its population will have more Family Court matters to deal with than South Australia. What the Department does not say in its answer to the Estimates Committee about workload is that Melbourne has more courts and more judges. The simple fact that it has more cases in itself does not warrant Melbourne having a building that will be put up ahead of that in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I was told by the Attorney-General's Department that there is another factor to take into account in considering which State should have its building put up first. Obviously there is not capital expenditure to spread around as some form of largess. Some priority has to be set. I was told that there is need for the Commonwealth to make a `major symbolic statement about its judicial presence' by putting up a building in one place or another. I think that is absolute baloney. What kind of statement will it make about the Commonwealth's judicial presence if a judge, lawyer, litigant or staff member in the Adelaide Registry is killed or seriously injured? I think that not putting up the building in Adelaide immediately continues to leave these lives at risk, and it is a risk that the Government should not be taking. It is certainly not a symbolic statement that the Government would want to have made. When finally some blood is spilt, the question will be asked: on whose hands does it fall? It will not fall on those people who consistently-and there are many in this category-have drawn this matter to the Government's attention. The Government may like to reflect on that. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that I am raising this matter tonight rather than next week is that next Monday a somewhat regrettable exercise will take place. Four of Adelaide's five Family Court judges will be trotting down from their chambers-well, they will probably go in Commonwealth cars-to the District Court in Adelaide where they will be giving evidence as to death threats or threats made against their lives-I presume that can be paraphrased as death threats-two years ago by a litigant in the Family Court. It is best not to go into the details of the person's name and the rest of it, but charges have been laid against a particular person that relate to death threats having been made against these four judges. They will be going down to another court to give evidence about this. It will be bad luck if anyone is expecting a hearing in the Family Court in Adelaide on Monday, as only one judge will be sitting for a good part of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> The defendant in this matter, without naming him, who allegedly made these threats-and that is what the hearing is about, whether threats were made-has a known history and experience of bomb disposal, apparently gained in Vietnam. That should highlight the seriousness of this matter. That is not to say that Adelaide court judges are the only ones who have threats made against them, but it highlights that all Family Court judges do have such threats. Therefore, when the Government, the Minister and everyone admit that security in the Adelaide court is inadequate, one should seek to highlight how ludicrous it is to be talking about making major symbolic statements about the Commonwealth's judicial presence in Melbourne, when the symbolic statement it and we as taxpayers should be making is that our judges, litigants and court staff will be safe in their courts. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent Adelaide Advertiser article of 27 April detailing the launch of a book on domestic violence entitled In Whose Interest? indicated that women using the Adelaide court feel harassed and insecure in those premises. This is not to say that we should accord women any more special treatment than we do men, but it is to say that by virtue of the fact that the court, as I understand it, does not deal with homosexual marriages, half of the people there feel insecure and at risk. That is a disgrace. They want to access their rights given to them by this Parliament, but they feel at risk. Why? Because security in the Adelaide court is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> Informed sources tell me that the Adelaide judges are very worried about this matter. I do not know, but perhaps the Adelaide judges are a bit like some of the South Australian parliamentarians. We sometimes feel that we get outvoted by the large numbers in the eastern States. Sometimes we feel that there are too many people from the eastern States and we are pleased to have the Senate where we have an equal voice with those States. Perhaps the Family Court judges in Adelaide need the equivalent of a Senate to make their voices heard in the internal politics of Family Court matters about the risk-not the risk that they personally run but, as I have stressed, the risk run by litigants, court staff and lawyers. I further understand from informed sources that the Attorney-General knows these facts well. Now the Minister should inform us what he will do about the position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up the Senate's time for too long, but I cannot let this opportunity pass without mentioning that today is the ninth day of May. We have just had a celebration in the Members Hall marking the third year of sitting in this Parliament. We celebrated 90 years of a democratic Federal government, and also the anniversary of the first sitting in Canberra of the Parliament in the old Parliament House in 1927. It greatly grieves me, as I go on my exercise trips out of this place down into the old rose garden, to go past old Parliament House and see a great community asset lying there idle, no doubt deteriorating and not in use. I think of a generation of children who were nine years old when we left there and who are now 12 but who, when anything is finally done, will be 15 or 16. That is a whole generation of youth who will not have the opportunity of going into the old building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I see old Parliament House as a place which, with vision, could be used as a museum, with an education centre. It could also contain a dining room, and people could visit that building and have the joy and thrill of sitting where Menzies sat, or maybe others may be thrilled to sit where Whitlam sat. I see that kind of experience as having a commercial value. People could pay to go there and the building could contain some commercial enterprises selling souvenirs and so on. I think that in this place we have almost reached the figure of two million visitors. Many of those people in addition to visiting this building would have made a pilgrimage to old Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the work carried out by the guides during our three years in this place. As a person who uses the guide services extensively for visiting groups and school groups, I know what those guides have done to increase people's knowledge of Parliament. I know that they explain that although there may be only two or three members present in this chamber, many of us are working in our rooms. The guides have helped to enlighten people on their visits. Only recently I met somebody who brought their children here for four hours, and that family came back the next day because the boys wanted to return because there was so much to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the credit is due to the Parliamentary Education Office and to the Parliament itself in the provision of services around the House. I am sure that some members have been to the area where the Apple Macintoshes are contained and have fiddled with the mice or mouses or whatever is the plural; I suppose that the word is `mice'. Many people put in their postcode to find out their local member. Many visitors view the film People in Parliament-and I do not mention this because Bob Collins and I are the two Senate stars-which is repeated over and over again. Although people show great interest in this place, old Parliament House lies idle. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day President Sibraa said to me in the corridors of this place-I suppose I should not mention conversations in corridors-how exciting it could be if some of the new modern technology could be used to put three-dimensional images to the speeches that we have on tape, as well as some of the new techniques that can be used to create visual images and messages. </PARA>
<PARA> I can imagine son et lumiere, or light and sound, performances in the evening where people could enjoy the beauty of the old Parliament House and the rose garden. There is the potential for all sorts of additions to the Parliamentary Triangle. What has happened? This Government has delayed taking action. This cannot be because it has not had notice. It is more than 10 years since we knew that that area was going to be empty and now it is sitting idle. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to a question I asked yesterday, Minister Bolkus said that there were plans in next year's Budget. I am putting the Minister on notice. I will be watching very carefully, as will a number of people in the community who are very concerned about this, to ensure that the Budget contains provision for restoring the old Parliament House to a point where it can be visited by the public. If it does not, I will be on my feet again because the old Parliament House is a great attribute and a great educational facility. If we are to have a democracy in another 90 years, we need to strike a blow every day to encourage our young people to understand the history of our parliamentary democracy and to be proud of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The estimate that around 300,000 Social Security pensioners would be and affected by the deeming rules was based on the number of pensioners whose departmental records indicated they were likely to be affected by deeming. In `Age Pension News' of February 1991 it was stated `only about 15% of pensioners' would be affected by deeming. The estimate of 300,000 pensioners affected represents around 14.3% of the 2.1 million Social Security pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA> Preliminary estimates of the number of pensioners actually affected by the deeming provisions are:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) 140,000 pensioners had a pension reduction on the 28 March 1991 pension pay day because of the deeming provisions (ie the rate of return on assessable cash and accounts was below 10%);</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) in addition, in the order of 200,000 pensioners reinvested their savings in cash and accounts in the period 22 August 1990 to 15 March 1991 to earn a higher rate of interest that affected their pension under the normal pension income test.</PARA>
<PARA> These figures do not include pensioners not yet affected by deeming, either because they had not returned the Investment Review Form before 28 March, or returned it too late for it to be processed before 28 March. They also make no allowance for the effect of deeming on new entrants to the pension after 28 March.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The criteria used in selecting the pensioners to be sent an Investment Review Form were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Reduced pension categories</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Total of account balances over $2,000 (single) or $4,000 (married combined), and interest rate less than 10%.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) No account balance on pension record but account interest recorded as greater than $200 (single) or $400 (married combined).</PARA>
<PARA> Maximum pension categories</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Total income (less account interest) plus 10% of account balance exceeds applicable income free area.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) No account balance on pension record but account interest recorded as greater than $200 (single) or $400 (married combined), and total income is within $10 per week of applicable free area.</PARA>
<PARA> These criteria were constructed to allow Investment Review Forms to be targeted to clients most likely to be affected. Others likely to be affected in the following categories will be reviewed through other processes:</PARA>
<PARA> * pensioners with warrantees/nominees;</PARA>
<PARA> * pensioners paid by group payment; and</PARA>
<PARA> * overseas pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA> The first two categories are to be reviewed by separate processes because it was considered that these clients could have difficulties in understanding the deeming rules and completing the Investment Review Form. Overseas pensioners will be reviewed as part of the regular pensioner entitlement review cycle.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Some 55,000 pensioners who meet the criteria set down in (3) were issued with an Investment Review Form subsequent to the mid-January mail-out.</PARA>
<PARA> The form that these pensioners have received was marked as a `reminder', but it was the first form they received. This resulted from an error in the computer program for the selection of pensioners who received the initial form. The program for the initial selection inadvertently omitted most pensioners with managed investments who should have received the initial form according to the selection criteria in (3).</PARA>
<PARA> This error was corrected when the computer program for the issue of the reminder forms was run. This resulted in the group with managed investments who did not receive the initial form receiving a reminder form. This was not evident, however, until after reminder forms had been dispatched to pensioners. Consequently, there was no opportunity to correct the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> Staff have apologised to pensioners making enquiries about this issue.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) The AVO provides valuation advice to the majority of Commonwealth Government Departments, a number of Government Business Enterprises and some State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA>No valuers are employed specifically to carry out valuations for Austudy purposes as the work represents just part of the Government's annual valuations program.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) In 1989/90 AVO received 376 requests for valuation advice from DEET. In the period 1 July 1990 to 31 December 1990 a total of 364 requests were received.</PARA>
<PARA>In some cases the requests sought more than one valuation. For example:</PARA>
<PARA> * the market value of the property as at</PARA>
<PARA>1-1-90</PARA>
<PARA> * the market value of the property as at</PARA>
<PARA>1-7-90</PARA>
<PARA> * the value of stock (market value)</PARA>
<PARA> * the value of plant (market value)</PARA>
<PARA> i.e. each valuation request may ask AVO to provide up to four valuations.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1989/90 a total of 656 valuations were carried out at DEET's request for Austudy purposes. In the period 1 July 1990 to 31 December 1990 a total of 711 valuations were determined.</PARA>

<PARA>(4) In many cases the claimant does not submit an estimate of value when completing an application for Austudy. The information sought, therefore, cannot be provided.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) Subject to the answer in (6) below, no legislative or administrative guidelines are used by AVO when undertaking valuations for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>(6) The Department of Employment, Education and Training contracts the services of the AVO to value the assets of certain AUSTUDY clients as provided for under Regulation 20 of the AUSTUDY Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department uses a Review of Assets form for AUSTUDY recipients, their parents and spouses to declare their assets and liabilities. The information provided on the form is made available to the AVO. The form provides for the applicant to authorise the AVO to inspect and value the family's properties, and specifies the date for which the valuations are to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA>The AUSTUDY Regulations require that the full net market value of a person's assets be taken into account. The net value is defined as being the full market value of the assets described in Regulation 14, less the value of the items described in Regulations 15 to 18 (eg principal home, debt on assets).</PARA>
<PARA>The AVO's valuation reflects the full market value of the assets described in Regulation 14. All further calculations to determine the net market value, and to determine whether a ``farm or business'' discount applies, are the responsibility of DEET, not of the AVO.</PARA>
<PARA>Neither the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, nor the Department on his behalf, has issued any directions to the AVO in respect of the professional determination of valuations.</PARA>
