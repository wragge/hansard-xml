<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Social Security to the closure of the Permanent Building Society in Perth at 5 p.m. last Friday, 30 August, at the direction of the State Government. Is the Minister aware of a media report that social security cheques were diverted from the Permanent Building Society to home addresses of recipients before 5 p.m. on Friday of last week? Can the Minister tell the Senate what prior knowledge the Department of Social Security had and where it came from?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as I know, payments of family allowance and family allowance supplement, which are next due on 5 September, will be made by cheque through the Department's regional offices. We will be attempting to mail the next payment to pensioners by cheque. We will be contacting pensioners so affected to see whether they have made new arrangements. In fact, when I leave the chamber I will be calling the Attorney-General in Western Australia to make arrangements to enable pensioners to get access to the cheques that were paid into the building society last week.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is exactly answering it. The cheques were paid in last week. I am pointing out that we did not have prior knowledge and that the cheques were paid to the building society. As far as I know-I will check this when I leave the chamber-the cheques were paid into the building society in the normal course of events. They have been blocked for release by the administrator. As I understand it, I am to call the Attorney-General in Western Australia when I leave the chamber to try to sort out an arrangement that will enable pensioners to get access to those cheques that were paid to the building society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not aware of any prior knowledge. In fact, last night I was advised by my Department to contact those responsible in Western Australia to try to make sure that pensioners get access to cheques that were quite normally paid to the building society. In previous instances, such as the Pyramid Building Society last year, my first attempt has always been to try to get pensioners access to their cheques.</PARA>
<PARA> Some beneficiaries are affected because some unemployment benefit cheques were also paid in at that late period, and I have to try to get access for those people. I hope to be able to inform the Senate tomorrow of the final arrangements. I do not have a final answer yet. Certainly on the basis of the advice provided to me, there would be no hint of prior knowledge. All our attempts are directed to getting access to the cheques already paid in.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I fully understand what the Minister has said and I fully understand that he is taking action to prevent a recurrence of this situation. I understand that for a while cheques will be directed to the home addresses of the recipients. I want an answer in relation to prior knowledge. There was a report in the media at 6 p.m. last Friday that there was prior knowledge and that some cheques had already been diverted. If the Minister is not aware whether there was prior knowledge, will he seek to find out? If there was prior knowledge, I believe that everyone should have had the same prior knowledge.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that I had pointed out that, on the basis of the information supplied to me, there could have been no prior knowledge. All we are talking about is preventing the next payment going into the Society but going directly to pensioners and taking steps to enable pensioners to gain access to the last payment which was paid in. On the basis of the information supplied to me, there is no hint of prior notice, so all I can do is deny that. But, as I said, I will check with the Department to see whether there is anything that I have not been told.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is the Minister aware of a media release issued by the so-called tax reform campaign group, for which Senator Michael Baume is the contact, which makes the statement that the Australian Taxation Office in New South Wales collected more than $24.8 billion in wholesale sales tax in the financial year 1989-90?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That unfortunate matter has been drawn to my attention. There was a media release issued by the so-called tax reform campaign group, for which Senator Michael Baume was named as the contact.

Senator Baume is into it again, just as he was in the 1987 election, putting out totally incorrect figures. The figure of $24.8 billion which is alleged to have been collected in sales tax is totally incorrect. That ought to have been obvious to those responsible for putting out this media release. After all, the Opposition has been trying to make something of the fact that sales tax collections in 1989-90--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Lewis has retired to the back bench. We all know why he retired: it was something to do with figures. It is extraordinary that this tax reform campaign group should put out these sorts of figures. The Opposition has said nothing about the fact that when this Government came to office sales tax receipts amounted to 11 per cent of total revenue. For the 1991-92 income tax year, the Budget estimates are that sales tax receipts will be 9.5 per cent of total revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is totally contrary to the point which this bodgie press release, succoured by the Opposition, sought to make. This press release cited $24.8 billion worth of sales tax receipts. I understand that the Taxation Office was so upset by the contents of this press release that it departed from normal procedure and contacted the office of the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, to point out to him that the Opposition was putting out totally incorrect figures about sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA> The figure that the Opposition used was, in fact, the total indirect income rather than the tax. I understand that later in the day the Opposition tried to issue a corrected front page statement with the correct figure for New South Wales sales tax receipts being $4.5 billion. I am not aware of what steps the Opposition took to advise those newspapers which reported the incorrect figure but I assume that something was done about it.</PARA>
<PARA> I just want to make the point that this Opposition has been in opposition for a long time. Every time it has got near the barrier it has tripped over because of bodgie figures-rubbery figures-on tax deductions, Medicare and everything. Prior to an election the Opposition has tripped over on rubbery figures or inadequate leadership. Those are the issues on which it has tripped over. I am just trying to help the Opposition by uttering a warning that if it goes on with this bodgie figure stuff, it is going to trip over again.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has tripped over with this issue because it has relied on the genius of Senator Michael Baume to endorse this statement by the so-called tax reform group. There is a lesson in this for all honourable senators opposite. I think the people of Australia are very concerned that there should be an improvement in parliamentary performance. They expect a little better performance from the Opposition than lying publicly in documents about figures in respect of sales tax.</PARA>

Given his professed capacity-from his last answer-in relation to statistics and figures, will he tell us on what initial rate was that figure calculated? Is the Minister aware that, using the prime lending rate as a base, as at the end of August our real interest rate was 10.9 per cent-which is nearly double the figure he choose to calculate-and Malaysia's was 2.2 per cent, Singapore's was 3.7 per cent, Japan's was 4.1 per cent, Hong Kong's was 3.6 per cent and Taiwan's was 6.7 per cent?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. I ask: is the Minister aware that the Tasman Institute has recently released a report entitled Global Warming-its Economics and Politics?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not had access to the full report but I know that the Minister, Mrs Kelly, and her Department have had some opportunity to examine the report. In any event, it would not need close examination to be able to refute and rebut some of its claims. The claims that are made by the Tasman Institute on the science of greenhouse I would have thought are quite easy to rebut. In fact, if one looks at the reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change it will be seen that that group was established by the World Meteorological Organisation and the United Nations Environment Program and that it comprised the largest group of scientists ever to have worked on the global warming issue. It involved 170 scientists from 25 countries, with an additional 200 scientists involved in peer review. At the Second World Climate Conference held in Geneva last year, 700 scientists from over 100 countries supported the findings of the group's report. It was stated in that report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We are certain of the following:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a natural greenhouse effect which already keeps the earth warmer than it would otherwise be.</PARA>
<PARA> Emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases . . . these increases will enhance the greenhouse effect, resulting on average in an additional warming of the earth's surface.</PARA>
<PARA>One wonders how more concrete one would have to be, or how more scientific an analysis would have to be, before a statement of that kind could be made. It is clear that the Tasman Institute just does not have the scientific expertise to refute the findings of a report compiled by the hundreds of scientists from around the world who have looked at this one.</PARA>
<PARA> One has seriously to question the Tasman Institute when it comes to the question of costs. It should be pointed out that many studies have been carried out in Australia on the costs and benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Some of those studies done by industry and energy sectors do acknowledge that considerable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be made without net costs and, in some cases, with net benefits by improving the efficiency in the way in which we use energy. Unfortunately, the Tasman Institute ignores those options completely. In the Tasman Institute report it is assumed that the Government would adopt an horrendous tax on energy to suppress demand. Of course, that is fallacious in the first place. It is well beyond any reasonable basis of experience in energy pricing.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that the interim planning target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions adopted by the Government has a very important qualifier placed on it. That qualifier is that Australia will not proceed with measures which have net adverse economic impacts nationally or on Australia's trade competitiveness in the absence of similar action by major greenhouse gas producing countries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission is currently conducting an inquiry into the question of the costs and benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Its draft report released on 22 August stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The costs and benefits of an international consensus to reduce greenhouse gas emissions depend on many complex scientific, economic, political and strategic considerations . . . . The Commission considers that this question is unanswerable at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission has had access to many studies and submissions, including the one from the Tasman Institute. It is clear from the methodology and conclusions regarding costs that the Tasman Institute has not passed the Industry Commission test and will not pass any credible scientific test in this country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the first question, I have become aware of the statement of the Centre for Defence Information in Washington as a result of Senator Powell's question, but not otherwise. Certainly the question of potential proliferation of nuclear weapons to new states is a very real one in the context of current developments in the Soviet Union. I am sure that is an issue of which the Security Council members will already be very conscious. In the event that they should decide it to be appropriate for the Security Council to formally consider the matter, then Australia will support that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the situation with nuclear warheads in the Soviet Union is concerned, the details of the information available to me in this respect are as follows: all told, the number of nuclear warheads deployed in the USSR at the moment is in the vicinity of 27,000. The majority of the strategic warheads-about three quarters of them-are located in the Russian republic, the remainder being located in three other republics, which are Byelorussia, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan. In addition to those strategic warheads, a very large number of tactical nuclear weapons are deployed with warheads in most of the union republics. The strategic ones are in about four republics and the tactical ones are in most of the rest. All told, something over 27,000 warheads are currently deployed. The emergence in the Soviet Union of a new structure of uncertain dimensions at this stage and with uncertain authority as far as military matters are concerned does raise questions as to where the command and control for these warheads will be located.</PARA>
<PARA> It is our understanding at the moment that the central Soviet Union military authorities are presently maintaining very tight control of all of the country's nuclear weapons. Moreover, it is the case that most republics, including the Ukraine and Kazakhstan, have already declared publicly that they have no intention of becoming nuclear weapons states. There is the further very welcome development of the decree issued a few days ago by the President of Kazakhstan ending nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk, the Soviet Union's biggest nuclear test site.</PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, we would expect the leaders of the USSR and the various republics to cooperate fully in maintaining a firm, undisputed and responsible control over all nuclear weapons. We would certainly welcome an early announcement by newly independent republics of their intention to be non-nuclear weapon states parties to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, thereby submitting all peaceful nuclear facilities on their territory to IAEA safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA> Whether the end result of the process which is currently at work in the Soviet Union will mean, in fact, that more than the Baltic states will be fully independent sovereign republics of course remains to be seen; so one cannot take completely at face value the declarations of independence that have so far been made. But, to the extent that those declarations are followed through with the achievement of genuinely sovereign independent statehood by the republics in question, it will be a very real question about their involvement in the NPT, and the point I have just made will hold.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the last part of the question, about information from Pine Gap and Nurrungar on the state of the Soviet command and control system, it is a wholly hypothetical question as to whether the Security Council would want access to any such information. In the event that such information is sought in the future, we will, of course, give consideration to supplying it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Government did institute an inquiry into the non-uniformity of national standards in occupational health and safety in Australia. I have said in this chamber before that next year there will be common standards in occupational health and safety right across the countries of Europe. In Australia, we have not managed to succeed in obtaining uniformity of standards between the States and the Commonwealth. There is concern in Australian industry about the cost that is imposed in meeting disparate standards if an industry operates in more than one State. It was partly because of that and partly because of other concerns raised by industry that I commissioned an inquiry into the matter by Dr Peter Grabosky of the Australian Institute of Criminology. As far as I know, Dr Grabosky is no relation to Count Grabosky of the Steve Vizard show-in case anyone is interested.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No-one is interested. Dr Grabosky has now reported and he has identified the following major impediments: the complexity of the standards development process involving tripartite consultation in nine separate jurisdictions; resistance to change in general and a desire by the jurisdictions to control their own agendas; and the array of drafting conventions which are incompatible across States. The report described the duplication of effort in nine separate jurisdictions as `wasteful and inefficient' and `an unnecessary burden on Australian taxpayers'. Dr Grabosky concludes that the achievement of uniformity is largely a matter of political will between the States with the support of the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is all very well if one is in Opposition and government is Sunday Too Far Away stuff. It is all right if one is in that position.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of recycling in Australia has been growing in recent years, and I would have thought the announcement of a de-inking plant in Albury would be welcomed by most Australians. It certainly is the best of news for paper recycling, especially for the recycling of newsprint. One of the great difficulties has been that, as people dutifully put out newspapers for recycling, all that the companies have been able to do is to store them. Even storage space for those newspapers has been running very short over the past two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, some people downstream from Albury quite reasonably are concerned about the additional salt load this may create in the end. However, the Managing Director of Australian Newsprint Mills has given the Government an assurance that the recycling mill will not result in an increase in the amount of salt discharged into the Murray River. In fact, the company will be taking steps to ensure that it assists the Government in reducing salt levels downstream. Waste water that is presently discharged does meet World Health Organisation standards for drinking water, and it will continue to be subject to primary, secondary and tertiary treatment to keep it that way.</PARA>
<PARA> If we are to continue having any really good news for the environment, obviously steps along the recycling path will be integral in any national strategy of waste minimisation. They should reduce the increasing pressure on Australia's forests by replacing virgin pulp from our native forests with recycled pulp from old newspapers, all without increasing pollution of the Murray River. There is no point in recycling any product that does not have a market, and this plant has a guaranteed market for its product. That will ensure its viability and the viability of the whole recycling system. It will help meet our target of a 50 per cent reduction in waste going to landfill by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA> ANM is also looking closely at minimising water use and at reusing water for irrigation of public parks and pine plantations. The company has announced that ultimately it intends to phase out river discharge completely for the nine non-winter months of the year.</PARA>

I am certain that Senator Boswell will recall that one of the States the Commonwealth had some arguments with was the State of Queensland when the National Party of Australia ruled it. Given the arguments over World Heritage listings in north Queensland and in Tasmania-and he will recall that they were very significant arguments-the Commonwealth determined that it would have to be only under the most extreme circumstances that World Heritage listings would be pursued without the agreement of the States. Given that there was absolutely no possibility of the State of Queensland agreeing to anything in respect of Fraser Island, it was certainly not on any priority list of mine nor of the Prime Minister during that time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of putting a submission is to try to persuade it adopt one's position, and that is what I would like. The next wage system would be enhanced considerably if, as I have said, a decentralised system allowed for greater scope for negotiations between unions and management so that they can accept a greater responsibility for the outcome of those negotiations. The packages negotiated should be processed with and through the Industrial Relations Commission. The Commission should have regard to maximum flexibility in the form in which the wage packages are negotiated, with productivity bargaining being, I would think, a key feature of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We argue that the guidelines that we have submitted to the Commission are the ones that it should adopt through workplace bargaining; that increases should be linked to demonstrable gains in productivity and flexibility; that negotiations must not be based on workplace arrangements reached elsewhere-they must be specific to the particular workplace, although it should be said that it is possible in industry sectors to negotiate a framework agreement within which the companies in an industry sector would negotiate specific agreements, and that has occurred in the metals industry; that any agreement should be fair to all relevant employees; and that the minimum basis of workplace bargaining must be national award standard conditions of employment, including leave standards, standard hours and redundancy provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does support comprehensive fixed term agreements and a no extra claims agreement would apply during the life of those fixed term agreements. We, in our submission, indicated support for the metal trades negotiated outcome, recognising that that is an appropriate settlement for that sector of the economy. We have called upon the Industrial Relations Commission to evolve from its detailed and prescriptive measures and to facilitate the shift to decentralised wage fixing.</PARA>
<PARA> We support a further review by the Commission late this year or early next year in which the question of a general increase in wages can be considered. We raise that because what we have asked the Commission to do this time is prescribe guidelines for workplace bargaining. But we recognise that not every worker in this country is in a position to negotiate for greater productivity. Indeed, there is the question of whether employers would want to negotiate a wage round specific to a company. From an equity point of view and in the interests of protecting low income earners in this country, it may be necessary late this year or next year to revisit the question of wages from the point of view of whether or not a general wage increase should apply.</PARA>

Is it a fact that last evening Mr Ken Colbung, the longstanding and, of course, highly respected Chairman of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Studies, was rudely thrown out of the parliamentary office of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Robert Tickner? Is it a fact that the purpose of Mr Colbung's visit to the Minister's office was to complain to Mr Tickner about the Institute's lack of access to Mr Tickner? Is this the Minister's first step in his process of reconciliation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs comment on measures announced by the New South Wales Premier, Mr Greiner, to ban the sale and resale of certain categories of rifles and shotguns? Does the Minister believe that this will assist moves to a nationwide approach to the control of guns in the Australian community?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1160" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the announcement by Mr Greiner, the Premier of New South Wales, of measures that he has foreshadowed to ban the sale of high powered semi-automatic rifles and shotguns. I believe it is a very constructive first step, a token of good faith in relation to the necessity to rid the Australian community of these sorts of weapons, and I certainly do welcome it. It coincides with the steps taken already by the Federal Government to ban the import of military style semi-automatics into this country, particularly those produced by the Soviet and Red Chinese armies which were flooding into this country in the latter part of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that this is a good step in New South Wales. It follows a very dramatic step taken several days ago by Terry Connolly, the police Minister here in the ACT, who announced very stringent measures in this regard. It coincided with an announcement by Michael Weldon, the Tasmanian police Minister, of the decision by the Tasmanian Government to ban the sale of military style semi-automatics in Tasmania and to introduce a stringent licensing system in relation to other sorts of firearms. Senator Jones, as a senator from Queensland, will be interested to know that only today Mr Terry Mackenroth, the police Minister in Queensland, has said that he will move to ban semi-automatic weapons in Queensland later this year.</PARA>
<PARA> So we have a situation where nationwide there has been a complete change in philosophy, shared by both conservative and Labor governments in State, Territory and Federal administrations. The argument that people kill other people, not guns kill people, has been rejected in favour of the proposition that not only must we have a stringent licensing system for those who have access to weapons but also we must reduce the arsenal of particularly lethal weapons available in the community. That change of philosophy is a very important underpinning of this nationwide approach which is emerging.</PARA>
<PARA> To those who say that we should not ban these sorts of weapons but should have a more stringent licensing system, it is important to point out to them that about 80 in every 100 of the killings achieved by use of a weapon are carried out by those with no previous criminal or psychiatric history. That means, of course, that it is very hard to weed out those who may reach for a weapon at the moment they cross the threshold of violence, either breaking under some particular stress or in a domestic violence situation. We have to ensure that when they reach for a weapon it is not of that particularly lethal kind that, as I say, has been flooding into the country-the semi-automatics. The step taken by Premier Greiner is to be welcomed and it now means that we have a very good foundation for going to the police Ministers conference in October in order to produce resolutions to go to the Premiers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA> The Premiers Conference will be very important in that it will put the question of gun laws in the wider context of dealing with violence in our community. The National Committee on Violence set up after the Hoddle Street and Queen Street massacres has already provided a tremendous range of recommendations.</PARA>

<PARA> The document in question, a Sunday press release, correctly listed a schedule of the $24.8 billion worth of goods on which New South Wales consumers were forced to pay the hidden Hawke wholesale sales tax in 1989-90. However, this figure was incorrectly transposed, not by me, as the amount of tax paid instead of the value of the goods on which tax was paid. The correct figure was $4.5 billion or an average consumption tax rate of 18 per cent. Unfortunately, as a result of a communications problem on Sunday I did not see the incorrect version of the press release that I had wanted issued. However, the schedule attached to the press release clearly showed what the $24.8 billion referred to. A corrected version was made available on Monday after I saw the release.

<PARA>The Australian Tax Office in New South Wales collected more than $4.5 billion in hidden wholesale sales tax for the Hawke Government from consumers in 1989-90, according to figures just released by the ATO.</PARA>
<PARA>Member of the Tax Reform Campaign Group and Opposition spokesman on the arts, sport and youth, Senator Michael Baume said the figures showed the level of wholesale sales tax being paid in NSW averaged out to about $780 for each man, woman and child in the State.</PARA>
<PARA>``This just goes to show the extent of this insidious tax and how it really affects the lives of the people of our State'', Senator Baume said.</PARA>
<PARA>``What is even more disturbing is that the great majority of the revenue collected from consumers through this tax came from the ``general rate'' of 20% which applies to many everyday household goods such as soap and toothpaste.''</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the answer. </PARA>
<PARA>Just briefly, my question to Senator Button related to the basis on which the real interest rate figure for Australia that he quoted to the chamber yesterday was calculated. I believe it is a matter of concern that deserves debate at a further time. The Minister who represents the Treasurer in this place and who is the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) was unable to give an explanation of how that rate that he used was calculated. The Minister, in his answer, sought to make an explanation that he has not got all day to use a calculator. Of course, it is not expected that he calculate the figures himself. What is expected is some understanding of the basis on which the figures he uses are calculated. </PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of interest, it is obvious to almost anyone except the Minister that his calculations were presumably based on the current long bond rate and last year's inflation rate. I believe that that is an inappropriate figure. This year's inflation rate is expected to be 3.5 per cent. Last year's figure was 5.5 per cent. Therefore, for the Minister to be using last year's inflation rate figure as a means of calculating the real interest rate almost indicates that he expects inflation--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other matter that I think deserves further investigation and why I have sought leave to move this motion today is that the Minister was asked to comment on our economic performance in relation to our Asian trading partners-a matter that he is either incapable of or unwilling to answer because he treats this place with some mirth. That in itself is inappropriate when a lot of our trading future is with our Asian neighbours. The Minister representing the Treasurer, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, and Leader of the Government in the Senate should be able to give some off the cuff answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last, but not least, the reason his answer deserves further debate is his constant reference in that answer and other answers to the will of some honourable senators on this side of the chamber to read their questions. The hypocrisy in making that complaint is evident when one considers that nearly every answer made by Ministers in relation to their own portfolios is read. I do not mind if they read answers in their representative portfolios, but when they have to read answers in relation to their own portfolios, as Senator Cook did yesterday in relation to a question I think on the International Labour Organisation, it is quite frankly very embarrassing. The hypocrisy is quite outstanding and deserves further debate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PROCTEXT><PARA> Senator Hill-Mr President, I raise a point of order. I suggest that the way the record is now being left is not correct in that the accusation of lying is unparliamentary. The only exception I can recall is the acknowledged conspiracy between the Prime Minister and Mr Keating in which they accepted that they sought to deceive the Australian people. There have been allegations across the chamber this morning that honourable senators have lied. Mr President, I suggest that you ask each honourable senator to withdraw his comments.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button-Senator Baume bounced in here at the end of Question Time with this personal explanation--</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume-That is false. I came in immediately after that question because I was getting the documents. That is false again. Try to tell the truth for a change, John.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button-Senator Baume should simmer down. The point is that he came in here alleging that I had called him a liar. I think we ought to look at the pinks at some stage to see precisely what was said. I do not recall having said that Senator Baume, personally, was a liar.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume-You said `lying publicly in documents'.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button-Not Senator Baume. That was the basis on which he sought to make his personal explanation. What I believe I said was that the Opposition should not associate itself with documents which contain false figures; and that is what the honourable senator did. I said that those opposite should not associate themselves with documents which contain lying figures. But the honourable senator has come in here and said that I made a personal allegation that he, Senator Michael Baume, had lied.</PARA>
<PARA> If I did say that in relation to Senator Baume in the course of a relatively long answer to a question which was frequently interrupted by interjections from the other side, I apologise and I withdraw that allegation. But I do not apologise and withdraw the allegation which I made collectively about the Opposition and which I illustrated historically; that is, that those opposite should not associate themselves in the public arena with shonky, misleading figures. That is the allegation I made against the Opposition. So if all honourable senators on the Opposition side want to get up and make a personal explanation they should go ahead and do it. That is legitimate debate in my view and if one comes into this kitchen one has to stand the heat. But I repeat: if I made an allegation-and I do not believe I did-that Senator Michael Baume lied, then I withdraw it.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Michael Baume-I thank the Minister for his conditional withdrawal. I can assure him that it was not only in his statement that I was accused of lying publicly in documents but also by way of interjection. When I challenged him on this matter he said, `I stick by it'. Following the Minister's conditional apology, I also withdraw my attack on the allegation being a lie. But I also say that the allegation is clearly false, as lying requires a deliberate intention which the Minister appears to have had, but which I certainly did not have.</PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the moneys available to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Successive Governments have adopted the practice of introducing a Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the Parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>Legally, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective 1991-92 Budget deficit. The Budget deficit in prospect for 1991-92 gives rise to a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund some $5.5 billion greater. This situation arises because appropriations from the Fund include various items that are classified as financing transactions rather than Budget outlays, and thus do not affect the Budget outcome. These items include payments to the National Debt Sinking Fund and superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides authority for the loan fund to meet defence expenditures incurred after the passage of the Bill that otherwise would have been met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and to supplement the Consolidated Revenue Fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The Bill also provides the borrowing authority to cover these payments from the Loan Fund. The Bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already appropriated, or currently before the Parliament, apart from loan raising expenses, which will be small. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that the Bill does not in any way impinge upon the prerogative of the Parliament to appropriate public moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr Deputy President, you just announced that the 16 documents tabled today are to be added to the Notice Paper for the next day when these matters can be dealt with. Can I say that the Opposition has some concerns about this. There are 16 documents tabled today on a day when we cannot discuss them. Yesterday there was one report tabled, and the period for debate was half an hour. There is, in fact, a curious malapportionment of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems extraordinary that, on a day when we have the capacity to debate documents, they are not presented to this chamber. On a day when we cannot debate them, they are presented. Some of these documents are reports for the year ended June 1990. They are almost a year-and-a-quarter old. Some of them were presented to the Minister quite some time ago. For example, the report of the Canberra Institute of the Arts was presented to the Minister on 1 May 1991. I think the chamber has every right to ask why, magically, 16 documents come up on a day when we cannot debate them and only one comes up on a day when we can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-It is very frustrating to hear people who have to find bad motives about everything that takes place. It makes one judge what motivates them, rather than oneself, on this matter. When this list was presented to me, as the list which was coming forward today, I understood that the Opposition may have been concerned about the coincidence of events. We consulted with members of the Opposition to be sure they were happy and offered to defer any of them if they wished but they declined.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Senator McMullan comes in here and says that there has been consultation with the Opposition. What he means by that is that the Whips got together and said, `Will it be all right if we put this over to Thursday because we cannot discuss them today' or some such discussion. I was not privy to that discussion so I do not really know the detail of it. But that would be the sort of discussion which would take place. Senator McMullan would know the Whips do not have a chance to have a discussion with all of us beforehand. They are presented with this table at five minutes to nine, and at 9 o'clock they have to make a statement as to what they are going to do with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course Senator Baume is quite right. If the Parliamentary Secretary had known that there was a list of 16 reports for today, I presume he would have said to some of the Ministers, `Can you not get those documents in today? There is half an hour to debate them'. Yesterday we had half an hour to debate documents, and we had only one document tabled. We have seen this happening for eight years. For eight years this Government has produced lists of documents on days when either we cannot debate them or there are very great difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw Senator McMullan's attention to the arguments we had when his predecessor, Senator Ray, was Manager of Government Business. Ultimately, Senator Ray came to realise that it was grossly unfair that we were not being given the opportunity to consider documents which are of such major importance not so much to honourable senators but to the people of Australia. As I said, these documents are brought in at a time when either they cannot be debated or the list is so long that there is no opportunity to consider all of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to finish by saying that it is clear that this practice is being followed by Ministers or by departmental heads. They know what they are doing when they produce documents to be tabled on particular days. I suggest that Senator McMullan make some inquiries to find out whether or not my allegation is true. </PARA>

<PARA> I understand that Senator Lewis would expect these documents to be dealt with in the normal way. But this did not happen on this occasion. We went beyond that in order to try to make reasonable provision for people to participate. I made this arrangement because I knew that if I did not people would react adversely. Had I been in the Opposition's position in relation to this concurrence of events, I would not have been pleased. That is why I tried to make special arrangements to enable debate to take place. </PARA>

No doubt debate on documents tabled tomorrow will be deferred as well and 30 minutes will be set aside. In other words, all of the intermediary reports that cannot be handled will be lumped together and dealt with at an appropriate time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that my request was a very simple one. It did not relate to a lack of knowledge of what arrangements had been made with the Whips. That arrangement is quite proper. My concern is that we have reports which are generally very late-reports which relate to the financial year which ended in June of last year and which have not been tabled yet. The letters covering those reports are dated many months ago. I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary why, magically, they are presented today when they could have been presented yesterday. After all, they are only a year and a quarter old. If they had been presented yesterday, we would not have had to come to this kind of arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Secretary has carefully sidestepped the issue of concern. My concern is that the Parliamentary Secretary should kindly smarten up his act and give the Senate a fair go. He should not come on with this farce of presenting one report on a day when we do in fact have time to discuss reports and then present 16 reports when he knows that debate on them and other deferred reports will be deferred to another day for very brief discussion. This is simply not good enough, and the Parliamentary Secretary's response was disgracefully inadequate. </PARA>

The Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill 1991 has not taken up the vast majority of recommendations and, in particular, the most important recommendations from this report. I have read this rather long passage to demonstrate just how far away the Government is from the findings of this review. I must add that the review was funded by the taxpayers and it seems that it is one that has been gathering dust on a shelf somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe very strongly that functional impairment alone is not a full test of a person's capacity to work and that other factors must be taken into account when determining a person's eligibility for income support. We are not trying to remove the screening process from this Bill, and we are not saying that recipients of support pensions should not be encouraged to undertake vocational and educational programs or that work force transition should not be a goal. However, we are saying that it is wrong, both medically and socially, simply to equate a person's impairment with his or her ability to work and fail to take other factors into account. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach was brought up over and over again as the Committee met and heard from witnesses. In particular, I want to read from the submission of the Philomata Legal Service to the Senate Committee. The submission states:</PARA>
<PARA>Impairment is a term used to describe limits in function compared to what is considered normal in human beings. Impairment can be physical, intellectual, psychiatric or sensory. Incapacity is a loss or limitation of opportunity to take part in the life of the community on an equal level with others due to physical of functional barriers. While impairment can be treated as a medical concept, incapacity is a function of the' relationship between impairment and a wide range of social and economic factors. </PARA>
<PARA>The Cass report understood this distinction but the Government either does not understand it or is being deliberately obtuse in order to cut costs. Again I ask: was this Bill really designed by economists? As the Cass report noted there are two types of non-medical factors: the first relates to a person's socio-economic resources, such as age, educational qualifications and skills; the second relates to the reasonable availability and accessibility of jobs and of opportunities that are appropriate to the person's skills and capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two particular problems with this approach in terms of the Bill we have before us. Initially there is the linking impairment with a very strict and unreasonable definition of continuing inability to work and the actual impairment tables themselves. The definition of a continuing inability to work in section 94 means that a person will not be eligible for the disability support pension if that person could theoretically be retrained for some unspecified job that exists anywhere in Australia. The secretary is specifically not allowed to have regard to the availability of work in the person's local labour market or the realistic availability of retraining for that person. The only exception to this is for people aged over 55 years where the Department of Social Security is permitted to look at the local labour market in determining whether a person has a continuing inability to work. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach will undoubtedly lead to hardship and inequity. For example, a totally blind person with a university qualification in, say, law, living in the inner suburbs of Melbourne or Sydney is under this Bill technically eligible for a pension. But what about a 50-year-old man with moderate alcohol brain damage who did not complete secondary education, is functionally illiterate in English and lives in a country town where unemployment is already running well over 30 per cent? Even if this man's functional impairment is assessed at more than 20 per cent on the impairment assessment table scale, the inability of the Department to take into account other factors could well mean that this man will not be eligible for a pension and will be forced to take up a Jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> Here comes another problem. He will have to jump through all those hoops, climb over all those hurdles, and his disability may very well cause him to fail some of the draconian tests that are in that legislation-another person who has fallen through the social security net. It will mean a loss not only of income but also of his pensioner health benefits card and the additional pharmaceutical supplement. This is not an isolated example. It will not be just a few isolated cases of people who are affected. There will be many people with disabilities who will start falling through these new gaps in the social security system. No doubt it will save the Government money in its social security budget, but whether it ultimately costs the community more is another matter altogether. The costs to the lives of many disabled people and their families cannot be calculated. </PARA>
<PARA> The impairment tables have been the subject of enormous criticism from all the witnesses. All of them had some comments relating to the impairment tables and some, in particular those who were concerned about the psychiatric impairment tables and those relating to people with drug and alcohol problems, were very critical. Many organisations have been critical. Academics and doctors are claiming that these tables are fundamentally flawed in two respects. First, their validity is in question with the Department actually acknowledging that at least one table is totally untested. Secondly, there are serious concerns about the summing and the way in which we are looking at adding up from table to table. </PARA>
<PARA> Different tables in this Bill rely upon different scales to add up across the different tables. This will cause particular difficulties for people who are multi disabled or those with psychiatric, and alcohol and drug related disabilities. As a representative from one organisation said to me yesterday, `It is as if we are to add an apple to an orange and come out with a banana'. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) is aware of these criticisms. People have visited him as late as yesterday, going over the same ground, explaining the difficulties. I understand that, in fact, further amendments are being drawn up today and I wonder when we will see them. I hope that they are in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> One such critic of the tables is Dr Hugh Dickson, director of rehabilitation and geriatrics at the Liverpool Health Service, who wrote a letter in August which I will quote briefly. Senator Alston saw this letter yesterday when he discussed the incorporation of a graph. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>While I understand that there is a desire to establish that a significant impairment exists in an individual applying for the pension, and that this impairment results in a disability sufficient to prevent employment, there appears to be a confusion as to the nature of the tables and the applicability of mathematical processes both within and between tables. As these tables are a mixture of ordinal and interval scales that masquerade as ratio scales, procedures such as addition, subtraction and multiplication as used in the combined values chart are unsound and should be abandoned.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Michael</PARA>
<PARA>RE: Tables for assessment of impairment for disability support pension. </PARA>
<PARA>You will recall our meeting on Tuesday 6th August regarding the assessment of impairment. </PARA>
<PARA>While I understand that there is a desire to establish that a significant impairment exists in an individual applying for the pension, and that this impairment results in disability sufficient to prevent employment, there appears to be a confusion as to the nature of the tables and the applicability of mathematical processes both within and between tables. As these tables are a mixture of ordinal and interval scales that masquerade as ratio scales, procedures such as addition, subtraction and multiplication as used in the combined values chart are unsound and should be abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tables deal with a mixture of physiological parameters, and description of disability, interspersed with references to specific diagnosis. The Tables are not exhaustive in their classification, or consistent in their manner of description of measurement. </PARA>
<PARA>Reference to specific diagnosis should be deleted wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Table 6 should be deleted as it is better dealt with in earlier Tables. </PARA>
<PARA>Table 2 should be deleted as it is better dealt with in Table 1.The combined values system should be discarded as it is unsound and discriminates against those with multiple impairments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tables should be circulated to the major colleges for their comments, despite the fact the colleges are likely to be slow in responding. </PARA>
<PARA>A discussion paper outlining in detail the unsound basis of the Tables is enclosed. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hugh Dickson</PARA>
<PARA>Director</PARA>
<PARA>Rehabilitation &amp;Geriatrics</PARA>
<PARA>1. Impairment Tables</PARA>
<PARA>The problem with constructing Tables of Impairment is that a consistent measurement of function for all organ and structural systems in the body does not exist. There is no method of determining, for instance, the exact degree of impairment of liver function or dysfunction. Measurement of impairment of joint function is somewhat easier, as angles of movement, are readily measurable, but other aspects of function such as the speed of movement, or strength of movement which may be impaired by pain or inflammatory change are difficult to quantify. </PARA>
<PARA>Types of Measurement</PARA>
<PARA>There are four general levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. </PARA>
<PARA>Nominal measurement indicates that numbers are assigned to objects without having a number meaning, such as the numbers worn by members of a football team. </PARA>
<PARA>Ordinal measurement indicates that a rank order has been established and nothing more. The numbers do not indicate absolute quantities, nor do they indicate equal intervals between successive numbers. </PARA>
<PARA>Interval measurement indicates that rank ordering is present and that the equal intervals between successive numbers on the scale correspond to equal intervals in the property under measurement. </PARA>
<PARA>Ratio measurement indicates rank ordering, numerical equivalence between the side and the measured property and an absolute zero where none of the measured property is present. </PARA>
<PARA>Combining Values</PARA>
<PARA>It may be seen that the Tables are a mixture of ordinal, interval and ratio scales. The functional aspects as described in the scales are ordinal measures, despite the attempted use of a ratio scale, the percentage system. While mathematical procedures have been devised for handling ordinal scales, these scales are not designed to allow mathematical procedures such as AB(1-A). A simple substitution of the actual description (the measure) instead of its numerical equivalent demonstrates nicely that a number of different properties are being handled in the ordinal scale and not one property that is behaving in a uniform manner. There is no standard unit of impairment, just as there is no standard unit of disability. </PARA>
<PARA>Confusion of impairment and disability. </PARA>
<PARA>The tables confuse these two categories. </PARA>
<PARA>Impairment according to the WHO International Classification of Impairment, Disabilities and Handicaps is any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological on anatomical structure or function. </PARA>
<PARA>Disability is any restriction or lack (resulting from an impairment) of ability to perform an activity in the manner or range considered normal for a human being. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus one can be impaired without being disabled. </PARA>
<PARA>Handicap is a disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from an impairment or a disability that limits or prevents the fulfilment of a role that is normal (depending on age, sex and social and cultural factors) for that individual. </PARA>
<PARA>The tables are a mixture of impairment criteria (Table 2 and Table 2.2) and disability criteria (Table 4). </PARA>
<PARA>Use of diagnoses</PARA>
<PARA>Impairment is not contingent on specific diagnoses or specific disorders. A number of conditions cause blindness, and a number of conditions cause cardiac failure or deafness or whatever. The tables should use the broad classification of impairment rather than the narrow definition of diagnosis as an exhaustive list of diagnoses causing impairment and disability is not feasible or particularly useful in this context. </PARA>
<PARA>In the latter two pages Dr Dickson explains in some detail the unsound basis of the tables. He is not alone in his concern, and I urge the Minister to consider delaying the Bill at least for another few weeks so that this matter can be further examined. </PARA>
<PARA> In the committee stage of the debate we will be raising the matter of monitoring. We need to monitor both the effects and the impacts of these tables as well as the impact of the Bill. At the very least, I urge the Government to take up the suggestion of the Australian Council of Alcohol and Other Drug Associations to establish and resource an independent monitoring panel to keep track of what is happening and what these tables are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of concern to the Democrats is the severe income cuts for those under the age of 21. This is a really disgraceful decision and one that all Government senators should be utterly ashamed of. This is not a hole in the social security net but rather a poverty trap. The Government likes to call this the `development of a common allowance structure for income support for young people', but what it actually means is that the Government is progressively cutting back income support for young people under 21. </PARA>
<PARA> The last plank in this policy, the last group to be affected, is the young disabled. The legislation contains provision for the rate of new disability support pension for people under 21 to be reduced to the equivalent of the Jobsearch and Newstart allowances. Alongside this, in recognition of the extra expenses to be borne by young people with disabilities, the Government will provide a youth disability supplement to people under 21. This supplement will be aligned with the child disability allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> This all is rather esoteric until we actually look at the figures. A single person under 18 living at home now receives an invalid pension of $301.60 a fortnight. Under the new arrangements, the disability support pension is only $124.10 per fortnight, plus the youth disability supplement of $59.90. This leaves such persons $117.60 per fortnight worse off-a massive drop in income. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is the same in all other categories. Single people under 18 living away from home will be worse off by $18.45 per week; single people under 21 living at home will be worse off by $46.30 per week; single people under 21 who are independent-living away from home-will be worse off by $7.60 per week. The figures for young people still living at home are of great concern. I have received many letters from parents of young disabled people who are worried about the effects these cuts will have on their continuing ability to care for these young people at home. I shall read a letter from some parents in southern Adelaide who are part of a group called Parents of Disabled, Southern Area. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA>As parents of young people with disabilities who are under the age of twenty, we are appalled at the proposed changes to the Sickness Benefit and Invalid Pension. </PARA>
<PARA> Our young people are already isolated in their schooling and local community, and we feel that by reducing their income they will be further disadvantaged. We also wonder where they will be employed when so many able-bodied people are without paid employment. Our children are in receipt of pensions because of their disabilities which are permanent. </PARA>
<PARA> They have many extra expenses over and above an able-bodied person of the same age. Parents often have to contribute financially, and for parents already on Social Security benefits or low income this is an added burden. </PARA>
<PARA>The members of this group go on to point out a variety of occasions when extra costs are incurred. There are extra transport costs; extra costs for specialised clothing and shoes, as young people grow very quickly in this age range; extra linen; additional laundry expenses; and extra water costs. Extra equipment, which is often expensive, includes things such as hoists, special cutlery, hand-free phones, special educational aids, massage equipment, et cetera. They also need specialised and often very expensive recreation activity, and of course there is the cost of respite care. </PARA>
<PARA> These parents point out that any loss in their child's income could have disastrous consequences. They argue that the margins are already tight for many of these families. They ask what will happen if some families are forced to place their young people into regular full time care. How will Senator Richardson and the Government justify this additional cost to the community?</PARA>
<PARA> There is also a problem with community organisations that are providing accommodation. Many of those organisations take a percentage of the pension. It is not cheaper to look after a person of 19 or 20 compared to a person of 23 to 25. It has been pointed out to the Government many times that the cost of living is the same for all people, whether they are between the ages of 16 and 20, 21 and 30, or indeed beyond. I note that Mr Braithwaite, the shadow Minister for community services, recognised this when he spoke in the House of Representatives on 4 June. He stated then:</PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned that payment for 16-to 20-year-olds will fall below single invalid pension rates. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to point out that this decision fails to recognise the extra cost of a disability and overlooks the real needs of a person with disabilities, particularly in this young age group, which are education, training, transport, and outreach into an adult community. I hope that Opposition senators and perhaps Government senators will support amendments in the committee stage that will remove this injustice and leave young people with a reasonable income. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some progress in the area of the mobility allowance. We welcome the increase in the allowance and the slight extension of the eligibility criteria. This does not go anywhere near far enough and, again, it is a specific recommendation of the report I quoted earlier that a disability allowance should be introduced for all people of working age. The Cass report recommends that such an allowance be provided to people engaged in education, training, job search, employment, community or voluntary activities and those engaged in what the report called caring work, especially household work, child-care, et cetera. The Cass report saw this as being a recognition of the extra cost borne by people with disabilities as they participate in the major areas of activity usually expected of adults. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I emphasise that this Bill continues the recent tradition of poorly conceived legislation that has been a hallmark of Senator Richardson's time in the social security portfolio. Why must legislation be pushed so quickly through the House of Representatives and this place, without any opportunity for many organisations and, indeed, for honourable senators to look at it? I urge Senator Richardson to have another look at this Bill. We will have time to do that; it will probably be Monday before we even get to the committee stage. There is still time to have another look at this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have at least 110 amendments to this Bill, and that number may be growing. While we have removed some of the flaws, some of the inconsistencies, and closed some of the gaps, there is still a long way to go. This Minister's failure to consult with the people affected by the Bill is indicative of the arrogance of this Government and of its inability to realise that it is not dealing just with facts and figures on a legislature sheet; it is dealing with the lives and well-being of thousands of people. It is insulting to these people and deliberately misleading to paint a rosy picture of an active employment scheme for people with disabilities in one year's Budget and to then to introduce in a subsequent year-claiming that everyone supports it-a very different document, one that has been significantly altered and includes a number of harsh new measures, which none of the groups directly affected had seen before the Bill turned up on the floor of the Parliament. I am not sure what style of government this approach represents, but I am certain it is not democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will cause the Government a lot of trouble. I conclude by quoting from the South Australian Consumer Advocacy Program, which sent me a fax yesterday and, I understand, many other senators. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Save yourselves work and embarrassment! Delay this Bill until the Minister gets it right!</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.01 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Few people will dispute that the administration of law tends to lag significantly behind the commercial developments that it controls. Today I would like to give the Senate an extreme example of this and in so doing exhort the Government to support an urgent change to the tax administration of swap financing. Second only to the making of loans themselves, the provision of the corporate banking interest rate risk management device known as swap financing represents the largest part of the service provided by the banks to corporate customers in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Swap financing involves billions of dollars a year. The problem is that swap financing is a highly sophisticated and up-to-date development in international banking but, unfortunately, the Australian Taxation Office is insisting on a medieval tax treatment which is a bit like trying to run a very fast train on wooden rails. I will give an explanation of swap financing because it appears to be a somewhat complicated arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> Put simply, swap financing is an interest rate risk management tool. For example, a company might borrow money that is subject to an interest charge that fluctuates or floats according to market rates. A company therefore may not be comfortable with that type of risk. If so, it can then go to a major bank and arrange to exchange or swap its interest obligation at a floating rate for a swap obligation at a fixed rate. Mechanically, this is achieved simply by the company periodically paying the bank an amount calculated at a fixed rate over the term of the underlying loan and receiving in return payments at a floating rate which the company then uses to fund the interest payments on that underlying loan. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposition I am putting to the Senate today is: what is the appropriate method of accounting for this interest rate swap? There are basically three approaches. Firstly, there is the cash accounting approach, unfortunately adopted by the Australian Taxation Office, which is referred to as the medieval approach. Secondly, there is the daily accruals approach which was widely adopted in the 1960s. Then there is the third and preferred approach used internationally today, which is referred to as the mark to market approach. That is the approach adopted by sophisticated countries in the 1990s. It is also used as a method of overcoming tax avoidance. This third alternative is economically the most correct method. In fact, it has already been adopted in the United Kingdom and has recently been proposed by the US Internal Revenue Service as the standard tax accounting method in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> This financial accounting and tax accounting method seeks to arrive at a true net profit or loss for the period for a particular swap transaction entered into by a bank or a corporate by taking into account both the past realised profit or loss and the future unrealised profit or loss in relation to the balance of the term of the swap transaction. The unrealised portion is arrived at by calculating the present value of the remaining cash flows under the swap transaction according to the current market rates rather than the rates of interest prevailing when the swap transaction was originally entered into. </PARA>
<PARA> This is accepted in the US and the UK, and by many banks in Australia, as being the only true and complete application of the income or loss from the total transaction. This is because it is the only method which values future cash flows as well as accounting for past cash flows. I therefore urge the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Government to adopt the mark to market approach as being the correct approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The second approach was used extensively during the 1960s-this demonstrates how old and archaic the Australian taxation ruling is-and is a compromise approach. It provides a form of net profit accounting but at the same time is a method which fits into traditional financial accounting concepts of historical cost and which also has the benefit of substantial support in traditional Australian tax accounting legal precedents. The accruals method involves the daily accrual of the amounts payable and the amounts receivable under the swap by each party to the swap over the period of time to which the swap payable or receivable relates. This approach is consistent with the traditional general financial accounting principles in Australia, reflecting as it does the matching concept which is fundamental to financial accounting. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of traditional tax law, this type of approach is strongly supported by the earnings basis in the derivation of income as was shown in the Arthur Murray case in 1965, 114 Commonwealth Law Reports 314 and the consumed cost or expense basis of deduction as shown in the Australian Guarantee Corporation case 84 ATC 4642. These cases are themselves based on the financial accounting concept recognised universally as matching. The net effect, over a particular period, of the accruals method is to strike a net realised profit or loss in respect of the swap transaction for the period. However, unlike the correct mark to market approach, no account is taken of the value at balance date of the rest of the transaction. It is therefore only a partial view of the whole of the transaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is quite apparent that because swap transactions hedge interest obligations-or receivables in the case of interest bearing assets-swap cash flows in an economic sense substitute for interest cash flows or at least are analogous to interest cash flows. Accordingly, just as interest as such is at present accounted for on a daily accrual basis for tax purposes, so logically should swap payments be accounted for in the same way or, preferably, on a mark to market basis. Indeed, a mismatch here would significantly reduce the value of the swap as a hedging instrument and thus threaten the continued viability of this valuable financial method management service for the Australian corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA> However, notwithstanding the force of these arguments for the daily accruals basis, the Commissioner of Taxation is proposing to insist that financial institutions and corporates adopt the due and payable/due and receivable or cash basis. Disastrous consequences will flow from the use of this archaic or medieval approach of a technique that went out in the old days when accounting was first emerging. </PARA>
<PARA> The cash basis has a number of disastrous consequences not only for the Australian revenue-consequences which the Taxation Office should have been able to foresee before it made this disastrous ruling-but also for Australian industry. The cash basis approach, which simply makes swap payments deductible at the time of the payment and the swap receipts assessable at the time of receipt, is an open invitation to Australian taxpayers, whether dealing with swap counterparties in Australia or overseas-and I think that is important-to manipulate to the disadvantage of the revenue the timing, that is the important word, of swap payments and receipts so as to defer taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give an example of this tax manipulation under the cash transaction method. A substantial up-front payment made to a swap counterparty outside Australia representing the present value of future periodic swap payments could be made shortly before the end of a taxpayer's financial year. This may or may not occur for good commercial reasons. Under the cash method the payment would attract a tax deduction, while the future receipt under the swap transaction received in the following year would be assessable to tax only in that following financial year. The deferral of tax created by the mismatch of payments and receipts could be perpetuated by the repetition of such transactions each following year. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the mark to market method will calculate a net profit or loss irrespective of the timing of the cash flows and thus avoid such artificial arbitrage problems. Likewise, the accrual method, by spreading receipts and payments over the swap payment period to which they relate, will also avoid such problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Taxation Office approach will put the Australian financing industry at a competitive disadvantage to its non-resident counterparts with whom it must deal on a daily basis. In turn, this will detrimentally affect the Australian corporate sector involved in swap financing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the mark to market method-or the accruals approach-swap transactions can effectively be priced without taking account of the timing of tax payments. This is because the amount of taxable income generated in a particular year of income will not be affected by when cash swap payments are actually made or received. However, under the cash method proposed and demanded by the Australian Taxation Office, where swap receipts exceed swap payments in a year of income, tax will be paid earlier than would otherwise be the case. Accordingly, a swap transaction that has the effect of generating an earlier payment of tax by an Australian bank counterparty will need to have built into the effective rates of interest at which the swap payments are calculated an amount to compensate the Australian counterparty for carrying the cost of having to pay the tax sooner, rather than evenly over the carrying cost of the effective life of the transaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the fact that swap business is highly competitive on an international basis, the Australian bank counterparties will quickly be priced out of such a market. This competitive disadvantage has a flow-on effect to Australian companies. As the swap hedging service to Australian corporates provided by the Australian banks is substantially dependent on the banks being able to offset their positions in the international market, the swap hedging facility will simply disappear from the Australian financial scene to the massive detriment of Australian industry as well as to the banking sector itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, in order for the Australian financial sector to participate effectively in the global financial system, it is important that there be consistency of both the accounting and tax treatment of financing transactions undertaken throughout the world, because we are not an island isolated unto ourselves. For Australia now to adopt a cash basis of tax accounting would be a retrograde step and would remove Australia further away from, rather than closer to, the tax and accounting approaches adopted by the other financial centres around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, Mr Deputy President, I make a recommendation through you to this Senate and to the Government. My recommendation-and this is widely supported by the accounting community-is that the Australian Taxation Office should adopt the mark to market method of tax accounting for all swap transactions. I urge the Senate to support this recommendation and to do so immediately as the Taxation Office is about to release a final ruling on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, if the Tax Office is intransigent I believe legislation should be introduced to amend the tax law to specifically provide for the tax accounting approach that I have recommended. Let us drag the tax treatment of these transactions into the 1990s, and in the process let us get the banking industry and the Australian corporate sector off these wooden rails. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to correct some of the statements made by Senator Olsen in this place in the last sitting week. In doing this I also express my concern that Senator Olsen raised some very controversial matters in the last Thursday lunchtime matters of public interest debate. In fact, he attacked me in this place during that debate on 22 August. I was not in the building. It was lunchtime. I did not have the opportunity to be in the chamber to rebut what he was claiming about me and to defend myself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My understanding is that, by agreement, the Thursday lunchtime debate in this particular place-not this week, but normally-is for matters of public interest. I understand that the agreement is that non-controversial matters are raised at that particular time. I was appalled to read some time afterwards in the Hansard of 22 August that Senator Olsen, on a number of occasions, attacked me for a report in my name in the Adelaide afternoon newspaper, the Adelaide News, on 19 August. I would like to refer to that particular article because in it I actually publicised the very important, large and extensive reductions in sales tax on business and agricultural inputs provided in the recent Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Olsen, perhaps, has not been in this place long enough to understand that one does not raise controversial matters in those Thursday lunchtime debates. Certainly, one does not go out and attack other senators in them. The agreement is that people can go and have lunch. It is not an occasion for major debate, the idea being that matters of public interest only are raised at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Olsen also, apparently, does not understand the Budget process in Australia, even though at one stage he was the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia-a very senior post in the South Australian Parliament. From the tone of his remarks on 22 August he apparently does not believe that the sales tax reductions should be given any press attention at Budget time. They are major reductions in sales tax, they are of enormous value to Australian business and they are substantial measures which are integral parts of the current Budget. I would simply point out to Senator Olsen that the sales tax reductions do appear on at least two occasions in Budget Paper No. 1. My press report was about the Budget and it was referring to those sales tax cuts in the context of the Federal Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> They are important. I know there is concern on the other side of the chamber that by exempting more and more inputs into business production from sales tax, by exempting more raw materials and by exempting more productive equipment-capital equipment-from sales tax we, on this side, are further undermining the case for the broad-based consumption tax; we are further undermining the Liberals' case for a goods and services tax in this country by now reforming, renewing and reviewing the wholesale sales tax to remove a number of business inputs from that tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the sensitivity on the other side about what we are doing to reform the sales tax. In this Budget, at a cost to revenue this financial year of $200m, we are removing a number of inputs into production from wholesale sales tax. This will have enormous benefit for Australian producers of traded goods, that is, Australian production which is exported or which competes directly with imports into this country. That $200m worth of sales tax reductions, that is, the cost to revenue of $200m, will have a big impact on lowering the cost of Australian business production. I point out that, while $200m will be lost to revenue this financial year, the loss to revenue next financial year will be a massive $375m, illustrating the scale of these sales tax reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Olsen claimed, in that supposedly non-controversial matters of public interest debate on 22 August, that I had said there would be $400m in sales tax cuts this financial year. The Budget Papers point out that this year there are to be sales tax cuts of $200m. Unfortunately, Senator Olsen did not understand what I was saying. I understand that Senator Olsen, before he became a member of parliament in South Australia, was also a small businessman, and I am surprised that he does not understand how sales tax impacts on business costs. </PARA>
<PARA> What I said, and this is how I was reported in the Adelaide News, was based on an understanding of how a costing works in business. That is what I said in my press release. We have to look at how a particular tax impacts on costs of production. While the cost to revenue of the sales tax reductions this financial year will be $200m, the value to business in terms of lower production costs is much larger than the $200m. The reason for that is that taxes on inputs, taxes on raw materials, taxes on capital equipment, are subject to the profit margins, the mark-ups on costs, that businesses apply to determine their surpluses. </PARA>
<PARA> As goods pass through the production chain, as goods at the early stages of the production chain are exempted from tax, there is a cascading effect on costs. If costs are lowered at an early stage of production, when a profit margin or a mark-up is applied to that lower cost base there is an even larger reduction on business costs. In fact, the $200m in revenue forgone by the Budget this financial year as a result of those sales tax reductions becomes much larger than $200m. That is the reason the Adelaide News quoted a figure of $400m this financial year as the value to business-not the cost to revenue but the value to business-of the sales tax reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> My press release makes it very clear, and I have a copy of it with me here. It says, `The total value to business will be ` `around double'' the cost to revenue'. The cost to revenue is $200m. My understanding is that around double $200m is $400m. Unfortunately Senator Olsen simply does not understand how business costing works. He jumped at a figure he saw in the Budget for the financial year 1993-94. In other words, there is a figure showing the cost to revenue of these sales tax cuts as being $405m in 1993-94, two financial years out from now. He thought I was talking about those figures. That is what he was attacking me for in the Senate on 22 August. Clearly, he just does not understand that the $200m cost to revenue this financial year will have an around double impact in reducing business costs, so a figure of up to $400m would be involved. As a result of the cascading effect as one reduces a cost at an early stage of production, through the profit margins this becomes magnified and one gets a bigger reduction in costs at subsequent stages in the chain of production. </PARA>
<PARA> We estimate that in the next financial year the cost to revenue of removing sales tax from all these inputs in production will be $375m. The cascading effect on costs-and I know Senator Watson would understand this; he understands business-will be not $375m but around $700m. We will see up to $700m in lower business costs as a result of these measures. I am surprised-Senator Olsen has been in small business-that he does not understand how a cost base cascades as a result of profit mark-ups. My comments as stated in the Adelaide News on 19 August are clearly right, despite the mistaken claims to the contrary made by Senator Olsen. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that these sales tax exemptions in the Budget will be a major boost for Australian business. They will lower the cost structure for those Australian businesses producing traded goods-that is, goods for export. Products will be more competitive compared with products sold in overseas markets. At the same time, these sales tax reductions will reduce the cost structure for goods produced and sold in Australia in competition with imported products. They will be more competitive because the cost reductions will not be available to the imported goods. </PARA>
<PARA> By reviewing the wholesale sales tax system now-what can actually be done to boost business profitability, to lower business cost levels by reforming the tax we now have-we will be able to see its impact without going down the road of a value added tax or a broad based consumption tax. We do not need to have one of those taxes to help lower business costs. We can do it by reviewing sales tax collections on business inputs in the present system. That is what we have done in this Budget at a cost to revenue this financial year of $200m.</PARA>
<PARA> The other reason we do not need to have a new tax is that the present wholesale sales tax is a very efficient and simple tax to collect. It is collected at the wholesale level. There are relatively few wholesalers-probably about 75,000-in Australia. Most people could not even name a wholesaler, there are so few of them. On the other hand, there are probably three-quarters of a million retail businesses in Australia. All of those retail businesses would be in the value added tax net that Dr Hewson wants to put them in by introducing a value added tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very illuminating to look at the latest annual report of the Australian Taxation Office. The present wholesale sales tax costs about 50c for every $100 of revenue collected; so about one-half of one per cent of all revenue collected by the Taxation Office goes in administration costs. I have seen studies of the value added tax system in the United Kingdom which suggest that $2 out of every $100 collected from that tax goes in administrative costs. One can see that the present wholesale sales tax in Australia is a very efficient tax to collect. I cannot understand why people on the other side are saying that it should be reformed because it is a complex tax when, clearly, its collection costs are far lower per dollar of revenue collected than the collection costs of the value added tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by pointing out that with these particular taxes it is not just a matter of the cost to government in collecting these taxes; there is also a huge cost involved to businesses themselves-the small business proprietors, the large businesses-with a value added tax along the lines being proposed by the Liberals. While the Liberals claim that a number of businesses have come out in support of their value added tax, one of Australia's largest retailers, one of Australia's largest proprietors of department stores-the David Jones organisation-is already on the public record as saying that, if the Liberals were ever to be in government and were ever to bring in a consumption tax, a value added tax, David Jones would demand that all of its cash registers, all of its computing systems and computer programming software be converted at government expense to meet the new requirements for a value added tax. So let us have none of this nonsense about the superiority of so-called broad-based consumption taxes over the wholesale sales tax. We can reduce the impact of the wholesale sales tax on business by continuing to reform and review the tax base. </PARA>

<PARA>  It has been decided to move the aircraft noise complaint function from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) because:</PARA>
<PARA>  (1) aircraft noise complaints usually arise as the result of aircraft movements into and out of an airport; therefore it is most appropriate that the authority responsible for generating those aircraft movements - the operator of that airport - be granted responsibility for dealing with the local community on problems created by the airport</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) the FAC has a legislated responsibility to be a `good neighbour' and is constantly dealing with the local community on a range of issues; therefore dealing with aircraft noise complaints will essentially be an extension of the FAC's current community consultation activities</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The article to which Senator Alston refers was divided into three parts, each reflecting the opinion of a different person - the Treasurer, John Kerin, the shadow Treasurer, Peter Reith and the journalist, Nick Richardson. The Treasurer was the author of that part of the article accredited to him.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The estimate of an inflationary effect of 7 per cent resulting from a 15 per cent consumption tax is that provided to this Parliament on 22 August 1990 by the then Treasurer, Mr Keating. See answer to (3) below for details of how the estimate was derived.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The calculations were prepared by the Taxation Policy Division of the Treasury. The assumptions underlying the calculations in (2) above were:</PARA>
<PARA>  (i) estimates were for the 1990-91 financial year;</PARA>
<PARA>  (ii) goods and services were weighted by the March 1990 quarter CPI weights;</PARA>
<PARA>  (iii) a standard ad valorem retail mark-up of 20 per cent was assumed;</PARA>
<PARA>  (iv) any decrease or increase in taxation was assumed to be reflected fully in retail prices;</PARA>
<PARA>  (v) the consumption tax base used was private final consumption expenditure minus expenditure on health, education, financial services and dwelling rent. However, it was assumed that inputs into these services would be taxed. Further, it was assumed that no additional revenue would be collected from products currently subject to excise (petroleum products, tobacco and alcohol) following the introduction of a consumption tax, effectively excluding them from the base.</PARA>
<PARA>  (vi) the consumption tax would replace the wholesale sales tax (WST).</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) The cost of compensating for the introduction of a consumption tax was also a Treasury Taxation Policy Division estimate. The `funding gap' of $3 billion is composed of revenue from a 15 per cent consumption tax, minus revenue forgone by abolishing the wholesale sales tax, minus compensation to social security recipients and taxpayers for the direct CPI effects of the new tax. The assumptions used in arriving at the `funding gap' include those detailed in (3) above. The cost of compensating social security recipients was estimated by updating the aggregates presented in the June 1985 Draft White Paper "Reform of the Australian Tax System", and is therefore consistent with the methodology used there. The cost of compensating income tax payers was estimated using the Draft White Paper methodology.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) The preferred consumption tax option at a rate of 12.5 per cent outlined in the 1985 Draft White Paper would have yielded a net revenue gain of $6.8 billion in 1984-85 after some compensation (other than through the income tax system) and allowance for abolition of the WST. In 1990-91, by comparison, a fully compensated consumption tax applied at that rate (based on the assumptions outlined above, including compensatory income tax cuts) would have resulted in a `funding gap' of $2.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>  There are three main reasons why the 1985 and 1990 `funding gap' estimates differ. First, the revenue base of the consumption tax in 1985 included a class of goods called `restricted' goods, such as fuel, cars and building materials, which were taxed whether purchased by businesses or consumers. These were included in the assumed 1985 tax base to overcome potential avoidance problems and the administrative difficulty that would arise from attempting to separate (tax- exempt) business use from (taxable) private use. However, most advocates of a consumption tax wish to relieve the indirect tax impost on business inputs and therefore the 1990 calculations do not include `restricted' goods in the assumed tax base. In short, the assumed 1990 consumption tax base is narrower, and falls relatively more heavily on final demand, than the one used in the Draft White Paper.</PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, the wholesale sales tax base has been broadened substantially since 1985. While this tends to reduce the price compensation necessitated by a switch to a consumption tax, it also reduces the net revenue gain from the switch. The latter effect was estimated to be larger than the former effect.</PARA>
<PARA>  Thirdly, the net revenue raised from the black economy by a consumption tax is not as large as it would have been in 1985. In 1985 the consumption tax would have applied to expenditure from income that was not taxed; that expenditure would therefore not have attracted compensation through income tax cuts. However, because the Government expanded the income tax base to combat tax avoidance and evasion, the cost of compensating income tax payers for CPI increases has increased substantially.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Treasury is currently upgrading its capacity to model indirect tax changes. It can be expected that that work will shed more light on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) The former Treasurer, in his National Press Club Address of 9 May 1990 detailed the reasons that a consumption tax, particularly one with a funding gap of $3 billion, would not result in a net increase in national savings. I commend the Honourable Senator to read that address.</PARA>
