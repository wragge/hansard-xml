Pursuant to the provisions of section 21 of the Constitution, I notified the Governor of New South Wales of the vacancy in the representation of that State caused by the resignation. I have now received through His Excellency the Governor-General a certificate of the choice by the Houses of the Parliament of New South Wales of Karin Nicole Sowada as a senator to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Paul Alexander McLean.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Treasurer to the Treasurer's statements on interest rates last Thursday that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Further easing now would not affect the economy until 1992, when the recovery should be well under way-a case of too much too late.</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Reserve Bank and the Treasury thought now was the appropriate time (to ease monetary policy), it would have happened.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: what changes have taken place in the economy since last Thursday, five days ago, which justify the one per cent lowering in interest rates today? What complementary measures will the Government be taking to ensure that the rate reduction is sustainable? Is the reason for the seemingly panic cut not more to do with shoring up the fortunes of the failing Prime Minister than with sound economic management?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is fair to say that, as I recall, there have been no dramatic changes in the indicators relating to the Australian economy in the last week. Having said that, let me also say that the Treasurer and others have always said that there would be a further lowering of interest rates at the appropriate time. Very much in the Treasurer's mind was the consideration that the Reserve Bank should meet and consider this issue, as it did today. It was following that meeting of the Reserve Bank that the further interest rate cut was announced. The Government has always said that interest rates should be set to ensure a modest and comprehensive economic recovery and one in which declining inflationary expectations can be sustained. It would be inappropriate to have left nominal rates at the previous level while the expected inflation rate fell away underneath the nominal rates and we still had a situation of relatively high interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In trying to put that into perspective in terms of real interest rates, I make the point that the latest figures for 30 August 1991 show low real interest rates in Japan at 3.9 per cent and Australia at 5.5 per cent. On the other hand, Germany has interest rates at 5.3 per cent; France, 5.8 per cent; Britain, 5.8 per cent; Italy, 7.4 per cent; and Canada, 5.4 per cent. In terms of those countries with which we like to compare ourselves and our economic ambitions from time to time-rightly or wrongly-the level of real interest rates in this country is not vastly different from what is revealed in those figures.</PARA>
<PARA> On 14 August, Senator Short claimed that real interest rates were at near record levels.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Does not the Minister's answer that there have been no significant changes in the economy since last Thursday simply mean that the Treasurer, in his statement last week that a further reduction now would be a case of too much too late, was wrong in his assessment of a fall in interest rates? Alternatively, does it mean that the Reserve Bank rather than the Government is now the sole arbiter of interest rate movements? Will he please answer at least the second part of my question-he did not do too well on the first part-as to what complementary measures the Government will be taking to ensure that the rate reduction is sustainable? If he does not give an answer to that, then the obvious answer to the whole question is that this move has done nothing more than shore up the fortunes of the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1011" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, let me say that the Treasurer's statement this morning, and the complementary statement from the Reserve Bank in particular, referred to subdued economic activity as a reason for the lower interest rates. They talked about the lower rates helping to improve business cash flows and they sought quick action by the banks and other financial institutions in adjusting loans to business in response to this cut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Government consults with the Reserve Bank about these issues. If Senator Short had listened to my previous answer he would have heard me say that, as I understand it, it was the Treasurer's view that he would like to await a meeting of the Reserve Bank before making any further announcements about interest rates. There is no doubt that the government of the day consults with the Reserve Bank about this issue and gets Reserve Bank advice; there is no secret about that.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know the context in which the Treasurer's remark was made last week. I think it was probably made in the context of the lagged effect of lowering interest rates. A further reduction now, as he put it, would be too much too late in terms of the lagged effect of interest rate reductions. Be that as it may, the cut has been made. It is welcomed by the Government; it is consistent with the Government's other policies.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked me about complementary policies which might be embarked upon by the Government. I gave him an answer to that part of his question, but there was such a hubbub from his side of the Senate that he probably did not hear the answer. Sometimes people on the Opposition side of the chamber get too excited; when the polls go up the excitement goes up and Opposition senators' intelligent contributions to this debate go down. I gave the honourable senator an answer to that part of his question and he can look at it in Hansard.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to an article in yesterday's Gold Coast Bulletin which refers to an Australian visa stamp placed on the passports of Taiwanese tourists. Is it a fact, as stated in the article, that Taiwan has threatened to suspend the opening of direct air links to Australia if the wording of the visa is not changed? If so, are Australian and Taiwanese officials working towards the solution of this situation and is it expected that the new air links will commence on schedule?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1012" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation in respect of this matter is as follows: following several years of negotiations, a commercial aviation understanding which provides a framework for establishing Australia-Taiwan air services was signed on 25 March this year. On 28 March Australia-Asia Airlines, a Qantas subsidiary, successfully concluded talks on technical and commercial issues with Taiwan aviation interests and a technical agreement was initialled by both sides. The Taiwan authorities have indicated that the arrangements which have been negotiated are acceptable, but they have yet to sign a technical agreement. A signature is required before airlines from both sides can lodge applications for operating approvals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following an unofficial visit to Australia in July by Taiwan's Minister for Economic Affairs, Mr Vincent Siew, a senior Taiwan official announced that there were no obstacles in the way of the commencement of air services between Australia and Taiwan. However, I have seen press reports-these were reflected in the Gold Coast article-to the effect that Taiwan intends to extract maximum political advantage from commercial deals with foreign companies.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has made it clear to the Taiwan side that our commitment to a one China policy remains firm and that Australia rejects the concept of linkage between what are mutually beneficial economic arrangements, on the one the hand, and issues of a purely political nature on the other.</PARA>
<PARA> I have also seen press reports, which are more explicitly reflected in the article to which Senator Colston refers, to the effect that Taiwan has threatened to suspend the opening of air links with Australia until the wording of an Australian visa stamp, which is placed in the passports of people from Taiwan, is changed. Such a linkage would, as a matter of principle, be totally unacceptable to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I have sought, and have now received this morning, an assurance that the Taiwan side is not, in fact, insisting on a linkage between the relatively small matter of a visa disclaimer stamp and the very significant issue of mutually beneficial air services between Australia and Taiwan. Moreover, I have been informed this morning that the Taiwan side is keen to see air links commence and that the necessary procedures are under way to enable air links to commence within the next month or so.</PARA>
<PARA> May I just say, in respect of the visa disclaimer, that its purpose is to make clear that the issue of a visa and its subsequent insertion into a Taiwanese passport does not in any way imply Australian recognition of the Republic of China-so-called-or the status of its officials. Given that Australia's one China policy is now so well understood on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, I have asked officials to report to me on whether such a disclaimer is necessary any longer. I hope to have their report within the next few weeks and I will make my decision at that time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know what Senator Cook said about this issue, but the point of the question is that there is a lot of press speculation about leadership issues in relation to the Australian Labor Party, there is a lot of press reality about leadership issues in relation to the Australian Democrats and there is a fair degree of speculation about leadership issues in relation to the Liberal Party of Australia. The key question in all of this is whether the Liberals, who seek to attain the golden prizes at the next election, can seriously carry Peter Reith with them into that election campaign. There is a lot of speculation about that behind the scenes in the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it is a real issue. It is a tragic issue about which I and other Ministers are very concerned, but it has to be seen in its proper context. One must look at it in the context of the political opposition in this country. Senator Short was in here two weeks ago, before the Budget, saying that there should be no Budget deficit. Dr Hewson, since the Budget, has been saying that there should be no Budget deficit. The problem for the Opposition is that it has to make up its mind about where it stands on these issues, because no Budget deficit means another 50,000 people unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has to decide-and it is a real problem for those opposite-whether its role model in politics is Arnold Schwarzenegger or Mother Theresa. That is what those on the Opposition benches have to decide. They are very touchy about those seven years in government when they were wimpish about all these issues and did absolutely nothing. They now have to come in here, be tough and try to psych themselves into being a tough opposition. The sad fact is that they are not very good at it.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition comes in here with a bleeding heart, talking about its concern and social responsibility. At the same time, Senator Short and Dr Hewson are talking about there being no Budget deficit and a whole range of other measures which-as pointed out by, I think, a good journalist in the Age today, Michael Short-are not relevant to the real questions which are confronting this country. The Opposition is not relevant to the real questions confronting this country.</PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to take advantage of perhaps mild discomfiture on the part of the Government as a result of the attention of the press to an issue which is not as paramount as the Opposition would like to think. The honourable senator should not come at me with these sorts of questions. Unless the Opposition has its policy settings right, it is not fit to be in government in this country, and it has not got those things sorted out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like all Australians, and particularly members of the Jewish community in this country, I was very saddened to hear of the senseless murder of Mr Yankel Rosenbaum in Crown Heights, New York, on 19 August. The Australian Consul in New York made representations to the New York City police department to request a report on the incident surrounding the death of Mr Rosenbaum. The Consul also contacted the hospital where Mr Rosenbaum died to seek his medical records and asked to be kept informed on developments, including a report of an inquiry into the hospital's handling of his treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Consul also approached the Mayor's office to convey our concerns over the situation and sought assurances that Australians living in the Crown Heights area of New York would receive full protection.

The Australian Consul in New York has also been in touch with an Australian rabbi and other Australians in the Crown Heights area to check on the welfare of Australian citizens. He has provided registration cards in order to obtain details of the Australian citizens in that area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations-and it is with some feeling of trepidation and absolute disbelief, tinged with sadness, that I ask this question of the Minister. Has his attention been drawn to reports that the Opposition intends to cut the ties between Australia and the United Nations International Labour Organisation if the Opposition is ever elected to office? I emphasise the words `if ever'. Is the Opposition spokesperson quoted in these reports the same John Howard who recently attended the International Labour Conference of the United Nations body and took part in its deliberations?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Herald-Sun newspaper yesterday reported-and I assume the report is accurate-that Mr Howard has said that the Opposition dissociates itself from the ILO, that if the Opposition were to become government it would withdraw from the ILO, dismissing the views of the ILO Committee of Experts on Australian industrial relations law as `foolish and gratuitous'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I note in the point of order a rapid remodification of the Opposition's position. I wonder who speaks now on the Opposition's case, Mr Howard or Senator Alston. The United Nations industrial relations agency is the ILO and Australia, as I was saying, is a founding member. We are one of the few continuing members from the old League of Nations days and Mr Howard, it is true, visited the ILO as part of the official Australian delegation last year and this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that context his remarks are extraordinary from several points of view. They are extraordinary as remarks of a politician, because what he said, in expressions of contempt for the international body, has the stamp of a Saddam Hussein of industrial relations. The remarks are extraordinary from the point of view of a lawyer who, in this context, is a disgrace to his profession. He is talking about judges of world rank-not by practitioners of industrial relations-who are experts in the field of industrial relations, making a finding as to the relevance of an international convention and as to whether Australian domestic law conforms to the precepts of that convention, which, after all, is a convention that has been adopted in this country since 1973 and a condition on which we have reported to the Committee of Experts since that time.</PARA>
<PARA> There are five quick points I should make. We as a country are obligated under international law to ensure that national law and practice are in conformity with the freedom of association convention. That is an obligation imposed on us by our embrace of that convention-a convention which we have ratified for 18 years and which has survived under several different types of government in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, if Australia were to withdraw from the ILO, we would be a laughing-stock in the world. We would be one of the few countries, and the only developed country, withdrawing from a world body of this sort; we would be a joke in our region; and we would be eliminated from influence in a significant agency of the United Nations. It would be futile, because our obligations under conventions would continue.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, we could not withdraw from the freedom of association convention in any case. One can only withdraw from conventions every 10 years. The next opportunity for us to withdraw from this convention would be in the year 2000. Even if we did, we would still be bound by the United Nations Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which ensures the right to strike. I point out to honourable senators opposite that this international covenant was adopted by the Fraser Government, not by any Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, it cannot be said-as Mr Howard pretended to say or as some other commentators have said-that the ILO does not know. We are required to report events in Australia to the ILO. We do so and have been doing so since 1973. Australia enjoys the unique distinction of being one of the few countries whose members on all the tripartite bodies are on the governing body of the ILO. The employers' body is represented by Brian Noakes of the Confederation of Australian Industry, the workers' body by Martin Ferguson of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the government body by the Australian Government. All of us are on the governing body of the ILO. We help run the show. So the ILO does know what happens in Australia. In any case, this is a matter of judges expressing a view.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I can say this: Mr Howard's own policy-as I understand it, because it does keep changing-is for workplace bargaining. Under such a system, he argues that there should be no exercise of the right to strike during the period of the bargaining. But that system contemplates the right to lockout and strike when the bargain is being set. Is Mr Howard saying that under his preferred system of industrial relations there will be no rights at all for any organisation, no matter what is happening to it and no matter the industrial circumstances? Is he saying that there will be no rights ever? If he is, let him say that. That is not only a contempt of the ILO but also a contempt of basic human rights principles.</PARA>

That question can be rephrased to read: what sorts of opportunities, what sort of hope, do nearly one million unemployed people have when they are confronted with an Opposition of wimps? They are confronted with no choice. They are confronted with an Opposition which would have no Budget deficit and which would put another 50,000 people out of work on that aspect alone. They are confronted with an Opposition which has had its only political joy in the last few years from rising unemployment. Opposition senators come in here week after week complaining about these issues for which they have a new found social concern.</PARA>
<PARA> I just say that the question has to be addressed in that way. What hope would there be for a society which was subject not only to the sorts of policies which the Opposition now espouses but also even policies which would have a more adverse effect on unemployment in this country than the present Government's policies?</PARA>

Is the Minister prepared to investigate allegations made on the SBS Dateline program on 17 August that in June 1991, an inspection group at Maralinga headed by the British High Commissioner, Brian Barber, discovered what Australian scientists believed could be part of the uranium shield or detonation device from an atomic bomb? I also ask the Minister whether the sample was concealed in a safe at Maralinga to avoid embarrassment to the British Government. I further ask whether the Minister could explain why the sample was not immediately sent to the United Kingdom for proper analysis and identification, and why the discovery was not made public. Will the Minister confirm allegations made on the Dateline report that an Australian radiation laboratory report on isotopic ratios at Maralinga was sanitised at the request of British intelligence in 1988-89 because Whitehall feared it would reveal a breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the other hand, it might be. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has sought advice on the allegations raised in the SBS program and has been advised that a piece of uranium metal recently discovered at Maralinga has no nuclear proliferation significance. This material was secured at Maralinga pending information from the United Kingdom Government as to its possible proliferation significance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Discovery of such items at Maralinga should not be surprising given the extensive program of British nuclear tests that took place there. This piece of uranium was just part of 7,000 kilograms of uranium metal now, in all shapes and sizes, buried at shallow depth at the Kuli site. It was not necessary to send a sample to the United Kingdom for analysis as the United Kingdom Government was able to make an assessment from the information provided by the Australian Government. It is also considered that this material presents no risk to the public while it remains within the restricted area at Maralinga.</PARA>
<PARA> Data produced by the technical assessment group, TAG, in its study program was assessed before publication to determine whether it contained proliferation sensitive information. These determinations were based on advice from the United Kingdom Government and the Australian Safeguards Office. These assessments resulted in minor changes to one of the TAG team's study reports in which some numerical data was rounded in response to non-proliferation concerns. TAG scientists had full access to the unrounded data. Publication of the rounded figures had no significant effect on radiological dose calculations or TAG's conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA> I can also say that scientists from the Los Alamos laboratories of the United States Department of Energy have proposed a joint program of research at Maralinga to study the geochemical behaviour of plutonium in an arid environment. This is a matter of considerable interest in the United States because of its vast legacy of contaminated military nuclear sites. No decision has been taken on the United States proposal, which follows substantial participation by the US Government in the TAG study program.</PARA>
<PARA> While little credence can be given to the interpretations of the scientific opinions by the SBS Dateline program, the program at least provides a timely reminder of the need to resolve the question of rehabilitation of the former British nuclear test sites in Australia following the TAG report.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government shares the concerns of both stevedoring employers and, indeed, the unions about the current level of idle time on the waterfront. However, the Government does not agree with the short-cut solutions that have been proposed by some employers, as well as the unions, in respect of providing redundancy packages to watersiders without going through the process of negotiating enterprise agreements. We have steadfastly resisted that course for a year and will continue to do so. The real solution to the idle time problem is to expedite the remaining enterprise agreements. Indeed, the resolution of outstanding enterprise agreements in just the ports of Sydney and Melbourne will solve the idle time problem in Australian ports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I informed the Senate the last time we sat, I expected a level of exits from the industry by the end of this month of around 1,100. That has, in fact, occurred. By the end of last month 1,102 waterside workers had left the industry under the program. The parties are now giving priority to the conclusion of the outstanding enterprise agreements in the ports of Sydney and Melbourne with the completion of the Conaust and Strang Patrick agreements for those two ports. When these enterprise agreements are concluded, this will see exiting from the industry a further 780 redundant employees which will, in fact, alleviate the idle time problem.</PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to be able to advise the Senate that Conaust advised me this morning that, this morning, negotiations were successfully concluded on the Conaust enterprise agreement for the port of Melbourne. I understand that the actual agreement will be forwarded to WIRA tomorrow for its formal assessment. This agreement will see 218 employees leave that single enterprise by the end of this month.</PARA>
<PARA> The Waterfront Industry Reform Authority advises that in addition to those Melbourne and Sydney agreements, other agreements are expected to be concluded by the end of September which will result in another 440 employees exiting the industry. This means that at around the end of this month or early next month I expect that a total of 2,200 waterside workers will have exited the industry which, effectively, will mean that we will have made up the time lost in some of the delays that have occurred this year. I expect that within the next few weeks we will have successfully concluded the agreements for both Strang Patrick and Conaust for the ports of Sydney and Melbourne.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. Since 13 February this year I have been asking about surcharges on commuter aircraft going into Mascot. In the light of the announcement yesterday that Hazelton Airlines-probably Australia's most efficient small commuter airline-will cease services to 14 country towns this week, does the Minister now concede that the additional charges levied as a result of peak period charging were inappropriate, given the parlous economic state in rural areas, which have resulted in a massive cutback in air services to country areas?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1020" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not. Not only was the level of those charges not excessive in respect of the particular impact they had on Hazelton's passengers, but also I have to say that peak period pricing-and I had a totally open mind on this subject, as Senator Brownhill knows-has proven on analysis to be a very successful regulator in making much more efficient use of the runway capacity at Sydney Airport, with or without a third runway. In fact, it has shifted a great deal of the smaller traffic out of the peak periods successfully and, conversely, has increased the number of larger aircraft-that is, the greater number of passengers-utilising the airport during those times. For the advice of the Senate, the actual impact on Hazelton passengers of peak period pricing was $1.34 per passenger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is regrettable that Hazelton has had to reorganise its schedules, although I have to say that it is not an unusual circumstance with a commuter airline. I must say that it is interesting to note that in respect of the ports which Hazelton has discontinued servicing, the absolute responsibility for providing air services for those ports rests with the New South Wales Government which, of course, regulates the intra-State traffic in New South Wales. It might be very interesting-and I would be happy to provide Senator Brownhill with a copy of this analysis-to compare the per cent charges that Hazelton makes in this regulated environment, in which it has a guaranteed monopoly on services in New South Wales, with the deregulated charges that occur in the intra-State services in Victoria and South Australia. It is an extremely interesting comparison.</PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, Hazelton has suffered in excess of a 40 per cent drop in its passenger numbers in the past 12 months. However, on analysis, there is no question that peak period pricing bears a very small part of that overall cost burden. It is true that the total level of Commonwealth charges has increased over that period of time because of the Government's unabashed policy of moving away from where taxpayers generally are supporting services which the majority of them do not use to where user pays occurs in the aviation industry. I would invite the Opposition to tell me that in government, whenever that happens, that is a policy it would seek to reverse. Undoubtedly, the major cause of the regrettable decline in Hazelton's passengers was the current bite of the recession in the rural areas of New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Does the Minister concede that the cause of the problem is the government charges imposed in the past five years, which have risen from 2 per cent of air fares per passenger to 17.6 per cent and which this year will cost Hazelton $4.2m in imposed government charges?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1020" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, two factors have contributed to Hazelton's problem. A factor is the comparative high fare structure-and that is beyond argument-of the airline. On average, Hazelton is charging between 16 per cent and 38 per cent more for similar mileage over similar routes compared to the deregulated services in both South Australia and Victoria to which precisely the same costs apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those figures that Senator Brownhill provided are accurate. The Government is moving away progressively from a situation where taxpayers generally, the majority of whom do not use air services, were paying the lion's share of the costs of providing these services-the airlines are getting value for money in that the services they are paying for actually are being provided, and they are extremely expensive to provide-to a situation where the people that are using the airline services bear the cost. The Government will not resile from that. Frankly, I would be astonished if the Opposition indicated publicly that its policy would be to move away from it as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Kernot for her continuing interest and pursuit of this extremely important issue. I am aware of the current level of death among Aboriginal women-not just statistically but, of course, personally.

They are, along with their children, the principal recipients of the results of that social situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have pursued the question since Senator Kernot raised it in the Senate. I have been provided with a response from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Research was undertaken by Ms Judy Atkinson into family violence in Aboriginal communities nationally in connection with the national domestic violence education program in 1989-90. The results of this research were published in the form of a booklet and a video entitled Beyond Violence-Finding the Dream by the national domestic violence education program through the Office of the Status of Women in March last year.</PARA>
<PARA> The research highlighted the severity of the problem of family violence in Aboriginal communities. Ms Atkinson indicated that more Aboriginal women have died from violent assault in communities in the Northern Territory and Queensland than the total deaths of Aboriginal men in custody in those States. The results of the research are readily available publicly.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kernot asked about Telecom's response to Ann Moyal's study of women and the telephone in Australia. It is a fact that Telecom actually commissioned this study from Ms Moyal in response to a general lack of research in the area and a positive desire by Telecom to thereby identify areas where Telecom's services could be enhanced and improved. This study was part of Telecom's general funding of research, which was also included more recently in a study of the affordability of the first telephone and the report on social equity in telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is currently considering the results of these studies to address the needs of a range of disadvantaged groups and, in particular, the concerns of Aboriginal women that have been identified by these studies commissioned by Telecom.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1023" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The flooding in Cambodia is distressingly severe. Over 150,000 people have been left homeless in five provinces, more than 100,000 hectares of agricultural land have been inundated, damage to roads, bridges and irrigation systems is reported to be very extensive, and Phnom Penh, itself, is under threat. Relief supplies of all kinds are needed urgently. In addition, the problem of reaching areas which have been cut off by the flood waters has to be addressed. The Cambodians have requested assistance in both of these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given the scale of the flooding and the fact that relief supplies are not readily available in Cambodia, the Government has decided that a relief flight from Australia is warranted. Accordingly, a RAAF Hercules will be made available for this purpose and will travel to Cambodia by the end of this week. The Hercules will take a number of flat-bottomed aluminium boats for delivering relief supplies in flooded areas. It is also likely to carry high energy biscuits, shelter materials, sandbags and cooking utensils. The composition of the cargo is still being finalised.</PARA>
<PARA> We are also proposing to send in an Australian disaster response expert with the relief flight. We will monitor the Australian assistance and examine possibilities for further Australian support. I have approved an amount of up to $200,000 in the first instance to cover these costs.</PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of the settlement process, it is possible to give a very long answer but, under the circumstances, I will keep it short. I simply say that we are very pleased indeed with the progress that has been made in the meeting in Pattaya, which has just concluded, involving members of the Supreme National Council and the representatives of the Permanent Five members of the Security Council.</PARA>
<PARA> The parties went to Pattaya on the SNC's agenda with three of the most difficult unresolved issues in the draft text agreed by the permanent five in November last year, namely, military arrangements, measures against the recurrence of genocide, and sovereignty issues relating to the role of the UN in the transitional period up to the elections in relationship with the SNC.</PARA>
<PARA> As has been reported, the SNC reached virtually full agreement on all three issues at that meeting. Some aspects of the military arrangements and the question of the voting system to be used still remain to be resolved, but there is no reason to believe that these will not be manageable. They were lesser issues than the ones that were resolved at the last meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> There are now very firm grounds for confidence that the settlement process is almost complete. Prince Sihanouk will lead an SNC delegation to the UN General Assembly later this month and there will be further discussions with the Permanent Five representatives there. Assuming that that forward momentum is maintained, there is now a reasonable prospect of reconvening the Paris conference at a ministerial level to conclude a comprehensive settlement by either late October or early November.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, I will not bother. I ask leave to incorporate the technical answer in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>On 21 June 1991 (Hansard, page 5323) Senator Patterson asked a question without notice about the inspection of imported gas cylinders. Her concern was that whereas all Australian made cylinders are subject to testing, imported cylinders are only tested at random. The answer to that question is, as I indicated in my previous reply to Senator Powell on 18 June 1991, that all cylinders are required to undergo the same testing procedures at authorised testing stations.</PARA>
<PARA>There have been, however, some suggestions from sources within the industry that some States may not be policing this requirement for imported cylinders as diligently as their regulations require.</PARA>
<PARA>The question of the inspection of imported pressure vessels and boilers, including LPG cylinders, was discussed at a meeting of the pressure equipment industry which my Department convened in Sydney on 15-16 August. The purpose of the meeting was to examine the regulatory environment faced by the industry, and to formulate steps to achieve a national regulatory framework for the industry. The meeting was attended by regulators, manufacturers and end-users of pressure equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>On the question of imported LPG cylinders, it was acknowledged that some imported cylinders slip through the regulatory net, due mainly to lack of resources within the regulatory authorities. However, the regulatory authorities also confirmed that consignments of faulty imported cylinders had been detected and destroyed. The meeting also agreed that my Department, in consultation with the regulatory authorities, should examine ways of ensuring compliance with the testing requirements including traceability of faulty equipment to manufacturers, suppliers and overseas approval bodies.</PARA>

The advice that we now have from the International Committee of the Red Cross confirms that the ICRC has not received any allegations of torture or ill treatment at either the Dakawa or Mazimbu camps-the two ANC settlements where Australia has been funding training and education activities through relevant non-government organisations. Accordingly, I stand by the assurance I gave in the course of the earlier answer that there is no foundation for the imputation that Australian aid funds have gone to such establishments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter asked me earlier in Question Time today how advanced the plans were for another runway at Perth Airport and whether it was true that the Federal Airports Corporation has asked the Water Authority of Western Australia to prepare a drainage concept plan for the area and, if so, when it was begun.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to Senator Coulter's question is that the Federal Airports Corporation has no plans at present to build another runway at Perth Airport. However, a future requirement for another runway has been recognised in the master plan which deals with the longer term needs of the airport. The FAC has advised that there were discussions with the Water Authority of Western Australia some time ago about proposals by the Authority to drain hill areas for redevelopment in the context of a review of the master plan for the airport. The FAC is not happy with the proposed drainage concept plan and the matter has not been taken any further in the last 10 months.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Airports Corporation believes that it would be possible to drain the surrounding areas in such a way as to complement the wetlands area rather than adversely affect that area. The FAC has written to State and local authorities and various interest groups giving them an undertaking that the Corporation will enter into full dialogue with them before any action is initiated for the wetlands area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 August, Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked me a question about existing arrangements for testing imported foods for certain residues. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Under the national imported food inspection program introduced by the Government in July last year, a range of imported foods is tested by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) to ensure they meet Australia's food safety standards.</PARA>
<PARA>The foods to be covered by the program are classified by the Imported Food Risks Advisory Committee (IFRAC) according to the risks they pose to human health. IFRAC is comprised of a number of specialists representing the NHMRC, Federal and State Health authorities, consumers and importers.</PARA>
<PARA>To this point, in assessing risks to health posed by various foods IFRAC has concentrated on the more dangerous microbiological contaminants and it is therefore true that only limited testing for chemical residues is presently being undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA>In its future risk assessments, IFRAC is expected to focus more on residues in food. Foods will be included for point of entry testing where there is a significant health risk. Obviously, however, Australia could not justify imposing a testing requirement without evidence of risk.</PARA>
<PARA>I am advised that AQIS will refer the Honourable Senator's concerns about organochlorin residues in processed fruit and vegetable imports for IFRAC's early consideration.</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) the Treasurer's statements on 29 August 1991 that any further easing of interest rates now would not affect the economy until 1992, when the recovery should be well under way, and that a reduction in interest rates now would be a case of too little, too late, and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1991 Budget has been brought down at a time when Australia is in the deepest recession that it has been in for 60 years. It is a Budget which should have been about growth, job creation and alleviation of the misery and hardship incurred by the people of Australia over the last eight years of this Hawke-Keating Government. It should have been about jobs, jobs and more jobs but, instead, this Budget is about fewer jobs, more unemployment and more hardship for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Budget forecasts an increase in unemployment from a figure of around 10 per cent to a figure that will peak, according to the Government, at 10.75 per cent and, for the year as a whole, will average 10.5 per cent. Everyone knows that those figures are underestimates of the real level of unemployment in this country because, taking all factors into consideration, the number of unemployed in Australia today is in excess of one million people. What this Budget really is about is a self-preservation job. It is more concerned about preserving one job in Australia-the job of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-than ensuring jobs for average Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Budget we have seen, and for months preceding it we saw, nothing in terms of government in this country but division, leadership squabbles, and leadership tensions and battles that have absolutely obliterated from the Government's mind any approach to rational economic policy or indeed any other policy making. This Budget was another lost opportunity; a great loss for those million Australians who are unemployed and those further people who are destined, in the Government's own words, to join the dole queues. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployment benefit payment figures in this Budget are in excess of a staggering $5 billion. Indeed, they are closer to $7 billion. There has been a doubling of unemployment benefit payouts in this country in the last two years. The number of jobs lost in Australia in the last 17 months under this Government is no less than 322,000. Over the last 12 months the drop has accelerated to the point where almost 1,000 Australians have lost their job every day of the year. Almost 1,000 Australians every day of the year have found their jobs destroyed by the policies of this Government, by the ineptitude of this Government and by the fact that this Government is not concentrating on governing Australia. What this Government is concentrating on is its leadership-internal ego-tripping disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> A party that deliberately engineers, pulls the levers and creates more than one million unemployed persons cannot call itself, by any stretch of the imagination, a Labor Party. This is not a party for labour. This is not a party for any Australian. This is a party for the destruction of the economy and through that the society we have known throughout most of our federation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a destructive act that has not occurred just because of the present Prime Minister-one of the chief architects though he may be. It certainly has not occurred as a result of the appointment of the new Treasurer (Mr Kerin), because he has not been Treasurer long enough to do that, although his performances in recent days-particularly the extraordinary confusion brought to money markets as a result of his statement only five days ago that we did not need an interest rate cut, that it would be inappropriate and that it would be too little too late; followed by the announcement today by the Government of a one per cent fall in interest rates-have seen him beginning to show the ineptitude of his predecessor. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this Budget was brought down by Mr Kerin, it is a Hawke-Keating Budget. There is no way, despite the former Treasurer's attempts to rewrite history and his role in the economic policy formulation of this country over recent years, that he can absolve himself from the responsibility of being the chief architect of the economic policies that have brought more hardship, a greater loss of jobs and a more rapid rise in unemployment in this country than at any stage in the last 60 years. In my own State of Victoria the situation is desperate. For six months now unemployment in Victoria has well exceeded 10 per cent. Indeed, male unemployment is closer to 11 per cent. Victoria is worse hit than many other States, although several States are in a similar position and virtually every State of Australia is suffering the same problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only a few weeks ago that the new Treasurer, Mr Kerin, gave a speech which was regarded by some as a fairly seminal speech about social justice. It was a good speech. It was worth reading because it tried to expand the horizons a little. The Treasurer said in his speech to the Irish-Australian Chamber of Commerce:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the most effective anti-poverty policy ever implemented has been sustained economic growth. It has brought increased social justice to hundreds of millions of people on our planet. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely right. If a government is concerned with social justice; if a government is concerned with compassion; if a government is concerned with jobs and providing people with the opportunity to increase their living standards to be able to live the sorts of lives that we all want and aspire to and, even more, want our children and grandchildren to aspire to, then growth is the sine qua non. What does this Treasurer do? This Treasurer and his predecessor and the Prime Minister for the whole period-Prime Minister Hawke-have presided over policies that have produced exactly the opposite to what Treasurer Kerin is saying is required in terms of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that I find absolutely incredible is that so divided is the Labor Party, and so divided is the Government, that they want to toss out the Prime Minister because they think he is too old and is getting a bit like Methuselah, and replace him with a person who has been the greatest architect of the greatest disaster-the greatest causer of hardship to Australians-in Australia's history. I find that absolutely incredible. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this Budget is a Budget of lost opportunity. There is a great deal that this Government could have done for the people of Australia. Sure, there is no quick fix; sure, there is no magic pudding: it will be a long, hard slog. But unless we start making policies that will turn Australia around-that will provide hope, incentive and opportunity for people and businesses alike to invest and get on with doing the things that we all want to do-then the task will be so much harder in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a Budget of greatly missed opportunities. A great deal could have been done. There could have been a much tighter approach to government spending and fiscal policy. The Government's own spending policies have blown out enormously, not just because of unemployment benefits but because it did not have the guts, the courage or the ability to take the necessary steps to rein in its own situation. As a result, interest rates will be considerably higher than they otherwise would have been. This year the Government will have to sell $11 billion worth of bonds in the bond market. That is more than a doubling on last year. If there is to be any recovery in the economy in the course of 1991-92, it will come very late in the piece. The bond selling operation will compound the difficulties of any recovery. It runs every risk of cutting off the recovery, in the same way as has happened time and again in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no attempt in this Budget to tackle the foreign debt problem or our balance of payments problem. There has been no attempt to tackle the real problems that we face. The Government should have made a meaningful start by reforming the tax system. It should have lowered the overall rate of tax; reduced personal income tax; abolished the stupid wholesale sales tax and replaced it with a fair and equitable goods and services tax; provided the necessary compensation to pensioners and low income earners in that sort of situation; and given flexibility to the labour market-all the other things that we know are needed. In 1983, in this chamber Senator Richardson said:</PARA>
<PARA>I might say that the Labor Government was elected primarily on the issue of unemployment. It recognises its responsibilities in this area and if it fails over the years to meet the problem of unemployment it will not be elected again and it will not deserve to be. </PARA>
<PARA>Amen to that. The voters of Australia will say amen in trumps when the next election is held. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -This afternoon we are having a special debate on the 1991 Federal Budget. We are canvassing the various issues and the parameters involved in setting the Budget for this financial year. The Budget proposes a deficit-that is, an excess of expenditure over revenue-of $4,700m. I might point out that this is a cyclical and not a structural deficit. It is not one that reflects longer term factors. It is simply a deficit that reflects our position in the economic cycle due to the impact of the automatic stabilisers-that is, changes in revenue and outlays reflecting the current economic position. We are not talking about a longer term deficit. We are not talking about permanent changes in policy on the expenditure or revenue fronts which impact on the final bottom line of the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year the Budget provides for 2.6 per cent real growth in outlays. In other words, spending in the Budget will grow 2.6 per cent faster than the inflation rate in the community. Of course, the inflation rate is now very low. Revenue, however, will fall by 4.1 per cent in real terms. So the net result is a Budget deficit. For the edification of Senator Short, this is the first Budget deficit in five financial years at the national level in Australia. In the last four financial years the Hawke Labor Government delivered Budget surpluses. This is something the Liberals were totally and utterly incapable of doing in all their years in government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What was the adjustment in the figures for last year?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was still a surplus of nearly $2 billion. Senator Tambling is very sensitive about this; he does not like hearing the truth about his Party's record. For four financial years in a row this Government has delivered a Budget surplus at the national level in Australia-something those opposite were totally and utterly incapable of doing in all of their years in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that, in the Budget, revenue as a proportion of gross domestic product-that is, revenue in relation to Australia's national income, if you like-is equivalent to 24.5 per cent. However, when the Liberals were last in office, revenue was not 24.5 per cent of gross domestic product; it was 26.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> So, on the basis of this important indicator, Labor is clearly not a high taxing party. In fact, the record under the Liberals shows that Federal government revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product was 1 1/2 percentage points higher in their last Budget than now. We hear continual rhetoric from the Liberals about government spending. The reality is that government spending in this Budget, as a proportion of gross domestic product, will be 25.7 per cent. In 1982-83, the last year in which a Liberal-National Party coalition Government was in office, Budget outlays were 28.8 per cent of gross domestic product. So, clearly on the basis of those figures, Labor is not a big spending, high taxing government. The reality, as we have seen time and time again, is quite different from the Liberal Party rhetoric on government spending. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very illuminating to look at the specifics of the Budget in terms of where the increases occur in government spending. Across-the-board there is a 5.7 per cent monetary increase in spending. The highest growth areas include a 29 per cent growth in law, order and public safety; and a 17 per cent growth in general and scientific research, which is part of the Government's clever country policy. We are trying to underpin the longer term viability of Australian industry by boosting research and development spending in the Australian community. The Budget provides for an increase of $19 1/2m for stages 1 and 2 of the cooperative research centres program. There is a 10 per cent growth in education outlays and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the new initiatives, the better cities project, comes under the heading of housing and community amenities. There is a 9.7 per cent growth in that area; in other words, 9.7 per cent compared with an average growth in spending of 5.7 per cent. An amount of $56m has been allocated this financial year for improving urban infrastructure and urban public works and renewing facilities in our large metropolitan cities. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this Budget contains important revenue measures. These measures include the first full financial year impact of the income tax cuts which began on 1 January this year. They involve increasing the tax free threshold-that is, the amount of tax exempt income-and reducing the marginal rates of tax. This financial year those income tax reductions will cost the Budget $1,100m. But the reductions are not offset by any changes in the Budget; they are not offset by any expenditure cuts. The Budget provides for personal income tax cuts of $1,100m this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the items that is clearly ignored by those on the other side is the large reductions in wholesale sales tax which will occur this financial year. As a result of Government policy, more and more inputs used by business for production purposes-that is, raw materials, capital equipment and so forth-will be exempted from sales tax. As a result of those moves, the Budget revenue will be $200m less this financial year, rising to $375m less next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> This important measure will help business contain costs by freeing a lot of the inputs-the raw materials and the capital equipment used in production-from sales tax. Goods used in storage, handling and dispatch at goods producing premises will be exempt from sales tax. Pre-production items will be exempt. For example, all goods used in research, development, engineering and technical design will be sales tax exempt in this Budget. Honourable senators who represent or reside in rural areas will be pleased to know that this Budget will, as a result of the sales tax changes, completely exempt hand tools used in agriculture and the fishing industries. The total cost to revenue of those measures this financial year is $200m. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that the Budget does not contain a consumption tax. This afternoon Senator Short talked about the Liberal Party policy of introducing a consumption tax should it ever be elected to office. It is absolutely and abundantly clear that there will not be a consumption tax-that there will be no tax on food, clothing or footwear introduced by this Government either in this Budget or in future Budgets. This is a Liberal Party policy. Our Budget will not make every Fletcher Jones, Sussan, Williams shoes, and Betts and Betts shoe shop a branch office of the Australian Taxation Office. The reality is that that is what those opposite are going to do. That is what they are on about and that is what their policies will lead to. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that those opposite are making a pilgrimage regularly to New Zealand. They rush over to New Zealand to see what has been happening under the conservative Government in that country. Time and time again they make the pilgrimage across the Tasman to see what has been going on under the conservatives in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out what would happen to the price of books in Australia if that group on the other side of the chamber were ever elected in this country. I will show what would happen to the price of books in Australia. I have here a book from the Department of the Parliamentary Library. The Australian price is $9.95. The New Zealand price is not $10.95 but $19.99, including a goods and services tax. This is a Penguin book retailing in Australia for $9.95. The New Zealand price is $19.99, including a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the people opposite who want to bring in a goods and services tax. They want to copy New Zealand. This is what they want to do: they want to tax the book industry. The reality is that they will put a tax on knowledge in this country. That is what is happening in New Zealand right now. There is a $10 difference in the price of a quality paperback book as a result of the introduction of a goods and services tax in New Zealand. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will pick up where Senator Maguire just finished off, with his shout across the chamber that we this side of the chamber would impose a tax on knowledge. That is an ironic statement coming from a man who represents a government which has just broken one of its promises to the students of this nation not to increase the HECS in excess of the rate of inflation. Instead, what this Government did in this Budget, about which he was trumpeting a few moments ago, was increase HECS in excess of $140 over the indexed cost of education. What this Government has done is intellectually, morally and politically dishonest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no surprise that Senator Maguire comes in here and tries these half-baked half-truths in an attempt to hoodwink the Australian populace. The truth is-and Senator Maguire has to accept this fact-that eight years of this Labor Government have destroyed the economic fortunes of this nation and have turned a generation of young Australians to a future of despair and desperation. How is this being done? It is being done through a massive and staggering youth unemployment rate and through a government that has no policy to deal with the creation of jobs or to deal with the jobs that it wipes out by the thousands every week. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Maguire, the much touted economist from the Government's back bench, finds himself curiously at odds with Senator Button, the Minister representing the Treasurer, and indeed with the Treasurer, Mr Kerin. Senator Maguire's opening comment was that the Budget had gone $4.7 billion into debt and that we should not worry because this is not a structural deficit but a cyclic deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an interesting view of economics from Senator Maguire. The Treasurer, Mr Kerin, on the 7.30 Report on Budget night said that it was a structural deficit. I quickly consulted Hansard. On Wednesday, 21 August, Senator Button said in response to a question from Senator Short:</PARA>
<PARA>I have consistently maintained in this place that it is a structural deficit caused by the recession. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a curious interpretation of the facts from Senator Maguire. If Senator Maguire cannot even work out whether it is a structural deficit or a cyclic deficit and if he puts himself at odds with his own Treasurer and with the Leader of the Government in the Senate, what credence do we give to the other statements that he makes in this place? What credence do we give to the other statements of a man who has deliberately tried to hide the facts about the stark economic truth of this Government's policy?</PARA>

Senator Maguire's latest stunt of waving around a book and saying that the difference between the price of a book in Australia and its price in New Zealand is based solely, 100 per cent, on the fact that there is a goods and services tax in New Zealand is ludicrous. He did not even have the honesty to quote the price in Australian dollars for the book in New Zealand. He used a New Zealand dollar price and an Australian dollar price and tried to hoodwink the populace and those of us in the chamber into believing that the price difference is due to a goods and services tax.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He does not even know the Standing Orders. He cannot interject from a seat other than his own. He does not have the honesty to talk about youth unemployment. Senator Maguire might not like it, but I will talk about youth unemployment in my State of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are the facts about youth unemployment in Queensland? In June 1990, 80,300 people aged between 15 and 19 years were in full time employment. In June 1991, 12 months later, how many young Queenslanders aged between 15 and 19 were in full time employment? There were 56,100. This Government, in the space of 12 months, wiped out 24,000 full time youth jobs in my State of Queensland. It is not just confined to Queensland. It is not just my State where this Government has wreaked its economic havoc. It has done so in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania-everywhere across this nation, where we have seen the results of an eight-year flirtation with the policies that this discredited Labor Government has tried to advocate. For example, in Brisbane, 11,800 full time youth jobs were wiped away in a year. Across regional Queensland the effect of this has been just as bad, if not worse. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is-and those opposite do not like acknowledging it, but it is true-that it is the young people of this nation who suffer in a recession. If they have just left school and go for job interviews, the first question they are asked is, `What is your work experience?'. If they are young and they answer honestly, most of the time they have to say that they do not have any work experience. The employers then say, `I do not have a job for you'. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad fact is that the young people of this nation will bear the brunt of this recession. Young people in this nation have the highest unemployment rate across all groups. Twenty-seven per cent of young people in Queensland looking for full time employment cannot find a job. Over a quarter of the young people in Queensland are consigned to the unemployment scrap heap by a party that calls itself the Labor Party. Twenty-seven per cent of young people in Queensland are consigned to the unemployment scrap heap by a party that puts up people like Senator Maguire, with their half-baked half-truths, in an attempt to hoodwink the populace from what everybody knows is the truth, although those on that side might not like to acknowledge it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a social cost to this youth unemployment and I will tell honourable senators about it. In Cairns, 56 per cent of all crime is committed by juveniles-people aged 18 or younger. It is no surprise that the reason for this is that Cairns and the far north have one of the highest unemployment rates in Queensland, and it impacts on young people. It is no surprise that, in a town where there is the highest rate of single parent families in Queensland and an excessively high unemployment rate, there is an alarming youth crime rate. All of those young people who commit a crime and are apprehended have a blot on their life from now until the day they die. Those young people have been driven there because of the failed policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that any government has a right to impose by design a recession that discriminates against young people-the future of this nation. I do not believe that any government has a right to consign people to the scrap heap, be it the unemployment scrap heap or the social scrap heap, because they were foolish enough as a result of the unemployment rate and a lack of opportunity to commit petty crime, juvenile crime. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has no right to do it; no government has a right to do it because the young people of this nation are the future of this nation. If this Government destroys the hopes and aspirations of young Australians we can have no hope for better standards of living across this nation. We need to tap into the powerhouse of Australian youth. We need to create incentive and we need to let young people know that there is a reason for striving; there is a reason for trying to do better for themselves. But this Government has cruelly kicked their aspirations in the teeth. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the Government that, in the middle of a recession when one million people are out of work, is imposing a tax on jobs. This is the Government that will strangle the hopes and ambitions of hundreds of thousands of school leavers this year by throwing them into an economy which does not have any jobs and into a job market which will shrink at an ever-expanding rate as the Government taxes the life out of small business. This is the Government that comes before us and parades its social conscience. This is a Government that ought to be wholeheartedly ashamed of the things it has done to this nation. Over eight years it has destroyed the strength of this nation, over eight years it has sapped the willpower of this nation and over eight years it has destroyed the economic future of this nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hawke Labor Government was first elected to office nearly nine years ago. Two weeks ago it brought down a Budget which has done nothing for the unemployed-now approaching one million people. We see the occasional improvement in one set of figures, only to see the next show a continuation of this country's endemic current account problem. We are bumping along on the bottom of a recession-cum-depression. The Government's economic performance makes a sheer mockery of the notion of repaying the Australian people for their faith in the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hawke Government clearly bases its policies on whatever is politically or economically opportunistic at the time. Over the years we have seen the Government twist and turn on economic policy. In 1983 the Hawke Government had a policy of fighting unemployment first through the assistance of the so-called accord. This has since changed to the balance of payments being the Government's main economic concern, followed, most recently, by a `fight inflation first' policy. It is really a case of the Government making the best of a bad economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody believes the inflation target of below 4 per cent was a goal that this Government always intended to reach. We did not hear about it until it had occurred. I cast my mind back and I checked the Hansard of 16 March 1982, in which Mr Hawke is recorded as having stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, that it-</PARA>
<PARA>he was speaking of the then Fraser Government-</PARA>
<PARA>would stop the ludicrous and obscene ritual in which it engages each month of trying to pick one element or other out of the statistics and to confect some fantasy which puts an unrealistically favourable perspective on the employment and unemployment situation in this country; and, secondly-and as I say, relatedly-that the Government would accept that it has been obstinately wrong-headed in its economic diagnosis and prescriptions and that it would now move positively to undertake policies and programs calculated to improve what has developed into both an economic disaster and a social tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA>His words must come back to haunt him. Lower inflation is the result of the worst recession since the Second World War. This Government has literally driven the country into recession through a policy of record interest rate levels from mid-1989 through to late 1990. We have seen a record number of bankruptcies, particularly among small businesses, and a rate of unemployment of around 10 per cent. I believe that there is another one per cent hidden in the invalid pension figures as well. There are 220,000 people, on the Government's own admission, who are about to receive disability support pensions, and I believe that more are hidden in those figures. Clearly, the Government has an extremely poor overall record on economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> What kind of winners are the Australian people where this economic mess is concerned? From the very first major economic disaster of the Hawke Government in 1985 when economic activity collapsed, inflation began to accelerate and the value of the Australian dollar collapsed, followed by a debt explosion, and every Australian has paid dearly. Today the Reserve Bank of Australia announced a drop in interest rates of a full one per cent. Obviously, the Government has panicked in an attempt to stimulate employment and it is an admission that recovery will be even slower than it anticipated in the Budget Papers which were released only 13 days ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployed are suffering particular hardship. Let us pause for a moment to examine the unemployment figures. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) clearly has a short memory. In 1983 he clearly believed that youth unemployment was something not to be tolerated. He said, `No Australian government should be forgiven for creating the levels of youth unemployment of the last couple of years which cannot, and should not, be tolerated'. We have heard this afternoon the passionate speech from Senator O'Chee, who is representing those young people. Again, it should be emphasised that this situation has occurred because of the Hawke Labor Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The levels of youth unemployment involving young Australians aged 15 to 19 years who cannot find full time jobs are now far greater than at any other time in our history. Yet this Labor Government still has the temerity to paint itself as the true party of full employment. In the past 12 months alone, 129,200 young Australians have lost their jobs. That figure represents the biggest 12-month loss of jobs by young Australians ever recorded. What has Mr Hawke said about that? On 18 August 1982 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . we will be dealing with the single most important and potentially dangerous issue confronting our country; that is, the total collapse of the labour market and the increasing permeation of our society by the devastating cancer of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that he reads his words again. Nine years later it is clear that this Government has no economic answers or vision for Australia as this country moves into the 1990s. It is a party which is too riddled with factional battles and leadership tensions to summon the will to take the decisions which are really necessary if Australia is to escape from its economic morass. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of interminable leadership bickering and quick-fix solutions to economic problems which are largely of their own making, the Prime Minister and his Ministers should go out and talk to those unemployed; talk to the people in the community-the manufacturers, the farmers or the miners who are trying their hardest to compete in international markets. Where is the urgency in dealing with such important matters as excessive transport costs, excessive waterfront and shipping charges, unnecessary government regulations and red tape, black bans, go-slows, stop works and labour market deals? All of these problems only serve to impede Australia's progress in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, Mr Hawke and Mr Kerin find their time consumed by fighting a rearguard action against Mr Keating's leadership ambitions rather than concentrating on Australia's dire economic problems. Who is calling the shots? Two weeks ago Mr Kerin said that there was no need to lower interest rates and now, two weeks later, we have a complete turnaround. Did the chicken farmer Treasurer have all of his feathers plucked by the Keating vulture, is it the Keating chicken-hawk or is Hawke a chicken? I am not too sure. Does the Treasurer now have any feathers to fly with after that attack?</PARA>
<PARA> His Budget is in tatters. The appalling performance of selling the Budget must be making Government senators cringe. The performance of the Prime Minister and Mr Kerin on The Midday Show was pathetic. With one million people unemployed, we have the obscenity of the Prime Minister paying $1.4m for a harbourside house in Sydney and talking about compassion with tears in his eyes. He talks about the pity that he has-which he alleges that we did not have-for the unemployed, while he spends $1.4m on a harbourside house. Where did he get the money? What deal was done to allow a Prime Minister to spend $1.4m to pay for a harbourside house while the country is in such dire economic straits?</PARA>
<PARA> Why has the Government not done something for the unemployed? It is obvious that government expenditure must be cut rather than relying on interest rates to cut private spending. The Government should reshape our tax system in order to restore incentives and also remove the damaging bias against our badly needed export industries. The Government should also boost national savings. The Budget 1990-91 has failed on all of the above counts. There are still no signs of the Government finally showing the determination to tackle the real issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue that I wish to address today is of great importance and was a matter announced in the Budget 1990-91. I refer to the continuation of reform of superannuation that this Government commenced in 1983. Superannuation is one of the most fundamental reforms that the Government has undertaken over the past decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Prior to the election of the Federal Labor Government, superannuation in this country had a number of undesirable characteristics. It was largely confined to those persons who were in the higher pay bracket. The tax on superannuation was 5 per cent-an issue that I will come back to in a moment. Because superannuation was largely confined to those who were higher paid, it meant that persons in the lower paid bracket, overwhelmingly women, had no superannuation provisions at all. Superannuation was also characterised by high commissions and agents' fees. Superannuation was characterised by minimal prudential provisions in the way in which it was administered. For our increasing ageing population who will be facing the prospect of a real decline in the value of their pensions in the future because we will not be able to afford to continue to pay pensions, it was imperative that the issue of superannuation was tackled in a cohesive, well planned and fair way. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier the 5 per cent tax that existed on superannuation. At that time the tax had a fairly perverse effect, in that those persons who were not receiving superannuation-that is, those who were lower paid-were artificially subsidising the superannuation of those who possessed it: the higher paid. That was an absurd and ridiculous outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last eight or nine years, this Government has set about a number of fundamental reforms to superannuation. The reforms included the encouragement and development of industry superannuation funds through the accord process and the establishment of minimum contribution levels of 3 per cent. As a consequence of those developments, the coverage of the work force by superannuation has risen from a little over one-third to some 70 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Included in the latest announcements were significant further reforms of superannuation. The Government has announced its intention to ensure that by the year 2000-01 a minimum of 9 per cent of payroll is contributed into superannuation funds, the current level being 3 per cent. This is to be phased in over the next nine years in a responsible manner. It is to be phased in by ensuring that employers in small business with payrolls of under $500,000 are not affected by this provision until 1993-94. For larger employers with payrolls greater than $500,000, the tax, already at 3 per cent, will commence at or rise to 5 per cent in 1992-93. I hasten to add that many of those large employers are already contributing 5 per cent-in some cases much more than 5 per cent-and, therefore, the provision will not hit large business in a significant way for the next two or three years. To phase in superannuation in that way is economically responsible. We should remember that at the present time employers are required legally to pay a minimum of 3 per cent. Unfortunately, many are not meeting their legal requirements; they are breaching the law. </PARA>

<PARA> On the other announcements that have been made, significant changes have been made to the prudential control of superannuation. I have already mentioned the sorts of characteristics that superannuation featured prior to 1983: minimal prudential controls and high commissions and agents' fees. It was very hard to obtain publicly information on the supervision of superannuation. A broad feature of the Government's approach to prudential control is its determination in the area of competition policy to develop a prudential framework which will foster rather than inhibit competitiveness within the superannuation industry. It aims to ensure that many of the secrets that have been kept hidden are exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of enforcement powers, the current arrangements for the regulation of superannuation rely on the taxation power, the result being that the only sanction that can be used against the funds for failing to comply with the regulations is the withdrawal of tax concessions. This is a disproportionate way in which breaches of the regulations should be dealt with. New regulations are being developed to ensure that when there are breaches the penalties paid are in proportion to the breach. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission will continue to regulate access to tax concessions and will continue to be the primary regulator in respect of superannuation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the entry requirements in the superannuation field. Unfortunately, in the past, persons who have been convicted in this country of certain offences have been able to be involved in superannuation. The Government is considering measures to control the entry of such persons and their involvement in the superannuation industry. The measures under consideration include requirements that those dealing in corporations law who have convictions in respect of dishonest conduct or who are bankrupts be excluded from key positions in the management and control of superannuation funds. That is a highly desirable development. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that additional prudential requirements for funds and institutions offering pensions and annuities continue to be developed. It is important that further resources are made available to the ISC to ensure that there is adequate auditing and observation of prudential standards in the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an increased emphasis on industry education. All too often, as we have seen with company directors over the last few years, people have not been adequately educated in respect of their responsibilities. The introduction of approved education and minimum training standards for trustees of superannuation funds is another feature of the Government's latest announcements. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the sorts of issues that have been outlined recently in the development of a cohesive, well-planned, fair and cost effective superannuation policy. </PARA>

What is the policy of those opposite on superannuation? They do not have a policy. For the last decade, those opposite have been making policy on the run, such as it is. The Opposition spokesman, when he is challenged to put up a comprehensive retirement policy for superannuation for people in this country, does not have a policy, which is an incredible situation. Superannuation is one of the most important issues facing the future of retirees in this country and the Opposition does not have a policy. Add to that the irresponsible approach of those opposite in the way in which they want to spend those superannuation funds. They have made wild and untrue accusations about this Government's approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the attention of honourable senators to a recent media interview with a Liberal Party spokesperson in Tasmania. It makes very interesting reading. Those opposite talk about responsible expenditure and investment of superannuation funds. Last week on the 7.45 a.m. news on the ABC, Mr John Cleary, a well known non-spokesman on financial matters, said to a reporter:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has been called on to implement an ambitious plan to refinance its loan program . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that it was a loan program that arose as a consequence of the catastrophic economic condition that the Liberal Party left Tasmania in. Mr Cleary went on:</PARA>
<PARA>There will be in Tasmania over the next ten years between $700m and $2,000m of occupational superannuation funds that will need to be invested on behalf of Tasmanian workers. At the moment, there is no guarantee that we intend to use those funds to pay off the debts of Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The unemployed are in danger of becoming the forgotten section of our society. We have to keep repeating the figures to remind those opposite that there are 831,900 unemployed in Australia-almost one in 10. The Government has admitted that this figure will go higher, that unemployment will rise to over 10 per cent in the coming year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government is to be condemned for engineering a recession that has cost more than 300,000 jobs since July last year. Then we have to keep reminding ourselves that more than 150,000 of the young people of Australia, the men and women of tomorrow's work force, are unemployed, and many of them have no prospect of ever obtaining a job. Almost one in three of our young people are unemployed today compared with 20 per cent a year ago, or one in five. In particular, the Hawke Government has to be condemned for eradicating 130,000 full time jobs for teenagers over the last 12 months with the result now that almost 40 per cent of teenagers are seeking full time employment in this country with very little hope for their future. </PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales is the only State in the country with a conservative government and it is the only State with unemployment under 9 per cent, but even here there are almost a quarter of a million people out of work. In New South Wales more than 50,000 young people are out of work, and again this is lower than the national average. But the situation is critical in my own city of Newcastle, where 30 per cent of all teenagers are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1991 Budget was disastrous for our forgotten unemployed in Australia. The Budget Speech was a lame duck apology to the Australian people for the recession that the Hawke Government engineered, which has caused so much anguish to families, especially those with one or more of their members amongst the forgotten brigade of unemployed. Budget Paper No. 1 tells us that:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian economy moved into recession in mid-1990 and the labour market deteriorated sharply from late 1990 onwards. The downturn has been longer and more severe than forecast at the time of the 1990-91 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>One has to ask why the downturn in the labour market was not foreseen. The Opposition kept telling the Government that it would happen; not only would the Government not listen, but also it refused to take appropriate corrective action. Not only was the Budget in 1991 disgraceful but it was also a Budget of no hope for the forgotten sector, the unemployed. Budget Paper No. 1 includes an economic outlook that states:</PARA>
<PARA>The moderate pace of recovery and the lagged response of employment . . . is expected to pick-up-and the unemployment rate to fall-only slowly from mid-1991-92 onwards. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the news for the unemployed in the Budget. The Budget says to the unemployed, `You have no hope until the end of this financial year; you have little prospect for employment before next year; and more Australians will be joining your ranks'. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had this to say to his fellow Australians who are out of work:</PARA>
<PARA>If my Government had not taken action to slow the economy unemployment might have reached 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>What sort of consolation is it, when already unemployed, to be told that it might have been 18 instead of 10 per cent? `Be grateful to me', says the Prime Minister, `because I could have made even more of you unemployed'. He has not any answers for the unemployed. He does not tell them how to get jobs or where the jobs of the future are going to come from; nor does he have any answers for his own Labor members of parliament on how they going to hold their seats in the next election with unemployment above 10 per cent. No wonder so many of them are worried. They will not be here after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that unemployment will not rise to 18 per cent. That is simply a ploy by a worn-out Prime Minister. He comforts someone with a broken arm by telling him it could be worse; he could have a broken leg as well. But I suspect-and I hope I am wrong-that the unemployment rate might be higher than the Treasury was prepared to admit in Budget Paper No. 1. </PARA>
<PARA> Independent forecasters have been predicting that unemployment will reach 11 per cent by the end of 1991 and will still be as high as 10 1/2 per cent by the end of 1992. The Government has been looking to a few industries to lead us into recovery, in particular the housing industry. The builders are worried that the increasing fear of unemployment is preventing many people from building or buying houses. So little has the Government done to ease unemployment or improve employment that it has continued to make the task for employers even harder. Employers are faced with wage deals being demanded by the ACTU and the more militant unions, and they are faced with a superannuation levy that will cripple many of them and cost the country a further 100,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not get much help from the new boy Treasurer (Mr Kerin). His answers on superannuation are very vague. He tells us that it is enormously complex and that a lot of work has to be done yet. There will be a White Paper a little later on, by which time it will be too late for many employers and the new ranks of the unemployed. The Treasurer and this Government do not have any answers. They say, simply, `Trust us, you 10 per cent of the unemployed. The economy will be in good shape for the next federal election'. The Treasurer's message is, `Hang on', but I say, `How do you hang on if you are unemployed? What if you are one of the young unemployed? What hope is there for you?'. </PARA>
<PARA> The traditional youth employment sector, for example apprenticeships, has not increased in the last 10 years. There have been no increases in apprenticeships since 1980. Young people face the situation that the number and nature of jobs have halved in the last decade. The young now carry a disproportionate share of the recession burden. They have no jobs, no say and no hope. They face an inheritance of entrenched unemployment, falling living standards and the burden of massive international debt-and there is worse. The collapse of employment for young Australians is a lot worse than the official figures indicate. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the increased plight of young Australians in the last decade. </PARA>

But far more than this is needed. What we need to do in this country is create more jobs. We need to give young people hope and we need to give families hope so that parents can provide adequate support and care for their children. We need to create equality of opportunity, not equality of outcomes. We need to manage an economy where all Australians have a right to expect just rewards for their efforts. When the Liberal-National Party coalition is in government, that is just what we will do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent Budget of this bickering, quarrelsome, riven with division, in its last days, Labor Government has condemned this country to a fetid legacy of 10.5 per cent unemployment, from which no fundamental turnaround is expected for at least 24 months. This failed Government can no longer conceal the truth. Australia's unemployment rate has burgeoned, so much so that the unemployed in our communities have come to expect that, like a scar, it will be with them until the hereafter. Let us make no mistake about it: unemployment is Labor's Achilles heel and it will most assuredly see this Government fall, without grace and unlamented, from office. Australia and its communities deserve no less than to be rid of this scourge of a government and they will be rewarded, I am sure of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But today I want to talk about people, not figures, because the reality of unemployment is not about numbers or statistics, rising or falling. The reality of unemployment is about everyday people with whom we mix on a daily basis. I want to talk about unemployed people and about what happens to them when the Labor Government they thought was going to help them lets them down, and lets them down badly. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment in Australia is a catastrophe that goes quite beyond mere statistics, number crunching or back-room bean-counting. Unemployment is not merely a problem for blue collar workers or Australia's youth. It has silently and in sinister form crept into middle class Australia and crippled the abilities of professionals, clerks, middle managers and those who work in factories. It has left few Australians untouched. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear alarming stories on a daily basis from national care agencies, detailing the tragedy which has befallen thousands of families. We see the eager queues each morning outside social security departments and Commonwealth employment offices, and we look at the faces of desperation and sadness in those queues. We hear of personnel managers at car plants who had to hand out final notices on a Friday to workers, only to receive their own the following Monday. We see accountants whose firms have gone down the gurgler front up to the social security office only to be told that they have to wait five weeks for security. </PARA>
<PARA> We see family men and women in their forties who were retrenched nearly two years ago, who have completed numerous training programs, but who still are unable to find a job. This is what the Labor Party calls compassion. What does a couple on a combined salary of $40,000 and a mortgage to match do when both have been retrenched within six weeks of each other and ended up on unemployment benefits of $254 a week? Well, one waits and watches the bank foreclose on their house and one sits and watches them lose everything for which they have worked all their lives. One watches their lives crumble and inside one can only feel pain. But what one is secretly feeling is that one is glad one is not out there on that queue. </PARA>
<PARA> What does one say to lend support to a bright young tertiary graduate who has made more than 150 unsuccessful applications for employment, or to the thousands more besides who will graduate this November and not be able to find any job at all so that they can pay their rent and put food on their table? What one says to them is, `Next time vote with your feet. Vote this Government out and keep it out.'</PARA>
<PARA> Let some Labor politicians experience the harsh reality of unemployment, without their mates remaining in office to prop them up with `jobs for the boys'. We have heard the replacement Treasurer, Mr Kerin, frankly speak of no relief in the forthcoming two years for those currently without employment. That in itself is devastating not only for those already unable to obtain employment, but for those who expect that they may be pushed aside on to the lengthening queue in the coming months. </PARA>
<PARA> The real tragedy is that no-one can reverse this trend in the shorter term. By early next year, the numbers of those who have been unemployed for more than 12 months will have swelled to a quarter of a million. Again this is an example of Labor's compassion. It is entirely unacceptable. These people will quickly be regarded as unemployable by their own society. Their confidence will wither and their skills base will be lost to their communities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is already quite clear that Australia has accumulated a mass of people for whom there is no future and no hope as a result of this Government's policies. Robert Hudson, the Executive Director of the Victorian Council of Social Services, is correct when he asserts that full employment can be created only through the correct mix of policies. But what we have had from the incumbent Government is irresponsibility and the wrong mix. The current mix is not providing a solution to the unemployment problem and, as a result, increasing numbers of ordinary Australians are hurting and suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian community should not have to endure a protracted period of debilitating unemployment. The successful industrial economies of Japan, Sweden and Germany invest far more in skilling their work force and getting unemployed people back into work than we do in Australia. With this most recent Budget, despite the touted increase contained within it in employment and training programs, expenditure per head of unemployed is about 20 per cent less than that provided by the Fraser coalition Government in the 1982-83 recession. It should be remembered that the 1982 recession was caused by the compounding effects of international recession and two successive massive droughts, whereas the current recession is a direct consequence of wrong-headed policies initiated by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> People are hurting everywhere. In Adelaide, for example, 30 per cent of our jobless are young people, but employers cannot advertise positions for them because of anti-discrimination laws. One newsagent in suburban Adelaide is looking for four juniors, but equal opportunity laws prevent his seeking them. Instead, when he advertises he is not allowed to set an age range and would in all probability be inundated with unsuitable candidates. Instead of the Government assisting this employer to keep four workers away from the dole queue, it is making sure that they stay on it, while laws make it difficult for him to get on with the job of staffing his newsagencies. Nanny state legislation like this is not assisting either employers or workers to survive the recession. It is ensuring that they become part of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment in South Australia at present is real and significant and treads water at 10.4 per cent. It has risen 3 per cent in just one year. But real and profound problems such as this require up-front and well-reasoned responses. That has not come from Labor governments, State or Federal. Even the Prime Minister's great mate, the de facto Cabinet member Bill Kelty, has told trade union officials that he does not believe the Federal Government will win the next election unless it reduces Australia's unemployment rate. It is a sad reality that this Government and its leaders are more concerned about keeping their own jobs than in ordinary Australians being able to keep theirs. That is why we have seen the panic reduction in interest rates of one per cent today. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government had established the economic preconditions for a sustainable fall in interest rates, especially preconditions to improve Australia's productivity and international competitiveness, then this fall would be very welcome. But it has not done this. On the contrary, over the past couple of days, we have heard the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), who is sitting here in this debate, defending 100 years of cultural baggage in industrial relations in admitting that the Government will establish an industrial court and remove sections 45d and 45e from the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>

<PARA> Why would businesses take the risk of hiring additional workers in this sort of industrial climate? We believe that the fall in interest rates today will not be sustainable. It is a panic move on the part of the Prime Minister to allay the fears of his `nervous nelly' backbenchers and head off yet another challenge from that lounge lizard Luigi Locarno, the member for Blaxland.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the reports. </PARA>
<PARA>The three reports entitled Transport of Livestock Within Australia, Equine Welfare in Competitive Events Other Than Racing and Aspects of Animal Welfare in the Racing Industry which have just been tabled are the final reports of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Chairman of the Committee, I wish to comment briefly on each of these reports. The first report deals with the transport of livestock within Australia and contains 20 recommendations on the welfare of animals being transported by road, rail and sea. It is not surprising that the Committee's report concentrates on road transport as this is now the dominant mode used for domestic transport of livestock. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee makes several recommendations encouraging a more professional and uniform approach to the transport of livestock by road. In particular, the Committee is of the view that all drivers of vehicles carrying livestock as part of a commercial transport enterprise should be properly trained and possess a suitably endorsed vehicle driving licence. The report addresses specific animal welfare concerns including the use of electric prods, the duration of journeys and loading densities. The Committee also heard considerable evidence on the transport of horses in doubledecker vehicles and is of the view that this practice should be banned. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report prepared by the Committee addresses the welfare of horses in competitive events other than racing. As indicated in the report, much of the evidence lodged with the Committee concentrated on equine welfare in rodeos. The Committee, however, does not support calls for the banning or phasing out of rodeos, but is of the view that significant improvements should be introduced to safeguard the welfare of horses and other animals involved in rodeo events. In particular, the Committee considered that only contract stock-that is, stock prepared for and familiar with events-should be used in rodeos. The Committee also encourages State and Territory governments to introduce regulations for the welfare of animals used in rodeos and to develop procedures to collect statistics and information on major injuries and fatalities of animals during rodeo events. </PARA>
<PARA> The report on equine welfare also addresses animal welfare concerns in eventing, endurance riding and shows, in particular. The Committee dealt with issues such as the use of prohibited drugs, veterinary supervision, rider education and responsibility and the need for further monitoring of injuries and fatalities. </PARA>
<PARA> The third report of the Select Committee is entitled Aspects of Animal Welfare in the Racing Industry. As noted in the report, the inquiry into this matter began in 1988 and the current Committee did not have an opportunity to resume work on this subject. Therefore, the report is ,not as comprehensive as the current Committee would have wished. Nevertheless, the Committee does address some general issues relating to animal welfare such as the use of the whip, the racing of two-year-olds, jump racing, track design and ergonomics. For example, the Committee does not support a total ban on the use of the whip in thoroughbred racing. The Committee accepts the use of the whip as a guide or control. However, it does not condone the use of the whip to inflict pain on a horse for no other purpose than to make the horse run faster. The Committee makes several suggestions as to how the use of the whip might be controlled or reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee could not agree on the implications for animal welfare of jump racing. Some members of the Committee consider that there is an inherent conflict between jump racing and animal welfare and, therefore, that this activity should be phased out over the next three years. Other members of the Committee considered that animal welfare concerns can be alleviated if improvements to jump racing facilities and practices are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last nine months the members of the Select Committee have participated in many hearings, inspections and meetings in order to complete these reports and a report on culling, which was tabled earlier in the year. I would like to thank the members of the Committee for their very valuable contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks made by Senator Burns, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Animal Welfare. This is rather an historic occasion in that I believe that this is the first time that three reports have been tabled together. Also, this is the final occasion on which the Select Committee on Animal Welfare will report to this chamber. I trust and hope that tomorrow, after the formation of a new rural and regional affairs committee, this Parliament will have a standing committee which will continue to look at animal welfare matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report dealing with transport of livestock is wide reaching. We have spent more time collecting evidence on the transportation of livestock than we have on any other inquiry. We have made 20 recommendations which definitely go to the core of our concerns. Of course, there are a number of animal welfare issues which will never be able to be completely dealt with by legislation or regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The real essence of this report lies in education and a national approach. For example, evidence suggested to us that few drivers of vehicles carrying livestock even knew of the codes of practice. One of our recommendations is that people who drive lorries should have a very good understanding of these codes. </PARA>
<PARA> We recommend that rural and producer organisations and the transport industry associations should promote training programs to extend the knowledge and skills of those who handle livestock during transport. In addition to special driving techniques, these programs should include training in all aspects of the model code of practice in the road transport of livestock. I believe that people would want their livestock picked up by somebody who knew how to handle them and who knew the codes of practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation is that the codes should be regulated under relevant legislation. They should be disallowable instruments in order to give them a little bit more strength than they have had in the past. The Committee had no trouble in reaching agreement on the issue of transporting horses in double-decked vehicles. Senator Calvert and Senator Bell, who are both in the chamber at the moment, had no trouble in coming to an understanding on this point. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the biggest issue to do with the transport of livestock is that of volume loading. We had to assess optimum loading and then make recommendations that could not be misinterpreted or abused. There have been other inquiries into appropriate load limits. For example, one was carried out by the Inter-State Commission. However, we were charged with examining the issue from the animal welfare aspect. It should be made very clear that this Committee always believed that its paramount duty was to look at this matter from an animal welfare point of view.</PARA>
<PARA> We accept that there is a potential for overloading. But we are confident that the producers and transporters are now more aware of the importance of delivering stock free from bruising and other injury. So they are going to do the right thing by the stock. It is not in the producers' best interests to overload stock in their own trucks or in commercial trucks. There is much more that I could say about the transport of livestock. However, I am aware that other senators want to speak on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal with the report on equine welfare in competitive events other than racing. In essence, this report covered rodeos, eventing, showing, endurance riding and show jumping. I would especially like to place on record the cooperation and assistance provided by those involved in rodeos. Their cooperation was appreciated as it assisted the Committee to produce a report that I believe is fair, equitable and workable. Essentially, the concerns in respect of rodeos related to the source of stock used; spurs and their use; electric prods; flank straps; and the size of calves in calf roping events. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations made by the Committee in this regard are designed to ensure that there is a more professional approach to rodeos and, in particular, that the interests of the animals are looked after. This great spectator sport should be able to continue for a long time if it is properly conducted and if all of our recommendations are taken into account. Of course, there is a lot to be said for training. The evidence put before us indicated that not everyone does the right thing at the events or during the training leading up to competition. This is an area that should be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence which the Committee received on eventing was rather limited. I regret that we did not attend any major three-day events to witness at first hand the level of competition. However, I have been to many three-day events. Obviously, we all have to look to our laurels as far as handling animals is concerned. In this area, we were concerned at the lack of statistics available. We have suggested that closer monitoring be done by the various bodies. Endurance riding, show events and other events were also included in the terms of reference and we had a look at those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Another report deals with aspects of animal welfare in the racing industry. We really needed to do far more than we were able to achieve. The report is a great credit to the secretariat because the evidence taken was limited, to say the least. I do not propose to go through every recommendation but I would like to highlight some of the points that were made. Horse racing-thoroughbred and harness-is a big sport involving large sums of money. In fact, it is the largest industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I remain concerned about the pressure placed on two-year-olds to race too early. It is quite interesting to compare the statistics on breakdowns in Australia with some of the other areas which do not have two-year-old racing. The evidence was not decisive either way. Therefore, we could only suggest that the welfare of racing two-year-olds would be improved by requiring veterinary certification of maturity. More work needs to be done on this matter. I suggest that the number of breakdowns in two-year-olds is not fully known and is not fully assessed. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of whips has been widely commented on. This is a matter of public concern. It is a very visual thing. As the Chairman of this Committee said earlier, whips are definitely needed to help guide horses. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Calvert is correct. This matter of public concern is often written and spoken about. We heard evidence in favour of and against the use of whips. Many other aspects were raised concerning this matter. The potential for abuse is present and there is a fine line between determining what is use and what is abuse. As can be seen from our report, members of the Committee had a number of views on this issue and we suggested a number of reforms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cooney, Senator Calvert and I lodged a reservation in respect of the chapter on jump racing. I should make the point that very few dissenting reports or reservations were put forward by any senators. I believe that we worked very well together. That had a lot to do with the fact that the secretariat presented good material to us. </PARA>
<PARA> While I remain very concerned at the number of injuries and fatalities in this sport, I am hopeful that, if reforms such as we proposed are introduced, the number of incidents will be reduced. The major problem in this country is that we do not have a sufficiently large industry to sustain breeding horses, especially for hurdles, as is the case in the UK and in other parts of the world. Here in Australia, because we do not have that breeding pool, we suffer from being a poor relation, in every sense of the word, in the racing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already remarked on drugs and other issues, but I cannot let comment on this report pass without expressing my extreme disappointment that no-one in the racing industry felt sufficiently moved to bring hard evidence to the Committee on drugs in racing. We have had so much on drugs in racing in the human sports that it is a pity that that matter was not brought more to light before this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> We took evidence on harness racing and I must remark here on the excellent evidence given by Mr Bede Ireland on the question of racetrack design and sulky design. That is one thing the racing industry should look at very closely. Some of the main trainers we had discussions with on an informal basis claimed that track design was one of the reasons why horses do have breakdowns. Obviously, going around a corner on a track which does not have a bit of camber on it causes problems with the horses having a lot of pressure put on their limbs. That is bad for the industry; it is bad for the welfare of the horse; and it is bad for the people who own the horse which has broken down and is not able to race in the future because it has strained a ligament or has done a lot worse damage than that. </PARA>
<PARA> These reports have been a great thing for the Committee. It is a remarkable achievement to have three reports concluded together like this and great credit must go to the secretariat. I would also like to pay credit to Dr Margaret Rose from Sydney who has given me much help over my years on the Committee. I thank her very much for that. I thank the secretariat for the help they have given me as a committee man and also as the Deputy Chairman of the Committee since 1985. I also thank the Senate for sitting and listening to our debate on this very important subject. I know that Senator Cooney will have something to say about the reports as well because he has been on the Committee for as long as I have. </PARA>
<PARA> The future of animal welfare is the responsibility of all of us in the community. We must ensure that the animals and their welfare are protected in every sphere in which animals are involved. The Committee has concluded but I believe the work has not. I hope that it will continue through the rural and regional affairs committee to be set up tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few brief comments more in a general context because I believe that the Select Committee on Animal Welfare has been one of the success stories of this Parliament. I can well remember in 1985 or 1986 actually giving evidence on the export of live sheep from Australia and also in connection with a number of other reports, although in a different capacity to where I stand now. What this Committee has succeeded in doing is bringing balance to the debate that was occurring in this country with regard to animal welfare. Through all these reports, the Committee has come up with some very important recommendations in terms of developing codes of practice to deal with matters in a practical sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to take this opportunity to express regret that these are actually the last reports of this Committee. Hopefully, the new committee of which Senator Brownhill has given notice will be able to pick up the running because it is very important that the debate on the codes of practice for animal welfare and handling of animals is kept going ahead in a balanced and sensible manner. Certainly, the work of this Committee, which goes back to 1983 and whose members appear on page 73, has gone a long way towards getting a more sensible and sane approach to the emotion which was occurring when this committee was put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The very reason the Committee came into existence was to address the emotion and the misrepresentations that were coming from minority groups within various sectors and industries in Australia. As I have said, the Committee started off with the inquiry into the export of live sheep from Australia, and then went onto dolphins and whales in captivity, kangaroos, animal experimentation and a number of other issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the thrust of the recommendations on road transport, rail transport and sea transport, but I want to comment on the recommendation on the introduction of volume loading of livestock. It is my belief that volume loading of livestock is the only sensible direction to go in the carriage of livestock, but of course with the necessary safeguards in the handling and welfare of those particular animals during whichever mode of transport is used. </PARA>
<PARA> On this aspect I can speak from experience as a farmer. The education process recommended in this report is also crucial and important because it does not take a lot of mishandling of livestock for huge commercial losses to come through to the producer. I have seen actual situations where damage has been done to a significant number of animals, whether they be sheep, lambs, or bullocks. Fortunately, I have had good operators to carry my livestock so I have never had to suffer that damage. I believe that the recommendation for an education program to train drivers in handling and loading the livestock, and determining pen size and all the other things that go with it is a very positive step in the right direction. I conclude by congratulating the people who brought down this report. I also congratulate those members who have worked on the animal welfare Committee since 1985. I think they have made a very significant contribution to a balanced, sane and sensible debate on animal welfare in Australia . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It is a little difficult in one speech to try to summarise the efforts that the Select Committee on Animal Welfare has put into these three reports, which are being discussed concurrently, but I would like to emphasise some of the important things in these reports. I concur with the remarks of the previous speakers. The time that I have spent on this Committee has been enlightening. It has also been a time when, owing to the nature of the Committee and the personnel involved on it, it has been possible to communicate in a rational and well considered manner and consider what has sometimes been an emotional debate within the wider community. That is a reflection of both the maturity of the people who have been involved in this Committee and also the fact that it is a debate which will not go away but must be considered in a sane manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reports that we have before us required a considerable amount of research and inquiry in order to generate them. I repeat what has been said earlier, that is, that the secretariat should be congratulated on being able to bring together the evidence received in the three separate inquiries and the great amount of research carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> A central matter we kept coming back to in the consideration of the Transport of Livestock Within Australia report was the need for a national regulatory framework. There was no dissent within the Committee about the good sense of ensuring that the conditions applying in one State should apply in another and that the model code of practice applicable to this industry really should be endorsed by all State legislatures and adopted by those people involved in the industry. That model code of practice, referred to on the very first page in the recommendations and major conclusions section of the report, really represented the core of the Committee's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crane in his well-informed comments picked up on the concept of optimum loading. There was a great amount of discussion about that by the Committee. Research into optimum loading and conditions associated with the transport of livestock really needs further attention. It was pretty obvious, in the time that we had available to us on this Committee, that considerable benefits would derive to animal welfare from adopting the optimum loading density concept in transporting animals. The Committee stated in the report:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . departure, in either direction, from the optimum will adversely affect animal welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>That seemed a pretty obvious conclusion for the Committee to come to. Also central to the transport of animals, and a subject which the Committee came to understand a lot better as we progressed through the inquiry, is the training of drivers and those people associated with loading stock on to transport vehicles. Somebody with only a superficial knowledge of animal welfare issues might think that training a driver in any special techniques necessary for transporting animals is a very simple matter. However, as we on the Committee learned, it is not just a case of saying, `Go out and look at the animals every now and then'. Many aspects to the transporting of live animals require special consideration, special training and a deal of experience. I was most pleased that in paragraph 4.2.2 the Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that all drivers of vehicles carrying livestock as part of a commercial transport enterprise should be properly trained and possess a suitably endorsed vehicle driving licence. This will ensure that those offering services in the livestock transport industry have undertaken an accepted form of training or have demonstrated a specified level of competence in livestock handling. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that recommendation will be a powerful one, in that it will, by itself, bring about significant reforms in the welfare of animals which are transported from place to place. The matter is not simply a question of a person undertaking a short course or watching somebody else driving live animals; it relates to understanding even how to start the vehicle. Even the technique of starting the vehicle must not be overlooked. Starting a vehicle loaded with live animals needs to be done very carefully and with the knowledge that if the vehicle is started too suddenly the animals at the rear of the vehicle will be crushed or put off balance and trampled. Obviously, one needs also to consider cornering techniques and the correct changing of gears to go up a gradient. All these things must be considered because the driver of such a vehicle is dealing with a dynamic load-not a load of gravel or whatever. There is much to consider. As I said, I hope that that recommendation will be a powerful one which will bring about a great deal of reform in the welfare of animals being transported. </PARA>
<PARA> Concerns relating to the transport of animals by rail were also addressed within the same inquiry. Obviously, there needs to be even further refinement of training programs to take into account the differences in transporting animals by rail. However, I do not think that this is either the time or the place to discuss that, although we did hear of some of those differences in the course of the Committee's inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the report entitled Aspects of Animal Welfare in the Racing Industry. In dealing with our major conclusions, once again on the very first page we are reminded that the Committee was impressed with the views of Dr Heynes of the Australian Veterinary Association on the use of the whip in the horse racing industry. He said that there needed to be changes in the use of the whip in the horse racing industry as a result of pressure from public opinion. I would like to think that this report is part of that public opinion. The public has many vehicles for expressing its opinion and certainly the Parliament of Australia would have to be recognised as one of the most important vehicles for this expression of public opinion. An expression of that public opinion is in the form of this report from one of our parliamentary committees. The Committee stated in the report:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Committee is of the view that regulations should be introduced forbidding jockeys from whipping horses that have clearly lost the opportunity to achieve a placing in any race. </PARA>
<PARA>What could be clearer than that? I suggest that that view of the Committee is shared by all those people who have either witnessed a horse race or who have taken part in any aspect of the horse racing industry. Anybody who presented a view to the contrary certainly does not understand very much about the racing industry and should not really be considered as having a worthwhile opinion anyway. I think that public opinion in this regard can be easily assessed. Certainly, one of the tasks of the Committee was to discover what the public opinion was and to express it in a report. The secretariat is to be congratulated because that opinion was difficult to put into words. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the Senate's attention to the Committee's consideration of jump racing, detailed in chapter 3 of the report. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Committee has serious concerns about the welfare of horses participating in jump races. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee felt that, even with improvements to the height and placing of jumps, improvements in training and education, and any other improvements in jump racing, the fatality rate would remain constant. On hearing the evidence, the Committee was able to conclude only that there is an inherent conflict between these activities and animal welfare. Therefore, the Committee was of the view that relevant State governments should phase out jump racing over the next three years. I cannot imagine that we are likely to get much concurrence from State governments for that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Brownhill, Senator Calvert and Senator Cooney were concerned about this matter but considered that improvements could be made to reduce the danger in jump racing. Nevertheless, it is important that the Committee said this and that the Committee pointed out that the activity itself is a conflict. It is excitement. The danger and excitement will almost guarantee it spectator value for some time, and it will linger on. It is important for this Committee to express that particular concern now. I hope that steeplechasing-jump races-is phased out. I would not like to put a time limit upon it. I hope that eventually it is an aspect of what we now consider to be sport which will not continue for too long into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also pleased that through this inquiry into animal welfare in the racing industry we were able to consider the present, almost arbitrary age at which horses are first raced. The welfare of racing two-year-olds has been a matter of some community concern for a considerable time. To address that, it is not only a question of looking at the chronological age of the horses involved; the Committee concluded that the racing of two-year-olds would be improved if there were a requirement that there be a veterinary certification of physical maturity, which is a different matter to chronological age. I was pleased to see that conclusion and that we were able to bring that about. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also considered greyhound racing, because the title of the report is Aspects of Animal Welfare in the Racing Industry. Although in common parlance the `racing industry' means the horse racing industry, greyhound racing was also considered. Concerns were expressed and recommendations made, which I will not go into now, although I recommend all honourable senators to at least glance at them. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Aulich for his guidance. For his edification, I will mention another concern of mine. In looking at greyhound racing, there is room to widen our concerns to the welfare of animals in other forms of racing. I do not suggest for a moment that the Committee should have considered cockroach races, the cane toad tournaments or any of the other carnival activities that are notorious throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I suggest that at the seat of this problem, and other problems associated with such activities, is our attitude to animals in general. We still have the attitude towards animals that they are a resource to be exploited by humans; that animals are on this earth simply to provide amusement or to be used as a material economic resource by humans, and that if it suits our purposes we should take animals, do with them what we will and then discard them. </PARA>
<PARA> While this attitude has been softened somewhat with regard to companion animals-horses, dogs, et cetera-we retain an arrogance which makes it difficult for us to appreciate the full range of welfare issues which arise when considering the many relationships between humans and animals. I know Senator Cooney is terribly concerned about this because during one of our inquiries he struggled to come to grips with what it was that we were considering about the welfare of animals. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to think that the other members of our Committee have done a little more than merely look at the title of the inquiry and the terms of reference of the particular inquiries. I honestly like to think that all the members of the Committee actually grappled with the question: what is our relationship as humans with animals and how do we use animals and how should we use them, if at all?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Brownhill's moves to establish a standing committee for regional and rural affairs will allow those questions to be asked at some future date. That sort of consideration was partly behind our consideration of the third report entitled Equine Welfare in Competitive Events Other Than Racing, because that was a wider reference which allowed the Committee to consider some of the other relationships we have with animals. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not dwell too long on that report but pass through it by saying that it considered many other aspects. Senator Brownhill suggested that we could have spent a little more time on things such as three-day events. There were time constraints throughout this Committee's references. Another good inquiry would be that aspect, if we are able to establish this standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the things we considered were the carnival events-rodeos or whatever-which include such things as saddle bronco riding, bareback riding, calf roping and steer wrestling. For example, we as a committee were able to attempt to define each event, to describe it and to determine whether there was any standard understanding throughout Australia of what a particular event should be, how it should be conducted and whether there were any guidelines that should be considered if any organisers were about to undertake an event such as calf roping. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was able to define each of these activities. It was enlightening for us to appreciate that some of these events have been introduced only in the past few decades into Australia. They are not an exhibition of traditional bushman skills, as we might have been led to believe. A number of them have derived from the travelling sideshow, from North American traditions, rather than the traditions of mustering and managing animals in the Australian outback setting. I was enlightened by that. I dare say the other Committee members were also enlightened by much of the other information that was given to us by way of submission when we were considering these particular things. </PARA>
<PARA> I must mention quickly that the Chairman, Senator Burns, and I made a reservation on this matter at paragraph 3.108. I should emphasise that, while accepting the Committee's conclusion on calf roping that there could well be an improvement in animal welfare in these events, we put in a reservation which said that we would consider that:</PARA>
<PARA>calf roping should be banned from rodeo events as weight limitations or improved roping devices do not overcome the inherent animal welfare problems associated with this event. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the information that we were given about the practice of rapping illustrates what I was speaking about earlier in respect of our arrogance and attitude to animals. We were told by Dr Ellis, who gave evidence to us, that rapping might also involve putting sharp objects under the leg bandages of a horse in order to condition it to jump higher for our amusement and benefit only-certainly not for the horse's benefit. The Committee considers that rapping and other such practices are unacceptable. We hold the strong view that the Equestrian Federation of Australia should make every effort to eliminate these practices from competition and training. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an example of the way in which this Committee worked. We were able to readily identify practices which we considered did not improve the welfare of the animals involved. General consensus was reached quite readily within this Committee about what was and was not appropriate to recommend. I look forward to being able to participate on a similar committee with similar colleagues. Many of the things that the Committee has been able to achieve should have a great impact on our relationship with animals throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief because I know that other senators have other reports to present. I thought I had better say something on this matter because it is the last hurrah for the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted over the weekend that Senator Walsh commented in a press report that there were too many committees in the Parliament. I must say that this is one committee that has served a particular issue well. It certainly went a lot longer than the Senate expected and it probably could have gone longer if that had been our wish. It is also very interesting to note that the members of the Committee obviously feel very strongly about the different reports because five out of the six members will be speaking on them today. </PARA>
<PARA> Cruelty to animals certainly fires up people's emotions. One thing that this Committee has been able to do is hose down, for want of a better term, some of the issues that could have got out of hand in this country. I refer in particular to our animal experimentation report. If one looks at what has happened elsewhere, one sees that animal liberationists overseas, particularly in the area of animal experimentation and the like, have become urban terrorists. It is not unusual to see fire bombings, murder and properties being broken into. Thank heavens that has not happened in Australia to any large extent. I believe that one reason it has not happened is that we have provided a forum to which concerned groups can put their views. </PARA>
<PARA> In the main, this Committee has been able to present balanced reports that most people have accepted. I briefly refer to the first report that we tabled today entitled the Transport of Livestock Within Australia. Senator Brownhill said most of what I would have said. He was also supported by Senator Crane and Senator Bell. I am impressed that we all agreed that volume loading is essential and necessary in Australia from a welfare point of view, not from the point of view of greedy operators being able to load more stock. This matter was very aptly summed up in evidence we received from Dr Hugh Wirth, the President of the RSPCA, and from ANZFAS, another well credentialled welfare organisation that gave us evidence on most matters we looked at. They believe that the term `volume loading' should be replaced by the term `welfare loading'. That sums up the whole section on volume loading. </PARA>
<PARA> The other report that has been referred to briefly today is Equine Welfare in Competitive Events Other Than Racing. My concern with that area related to show events. As a former President of the Royal Agricultural Society in Tasmania, it came to my attention on many occasions as I moved around the show scene, that the use of drugs in particular was quite evident in dressage and showjumping. I guess that time will tell whether that will decrease. </PARA>
<PARA> We recommended that people at shows increase the number of drug tests on horses in an effort to reduce that problem. We also put the view that, where a show society banned a competitor for using a prohibited drug, that competitor should be banned from all other shows. We were told in respect of another area-eventing-that it had been found that the feet of a horse had been denerved. The horse was banned but the rider was still allowed to continue. Those are the sorts of things that people have to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Senator Brownhill, I am concerned that there was very little evidence of any statistics being kept in respect of endurance riding. We drew attention to the fact that there has been a definite increase in fatalities in that pastime. </PARA>
<PARA> The rodeo section has been very well covered. Contract stock can be used to reduce the concerns of animal welfare groups about rodeos. We believe very strongly that, by and large, the use of contract stock in rodeo events would go a long way towards reducing injuries to animals. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to say one or two things about our report on the racing industry, which is entitled Aspects of Animal Welfare in the Racing Industry. As has been said previously, I believe it is unfortunate that we had neither the time nor the resources to investigate this matter as well as we might have. What was done and what has been recommended goes a long way towards covering the area. But there certainly is a need, perhaps at some future date, for a more searching report into some aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer particularly to track design. We had plenty of evidence to show us that track design is one of the major contributors to animal injuries and deaths in racing and jumping. Very strong views were put to us by people such as Bart Cummings, to whom we spoke briefly; Richard Hore-Lacy, who trains jumping horses; and well-known jockeys to whom we spoke informally. None of this evidence is in the report because we did not have the opportunity to talk to them formally. It is unfortunate that these personalities did not give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been said, Senator Cooney, Senator Brownhill and I do have a reservation about jump racing. I believe that improvements can be made. It is also interesting to note that those two senators and I are the longest serving members on the Committee. Having spoken to the trainers, jockeys and those people involved in jump racing at Sandown in particular, we all agree that the fatality rate could be reduced if some of the improvements recommended in the report were implemented. We certainly disagree with the notion that jump racing should be abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of the whip, as has been said, is quite controversial. We heard evidence that in the United Kingdom there is a restriction on the number of times a jockey can whip a horse during a race. In all practicality, if that recommendation were carried in Australia I think very little notice would be taken of it. But evidence was given-and we observed it ourselves-of cases when the use of the whip is certainly unwarranted. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude my remarks by saying that I appreciate the help given by the Committee staff during our inquiries. I would like to compliment the staff that I served with: Paul Barsdell, Derrick Abbott, Monica McMahon and Neil Bessell; and particularly the assistance given by Bronwyn Allan, Michael Game and Peter Short. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cooney referred to some of the former chairmen and members of this Committee. One member of the Committee whom he inadvertently failed to speak about was former Senator Ray Devlin-our former colleague from Tasmania-who had quite an involvement and interest in the racing industry report. I think he would be rather disappointed that we did not have a bit more time to spend observing practical racing and examining some of the things which can be done to improve it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Calvert for reminding me that on the last occasion when I spoke about a report of the Select Committee on Animal Welfare I did not mention Senator Devlin. I see some of his former colleagues in the chamber now-Senator Aulich and you, Madam Acting Deputy President-who would appreciate the work that Senator Devlin did in this area, particularly the work he did on the three reports, Transport of Livestock Within Australia, Equine Welfare in Competitive Events Other Than Racing and Aspects of Animal Welfare in the Racing Industry, which are now before the Senate. He was Chairman of the Committee during much of the preparation of those reports. He has been very well succeeded by Senator Burns but, certainly, Senator Devlin did some great work on those reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reports are the last three reports of the Committee. It will go through a metamorphosis and become another committee which will pay some time and attention to the areas at which these reports have looked. This is a Senate select committee which has gone on for many years. I think this is because when people started to look at animal welfare two things happened: firstly, some concentration was applied to the subject and, secondly, there was a development. The way people think about animal welfare now is very different from the way in which they thought about it when this Committee was first set up. Senator Crane made that point and I think all Committee members, including myself, can be proud of the work we have done in that area which has largely been aimed at raising people's expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> The things that I might have said about these reports have been said, but I would like to make a few remarks about the report entitled Aspects of Animal Welfare in the Racing Industry. As has been pointed out, it is a very big industry-big in the sense of employing many people, giving out much money in terms of prizes, and providing a livelihood for many people. During our inquiry we were given great assistance by people in the industry. Doctor John Bourke of the Victoria Racing Club was very good, I think all Committee members would agree, in the way he helped us through the intricacies of the racing industry. I think he treated us very well, as did many members of the industry generally. </PARA>

<PARA> I simply raise that issue because we have to have some balance when we are looking at an industry like the racing industry. There is always a risk of some soreness and pain in any sort of contest. Of course, it will be said that people run, exercise and take part in sport because they want to win. But from my observations of the thoroughbreds, I thought they certainly took part in racing very willingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry seemed to be concerned about, and turned its mind to, the various issues, such as the use of whips and the racing of two-year-olds. Madam Acting Deputy President, you would know that the difficulty with the two-year-olds is that the epiphysial plates may not close as early in some animals as they do in others. If a horse is run when its epiphysial plates are not as closed as they should be, the effect would be the same as running anybody with such plates. </PARA>

I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>DEPARTMENT OF THE SENATE RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION -ESTIMATES COMMITTEE DOCUMENTATION AND PROCEDURES</PARA>
<PARA>The recent report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration's inquiry into Estimates Committee Documentation and Procedures contained a number of recommendations aimed at rationalising the amount and ``flow'' of paper associated with Senate Estimates hearings.</PARA>
<PARA>These would affect publishing and circulation arrangements for both Program Performance Statements submitted by departments in support of the budget and additional estimates, and any subsidiary material requested in committee hearings, including the answers. to questions taken on notice.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has not yet provided any indication of its response to the committee's report but it is appropriate for the Department of the Senate to respond to those recommendations which are of direct relevance to it. The broad thrust behind the proposals, to make the Estimates Committee process more manageable and, perhaps, less demanding of resources, offers many potential advantages. However there are major technical problems involved in implementing some of the recommendations which make it impractical for the Senate Table Office to implement recommendations Nos 1 and 2 in time for the 1991 Budget Session.</PARA>
<PARA>Later this year the Department of the Senate will be engaging a consultant to develop an overall plan for the implementation of information technology in the Table Office. In this context, the technical problems identified in the attachment to this statement will be considered and a further report on the feasibility of electronically providing information on estimates documentation will be tabled.</PARA>
<PARA>The specific recommendations which have implications for the Department of the Senate, together with the department's comments on these recommendations, are set out in the Attachment.</PARA>
<PARA>ATTACHMENT</PARA>
<PARA>DEPARTMENT OF THE SENATE RESPONSE TO THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON ESTIMATES COMMITTEE DOCUMENTATION AND PROCEDURES</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1 (a)</PARA>
<PARA>That the Department of Finance investigate the benefits and costs of inserting in the guidelines for preparation of the explanatory notes a requirement that (a) the explanatory notes be made available to the Senate Table Office in electronic as well as printed form with consequent reduction in print run (pages ix and 24).</PARA>
<PARA>Print Run</PARA>
<PARA>Not all copies of explanatory notes (now called program performance statements) produced by departments are for the Senate Table Office.</PARA>
<PARA>Last financial year the Table Office only received 100 copies of the estimated 250-450 copies of the explanatory notes each department printed. Of the 100 copies received, a substantial proportion were distributed to Senators, the National Library, the Parliamentary Library and the media.</PARA>
<PARA>Based on past experience it is unlikely that a reduction in the number of `hard' copies provided to the Table Office would have as dramatic an effect on the print runs as the committee believes. There may be an argument for reducing the print run for some of the statements less in demand, particularly for the additional estimates, but certain departments' statements are very popular and Table Office stocks of their explanatory notes are almost fully consumed. Given the unpredictability of demand for a department's explanatory notes, and the need for some uniformity in the Table Office requirements on departments, it is not feasible to reduce the print run provided to the Table Office below 100, at least for the budget estimates, although the print run for the additional estimates could perhaps be reduced to 75 copies.</PARA>
<PARA>Systems Compatibility</PARA>
<PARA>The compatibility, or lack thereof, between departments' electronic information systems and the information systems operating in the Senate and the Department of the Senate are vital factors to be taken into account in assessing this recommendation. The Table Office would need to stipulate, to submitting departments, that the explanatory notes be delivered in a standard format on floppy disks. An obvious choice would be WordPerfect. However this may meet with some resistance, as:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) some departments do not use WordPerfect, and may not consider themselves in a position to convert their documents to this format; and</PARA>
<PARA>(ii) some tabular, and particularly graphical, presentations may be difficult (or even impossible) to replicate in WordPerfect format.</PARA>
<PARA>Alternatively, departments may supply their explanatory notes on floppy disk, and the Department of the Senate would be responsible for conversions to WordPerfect. This option would result in additional handling costs for the Table Office and have significant resource implications.</PARA>
<PARA>At present 23 sets of explanatory notes are prepared for estimates. A document of some 40-50 pages is the norm for the additional estimates, with the estimates of only a few departments being longer (for example, Department of Defence at 250-plus pages). However, for the budget estimates, the majority of explanatory notes are longer than 200 pages, with several at 400-plus pages. The Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) has advised the Table Office that if the moving around in a WordPerfect document and searching is to be facilitated, the optimum length of the document for down loading onto the Senate information system is approximately 50 pages. Each of the lengthier explanatory notes would therefore have to be reformatted into a series of shorter documents and this would require a substantial amount of time to be devoted to converting and/or reformatting the electronic information to render it more useable on the Senate information systems, time which is not often readily available, given the time constraints already imposed by the very nature of the estimates process.</PARA>
<PARA>In the worst case, where none of the information provided by departments was compatible with the Senate information systems, it would be necessary for an officer to be employed for some 45 working days on converting the information in order to make it compatible (in addition to time taken to copy the diskettes, which is discussed later). Further, it is not possible for any officer to be employed to carry out the conversion, as the nature of the work involved requires the services of a technically qualified officer with expertise in formatting and reformatting documents into the most appropriate style for ease of access by users.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2.(a)</PARA>
<PARA>The second recommendation which impinges on the Table Office again concerns electronically provided information:</PARA>
<PARA> `` . . . the Senate Table Office should:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) encourage Senators who wish to obtain copies of explanatory notes for portfolios other than those covered by their own estimates committee to receive the information in electronic rather than printed form 80 that they can then select which pages they want to print out; . . . '' (pages ix and 24)</PARA>
<PARA>Diskettes</PARA>
<PARA>Presumably, departments would provide only one copy of the electronic information on diskette and the Table Office would be responsible for the copying of that information onto diskettes in order to meet requests for that information.</PARA>
<PARA>As already stated, there may well be problems of compatibility between departments' hardware and software and those of the Senate. Incompatibility would necessitate conversion of the documents at a substantial cost to the Senate and its Department, in both time and resources. The costs of copying the diskettes also have to be examined. The same skilled officer would need to be employed to carry out the copying, in order to ensure that all the technical requirements of the copying were met, to check the diskettes copied, to label the diskettes and to produce appropriate instructions for users to facilitate downloading and use of the information.</PARA>
<PARA>Advice has been received that a good-quality, multiple diskette copier would cost approximately $8000, plus ongoing maintenance costs. Such a copier copies a bank of diskettes at a time (for example, a bank of seven diskettes, so that the copier makes seven copies of the original diskette simultaneously) and takes approximately 10 minutes to copy a diskette onto the bank of diskettes, including setting up, loading, copying, checking and labelling. The current cost of 3.5'' diskettes is approximately $2.50 and that of 5.25'' diskettes is approximately $1.25. A full set of the explanatory notes would currently require 23 diskettes. To provide one Senator with a full set of the explanatory notes on diskette would entail a minimum cost of $28.75. To provide a full set of the explanatory notes to all Senators (76), 1748 diskettes would be needed at an estimated minimum cost of $2185.</PARA>
<PARA>Reference has been made in the earlier part of this response to the fact that the majority of the explanatory notes for the budget estimates are in excess of over 200 pages in length and the optimum length of a WordPerfect document for downloading onto the Senate information system is approximately 50 pages. One diskette could contain a department's explanatory notes, but in instances where the notes are longer than 50 pages, they would need to be subdivided into documents of approximately 50 pages. Advice has been received that approximately 6 working days would be required to complete the task of copying the diskettes and that converting and copying the electronically provided information would take approximately 11 working days in total (45 days for conversion and 6 days for copying).</PARA>
<PARA>If it were decided not to prepare a full diskette set of the explanatory notes for each Senator, but only to copy a department's notes as a request was received, it would still be necessary to arrange for the conversion of departments' electronically provided information. As already stated, this process could take 45 working days. If Senators do not request all the explanatory notes, there could be a reduction in the total copying time but only if a full bank of seven copies were copied each time. (Copying in full blanks is necessary to maximise the benefits of multiple copying and this would also result in some stocks being held in the Table Office). Each request from a Senator would be processed as received, and if there were no stock on hand, would take approximately half an hour to process from receipt of the request to the diskette leaving the Table Office.</PARA>
<PARA>Another matter of concern is the integrity of the material on copied diskettes. Although the officer carrying out the copying would check the copied diskettes, this does not ensure the integrity of the diskettes once they leave the Table Office. The diskettes could be corrupted either in their handling during distribution (for example, if mailed) or by Senators or their staff while using the diskettes.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2.(b)</PARA>
<PARA> `` . . . the Senate Table Office should:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) no longer print and bind the Additional Information but arrange instead for it to be added to the parliamentary database after it has been tabled. Printed copies of individual responses would continue to be provided by the estimates committee secretariat to the Senator who asked the question giving rise to it, and to other Senators requesting it, until the information became available electronically; . . . '' (pages ix and 24)</PARA>
<PARA>The additional information poses more complex problems. The implementation of this recommendation involves complex technical problems, including:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) there is a large amount of data involved-some 5418 pages of explanatory notes at around 3 Kbytes per page, and an unspecified quantity of additional information at possibly as much as 1 Mbyte per page (depending on how the images are stored);</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the people accessing the information are spread throughout the country;</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) current parliamentary databases were not established to handle, nor are they capable of handling, image-based data or table-based data. They are essentially text-based databases.</PARA>
<PARA>(iv) the current information is provided from a wide variety (and quality) of sources, making imposition of a standard format impossible to administer.</PARA>
<PARA>Currently, the only way such information could be consistently electronically captured is by a process known as bit mapped scanning. This is, in effect, the electronic storage of photograph-like images of the original documents.</PARA>
<PARA>While this concept is technically feasible, it does pose some problems including:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the scanning and storage of documents using relatively new and expensive resources; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) some form of indexing and retrieval technology would be necessary to recover the stored images for later reference.</PARA>
<PARA>The software used to manipulate this information would also depend, among other things, on how the information is incorporated into the databases for later retrieval.</PARA>
<PARA>Before any sound technical proposal can be developed to store this additional information in databases, and access it from the parliamentary network, or any future extended parliamentary network, an extensive technical feasibility study would need to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA>According to PISO such a study would need to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) examine the most efficient mechanisms to collect and store the information;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) examine the projected patterns of access to the information;</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) examine how Senators wish the information to be presented;</PARA>
<PARA>(iv) examine where the information needs to be delivered (e.g. electorate offices), and how best to get it there;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) determine whether delivery systems can be purchased, or if they will need to be developed in-house;</PARA>
<PARA>(vi) determine development and support costs for such a system; and</PARA>
<PARA>(vii) determine who will/can pay for the support (this may have an impact on the system design).</PARA>
<PARA>This feasibility study would be a major undertaking, as it would involve studying several technologies not familiar to the current parliamentary environment, such as SGML, image processing, E-mail, image databases and CD-ROM, and liaising with several groups of people, including technical specialists, the Senate Table Office, government departments and statutory authorities. According to PISO such a study would require several months work and could cost upwards of $50,000. Currently, no funding has been included within the budgets of either PISO or the Table Office for such a project.</PARA>
<PARA>It would not be sound management to proceed with aspects of recommendation 1 until the feasibility of recommendation 2 has been established, chiefly because the way in which this information is stored will have a significant bearing on how it can be accessed in the future. As the latter has not yet been determined, it would be unwise to proceed with the former.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation suggests that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Explanatory Notes be required to be lodged with the Senate Table Office no later than the Friday of the week following the presentation of the Budget;'' (pages ix and 25)</PARA>
<PARA>In recent years the deadline for the lodgment of the explanatory notes has been negotiated between the Clerk-Assistant (Table) and the Department of Finance each time. The tabling date has been determined by the date the Government proposes for the commencement of the estimates process. For example, for the current budget sittings, it was agreed that the explanatory notes should be tabled by the Thursday of budget week. Implementation of the committee's recommendation would have meant that, on this occasion, the notes would have been received only 2 days before the estimates committees' public hearings were to commence. By the time the documents were circulated to Senators they would in reality have a maximum of one day to examine them. Unless the Government agrees to schedule estimates committee hearings at a later time, it would be impractical to proceed with this recommendation. Further, as circumstances change from one estimates period to the next, it seems more appropriate to negotiate an appropriate tabling date each time, taking into account all the circumstances existing at that time.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4.</PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation suggests that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``the President of the Senate table in the Senate a schedule of the date of receipt of each portfolio's explanatory notes on the first sitting day after the last set of Notes is lodged;'' (pages ix and 25)</PARA>
<PARA>While the preparation of the document presents no problem, the Department of the Senate questions the need for the document if the explanatory notes are received on a sitting day, as in that situation, they are tabled as expeditiously as possible and certainly within 24 hours. Any person interested in this information would be able to obtain a good idea as to the date of receipt of the notes by examining the Journals of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5.</PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation suggests that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``If explanatory notes are provided other than in a sitting week, the Government take the opportunity to arrange for them to be presented to the President of the Senate and deemed to be tabled in accordance with the resolution adopted by the Senate on 13 February 1991;'' (pages ix and 25)</PARA>
<PARA>In its report, the committee (page 25) explains the reasoning behind this recommendation: `` . . . that it is important for the explanatory notes to be given formal status as soon as possible 80 that they are available for distribution to Senators . . . ''. This reasoning appears to be based upon a false premise. There is no need for the explanatory notes to be tabled before they are distributed. Once the Appropriation Bills have been introduced in the House of Representatives the explanatory notes can then be distributed.</PARA>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Active Citizenship Revisited Report</PARA>
<PARA>Response by the Presiding Officers</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was given the task of inquiring into and reporting on developments which had occurred during the two years following the original report on Education for Active Citizenship. As the report on Active Citizenship Revisited raised a number of issues relating to functions carried out by offices in the Parliamentary departments, the following responses have been prepared to each of the pertinent recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) Recommendation 2.5</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that a coordinated approach be adopted to the production of resource materials for the national curriculum on studies of society and the environment. Production should be the responsibility of a variety of organisations including the Curriculum Corporation, the Parliamentary Education Office, the Australian Electoral Commission, State Education Departments and Legislatures and individual organisations with an interest in this subject. Materials should be designed to broaden the approach to active citizenship education in schools and to complement existing materials.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the observation that there needs to be a coordinated approach to the production of resource materials for the studies of society and the environment and I understand that the Parliamentary Education Office (PEO) is but one key component in a network of agencies responsible for implementing parliamentary and citizenship education in Australian schools. To this end I have encouraged the PEO to establish highly effective and productive links with each of the agencies or groups mentioned in recommendation 2.5.</PARA>
<PARA>It is my understanding that the peak curriculum development organisation which appears to be strategically placed to assume a coordinating role is the recently established Curriculum Corporation of Australia. If it, or any other equally reputable and appropriate organisation, takes on a coordinating role and requires the cooperation of the PEO, I am confident that quality advice and assistance, subject of course to resource limitations, will be forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA>However, until a national and agreed statement on parliamentary and citizenship education is finalised, it would appear that only limited progress could be made in respect of a more formalised system to coordinate curriculum development in the area. Until then, the PEO will continue to operate under its existing network arrangements, for example; conducting parliamentary education programs for schools and teachers, attending meetings of professional associations and entering into joint venture arrangements with relevant agencies to produce curriculum materials.</PARA>
<PARA>(ii) Recommendation 5.1</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends the production and distribution of copies of the Australian Constitution, at minimum cost, to schools and to the general public through libraries, AGPS bookshops and parliamentary bookshops where they exist. This could be undertaken by the Curriculum Corporation, the Parliamentary Education Office or State Legislatures.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>I agree that there exists a need for the Constitution document to be more accessible and affordable to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the PEO has arranged for a new format for the Constitution which will result in the production of a pocket sized document which will be available to schools for 60 cents per copy (minimum order quantity of 30). The Parliamentary Bookshop and AGPS now sell single copies for $2.50. During the Autumn Sittings this document was tabled in the Senate and referred to in the other place during Members 90 second statements. Bulk sales of the publication to schools already indicate that it will be popular document.</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) Recommendation 5.3</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Education Office convene a meeting of education officers (or equivalent) of all parliaments to discuss cooperative approaches to parliamentary education in general and the production of resources in particular.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>During its first two years of operation the PEO has established effective lines of communication and ongoing liaison with the relevant education officers in each of the state and territory legislatures. This initiative has resulted already in a number of bi-lateral programs to develop materials which, inter alia, address the relationship between state and Federal parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA>As yet there have not occurred any multi-lateral initiatives which would bring about a more coordinated approach to parliamentary education by the state and Federal legislatures. We believe that considerable advantages would accrue if a small working party, with representation from each legislature, were convened to discuss options for future cooperation and collaboration. A project officer in the PEO has been given responsibility for arranging such a meeting which at this stage is scheduled for March 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>(iv) Recommendations 5.4 and 5.5</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that favourable consideration be given by the National Parliament to the enhanced funding of the Parliamentary Education Office for the purpose of extending its community education programs and its educational leadership role amongst Australian legislatures.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that all Parliamentary and electoral education services re-examine their programs with a view to an increased emphasis on programs for adult clients, and to deliver those programs in a manner which encourages the content knowledge, contextual understanding and personal involvement necessary to promote genuine participation as an active citizen.</PARA>
<PARA>I recognise that there has developed an increased interest on the part of the adult community to learn about our system of government which includes the integral role of parliament as the law making institution. I also recognise that this interest will intensify as the nation moves towards its centenary of Federation and discussion and debate continues on the issue of constitutional reform.</PARA>
<PARA>I anticipate that during this time the PEO will continue to be seen by Senators, Members, educators and the community at large as being one of the key sources of information and advice on parliamentary and citizenship education. In keeping with the Office's flexible and adaptable approach in the past, I am quite sure that, where possible, and within the constraints of its existing resources, it will continue to provide this service.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the PEO is only a small office comprising fewer than ten (10) full time officers attempting to carry out its ``core business'' directed at the parliamentary education needs of more than 10,000 Australian schools who continue to draw on the resources of the Office at an ever increasing rate. It would appear that the work of both the PEO and the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, coupled with the efforts of Members and Senators generally, has stimulated a high level of interest in parliamentary and political affairs in schools and, in line with the findings in the Report, has resulted in an increase in demand for parliamentary education services.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, in the current environment of public expenditure restraint, there exists only a slim hope that additional human resources could be secured for the PEO to move into any major community education initiative beyond its present range of activities.</PARA>
<PARA>My preference is that the PEO should respond to demand in this area on a case by case basis and that any proactive efforts in the adult education area should be the responsibility of Senators and Members and their respective electorate or interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA>I remain confident that under this regime the PEO will continue to provide materials and services to those Senators and Members who require assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>Should circumstances change which would place us in an enhanced position to seek additional funding to support increased activity in the PEO in the community education domain, or should there be a slackening of demand by schools for PEO services and curriculum packages, it would then be entirely appropriate for a review to be undertaken with a view to allocating additional resources to support adult programs.</PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to place on record my appreciation for the unstinting efforts of the Committee in increasing the level of awareness and reasoned nonpartisan debate about active and responsible citizenship in the context of Australian democracy. The work of the Committee has given all Australians an opportunity to examine the role that they should have in both community and public affairs in future years.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I speak briefly to the President's response to the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled Active Citizenship Revisited. I will then seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date because I believe that there are other senators who wish to contribute. As honourable senators would know, this report is an attempt by the Committee to go back over the issues that relate to the question of active citizenship in this country. In particular, it is an attempt to review what has been achieved so far as a result of the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> We made that decision quite deliberately. We have looked at a number of reports that have come into this chamber over the years. Many of the reports have been extremely valuable. They have made recommendations which governments should have acted on, or at least taken into account, in the optioning that goes before Cabinet. After that, nothing was done: the reports sat on the shelf and in many cases gathered dust. The effect of the reports was in many ways neutralised because no-one went back to them to assess whether action had arisen from their recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> We are determined to go back to the issue of active citizenship. We believe that it is an extremely important matter for the Australian community to deal with. It is not just a question of whether Parliament is regarded in this country with a degree of authority or respect or as a place-as I think it may be regarded in some quarters-where people abuse each other and waffle on with no real aim in mind bar passing legislation or the occasional Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Regardless of how Parliament is looked at, this report goes beyond that. The report is about whether people in the community, particularly young people, are able to participate in forums, in organisations, which have some degree of effect on their lives. It does not matter whether it is a sports club, the local council, the State Government or the Federal Parliament. It is an attempt to come to grips with a problem which has been facing many Western democracies over the last decade or so. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the last two American elections, we see that the figures that came out of those elections indicated quite clearly that less than half of those that were eligible to vote actually voted for the President. That is in a democracy which is expected to be one of the more vital and alive in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the recent events in the Soviet Union- or what is left of it-should have indicated quite clearly to all of us that democracy is extremely valuable. Democracy has to be fought for and does not stay forever in any particular country. There will be challenges to the preservation of a democracy in every Western society. Parliaments have a duty to ensure that the institution of Parliament is protected against authoritarianism and apathy. Authoritarianism breeds on the apathy of voters. We have a much greater responsibility than that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ensure that at every level in life our young people in particular can become active citizens; that they are not just sheep but have some control over their own destinies and over their workplace-over any organisation which has an effect on their life. </PARA>
<PARA> The response from the President, I believe, has been positive. On many occasions, the President has proved extremely willing to support the Committee's approach to active citizenship. He has gone out of his way to ensure that this Parliament, particularly the Senate chamber, has provided the information, the ideas, to members of Parliament who want to get closer to young people in their electorates. He has made sure that the parliamentary visits program has gone beyond just a few lucky schools that happen to be close to this Parliament House. In fact, as honourable senators know, it is now a program geared towards bringing in young people from all over Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The President has been very active indeed in ensuring that the televising of this chamber is done in the most appropriate way. In other words, all of those sorts of things which bring this Parliament closer to the people have been very much in the mind of the President. I congratulate him for that. The positive response of the President to the report of the Committee is taken on board. I will not go into the details because I want to deal with some of the principles behind the publication of the report and the President's response. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fair to say that the image of politicians in Australia at the moment ranks well below shonky used car salesmen. That is a real problem not only for democracy but also for the sorts of people that we will get into the chamber in the future and for the way that this Parliament operates. In many ways, the responsibility comes back to us. We cannot look at anyone else-after all, we are the legislators. We are the ones who determine how we operate in this place. I do not particularly care if people have brawls in the House of Representatives during Question Time-maybe that is entertaining-and I do not think the fact that parliamentarians are occasionally vitriolic and nasty to each other is the real problem. It just adds a bit of drama to the occasion. On the whole, it is not a problem that afflicts this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a problem is the way we organise our business. It is fair to say, as many people have said, that much of our time in this place is taken up by dealing with Bills, many of which should never have come into the chamber in the first place. I am not blaming the Government; I am just blaming the process. It would not matter who was in government, it would be pretty much the same. We insist, for example, on looking in this chamber at legislation which needs to be renewed every year. The question to be asked is: should that Bill have to come in every year? Does the Parliament need to vet in detail that particular Bill?</PARA>
<PARA> Governments today are faced with a rolling problem of legislation, much of which emanates from the bureaucracy. Much of it is patching up bad legislation from previous sessions, written again by the bureaucracy. Parliamentarians, in a sense, have started to lose control of their own chamber. The responsibility for that does not just lie with the Government; it lies with all parties in this chamber. If we insist that a Bill comes back here to be looked at every year because we do not trust anyone, because we do not trust the Minister, we are clogging up the Parliament. We are cutting off the opportunities for debate on issues that count and we are cutting off the opportunities to make sure that this place is relevant as a debating institution to the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point which flows from that issue is the question of fixed time debates. We have just listened to a debate on a report on animal welfare. The Select Committee on Animal Welfare is about to wind up. It has presented a number of very important reports. Those reports are relevant to a wide section of Australians-from people involved in animal sport, to farmers, to exporters, to our rural industries. The reports are in fact very interesting. They are not the sorts of things that I would willingly pick up, but I picked them up the other day, read them and finished them. I thought that the reports were interesting. The reports would interest a lot of people in the community at large. If honourable senators look up at the broadcasting sign, they will see that the Senate is not being broadcast today. The debate on the report has not been heard by anyone in the community. The debate will get coverage in Hansard and diligent senators may decide to send out a copy to interested electors. On the whole, the impact of that report will in many ways be negated by the way in which this Parliament works. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Parliament is to remain relevant and to add its contribution to Australian democracy, sooner or later we have to get to a system where we have fixed time debates. We need to have a system where major issues that are coming before this Parliament-whether they be a Bill, a motion moved by the Opposition or a report tabled by a particular committee-are advertised well in advance so that interested groups, people who have a particular interest in an area, are able to turn up here or tune into us on the television or radio at a fixed time and know that that is the debate they will hear or see. How can the average farmer, for example, who is interested in reports on animal welfare find out when and where to listen in to this chamber and how to find out when such reports are on? He has to take potluck at the far end of the dial. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that the real purpose of this Parliament is to pass legislation. It may be that that is the major function of this Parliament-the Government certainly thinks so. But there is another function here which we overlook and that is the function of this place as a forum for debate-for the exchange of ideas and information-which flows out to the community and back again via honourable members and senators. </PARA>
<PARA> We are increasingly being seen as an irrelevant institution. The report on active citizenship showed just that. What was the average young person's attitude towards members of parliament? They were seen as stiff, sterile in terms of ideas and boring. That came through over and over again. That may suit, say, third parties that tend to rely upon disaffected young people to get their votes, but that is only in the short term. Even those parties, in the long term, benefit from an active citizenry which takes an interest in major issues, is prepared to be heard, knows how to work within the system and is prepared to contribute. </PARA>
<PARA> Already that disaffection with politics in Australia-and in the United States and most other Western countries-is showing itself in the decline in the number of people who belong to political parties which I understand is less than one per cent of the voting population in Australia. That is a minute percentage compared with a significant number of other countries, but even numbers in those countries are declining because, again, most of their institutions behave like ours. We do not give the consumers, that is, the voters, the opportunity to anticipate what is going on here and to play some role-if nothing else than simply listening at an appropriate time to hear the issues that they regard as important being debated. </PARA>
<PARA> We can televise this chamber until the cows come home. We can set rules about what should be included during that televising of Parliament-for example, we must not make the chamber look too empty, according to the rules that we have written; people can dress for television and wear the right ties and the rest it-but at the end of the day that is going to have very little effect on young people, in particular, and their perception of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a question of having rules or a constitution which at the end of the day decides whether or not we go down the road towards a totalitarian country; it is a question of attitudes. First of all, do our citizens care? Are they active citizens or do they want to leave it up to politicians to handle themselves? The second question is whether or not the Parliament or the parliamentary institutions are, in fact, the fulcrums or centres of debate in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked honourable senators today how they think the major debates that are going on out there-the major concerns that people have-are being reflected in this place or in the House of Representatives. Is there a real exchange and interchange of ideas between the political parties? Is there any indication that we, as individuals and as a corporate group, are prepared to put ideas in the centre and to debate them? Honourable senators should look at our matters of public importance-the MPIs that we have every week. They should look at the subject matter. Generally speaking, such motions relate only to economic behaviour-how the Budget should have been readjusted by the Government and how our fiscal policy as a government is extremely poor. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am saying that this is what the MPIs put up by the Opposition have said. Occasionally, there are MPIs on unemployment. Three Opposition members will get up on one side and bash the Government, and Government members will get up and bash back. At the end of the day the public is no wiser and none of us are any wiser, I might say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I am making about matters of public importance is that they are discussed after a couple of hours notice. A member of Parliament on our side, for example, can be told, `Oh, by the way, in about three hours time you are speaking on a matter of public importance'. It could be on the restructuring of the economy, the protection of the Argentinean ant or whatever it happens to be, and in three hours time that member would go into the chamber and debate it. Of what benefit is that type of program to anyone? Would it not have been better to have said, `The Opposition is going to move a major motion on Wednesday and notice will be given on Monday.'? Then people could prepare so that that debate would be the most positive, valuable debate we could have instead of the fairly low standard debate we tend to have in this place at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, what I am saying today is that not only the Senate but also the House of Representatives have to examine very closely their procedures. We have to ensure that what is said in here is a reflection of the concerns in the community at large and is something we are prepared to stand up and be counted on. For example, gun laws are a matter of major concern in the Australian community at the moment. It is a very complex issue. How often has it been aired in this place? There are a few questions at Question Time, a couple of carefully worded replies from a Minister and one of the major issues in the Australian community goes in the front door of our Parliament and out the back door. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, looking at the talent-and I use that word very carefully-that is elected to this Parliament, there are not too many drongos. There is a lot of talent in this place, and it is not used. It is a game of superficial ping-pong. I see people who came in here with me in 1983 who I knew had a lot to give and who, in a sense, intellectually are working at about half pace. </PARA>

This side, on the whole, speaks less than the Opposition. Why? Because we have a legislative program to get through. Why? Because the time allowed for debates in the Senate is much greater than in the House of Representatives. For example, if we have to get legislation through by Christmas we have to sit and listen to 32 members of the Opposition debate the pig levy Bill-which may or may not be important-while one or two Government members will get up, because if we all got up that Bill would never get through.</PARA></TALK.START>

She is saying that if the legislation were better we would not have to amend it so much and therefore the place would run smoothly. That is not the case. The case is more as to the way in which we organise the whole of this Parliament. Of course the Government has a role to play. It has to organise its legislative program more efficiently. That means, for example, making some of the public servants in this town-who, incidentally, in many cases at the top level earn more than do the majority of us-work in January so that when we come back here the program is ready. Similarly, if some of the questioning that goes on in Estimates Committees-the thousands upon thousands of questions on notice that bog down departments and get nowhere-in some way were given a focus by Opposition members, if those opposite adopted tactics and a strategy to make their approach more efficient, there would be more time to do other things in this place, to debate the major issues that I think the community wants debated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at the program over the past five years in the Senate, one can see why the Australian public is turning off us at a thousand miles an hour.

In terms of issues that ought to be taking precedence in the community, particularly political issues, surely they are not the only things that are happening in the community. We have a million unemployed out there. There is no easy answer to it but I do not hear too much discussion in this place that could be called a worthy approach to that issue. It is the ping-pong of defence, counter-defence, attack and so on between the Government and the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am going on record today because after seven years in this place and nearly six years in a State parliament, I can see parliaments becoming more irrelevant year by year. The position, the respect given to politicians and the satisfaction they get from their jobs are also declining. I ask senators to look at the turnover. The average time that people stay in this place is now about eight years; they are in and they are out. We are starting to get a phenomenon now which is called the drop-dead phenomenon, where people come in here and at about age 45 or 50 start making a decision about their lives. They say `What am I achieving?'. If they have another option out there, they will go. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Lewis says, one does not blame them, because for the most part the majority of people in this chamber are irrelevant. One does one's little bit but most people here are working at about half the effectiveness they should be because of the way in which this place operates. We can blame no-one else but ourselves. Every time we have moved to improve the Standing Orders to make sure that the rules govern the way in which this place runs, we have bogged ourselves down in a suspicious game of chess. `If the Liberals want this, we had better check this very carefully', says the Government, `because there may be some reason why they want it. They may get an advantage'. The Opposition says, `If the Government wants this particular move, we had better look at it pretty suspiciously'. The Australian Democrats say, `We will be cut out if we are not careful'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are lots of people who will have to give a little. For example, we should ask ourselves about fixed time debates. If three o'clock on a Wednesday is the time when a major debate occurs, and everyone knows that with three days notice of the fact that that topic will be debated, who gets an advantage? The Liberals have said that it is the Government because it can organise its PR. The Government says that it is the Opposition because it can make a major attack on the Government and embarrass it. The Democrats say that because there are two major parties, they will not get a look in. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that nobody specifically benefits. The people who perform benefit; the Parliament benefits if the level of debate goes up. If people improve their preparations, if people actually debate an issue rather than just shout across the chamber at each other, the Parliament benefits-not one party over another. When we come back to a review of the Standing Orders again, we must look at it objectively and fairly. Only a fool thinks it is better to ruin a Parliament or the parliamentary institution over a long period than to lose an advantage to the other side. </PARA>
<PARA> I am an historian by trade. Uruguay was considered to be one of the most viable democracies in the world. It is now a dictatorship. It has gone through the most horrendous persecution of out-groups, breaches of civil liberties and so on, all in about 20 years, because it did not nurture its democracy. The Weimar Republic had the best constitution probably written this century-the freest, the most caring of individual liberties and rights, with nice checks and balances built into the system. But by 1933 Germany was a dictatorship because of apathy. The apathy that the community in Germany was showing was a very dangerous seed bed for Hitler. People lost confidence in the economy. They started to look for scapegoats and so on. They looked for someone who would give them simple answers, and they got him. </PARA>
<PARA> The road to democracy, or the road away from it, is not a fixed one. Every community has to reassess its position every decade or so. In America they are just starting to do that now. They are saying, `How come only 50 per cent of eligible voters bother to vote for the President? How come people take the law into their own hands in so many places? What is wrong with our system?'. Then on the other hand one has the Soviets inching bit by bit towards a democracy. They may not even make it, who knows, but it is a very exciting time. All is change, as Heraclitus says. </PARA>
<PARA> I am leaving the Senate with a message because I want to be on record about this report. This report was just a start. It was an attempt to try to look at the way we get young people in particular to treasure their democracy, to treasure their right to participate in organisations that affect their lives. This Parliament is one of those organisations. We shall have to start thinking very carefully about where we stand in terms of the respect young people give us, the impact that we have on the community, and how we can improve that. It goes far beyond party politics. It goes to the core of the sort of political system we want. Do we want a system run by the elite with the apathetic majority just going along, or one which is a culmination of a proper participatory democracy? I seek leave to continue to my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the report be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the thirteenth report of the Committee of Privileges concerning a matter raised by a person under Privilege Resolution 5 of 25 February 1988. On 21 August 1991, the President, Senator the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, referred a letter from Dr Alex Proudfoot relating to the remarks made by Senator Reynolds in the Senate on 30 May and to a question on notice, a response to which was published in Hansard on 14 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has considered the submission and recommends that a response agreed to by Dr Proudfoot and the Committee be incorporated in Hansard. In making this recommendation, the Committee wishes to emphasise that, as with all matters of this nature, the Committee does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or persons, but rather it ensures that a person's submission and, ultimately, the response recommended by the Committee accord with the criteria set out in Privilege Resolution 5. </PARA>
<PARA> I might just elaborate on that point because there has been some publicity which from time to time has indicated that there is a failure by people in the real world to understand what the Privileges Committee is in fact saying in matters such as this. I can understand that because we do not expect people to be reading resolutions of the Senate. The situation is simply that when the Committee considers a submission under this resolution and reports, the Committee shall not consider or judge the truth of any statements made in the Senate or of the submission. </PARA>
<PARA> In this particular case, we are not judging the truth or otherwise of the statements made by Senator Reynolds in relation to the question and we are not judging the truth or otherwise of the statement made by Dr Proudfoot. We are presenting to the Senate Dr Proudfoot's submission, he having convinced the Committee that he complies with the requirements of the resolution and that his statement, in accordance with the resolution of the Senate, is now succinct and strictly relevant to the questions in issue and does not contain anything offensive in character, et cetera, in accordance with what is set out in Privilege Resolution 5 of the Senate dated 25 February 1988. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA> The response read as follows-</PARA>

<PARA>PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5(7) (B) OF THE SENATE OF</PARA>
<PARA>25 FEBRUARY 1988</PARA>
<PARA>This is a submission under the Senate's Resolution 5 of 25 February 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>I have been referred to in the Senate by Senator Reynolds on 30 May 1991 (Hansard, page 3943) and in a question on notice (no. 994) published in Hansard 14 August 1991 on page 369. </PARA>
<PARA>Although Senator Reynolds did not mention my name, I am readily identified from the details given, my case against the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) having been reported in the media on several occasions. </PARA>
<PARA>On 30 May 1991 Senator Reynolds described my action against the HREOC as an ``unfortunate dispute''. </PARA>
<PARA>I took the action in accordance with my rights under statute, with the aim of forcing the HREOC to entertain my complaint of sex discrimination. More than two months before Senator Reynolds' remarks, the Federal Court had given judgment in my favour (Proudfoot v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, 100 ALR 557). </PARA>
<PARA>I have been adversely affected by Senator Reynolds' references to me, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The reference on 30 May 1991:</PARA>
<PARA> People (including my superiors within the Australian Public Service (APS)) may be led to believe that my court action was frivolous or vexatious, and that I lack judgment. Such a belief would be damaging to my reputation and to my ability to perform my duties as a senior administrator within the APS. </PARA>
<PARA>Part (4) of question on notice no. 994:</PARA>
<PARA> People (including drug companies with whom I deal as a therapeutic goods administrator, patients' advocates with whom I deal in the same capacity, and patients whom I treat in the course of approved patient care work outside the APS) may be led to believe that I am biased against women, that I regard fairness as unimportant, or that I lack objectivity in dealing with particular groups. </PARA>
<PARA>I regard part (4) of Senator Reynolds' question as a personal slur. I believe that the implication is that since I have complained of discrimination against men, I must be biased against women and cannot be trusted to adopt an impartial approach if in the course of my official duties I am called upon to deal with anything which relates to women. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that I have never acted with less than scrupulous impartiality in the performance of my duties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the reports. </PARA>
<PARA>The first report that I have just presented is for the construction of a two storey chancery building and a new two storey head of residence and the provision of associated infrastructure, such as services, parking and landscaping for the Australian mission in Islamabad, Pakistan. The estimated cost of this work is $7.992m at March 1991 prices. The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's public hearing into the proposal was held in Canberra and officers from Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Australian Construction Services as well as representatives of the Public Sector Union, Austrade and the Foreign Affairs and Trade Association presented evidence. I mention this because, as has been the case with previous inquiries into embassy-type overseas works, the Committee was precluded from carrying out site inspections and taking evidence from Australian representatives in Pakistan by virtue of subsection 12(1) of the Public Works Committee Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The report, once again, draws attention to the continuing difficulty the Committee faces in assessing overseas projects because of the restriction placed upon it. The report mentions that Australia's relations with Pakistan are significant. The south Asian region is of general strategic concern to Australia and Australia and Pakistan have longstanding trade links. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, the High Commission is housed in a building which was constructed in 1976 to accommodate the mission's garages, workshops and stores. Similarly, the official residence consists of an inappropriate and poorly maintained leased house which required major maintenance and repairs before it was occupied. The Government of Pakistan allocated a 1.45 hectare site in 1965 for the chancery and head of mission residence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded, on the basis of written and oral evidence, that there is a need for a functional high commission complex which will project Australia's presence and reflect the importance that Australia places on its relations with Pakistan. The report also recommends that a permanent building services officer be located at the new High Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report which I have presented relates to the second stage of the development of HMAS Albatross at Nowra, New South Wales. The first stage of development of the base was the subject of an inquiry by the Committee in 1986. This second stage is for the construction of a new building to house command operations, communications and administrative functions, a new building to provide offices for technical and administrative staff of two squadrons plus the upgrading of associated hangar annexes, and the upgrading of high voltage reticulation and emergency power supply. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of the proposed work is $9.9m at December 1990 prices. The Committee concluded that there is a need to construct the buildings and associated engineering works to provide facilities to accommodate support functions and for the high voltage electrical services to be upgraded. The Committee also concluded that the proposed work would be adequate in meeting the need. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee gave some attention to energy issues during its inquiry. The Senate will be aware that the subject of energy conservation has been highlighted in a number of recent reports by the Committee. The Committee is mindful of the Government's objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005. This objective is highlighted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the forward in the Energy Guide which was recently circulated to every Australian household. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that as part of the stage 2 development an energy audit should be undertaken to identify methods by which the use of electricity can be reduced. Furthermore, it was agreed that those buildings in this proposal requiring the provision of hot water should be provided with adequate solar hot water heaters. The proposal as put to the Committee stipulated the use of electric hot water heating. </PARA>
<PARA> The choice of electricity was the result of an analysis of life cycle costing which indicated that solar hot water heating would cost 70 per cent more than an electric system. The Committee understands that the technique of life cycle costing is one of a number of techniques available for use in analysing capital and recurrent costs associated with investment decisions. It is limited in its focus in this instance because it does not take account of other factors such as investment in power stations or greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, the Committee believes that, as the citizens of Australia are asked to contribute towards the achievement of the Government's objectives, it follows that government departments and agencies should provide leadership in the achievement of the objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The third report which I presented relates to the redevelopment of Seaward Village by the Defence Housing Authority. Seaward Village is adjacent to Campbell Barracks, Swanbourne, Perth, the home base of the Special Air Services Regiment. The proposal examined by the Committee is for the replacement of 77 substandard houses with 123 houses on 115 lots, new roads and the provision of new utility services. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $12.814m. The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> In doing so, the Committee has also made a number of recommendations that asbestos removal, the non-excavation of dune formations, access roads, energy targets and efficiency be carried out as part of the proposed work. As with the previous report, the Committee has recommended that the Defence Housing Authority use the concept of energy targets as a criterion by which it selects the suitability or otherwise of project homes submitted to it by builders. This recommendation is consistent with earlier reports by the Committee and reinforces the spirit of the Government's target to reduce greenhouse emissions by 20 per cent by 2005. The Committee has also recommended that the houses be provided with solar hot water heating for the same reasons as I mentioned in relation to the previous report. I commend the reports to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991 forms part of a package of six cognate Bills which are being introduced today. Taken together, these Bills increase the level of prudential protection provided to life and general insurance policy holders and provide a measure of financial support to policy holders of Occidental Life Insurance Company of Australia Limited and Regal Life Insurance Limited. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bills give effect to announcements made by the former Treasurer on 6 November 1990, 21 January 1991 and 11 February 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill now before the House sets out new rules for compulsory notification to the Minister and screening of proposals relating to:</PARA>
<PARA>* Acquisition or issue of significant shareholdings (15 per cent or more) in Australian insurance companies;</PARA>
<PARA>* Acquisition or leasing of a significant portion (15 per cent or more) of the assets of Australian insurance companies; and</PARA>
<PARA>* Control of agreements, whether formal or informal, relating to the directorate of Australian insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA>The changes provided for in this Bill complement other measures being introduced today in the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1991 to strengthen and enhance existing insurance supervisory legislation. The Government is introducing legislation providing for the screening of proposed changes to the ownership and control of insurers in order to reduce the risk of financial loss to policy holders where inappropriate persons assume ownership or control of insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA>The measures seek to preserve the good standing of these important industries and to ensure that the national interest is protected where changes to the ownership or control of insurance companies are proposed to be made. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill aims to protect the public interest by:</PARA>
<PARA>* Ensuring that the conduct of the affairs of Australian life and general insurance companies is not adversely affected by changes in ownership or control of those companies;</PARA>
<PARA>* Preventing unsuitable persons from acquiring a position of influence over Australian life and general insurance companies;</PARA>
<PARA>* Preventing transactions or arrangements which would result in undue concentration of economic power in the Australian life insurance industry, the Australian general insurance industry or the Australian financial system generally; and</PARA>
<PARA>* Preventing transactions which would be contrary to the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>In developing the measures contained in this Bill, the Government has taken into account other comparable legislation including the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 and similar legislation operating in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA>The Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill is structured in 10 parts. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 1 provides a number of necessary formal provisions, a clear statement of objects, and a simplified outline of the Bill. It also defines key terms and concepts for the purposes of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Parts 2, 3 and 4 deal with the acquisition of ownership or control of Australian insurance companies. The parts deal with acquisitions by means of:</PARA>
<PARA>* Issue or acquisition of shares;</PARA>
<PARA>* Acquisition or leasing of assets; and</PARA>
<PARA>* Agreements relating to company directorships. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular, the 3 parts provide for:</PARA>
<PARA>* A trigger threshold of 15 per cent of ownership or control of a target company for purposes of notification of a proposed acquisition;</PARA>
<PARA>* A 30 day time-limit for the Minister to make a decision in respect of a proposal;</PARA>
<PARA>* The Minister to grant conditional approval, make permanent or temporary restraining orders and to make divestment orders where it is appropriate to do so; and</PARA>
<PARA>* Penalty provisions for contravention of orders made by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 5 provides for the Federal Court to make judicial orders for the enforcement of ministerial orders made under the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 6 provides a mechanism to unwind schemes which may be effected to avoid the notification and approval provisions of the Bill. Part 7 empowers the Minister to set down principles, to be tabled in Parliament, to be followed in making certain decisions under the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 8 provides a mechanism for the review of decisions by the Minister and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>Parts 9 and 10 contain a number of miscellaneous provisions of relevance to the administration and operation of the Bill. These include provisions relating to the secrecy of information provided to the Government for the purposes of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides that proposals involving the acquisition of ownership or control of interests in an insurer in excess of a 15 per cent threshold must be notified to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The 15 per cent threshold is defined in terms which are sufficiently broad in scope to ensure the notification of proposals to acquire significant direct or indirect interests in an insurer. The threshold takes account of interests arising from the operation of informal agreements and understandings. It also has regard to the interests of persons who are associated with the acquirer as well as interests that may be directly held. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Bill, proposals must be notified prior to the acquisition of an interest in excess of the threshold and the Minister has 30 days in which to make a decision. The Minister may decide that he has no objection to the proposal or, alternatively, that the proposal may be implemented with or without conditions. If the Minister makes no decision within the 30 day period then the proposal may be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister may also issue a temporary restraining order where more time is needed to examine a proposed transaction. The life of such orders is subject to limits laid down in the Bill. Where the Minister is satisfied that the proposal is not in the public interest, he may issue a permanent restraining order. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also contains broad anti-avoidance provisions. In particular, it provides penalties for non-compliance and the Minister has power to issue a divestment order in circumstances where a person has acquired an interest in an insurer without seeking prior approval and where that acquisition is considered to be contrary to the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>The need for the type of legislative controls which will be provided by this Bill was demonstrated by the circumstances leading up to the attempted sale of Occidental Life and Regal Life. In that case, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner was aware from informal industry contacts that steps were being taken to arrange for the sale of the two companies. </PARA>
<PARA>His attempts to obtain precise and detailed information concerning the proposed transaction were frustrated by the lack of formal authority to investigate the matter properly. </PARA>
<PARA>More generally, the Commissioner has been concerned that he has been required to rely on the cooperation of the industry rather than on formal arrangements for monitoring changes to the ownership and control of life and general insurance companies. Experience has clearly shown that it is an important element of supervision to be in a position to appropriately monitor significant transactions of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA>Such monitoring arrangements are important not only for prudential purposes but also to place the Government in a position to effectively monitor changes which could lead to undue concentration of power in the insurance industry and financial markets generally. </PARA>
<PARA>In framing the Bill, the Government has been aware of the need to build in appropriate safeguards and review provisions in order to avoid unnecessary intervention in the operation of the market. Accordingly, the Bill contains measures for the protection of the rights and interests of persons and companies affected by its operation. In particular, the Bill contains appropriate secrecy provisions and review provisions which will give scope for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in respect of key decisions under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>In summary, the measures being introduced in this Bill are designed to further protect the interests of insurance consumers as well as the broader national interest. The Bill does not unduly interfere with the open and competitive market for insurance business. At the same time it provides clear rules and guidelines with respect to the ownership and control of insurance companies while providing for the protection of the privacy of affected individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Implications</PARA>
<PARA>The measures contained in this Bill to provide for the screening of changes to the ownership and control of insurance companies, together with the improved prudential arrangements contained in the Companion Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1991, will result in additional supervisory costs being incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The additional resources needed to give effect to these measures have been estimated at $510 000 in 1990-91, $785 000 in 1991-92 and $410 000 in both 1992-93 and 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA>These additional costs will be fully recovered through the life insurance and general insurance supervisory levies. It is for this purpose that the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991 and the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991 are included in the package of Bills before the House. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991 to the Senate and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The affordable rate, as Senator Brownhill quite rightly points out. Consistently through the debates that have taken place in this chamber-and in the House of Representatives-in June, and subsequently when we returned recently in August, we have taken the view that 10 per cent is the maximum rate of wool tax that should have been implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In moving this motion today I have drawn the Senate's attention to the list of instruments with regard to the regulations to implement the wool tax. There are five specific regulations contained in the various statutory rules. In moving this motion I am putting forward the view which the Opposition has continuously held and which it believes has been sustained on the economic benefits, the formulas and all of the processes that have been put before the Parliament at the time of consideration of this matter in June and more recently in August. </PARA>
<PARA> We have previously spoken in favour of a wool tax levy of 10 per cent. It was only the combined action of the Labor Government and the Australian Democrats that resulted in a compromise. The Government originally proposed a 15 per cent levy, but by agreement between the Government and the Democrats the figure of 12 per cent was arrived at. Again, I stress the point that we believe the economics and the situation of the industry totally support a maximum levy of 10 per cent. That point needs to be stressed over and over again. The figure of 10 per cent is probably rather conservative. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting that we have not been able to get the Government to agree to any further changes. It is also interesting to note that these regulations apply only for a period of 12 months. The legislation that was introduced into the Parliament in June put in place a 15 per cent levy, and it was only because of the agreement that was struck in the dying stages of that session of Parliament that the Democrats agreed to implement the 12 per cent levy. On a subsequent reading of that process of legislation we found that it applied only for a 12-month period. Therefore, at some stage in the future the tax will revert to a rate of 15 per cent. We do not believe that on any of the arguments that have been presented-whether by ABARE or industry sources, or through economic analyses that have been done in various academic institutions or by people who are close to industry-this figure can be proved, sustained or, in effect, borne by the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We are well aware that Australia is currently caught up in a very severe recession. This has dramatic effects on the primary industries of Australia. The primary producers are being asked to bear unnecessary additional costs at a time of extreme problems in their industry that have been totally forced on them by the policies of the Hawke Labor Government. We need to look at the plight of those in the bush, primary industry and the many people who live in remote and rural Australia who are caught up in the implications of these policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody can deny that it is by the very firm and deliberate action of the Hawke Labor Government that people in rural Australia are suffering. They are suffering personally. They are suffering industry by industry. They are suffering in the associated communities, towns and supporting industries that have been so drastically affected by all of the policies of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We noted recently in the Budget that the Hawke Labor Government marched forward with a bigger, better cities-brighter program-or whatever it wants to call it, and somehow plucked out of the air $800m for a program to improve urban centres. Yet when we really look at the productive industries and productive sectors, we show up the hypocrisy of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but that $800m promise has been cast off into the future. There is only $50m of it in this year's program. When we analyse where that $50m is to be spent, it is worth noting that it is only in Newcastle, Sydney, Wollongong, Melbourne and Geelong. It is nothing but a marginal seat survival strategy by the Hawke Labor Government and has no bearing whatsoever on the productive sectors of the economy. Nothing has been forthcoming from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) as a result of the recent Budget that would allay the fears of those people who are producing the wealth of this nation and, particularly, the woolgrowers. It is for that reason that we bring forward this motion to disallow the regulations on the wool tax levy and call on the Government to make regulations at the far more appropriate level of 10 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we are again, probably for the fifth time this year, debating a wool measure-in this case wool tax regulations. It is a pity that we do not have a Minister at the table who knows something about the situation or, indeed, the same Minister who did the deal with the Australian Democrats. At this time and ever since then the coalition has demonstrated that a 10 per cent levy was enough. In fact, we had figures which showed that 9.2 per cent was enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that our projections have improved since then. Production is lower than the figure used at that time which, from memory, was 885 million kilos. Prices have been consistently above the 450c a kilo figure which was used in the exercise. The price is still over 500c a kilo, even with the higher volume that has been coming forward onto the market in the last few weeks. Our figures, and I believe even the Government figures, were based on 450c a kilo for 21 micro wool. There have been higher clearances of the stockpile than expected by the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. We were saying this back in February, March, April, May and again in the dying stages of last session. At least the Government and the Government advisers-if there is not a Minister who is interested in the situation-should have known that what we were saying was correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought there would have been some change by the time these regulations had come before us. But, no, the Government has decided to stay with it. My opposition has increased since we realised that the Minister misled the Senate by not advising that promotion had been cut from 3.5 to 2.5 per cent; in other words, reduced by one per cent. Nobody on this side of the chamber was told about this on the last night of the autumn sittings. The Democrats gave in and accepted 12 per cent. Senator Bell has just indicated that the Democrats were not told. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Minister at the table, assisted by Mr Crean, pretended that they were giving the Democrats something but they gave us nothing. It was just the three card trick-that is, they were giving in at 12 per cent and that 12 per cent was for one year only. These things only came out later. Perhaps even the Democrats would not have taken the same decision that evening had they actually known what the Government was offering. The Government got the Bill through that night by deceit. It did not put all the cards on the table. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government gave nothing away that night and, of course, it is not giving away anything now. We have argued since February, April and the last night of the sittings-21 June-that our figures are affordable. Although there has been a lot of shearing, less wool is coming through because the cut is lower than expected. The whole of Western Australia is down about 20 per cent and parts of the eastern States are also down. Next year's clip will also be down judging by the seasons that have been experienced in the east, in South Australia as well as in the west. The Government should see the light now because things are tough out in those places. Farmers are finding life very tough because of this levy along with the other non-measures in the Budget that Senator Tambling has already mentioned. A reduction in this wool levy would help to ease this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said here in this chamber before that we should not have continued that night; once we had defeated the Bill we should have shut the Senate down and gone home. But we on this side, out of the goodness of our hearts, let the Government have another go for 10 minutes. That 10 minutes, as I said before, went to 40 minutes. The Minister at the table at the time could not think, Mr Crean intervened and something was sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA> I look again to the Democrats for support in defeating these regulations tonight. The threat of a 15 per cent levy is hanging over us. If we do not defeat these regulations we will have the 15 per cent. I could support a figure of 12 per cent for the rest of the five years. But these regulations, as Senator Tambling has already mentioned and as I am sure Senator Crane will also mention, set the rate at 12 per cent for 12 months. But then it reverts to 15 per cent. So, unless for some reason an amendment came before this chamber, we would have to wait 4 1/2 years before we could look at the 15 per cent again. </PARA>
<PARA> I call on the Democrats to think about it again. If we are going to finish up with 15 per cent after this year, we may as well take the risk of finishing up with the 15 per cent now. As I said before, we were hoodwinked into this by deceitful means. We were not given the full facts and, as far as I am concerned, that is a matter of deceit. I believe that we have always been on the right track. I think the next 4 1/2 to five years will prove that everything we have said during this wool debate was correct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, the Opposition is calling on the Government to lower the wool levy to 10 per cent. By moving to disallow the 12 per cent levy that the Government has put forward in the regulations presently before the Senate, we realise that it is only for 12 months. In 12 months time the Government could raise that levy. But in the meantime, we can do nothing. We already know that there is no need for a 12 per cent levy. We know that we have already sold over 100,000 bales from the stockpile; and we know that the prices of wool are very much greater than earlier anticipated. On our side of the Parliament we had already come to the decision that a 10 per cent levy was more than adequate. This gave us a buffer of 0.9 per cent for things to go wrong because our figures proved that there was no need for a levy higher than 9.1 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know whether Government senators opposite realise the extent of unemployment in the bush. We are worried about unemployment in the cities but there is horrendous unemployment in Tasmanian bush areas. Young people are moving out of the bush into the cities to try to get work because there is absolutely nothing for them, even on one-man family properties. Yet, the Government is insisting on an additional 2 per cent levy that is not needed. The other day on the Today Show the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) showed that he was out of touch with the people of Australia when he said that John Hewson did not have any compassion because he owned a Ferrari. </PARA>
<PARA> The people ridiculed the Prime Minister, with his mansion worth $1.4m, and he could not understand why. We have a Budget with absolutely no compassion at all for unemployed people and absolutely no compassion for the wool growers of Australia who are being charged an extra and unnecessary 2 per cent extra levy, thus making jolly sure that there is no way they can afford to employ anyone on their properties, perhaps even their own sons and ensuring that they have to leave and go to the cities. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Panizza said, the Government was so deceitful in the original debate that it did not mention that it would claw back, on that 12 per cent levy towards the 15 per cent which it thought was necessary, an additional one per cent from the promotion of wool. We on this side of the chamber were unaware of that. I am quite sure that the Australian Democrats were unaware of it as well. The Government did not bother to tell us. The deceit was unbelievable. The lack of accountability of the Government was also unbelievable. I have with me an Auditor-General's report entitled Potential Erosion of Accountability to the Parliament. That report deals with the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill 1991 and the Australian Wool Corporation Bill 1991. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction and passage of these Bills with the current audit provisions could have a significant and serious effect on the ability of the Parliament to exercise the responsibilities entrusted to it by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned that a continuing effort to weaken the Parliament's role in the scrutiny and reporting on the activities of all public sector entities appears to be gaining strength. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the Auditor-General speaking of the Government. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In the early hours of 31 May 1991, without consultation with the ANAO, two Bills were introduced into the House of Representatives which tilt the balance against the Parliament's scrutiny, through the Auditor-General's involvement in the audit, of public-sector entities. </PARA>
<PARA> This action was despite the Government's decision that the Auditor-General should be the sole external auditor for all Commonwealth owned or controlled entities announced in a statement by the Government on 6 December 1990 in response to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts' examination. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> While paying lip service to the Government decision, these Bills allow the entities to recommend the appointment of auditors other than the Auditor-General and put the onus on the Minister for Finance to explain why he declines to appoint a recommended private sector auditor. No such explanation is required if the Minister excludes the Auditor-General. The reverse should be the case, given that a private auditor is without responsibility to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that some States have found it necessary to tighten accountability by strengthening the roles of the Auditors-General in the light of recent history should be sufficient warning against the dilution of the Parliament's and the Auditor-General's role. </PARA>
<PARA>He further continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Parliament (and the public) have a right to know what has been done with power and/or taxpayers' resources granted or guaranteed to any group. This right will be undermined if the current attempt to weaken the audit mandate of the Auditor-General succeeds. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope this is a mistake which will be corrected, rather than a reflection of a change in Government attitude to the role of the Parliament and the ANAO. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask that the Parliament consider the implications of these Bills for its ability to scrutinise what has been done in its name.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) whether he will answer the question that I put to him and which the Auditor-General put to the Government. We on this side of the chamber once again plead with the Government to enable the wool growers in the bush to employ more people and not to rip off another 2 per cent levy, which is totally unnecessary. It is for this reason that we move to disallow the regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion to disallow these Wool Tax Regulations will not be supported by the Australian Democrats. However, to some extent I share Senator Panizza's argument, to which I listened carefully. I agree, and I think it is quite evident, that circumstances within the wool industry have changed since the original assessment was made by the Government to recommend its particular level of taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is what we were arguing in the original debate. We argued that the circumstances had changed since the initial assessment and the justification for 15 per cent. However, the figure of 12 per cent was the one which we proposed as an amendment and the figure which was finally achieved. It is true that during the debate, as Senator Walters and Senator Panizza pointed out-although I was not here for Senator Tambling's speech, I know he strongly feels this way too-there has been a sense of being misled, perhaps even cheated, by the Government not having explained to the Senate that when it agreed to the 12 per cent figure, that meant there would be a reduction in the promotion component of that levy; in other words, less of the levy would be spent on promotion. I share that sense of having been misled. </PARA>
<PARA> Having taken all that on board and thought about it, I have not changed my reaction to the proposal. There are two factors involved. The first factor is that I fail to see how, by disallowing these regulations, we can come up with any figure other than 15 per cent-the figure set by legislation. The Opposition has not been able satisfactorily to explain how any other figure can be delivered, if these regulations are disallowed. They cannot be amended; they simply must be disallowed. </PARA>

The other aspect that concerns me is the suggestion that the 12 per cent levy is for one year only. I think it is perfectly accurate to say that. But to suggest that the Government will be solely responsible for setting the next year's levy is to misunderstand what we have been able to achieve by means of the legislation. Next year's rate will not be set by the Government acting alone. This should be appreciated. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain exactly the process for setting the next year's levy. There is a requirement for consultation. It is not a case of the Minister setting the figure by bald decree, as has been the case in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I have faith that that process is not the same process as we had before. I would hope that it is not a misplaced faith. It is quite a risky business to come in here and say that one has faith in the process that has been laid down before, because we have already seen the lack of information-sharing which occurred on that particular night with regard to the promotion levy. My belief is that it would require quite a cavalier step for the Minister to take no notice whatsoever of that consultation process which is enshrined in the legislation itself. I hope that the Minister will explain, for the edification of the Opposition, exactly how that rate will be set in future. </PARA>
<PARA> For the reasons that I have outlined, I see absolutely no point in taking the risk of disallowing these regulations and hoping with crossed fingers that anything other than 15 per cent can be achieved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the regulations that we have before us, I want to support what my colleagues have said. I want to take issue with Senator Bell's statement that we achieved amendments on the last night we debated the wool legislation. We did not achieve amendments. The Bill says 15 per cent. The Government did a deal with the Australian Democrats and we ended up with the proposal of 12 per cent by regulation, which is before us now. I also want to disagree with him very strongly because I do not believe that if these regulations were disallowed the Government would not come back to this place with revised regulations. It would not be game to put a tax of 15 per cent on the head of the wool industry when, in fact, we do not even require a 12 per cent tax. We probably do not even require a tax of 10 per cent to do the job. It is about time a little economic rationality came to the people who sit on the other side of this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have just seen $800m handed out in the Budget to the better cities program. I am going to work through a few figures here tonight because I think they are important. I am damned furious about what this Government has done to the wool industry. I have put the figures relating to the wool industry before. For a bona fide wool grower with 5,000 sheep, the difference between 12 and 10 per cent is $1,400. To people in a secure place in a secure job, $1,400 may not sound like a large amount but, for people who are operating at a loss, it is a hell of a lot of money; it is an enormous amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA> If one takes the figures a bit further and looks at what is happening to the infrastructure in rural Australia one will see that for 50 such growers the difference is $70,000. For 500 such growers it is $700,000. That is an enormous cash flow through businesses, whether they be in the transport industry or the service industry, in the various country districts. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us recount a few of the predictions that we put forward at that particular time. I still challenge the Government, including Senator McMullan who is chatting away there rather blissfully, to put on the table the figures by which it has come to its conclusions. We have put our figures on the table. They have not been knocked off. I want to remind the Senate of them. We said that at a clean price of 447c, just under 450c, with the sale of assets and the sale from the stockpile of $74m, one could deliver a tax of marginally over 9 per cent. Nobody has knocked those figures off. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to recap a little on what has happened in the wool industry since last year. Last week's price, even with the Russian coup and the disruption that caused to the market, was still sitting at 512c. The market last week stabilised at that when Japanese and western Europe buyers came back into the market, and 87 per cent of the wool was sold. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the Russian coup, the wool market was sitting at about 544c, and that is where it has come back from. It was significantly above and is still significantly above the figures that we worked from. On top of that, looking at the figures for last March, we were talking about 913 million kilograms of production. That was revised to 885 million kilograms of production. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us now look at the latest predictions from the Wool Council of Australia today. I also gather from survey work myself that the prediction now is of the order of 860 million kilograms, not the 885 million kilograms that was being predicted. So there is a logical reason why the Government should move to allow this additional cash flow from a lower tax to move through the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has occurred in the three months to the end of last week in terms of sales from the stockpile. On our figures, we said there would be a requirement to sell $74m from the stockpile during the next 12 months. As of last week, 118,134 bales had been sold, at a value of $76m; so that figure has already been exceeded in three months. Whatever analysis is placed on the position we are at, it is not necessary to continue with this 12 per cent figure. It will have a significant impact on the ability of people to stay in the industry. I can tell the Senate now that there are many people in rural Australia who are absolutely incensed by Mr Kerin's statement, when he was Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, that it looked as though something of the order of 48,000 farmers would have to go. </PARA>
<PARA> If we continue to tax an industry out of business, like this Government is taxing primary producers out of business, that will eventuate. It is not necessary; it shows a lack of concern. People on the other side of the chamber have forgotten the meaning of the word compassion, which has already been raised in the debate today. They have forgotten what the Labor Party is about.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the challenge that now exists in terms of the wool industry and its ability, if it is handled correctly, to address the twin evils of unemployment and bankruptcy. The challenge now, with what has occurred in eastern Europe, is to move into those countries and market our wool and set up structures by which we can start to get sales moving again. I put the question to the Minister at the table, Senator Cook: what is happening now in terms of Russia? What is happening now in terms of the Baltic states? What is happening in terms of Czechoslovakia, Poland or Hungary in regard to the marketing of our wool and getting it back into the factories that have been very important to this country and its wool industry over recent years? What trading arrangements are being looked at?</PARA>
<PARA> I also put the challenge to Senator Cook, as I did to Senator McMullan when he was in here, to spell out quite clearly the basis for staying with the 12 per cent. All economic analysis that we on this side of the chamber, including me and the people who work with me, can put together shows that it is not necessary and that, with what has occurred, less than 10 per cent will be what is required. When we look at those particular figures, we must bear in mind the debt reduction scheme that was put in place by this Government. Even before 30 June, almost the first two years of that requirement had been met. That is another valid reason for easing the tax burden in these initial stages while the adjustment goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final analysis, the level of this tax is not necessary. I do not believe that the Democrats have the courage to support us or that if they did the Government would have the stupidity to try to apply a 15 per cent tax. Nonetheless, I must point out that in the final analysis, when it comes to the next year-which has been raised in this debate tonight-the Government does have the final say about what the tax level will be, despite whatever consultation may go on. The real challenge tonight in terms of the Government's position is to look again; to minimise the burden on the industry; to allow the industry and those people who live in rural Australia and are involved in the industry to maximise their returns so that they can at least get close to breaking even; and to maintain the very necessary infrastructure that has been broken down so dramatically. To do otherwise would indicate to me just how callous the Government is in terms of its attitude to the wool industry and many people in rural Australia, and how it is not prepared to look at this problem we now have in an objective, rational, sensible manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion for the disallowance of certain wool tax regulations. The National Party of Australia took a very strong stand on this issue when it was debated at the end of the last session. We stand committed to the remarks that were made very eloquently at that stage by Senator Tambling on behalf of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only thing that has changed since May is that, if anything, the outlook for wool growers has got much worse. While wool prices at the start of the sales may have risen just marginally, the economic outlook is definitely no brighter. The prospect of drought has increased across much of Australia. Even where rains have fallen, there is still no opportunity for pastures to come away. The price of sheep has not improved in any substantial sense and neither has the value of the wool growing properties. In fact, the value of wool growing properties has fallen quite dramatically in some areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to go over the arguments that the Opposition put forward as to why a 10 per cent tax was the appropriate level. I believe that our arguments and reasons are very well known and, as I said earlier, were very well put by everyone in the debate at the end of last session. If I had to choose just one area in which the Federal Labor Government has abandoned primary industry and let down and disappointed rural Australia it would be in the treatment of wool growers and its handling of the entire wool crisis over the past 12 to 15 months, when uncertainty was introduced into the industry by the lowering of what was going to be the immutable floor price at that stage. The uncertainty was put in by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is now the Treasurer of the country, and then obviously had to be taken away. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government's handling of this issue has been, and still is, a national disgrace. Three years ago the wool industry earned some $6 billion for Australia. Today it is a quite different story. Wool growers' incomes by any ABARE or other standard for the short to medium term are desperate. Indeed, an ABARE farm survey report for 1991 predicted an 85 per cent decline in surplus income, with more than 50 per cent of Australian wool growers having a negative income this year and up to one in three forced into bankruptcy, as Senator Crane has already mentioned. The report suggested an even further decline this financial year, which I suggest vindicates even more the Opposition's stance in wanting to disallow these regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> We still believe that 10 per cent is the preferred tax level. In fact, it is the essential height of tax level that is sustainable and able to be paid. As I said, the Opposition's position of 10 per cent was the only sustainable option that the wool growers could afford to pay. What needs to be remembered is the capacity of these wool growers to pay any tax. Senator Crane has made that very clear with some of the figures that he has put to the Senate over time. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that honourable senators on all sides of this chamber should go out and meet with a few wool growers, especially in the western divisions, just to see how things really are. They would get completely different opinions of what they think is happening and what really is happening. I also suggest that a few people from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy should go out and see how it really is and not just look from the cosy confines of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already witnessed properties from which families have simply walked away. There has been no talking to the banks or calling in agricultural consultants to help with the package. The situation is so desperate that the only hope is to abandon the farms. These are not the Depression years of the 1930s but, basically, for many farmers they may as well be. This Government will stand indicted for what it has done to the rural industries of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Even today we heard in Question Time the admission by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, that charges to commuter airlines such as Hazelton had increased substantially and were a part of the problem of that airline having to cut back substantially in rural areas. Senator Collins was unable to deny that Government imposed charges had forced this airline to give up no less than 14 services to rural areas. </PARA>

<PARA> Last month we had a Budget. It seems a long time ago. There was nothing in it for rural Australia, save an increase of 34 per cent in charges at a time when farmers in all industries are basically on their knees. As Senator Crane, Senator Tambling and Senator Walters said, $800m was allocated to the cities. Apparently, that was the only solution to the problems of Australia that the Labor Party had. But wait a minute-$100m was given in rural assistance over the next few years to the farmers who are going out the back door. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are the policies that will get us back on the road? Where are the policies that will get the rural industries and, indeed, our economy back on track? There are none. Where are the programs that would address the difficulties faced by nearly one million people, especially our young, chronically unemployed? There are no programs, and that is what saddens me. We have programs. We have policies for taxation reform, labour market reform, increasing the efficiency of infrastructure, privatisation, fixing up things in transport and fixing up the waterfront. They are all things that this Government should be doing now. It should not be waiting for us to win the next election and then do them; they should be done now. That would at least help the wool growers and the people of rural Australia a little. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government made a mistake with its legislation in the first place. It set a level that was unaffordable and unsustainable for the wool growers. The Senate provided the Government with a way out and an opportunity to save what little credibility it might have had within the industry. The Government has chosen to be pig-headed about the level of the tax. Tonight the Opposition reaffirms its position for a 10 per cent maximum tax for the wool industry. </PARA>

Those opposite must be saying a prayer of thanks for the good grace of whoever it was that put them into opposition during a time of rural downturn which has been caused principally by international factors. Those opposite must be saying a prayer because it gives them the luxury of never having to make a decision about how to contend with the difficulties but always having the luxury of criticising what is done. Thus they can be pure to their own rural constituencies without having to shoulder the responsibilities of good government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Much of the argument which has been put is based on the thinking, `Thank God we don't have to make the decisions, but we'll as sure as hell give those who do a run for their money and appeal to populist sentiment rather than good governance'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, in the honourable senator's time and in the time of Senator Winston Crane. Much of the criticism here is based on the populist notion that if one simply declines to face the difficulties and argues a more sentimental cause, one is somehow doing a service. One may be doing oneself a service in terms of re-election, but one is not doing oneself a service in terms of facing the difficult, thorny questions associated with managing an industry when world markets have closed and prices have tumbled. They are serious questions which require not populist sentiment but serious answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to wool tax regulations Nos 1 to 5. The 1991-92 wool tax rate was dealt with exhaustively by the Parliament at the end of the last sitting. The arguments in favour of a 10, 12 and 15 per cent tax were canvassed extensively in both Houses at that time. The Opposition has now sought to disallow the regulations for the 12 per cent wool tax for allocating 9 per cent to debt reduction, 2.5 per cent to promotion, and 0.5 per cent to research and development. It should be noted that were the Opposition's motion to be successful, it would raise the wool tax rate to the 15 per cent maximum set in the wool tax Acts. Were the disallowance of the 2.5 per cent allocation for promotion to be successful, the full 15 per cent would still be collected, but none would be allocated for promotion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate cannot amend the tax rate in the regulations. It can only disallow what is there and hope that the Government will put forward new regulations in line with the Senate's views. However, the Government is not obligated to do that; it could persist and put forward regulations in the same terms as the disallowed regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> In moving for disallowance, the Opposition is not presenting new information in this debate. It is arguing from the basis of the information it presented to the Senate in June which was criticised then by both the Government and the Australian Democrats. That information is now more than just a little out of date. Although the Opposition used information based on an average wool price of 475c for 1991-92, the Opposition members expected higher prices. Senator Boswell told us that we were in a rising wool market; Senator Archer stressed this too, as did Senator Chapman. Senator Panizza, who is one of the interjectors here tonight, told us that the wool price in June was 33 per cent higher than that 475c average. Senator Crane-another interjector tonight-used the futures market prices to argue that a forecast price of 475c for 1991-92 was too low. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Opposition's expectations for the market have not materialised. The price at last Friday's close of trading was 512c on the new indicator price, or 489c on the old indicator. In June the Government argued that a lower tax rate meant less income for the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, in particular, and that in order to cover its fixed costs it would have to sell more wool from the stockpile which would bring more wool into the market and depress the price. As it is, the price of wool, not the tax rate, is the determinant of growers' income. Lower prices mean lower grower incomes.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is now advocating lower wool tax on an already soft wool market and is, in effect, seeking to soften the market further. By advocating the lowering of the wool tax payable to the Wool Realisation Commission from 9 per cent-which the Government made effectively 10 per cent by providing a $22.5m grant-to 6 per cent, the Opposition is arguing that the income position of wool growers will be improved by requiring the AWRC to sell another $60m worth of wool. The Opposition will not accept that argument, but it follows inescapably from the course of action that the Opposition has been advocating here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government rejects the disallowance of the 12 per cent total tax rate. The Opposition has argued that the 12 per cent tax rate applies only for 1991-92 and that, therefore, the tax will revert to 15 per cent. The Government has stated repeatedly that it is its intention to lower the wool tax rate by regulation as soon as possible-hopefully, in 1992-93. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) made this quite clear in the House of Representatives the week before last. He said that if the wool tax rate was 15 per cent this year he could guarantee that it would be lower next year. With the tax at 12 per cent he could not guarantee a lower rate, but he said that it was his intention to lower the rate if this was possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's contention that the rate will revert to 15 per cent next year has no support in fact. Moreover, as Senator Bell points out, there is a consultation process laid out in the legislation for the period after 1 July 1992 and the industry will have a say; that is, recommendations for the wool tax rate for research and development and promotion will be considered by annual general meetings of wool growers to be held in and about May next year. Those recommendations will be forwarded to the Minister. As well, recommendations for the wool tax rate for debt reduction will be considered by the Wool Council of Australia and then forwarded to the Minister. The recommendations on the three parts of the wool tax will then be taken into account in the setting of the total wool tax. Therefore, industry will have a full say in the wool tax rate beyond 1 July 1992; it will not revert automatically to 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the matters raised by Senator Walters. In relation to Senator Walters's question regarding the audit of the wool industry authorities by a private auditor, I remind her that the Government accepted Opposition amendments and that the Auditor-General is the auditor for the wool industry's bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Senator Crane raised the issue of what trading arrangements are being looked at for the Soviet Union and eastern European states. Senator Crane may remember that in December 1990 a $500m 240-day revolving credit line was provided to the USSR for the purchase of wool, wheat and meat. Some $420m of that amount has now been taken up; so there is a positive commitment by this Government to penetrate the eastern European market further. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the trade situation in eastern Europe is fluid. At present, the Soviet authorities are very busy restructuring their economy. Nonetheless, this Government has provided that revolving credit line and, as well, it has provided a separate credit facility for Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of those circumstances, I conclude my remarks in this debate by saying that on this occasion I welcome the support, as voiced by Senator Robert Bell, of the Australian Democrats in not voting for the disallowance. I think many of the arguments that he has raised and presented are sound. I have quoted, in particular, one of those in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Opposition should have a good look at itself. If the Opposition is not congratulating itself for being in Opposition and not having to face hard decisions, I wonder how it would face up to hard decisions were it ever to be in government. For those reasons the Government rejects the disallowance of a 12 per cent total tax rate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In bringing the debate on the motion to disallow Wool Tax Regulations Nos 1 to 5 to a close, I point out that once again not one Australian Labor Party senator participated in a substantive way in the debate. We certainly heard the response of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), as is usual in any of the primary industry debates. We always get the Minister's predictable words and the briefs that he has been handed and given. It is very interesting that even on this occasion the Labor Party's one usual voice, Senator West, was again muzzled and is missing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister, in his response, made a number of very interesting points that, of course, do not take account of the changed circumstances in the industry or in economics. The compounding effects of the failed Labor Budget, of course, have produced so many other effects that are deliberately compounding on the industry at this particular time: the primary charges, the interest rates regime, the wholesale sales tax that has been continued, the transport costs that will be passed on through roads, rail and airlines. We heard from Senator Brownhill today on several occasions with regard to the catastrophe of Hazelton Airlines in New South Wales, which vitally affects this industry. There are also the increased household and domestic costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook said that the Opposition had resorted to sentimentality and that it was basking in a luxury of the rural downturn. What a hypocritical load of nonsense! The coalition certainly in no circumstances engineered the recession or caused the unemployment of millions of people around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the Senate that it was the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who said that there would be no child living in poverty. What we now have is a million Australian families living in poverty. What an exchange! How many of those are caught up in the primary industry sectors?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister did not counter the figures that were presented by us throughout this debate this year. Instead, he fudged and fiddled whilst Rome burnt. Whether it is Prime Minister Hawke, Mr Kerin, Mr Crean or Senator Cook-they are still fiddling while more than Rome burns in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The threat that the Government could revert to the 15 per cent tax is nothing short of bully boy tactics that are totally unnecessary. I certainly hope that when the Parliament considers these regulations again, the Government will have better advisers, better representatives and better economists looking over its shoulder than those it has had this year. It certainly is a very sad day today when the Government and the Australian Democrats will not support a much more appropriate 10 per cent wool tax levy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now debating the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. Many Bills going through this place deal with specific matters and some others deal with a wide variety of matters under one particular portfolio. In a sense, we kid ourselves that these Bills can be regarded as one package and called an omnibus Bill, when really such a Bill is an amendment to a whole variety of Bills. That is the case with the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The more substantial amendments that this Bill makes are to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 and the Trade Practices Act 1974. There are less substantive amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933, the Bills of Exchange Act 1909, the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act 1977, the Family Law Act 1975, the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Law Officers Act 1974 and the Statutory Declarations Act 1959. There are also some substantial amendments to the Privacy Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The ASIO Act 1979 is amended by inserting a reference to the Crimes (Hostages) Act 1989 in the definition of politically motivated violence. The amendments also provide for the ACT to be in the same position as the States and the Northern Territory in relation to the performance of functions by ASIO. Other changes are made relating to the inspection of postal articles, requiring the Deputy Director-General of Security or a Deputy Director-General to certify warrants authorising such inspections. This procedure is in line with the procedure for the handling of warrants relating to telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 give the Trade Practices Commission the power to make a charge for supplying a person with material and for permitting a person to attend a prescribed activity. This, I suppose, requires some sort of definition of what a prescribed activity might be in case one's imagination got away with one. One might use the example of a seminar or a workshop arranged by the Commission. Where the Act does not expressly provide for a fee to be charged in relation to a discretionary service, the Commission may charge a fee agreed with the person. The expected revenue from these changes is $33,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Acts Interpretation Act 1901 is amended so that where a law of a State or Territory alters the name of a body or an office a reference in Commonwealth legislation to the body or office by its former name is to be construed as a reference to the body or office by its new name. The amendments to this Act also provide for members of statutory bodies to be able to participate in board meetings by telephone, closed circuit television and other electronic means of communication. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that these remarks, or perhaps it is something else, have caused some mirth. I wonder whether what has caused the mirth is the fact that in South Australia the State Bank, which is in such trouble, managed by a quick ring-around by phone to lend hundreds of thousands of dollars over the weekend. I certainly hope that these amendments, allowing statutory bodies to participate in board meetings by phone, do not result in such disastrous consequences for those bodies as this ring-around-loosely described as a form of meeting over the phone-did for the State Bank and, consequently, for taxpayers of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As it turns out, the investment of that bank was a very bad one, about which there have been unkind allegations-I do not know whether or not they are unkind-that one of the members of the board had some interest. Questions have been raised as to the distance that that board member kept from that entire matter. I mention that not only because of your mirth, Madam Acting Deputy President, but also because I think that example raises a serious question that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) might like to respond to about the risks of having board meetings by phone. I look forward to his reply in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 are similar in nature. They delete the provision which is currently present in each of these Acts that the AAT, the Family Court and the Federal Court must seek the approval of the Attorney-General to expend appropriated funds. These bodies operate under the Department of Finance ledger system, whereby the funds appropriated are controlled and released by the Department of Finance in accordance with validated claims submitted by each agency. These provisions are therefore unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the ACT Supreme Court Act 1933 provide for the court to direct that the master and the registrar are to have interchangeable powers in relation to the winding up of a company. Currently under the Bills of Exchange Act 1909 there are three days of grace added to the date on which a bill that is not payable on demand falls due. This amendment removes that provision which is not in line with general international practice. Such bills will become payable on the last day of the time of payment fixed by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act 1977 abolish the National Legal Aid Representative Council, and increase the membership of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Council from seven to eight. These amendments are expected to achieve savings of some $15,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Law Officers Act 1964 are designed to ensure that any person who has served as a Solicitor-General for an aggregate of seven years and who ceases to hold that office will be entitled to a pro rata pension, except if that person is removed from office for misbehaviour. Pursuant to amendments in 1988 such a pension is payable only to a Solicitor-General who has served at least seven years and who has not been reappointed at the end of his or her term of office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition had significant concerns about this matter, which was debated at some length in the other place. The shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peacock, was satisfied by the explanation made during the debate in the other place on this Bill that the intention of the amendment is to make it clear that a Solicitor-General who is removed from office owing to disability or following bankruptcy is entitled to a pro rata pension. The amendment will bring the pension arrangements of a Solicitor-General into line with those of other officers of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), who shares with me and others a position on the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority, during the debate in the other place explained this amendment as necessary because in 1988, when of course the Hawke Labor Government was in office, these amendments were `stuffed up'. In view of the rate at which legislation is shoved through both the lower House and on occasion this place, it is no surprise that mistakes are made. Inadequate time is given to consider the consequences of various pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The final amendments in the schedule to the Bill relate to the Statutory Declarations Act 1959. They simplify the processes for witnessing statutory declarations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also introduced a series of amendments to the Privacy Amendment Act by way of amendments to this Bill. These new amendments relate to credit reference reporting, which was the subject of the Privacy Amendment Act 1990. That Act was first introduced more than two years ago and still has not come into operation. It was to come into operation upon the expiry of nine months after the date of royal assent, which was 24 December 1990. That would have made the commencement date 24 September 1991, a little less than one month from now. Under these latest amendments the commencement date will be delayed until 25 February 1992. These amendments were made available to the Opposition in the other place at the last minute. The shadow Minister for corporate and consumer affairs, Mr Costello, was given a somewhat hurried briefing on these amendments, and the Bill was dealt with in the House of Representatives in the evening following an afternoon briefing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth mentioning that the Opposition raised many serious concerns in relation to what is now the Privacy Act 1990, and moved more than 50 amendments. The concerns that we expressed at the time included, among others, the exclusion of publicly available information from the permitted contents of a credit file; the distinction between commercial and consumer credit; and the exclusion of general insurers, real estate agents, mercantile agents, purchasers in debt securitisation transactions and trading organisations from access to credit information files. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, this latest group of Government amendments contains provisions relating to the definition of credit reporting business; agents of credit providers; rights of access to credit information files and credit reports which may be exercised by a person with written authorisation from the individual concerned; telephone applications for commercial credit; the use of credit reports for internal management purposes by the credit provider; telephone applications for credit; advice of a credit provider to joint applicants for credit about a refusal of a credit application; and a range of circumstances in which disclosure of personal information by a credit provider will be permitted, including provisions relating to oral consent, guarantors, mortgage insurers, dispute settling bodies such as the banking industry ombudsman, State and Territory authorities which provide mortgage credit, merchants who provide for payment by credit card or electronic transfer of funds, persons who take on the assignment or discharge of a debt; and last, but not least, limits on use or disclosure by mortgage insurers or trade insurers of personal information contained in credit reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes these latest amendments to the credit reporting legislation. We maintained at the time that the legislation was seriously flawed, that it was being rushed through, and that the proposal of such a large number of amendments by the Government before the Act even comes into operation would tend to confirm this view. You would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, from your long service on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee-I understand that you are the longest serving member on that Committee- of the concern of that Committee for those people in Australia who are affected by our laws and who are expected to follow them. People are expected to know what the law is. You will also know of the queries raised by that Committee when legislation which has been operative for only a limited time is amended. Here we have a Bill which has not even come into operation but which is being amended. Indeed, the Opposition said at the time that the legislation contained serious flaws and needed further consideration. That has been shown to be the case by the Government's introducing amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> We particularly welcome the amendments which water down the definition of credit reporting business, and those which allow for the normal commercial practice of telephone applications for loans to continue without insisting on having the applicant's consent in writing at that stage to the obtaining of a credit report. </PARA>
<PARA> We also particularly welcome the large number of additions to the circumstances in which credit providers may disclose personal information contained in credit reports, as we understand that these amendments pick up concerns expressed by the credit and credit reporting industries about the workability of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noted that the Privacy Commissioner is of the view that these amendments do not change the protections given to individuals by the original legislation. I have a copy of a letter from the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor, to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). One comment made by the Privacy Commissioner in the third paragraph of his letter is:</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments address reasonable consumer needs or industry concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>Well and good; I am pleased he thinks that. What concerns me is why were not these reasonable consumer needs or industry concerns addressed at the time when the legislation was put together? It is not as if everyone was saying, `Yes, this is the right way to go'. It is not as if the Government was not warned that consumers and the industry had some concerns that needed further addressing. The situation is quite simply that, despite the warnings, the Government decided to proceed. I do not want to labour that point any more, but it does bear repeating twice. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Opposition is not opposing this Bill. The majority of the amendments it makes are technical and non-controversial. I reiterate our support for the amendments to the Privacy Amendment Act as they go some way towards improving this basically flawed piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. As Senator Vanstone said, this is an omnibus Bill largely making changes of a minor policy nature and administrative changes to the legislation. Perhaps the matter that has most substance, as is indicated by the Government's amendment, is the sections that deal with privacy matters-in particular, the credit reporting services and the procedures for credit providers. Senator Powell, who has dealt with privacy legislation in the past, will deal with those sections and I will address myself briefly to the other provisions of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said before, most of the amendments are fairly self-evident and necessary. For instance, I note the removal of the requirement for the Attorney-General to approve the estimates of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia. This is now not necessary since the funds appropriated are controlled and released by the Department of Finance in accordance with fairly strict procedures. In expressing approval for lifting this particular workload from the Attorney-General, I express the hope that this may speed up necessary amendments to the National Crime Authority legislation which I, and I am sure other members of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, eagerly await. The secrecy provisions in that legislation clearly need considerable amendment and the delay is now getting beyond the stage where we can accept it with equanimity. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to some of the other provisions. It is quite clear that the amendments to permit interchangeability between the master and registrar of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court during the course of the winding-up of a company are essentially machinery provisions, as are the provisions that refer to the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act. There are other provisions which may have a little more substance. I refer to the minor changes to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979 which are designed to place the Australian Capital Territory on the same basis as a State. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the amendment to the Bills of Exchange Act to remove the provisions for adding an extra three days-called days of grace-to the maturity date of a bill of exchange that is not payable on demand, one wonders why that provision was ever enforced before. I also note amendments to section 64 of the Judiciary Act to prevent the application to the Commonwealth and the States in civil suits of laws to which the Commonwealth and the States are not themselves subject. Again, I would have thought that that is essentially a clarification provision. There are other amendments to the Statutory Declarations Act 1959, the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the Law Officers Act 1964. I shall not detain the Senate by making detailed references to those; suffice it to say, that the Australian Democrats support this Bill in its unamended form. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Spindler has mentioned, the Government amendments in this legislation also include amendments to privacy legislation in relation to the credit reporting industry. As honourable senators will recall, last year-somewhat belatedly, in the view of the Australian Democrats-the Government introduced legislation extending the operation of the Privacy Act to the credit reporting industry. During the passage of the Privacy Act in 1988 the Democrats had contended that it should apply to the private sector, but we were unable to persuade either the Government or the Opposition to support this view at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even after the introduction of last year's amendments with relation to the credit reporting industry, we played a constructive role in amending and improving the legislation and in striking what we saw as an appropriate balance between the protection of individual privacy and legitimate industry concerns about its commercial activities. After extensive industry consultations and protracted committee discussions, I believe that this chamber passed a balanced and effective piece of legislation. For all that, it is still possible that minor amendments become obvious even after legislation is passed. In this case, we have the context of the development of the Privacy Commissioner's code of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> The relatively technical amendments that we have before us tonight are aimed at accommodating industry concerns that certain legitimate industry practices would constitute technical breaches of the legislation if left unamended. Most significantly, the amendments deal with the regulation of access to credit histories by the agents of credit providers or for internal management purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Commissioner noted in the lead-up to these amendments, it is important that they be carefully drafted so as to minimise the possibility of irresponsible credit providers using them to avoid the strictness of the controls imposed by the Act. Proposed new section 9C, referring to agents, and proposed new paragraph 9F(a), referring to internal management, are the important provisions in relation to the access issue. Proposed new section 9C amends section 11B of the principal Act by providing that an agent of the credit provider can be taken to be another credit provider if the agent is performing a task that is a necessary step either in processing an application for a loan or in management of a loan. This is to avoid the risk of credit providers and their agents committing technical breaches of the principal Act when they are acting properly and lawfully in accordance with accepted commercial practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Commissioner has examined the clause. He considers that the words linking agency use with `a task that is necessary in processing an application for or in the arrangement of' a loan are sufficiently specific to prevent abuse. Similarly, new paragraph 9F(a) amends the legislation in relation to the permitted use of information for internal management purposes. The use of information is subject to the express qualification that the internal management purposes must be directly related to the provision of loans or the management of credit-such as occurs in credit scoring, for example. Once again, the Privacy Commissioner has looked at this matter and considers that the clause is sufficiently specific to prevent abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I note that the securitisation industry has raised some concerns in relation to these amendments. That industry does not believe that its problems have been solved by the above amendments. I believe that these concerns, as they have been expressed, should be borne in mind as the Parliament continues, as it must and will, to monitor the operation of this legislation. I would draw attention to the Privacy Commissioner's professed view that reasonable industry concerns and consumer needs have been met by the amendments that are before us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> On balance, then, the Australian Democrats welcome these amendments as part of the ongoing parliamentary review of this important piece of legislation-the Privacy Act. Subject to this being confirmed in practice, we share the Privacy Commissioner's view that these amendments do not change the protections originally given to individuals in any way which could reasonably be regarded as threatening individual privacy. If the practice proves otherwise, the Australian Democrats will be the first to move to ensure that the protection of individual privacy is maintained and strengthened. We welcome these particular amendments as part of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank members of the Opposition, Senator Vanstone in particular, and the Australian Democrats, especially Senator Spindler and Senator Powell, who spoke in relation to the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, indicating their support for the speedy passage of its provisions. As was pointed out by the senators who spoke, this Bill deals largely with matters of some technicality and of a generally uncontroversial nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of which Senator Vanstone made some mention is typical of that more technical-type amendment. I would like to deal with the question that Senator Vanstone raised of the amendment which inserts a new section 33b into the Acts Interpretation Act. The view of the Attorney-General's Department was that, unless expressly authorised by the relevant Act, a board member of a statutory authority had to be physically present at a meeting for participation in the meeting to be valid participation. </PARA>
<PARA> In a technological age, as we all know and have practised at various times from our own offices, it is possible to participate at meetings by way of telephone, closed circuit television, et cetera. Indeed, this Parliament has already passed various Acts making provision for this form of participation, for example section 68 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act of 1989. This provides a means of enabling a more convenient meeting to take place, particularly in a case where several members of national body almost invariably have to travel great distances from various parts of the Commonwealth to participate in a meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the norm no doubt will be that a meeting will be conducted around a table with all members able to interact at a personal level, the possibility is there for telephonic hook-ups and so on. That possibility has been recognised in other statutes. Specifically, the legislation that we are dealing with will enable that provision, that permission, that empowering, to be available for all statutory bodies without the need to amend all the individual Acts. Of course, that is the purpose of the Acts Interpretation Act type of amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the more interesting amendments are those to do with the privacy legislation. I thank those honourable senators who have spoken with a degree of understanding about what did occur. The process that the Senate undertook, particularly through its committee system, in relation to dealing with dozens of Government, Opposition and Democrats amendments to the original Bill, was a testimony to the way in which the committee system can operate. I believe that it was the initial test of the committee system and it proved to be extremely efficacious. At the end of the process we had a Bill which was workable and satisfactory in terms of policy from the Government's point of view. I do acknowledge that the Opposition thought that a different structure altogether ought to be adopted which would include real estate agents and insurance agents as persons who would be entitled to access to the credit reports of a person who had borrowed finance from a particular organisation to undertake the purchase of some goods or service. </PARA>
<PARA> Putting that major difference to one side, I think it was agreed that that process had led to the emergence of a very satisfactory outcome. We do live in a credit-ridden society, a society where access to funds through borrowing is absolutely essential to ordinary existence. Great privacy concerns have been aroused and misgivings have been expressed constantly in the community about the extent to which persons who have nothing to do with the initial borrower, credit provider or lender can have access to credit files which may not even be accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill attempted to ensure that the credit reports held by lenders or credit reference associations were absolutely accurate and up to date in their information and that they were only made available to credit providers in very specifically delineated circumstances. The Bill emerged and it was passed by the Senate. Then the consultation process was undertaken, as it needed to be, with Kevin O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner at the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. His consultation with the finance industry and with other interested groups led to the recognition that certain matters might be best clarified by way of amendment in order to ensure that there was absolutely no nervousness in the commercial community about the impact of certain provisions in the Privacy Act. Also, certain technical matters needed to be adjusted and remedies were required to deal with matters of concern. But these were matters that were not apparent at the time of the passage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> On the whole, the amendments that are incorporated in this legislation are of a technical or clarifying kind. Indeed, the Privacy Commissioner wrote to me on 12 August 1991 in relation to these proposed amendments, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>They do not, in my view, change the protections given to individuals by the original legislation in any way which could reasonably be regarded as threatening individual privacy. The amendments seek to recognise a range of industry practices or consumer concerns which have come to notice during consultation on the Code of Conduct. The amendments address these issues in reasonably precise terms. </PARA>
<PARA>That short paragraph contained in the letter from Kevin O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner, indicates why this chamber ought to be very ready to give its assent to the passage of these amending provisions. They do not change the basic protections given to individuals, so essential in this credit-ridden society, in relation to credit reports that may be held about them by credit providers or credit reference associations. The need for privacy of records which ought to be accurate is a matter of great concern to all in this community, based as it is on such a need for credit. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to let the Senate know the reason for the decision to delay the effective operation of the majority of the amendments to the Privacy Act until 24 February next year. I was contacted by various members of the finance industry, primarily Alan Cullen, the executive director of the Australian Bankers Association. He had several conversations with me which he reduced to writing. He indicated to me that he thought that the consultative process had been extremely constructive but had nevertheless taken a considerable amount of time. </PARA>
<PARA> He indicated that the final emergence of the need for some clarifying and technical amendments and the final form of the code of conduct would apply right up to the proposed coming into operation of the Act on 24 September. Therefore, members of the finance industry and the Credit Reference Association and borrowers would not have sufficient time to accommodate themselves to the changes that might be brought about by the passage of amendments or by the finalisation of the code of conduct. For that reason alone, a delay would seem to be appropriate. Irrespective of the question of amendments or the late finalisation of the code of conduct, Mr Cullen informed me:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the fact that review and development of the systems has been underway, as noted above there are final requirements under the Code to be settled and the Code is then subject to the Parliamentary process. The impact on credit assessment practices and systems, especially where on-line computer links to the Credit Reference Association of Australia and automated credit assessment systems have been undertaken, requires development and testing of both the financial institutions systems and that of CRAA. </PARA>
<PARA>Because those computer changes were so extensive, it would obviously take several months for them to be brought into operation. Therefore, I was very happy to accede to the request for a delay in bringing into operational effect the provisions of this particular piece of legislation, apart from those provisions dealing with the entitlement of a person to have access to his or her credit report to ensure that it is an accurate and up-to-date report. That will come into effect immediately, but the other parts of the amendment Bill will be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank those honourable senators who have spoken. I believe that the Senate, particularly in dealing with the privacy Act amendments, has acted in a way which is consistent with policy, yet very sensitive to the legitimate needs of the finance industry to the world of trade and commerce and to the needs of borrowers in this society so dependent on credit. The other amendments are mainly technical, as has been enunciated by Senator Vanstone. I believe that the Senate ought also to pass those amendments as speedily as possible. I commend the second reading to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill 1991 gives effect to changes announced in the 1990 Budget which were designed to restructure income support for the sick and the disabled. The Government, by that announcement more than 12 months ago, conceded that for many years the basis for and the operation of invalid pensions and sickness benefits have not been satisfactory. Accordingly, the invalid pension will be replaced by a disability support pension and the sickness benefit by a sickness allowance. The sheltered employment allowance will be abolished; the rehabilitation and incentive allowance is being phased out; and the mobility allowance will be increased from $22 to $40 per fortnight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition has a number of concerns about the nature and extent of these changes, although ultimately we will not be opposing the Bill. I should say at the outset that the change in name from invalid pension to disability support pension tells us quite a lot, because if one goes back to the original qualifications for an invalid pension they were meant to be very tough. In order to qualify for an invalid pension, a person was required to have a permanent incapacity-defined as 85 per cent-of which at least one-half had to be due to physical, mental or psychological impairment. Over the years that very tight standard has been gradually whittled down so that in practice invalid pensions have been granted to persons with impairment levels as low as 15 per cent, leading to an extraordinary blow-out in the numbers of those receiving the invalid pension as a pensioner, a wife or a carer. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the concessions of failure and despite the change of name, the future will probably demonstrate that there has been an even greater weakening of the provisions. Instead of the original concept of effectively total and permanent disablement, we now have a situation where a person can qualify for and continue to receive indefinitely a disability support pension with a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of as little as 20 per cent as long as that person has a continuing inability to work for at least two years. A time frame of that duration is certainly quite inconsistent with the original concept of total and permanent disability. The extent of the impairment similarly indicates that this is far from what the original pension was intended to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, we welcome the various initiatives in the Bill which are aimed at providing additional support for disabled people. I have already mentioned the raising of the mobility allowance. The extension of health care cards to child disability allowees and the availability of a $200 employment entry payment to people who leave the disability support pension to take on full time work are all supported. These targeted measures make much more sense than simply across-the-board adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> We also support some of the tightening up measures, such as restricting the portability of the disability support pension and the removal of non-medical factors from the pension eligibility criteria. Paying the invalid pension on the basis of socio-economic factors and impairment has led to what can only be described as massive rorting of the pension, leaving little in the government coffers to assist those who are seriously disabled. Since bringing in this Bill to the Parliament, the Government has drawn up more than 100 amendments-on the latest count I think it is of the order of 116-and to a great extent the amendments have alleviated the concerns expressed by many of the interest groups who represent people with disabilities so ably. Nonetheless, the amendments themselves are testimony to the abject failure of the Government to consult with these interest groups. In particular, in the face of the statement made by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) that he had engaged in very extensive consultations, these amendments just make a mockery of his definition of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Government's decisions is to remove the penalties clause from the Bill. Perhaps we can deal with this more in the committee stage, but again it seems a trifle incongruous that, on the one hand, a person on the pension is required to undertake training and rehabilitation programs but, on the other, if he or she chooses not to cooperate, there is currently no penalty for refusing to do so. In a sense, that seems to be the worst of all possible worlds. On the one hand, the Government is signalling that it wants to ensure that people are not simply left to languish and where they do have a capacity to undertake those additional programs they ought to be required to do so but, on the other, in not following through with a penalty provision, the Government clearly makes a mockery of that good intention. </PARA>
<PARA> In so far as the Bill was supposed to get off disability payments people who should never have been there in the first place, the Bill is a major disappointment-a manifest refusal to bite the bullet. Despite its many changes, the disability payments regime proposed here will still leave Australia with one of the most generous schemes of its kind anywhere in the Western world. Many countries pay disability payments on a partial basis-a part payment to match a part disability-while most link payment levels and the duration of payment to past contributions to cover such contingencies. Some countries still recognise only a total incapacity to work and pay a benefit only on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In France a disability payment is made available only where the individual experiences a two-thirds loss of earning capacity. This compares with the substantially more generous system proposed in this Bill whereby a person may become eligible for pension if unable to work at award wages or more for at least 30 hours a week. It is interesting to note also that in the Netherlands before a disability payment is made a labour or occupational specialist visits the disability payment applicant's employer or former employer in order to make a better informed determination as to whether the applicant is able to work. Thus the Netherlands imposes this extra eligibility test on its applicants, something that the current Australian regime does not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill's restructuring of the regime of income support for those people who are temporarily incapable of work due to injury or illness is largely supported by the coalition. The problems with the sickness benefit have in part mirrored the problems with the invalid pension. The numbers of sickness beneficiaries have exploded over recent years. The increase in the number of payments since 1971 has been in the order of 660 per cent. Not only this, but the average duration of time spent on the benefit has risen markedly. For a benefit that was supposed to have been temporary, it is ironic to see significant numbers of people who have now been on the benefit for three or more years. During May 1990 the average time spent on the benefit for all sickness beneficiaries was more than one year; in fact, 56 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> This felony has been compounded by the Government's past lack of resolve in reviewing benefit entitlements. For example, during 1989-90 just 6,500 sickness beneficiaries were reviewed by Commonwealth medical officers out of a total client population of almost 80,000. I note the Government's decision to introduce an amendment to reduce the maximum period of time that can be spent on the new sickness allowance from two, maybe three years, to one, maybe two years. But even then there are some additional extensions that can operate to have the payment made for up to 3 1/2 years. To a certain extent it is heartening to note that amendments moved by the coalition in the lower House have at least evoked some support from the Government in tightening the duration to some extent. </PARA>
<PARA> The invalid pension scheme was first introduced on 15 December 1910. At that time the requirement was that a claimant be permanently incapacitated for work. Over time there has been both a de jure and a de facto whittling away of the strict eligibility criterion which has led to an explosion of the invalid pension numbers in recent years. This explosion is one of the great welfare scandals. Since 1983 the number of invalid pensioners has expanded by 52 per cent, way ahead of the increase in the general population of some 11 per cent. To emphasise this point I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a graph demonstrating the explosion of numbers of people on the invalid pension. </PARA>

I have had complaints from doctors in three different States who have all reported to me along identical lines that they have had patients come to them and say that they have gone to the local regional office of the Department of Social Security seeking unemployment benefit only to be told that they would be much better off going around the corner to see the doctor and obtaining a certificate entitling them to sickness benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> In one instance, a doctor in a country town told me that he had rung the regional office when this first happened and had rung again when it continued to happen, all to no avail. He finally sent me a copy of the letter which he had sent off to the Minister. I assume that, again, nothing has happened in that regard. One would not suggest a giant conspiracy theory that the Government is somehow requiring regional offices of the Department of Social Security to try to alleviate the unemployment queues in this way, but the fact remains that they have been made aware that this practice operates on, presumably, a sporadic basis, yet have chosen to do little about it. It has to be a scandal because not only is it totally inconsistent with the notion of invalidity but also it serves no useful purpose; indeed, it simply encourages people to abuse the system, to become dependent when they do not want to be. When they are genuinely interested in finding work they are really being told that it is quite a simple matter to have themselves classified as not only incapable of work but also, to a significant extent, either sick or disabled. That is the sign of a sick society rather than a sick patient. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of people who joined the invalid pension ranks during January this year alone was 802. By April, the monthly figure of new entrants was 1,222. By June it had blown out to 2,516. None of these numbers can be explained by a deterioration in the economic climate. Bad and all as that is, it certainly has very little to do with any sudden deterioration in the health of the population. Clearly, it is a function of a more generous application of the rules by departmental officers. I think that highlights one of the great problems in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government's indifference to people with serious disabilities is nowhere better evidenced than by its attitude to disabled persons sheltered workshops. By 30 June 1992 these workshops will be closed regardless of their excellence and the demand for them, leaving many disabled persons who have found employment and the self-respect that comes from being gainfully employed in the workshops to compete in the open labour market with the almost one million able-bodied unemployed Australians for whom, indeed, jobs are very hard to get. Not only this but at the same time that it is forcing the seriously physically and mentally impaired onto the open market the Government has not even bothered to earmark any significant number of places in labour market programs for the disabled. Thus not only will disabled people have to compete on the open market for jobs with other people who are not impaired, but now they will also have to compete with the able-bodied for places in training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Reform of the income support system for people with disabilities is long overdue. As I have just indicated, the explosion in numbers has been due not only to sloppy legislation and its interpretation but also to a far from zealous application and enforcement of the eligibility criteria. A combination of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal taking increasingly generous views of what constitutes incapacity to work and general confusion within the Department about how to implement invalid pension legislation has led to the pension being granted on near negligible medical impairment grounds. In fact, over the period 1988-90, 7,302 people were granted the invalid pension, even though their assessed medical impairment ratings were put at 20 per cent or less. Technically, it is possible to claim the invalid pension with an assessed impairment as low as 5 per cent making, of course, a mockery of the current definition in the social security legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been assisted by taking into account prospective claimants' education, age, poor English skills and other factors connected with labour market disadvantage-all matters that are, indeed, quite relevant to determining the degree of difficulty which a person might experience in obtaining work on the open market. Clearly, it is a basis for entitlement to what used to be the unemployment benefit. But by no stretch of the imagination can those factors aggravate one's physical, mental or psychological condition. To no extent ought they to affect the application of the eligibility criteria for invalid pensions or sickness benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> So the confusion about what constitutes incapacity for work has also led to many costly appeals to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the AAT. During 1989-90 this led to 1,264 appeals to the SSAT alone over decisions regarding incapacity for work. Michael Horsburgh, a deputy member of the SSAT, has publicly stated that when determining a claimant's eligibility for the invalid pension SSAT members tend to subjectively decide whether they feel the individual ought to get the pension and then to attach an incapacity rating on that basis rather than, of course, the other way around as specified by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government were serious about making the disability support pension the preserve of the genuinely disabled, allowing for more targeted and specific assistance, it would take real steps to remove from the invalid pension the many thousands who are not seriously disabled and place them on a more appropriate work-tested income support payment basis. As the proposed regime currently stands, the Department estimates that some 2 per cent of invalid pensioners who received the pension on or before 21 August 1990 will have medical reviews scheduled and therefore will have their eligibility reviewed within the year after the introduction of the new regime. This is far from good enough. It will be necessary, but not sufficient, to have an assessed impairment rating of at least 20 per cent under the new impairment tables. The use of these tables is far from perfect and the Government has undertaken to monitor their performance. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact remains that, once again, the most serious question of all has not been addressed. What we will find is two streams of recipients. There will be those who got the invalid pension on the easy basis-those for whom a whole range of socioeconomic factors was sufficient to entitle them to a pension. Those people will, in the main, continue to receive that pension indefinitely. Alongside them will be the persons who happened to apply after a certain date and who will suddenly be exposed to a whole range of other criteria. That is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no good reason for not reviewing the conditions and continuing entitlement of those who have been on the invalid pension for many years. Indeed, the individuals themselves are often being done a disservice. If they are capable of getting back into the work force, exercising their capability for work, even to a moderate extent on a part time basis, they would be much better served than to be left languishing as second-class citizens in the way that this legislation proposes. It is quite clear that we will effectively have a 20 per cent impairment level being necessary and sufficient and that, as I predict, in due course, we will find that the Bill will actually loosen the eligibility criteria and merely formalise the de facto arrangements that have been operating in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be keeping a very watchful eye on how the system operates. If it is found to be inadequate we will take measures on coming to government to ensure a genuine tightening of the system. In either case, we will sequentially and regularly review all disability support pensioners who are not manifestly impaired in order to redetermine and reassess their eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as questioning the 20 per cent level, we are also somewhat taken aback at the degree of inactivity when it comes to what purports to be an active employment strategy for those with mild impairments and those who will be determined to be labour-market ready. In introducing the Bill, the Government is acknowledging something that everyone else has known for years: there are many people who have been on the invalid pension and who are not significantly impaired, let alone disabled. It therefore seems extraordinary that those disability support pensioners who successfully complete training and rehabilitation programs and are assessed as labour-market ready will be placed back on the pension if they cannot find work. This seems to be a significant departure from that which was originally intended. </PARA>
<PARA> A working document on restructuring disability payments obtained from DEET last year shows that the Government was considering the introduction of an activity-tested short term disability payment which was intended for `those with a temporary or permanent low-level disability and who have the capacity for . . . or are now capable of full-time work in open employment'. Its receipt was to be contingent upon undertaking training and Job Search. Now it seems that such people who do not find work will be allowed to slip back onto the pension without a requirement to even search for work. The Government estimates that some 12,000 pensioners annually will be selected for training and rehabilitation. Of these, 20 per cent are expected to find full time work, 30 per cent part time work and the rest-some 6,000 people who have been assessed as capable of work-will simply slip back onto the disability support pension. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the concerns about the Bill which have been indicated to me by various groups appear to have been addressed in the multitude of amendments. Once again, I can only say that the fact that this Bill went before the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and still resulted in in excess of 100 amendments is very powerful testimony either to the failure of the Government and the Minister to consult with all the relative groups and organisations before the Bill was introduced or sheer incompetence in not being able to draft the Bill despite the fact that we have been on notice about it since August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now briefly like to indicate what will be part of our agenda for real reform in the disability payments area on coming to government. First, we will be earmarking places in government training schemes for those with impairments who have not made the transition to work but wish to do so. In fact, the funds set aside for these people will be significantly increased and the types of programs offered will be enhanced. We will not permit the spectre of the disabled competing against the more able-bodied for places in such programs. Furthermore, we will be targeting the disability support pension far better. Those whose impairment is not significant will not be permitted to remain on the pension. This was what the Government set out to do but what it has miserably failed to do. </PARA>
<PARA> We are convinced that there are significant savings which can be derived from an effective eligibility criterion and from effective enforcement of the tests that ought to be in place without jeopardising any pensioner who is seriously, let alone manifestly, disabled. Whilst we are confident that significant savings can be achieved, these will come from targeting those who have been placed on the pension by the Government for socioeconomic reasons and not just those who have come on the pension since August last year. These people will be assisted back to work and, as a result, will have access to higher incomes, higher living standards and real career prospects. Those whose disabilities mean that they could not reasonably be expected to make the transition to work will be provided with more, rather than less, support by the next coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me simply say that the changes in the current Bill are a political response to a system which is widely perceived to be out of control. Despite the fact that one of the greatest areas of need in terms of reform relates to those persons who are already on the invalid pension, virtually nothing is to be done to address that problem. As a result, we are seeing what will probably turn out to be largely cosmetic changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not tightened up on monitoring and reassessment. Indeed, in deciding whether or not payments ought to continue, there will not be first recourse to Commonwealth Medical Officers but, rather, there will be reliance continued to be placed on certificates provided by an applicant's general practitioner. That, I would have thought, was simply an invitation to people to get onto the benefit much more readily and unnecessarily. As a result, it is quite clear that the Government is not serious in its monitoring and assessment of these schemes, let alone in raising the eligibility high-jump bar in a way that most other countries have long ago recognised needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> In many instances we will find persons receiving these payments as proxies for Job Search allowance and Newstart and there will not be the financial capacity to properly address the needs of those who are at the hard end of disability and who are very much in need of continuing government support. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment essentially condemns the Government in terms that I have already addressed for not dealing with those who are already recipients and it expresses concern at the Government's totally inadequate consultation with those persons who would have been very well placed to give the Government advice if it had sought to learn from that. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) condemns the Government for failing to extend the proposed reforms to Australia's current unacceptably large invalid pensioner population, with the inevitable result that there will be two classes of pensioners, poor targeting and a reduced capacity to assist the most disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) expresses its concerns at the Government's totally inadequate consultation with medical practitioners, health professionals, welfare groups and representatives of people with disabilities and their carers, resulting in serious uncertainties about the reliability and validity of the proposed Impairment Tables as well as over 100 proposed amendments since the bill was guillotined through the House of Representatives.''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin my remarks tonight by referring to Hansard of 19 June 1991 and reading some comments made by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, at that time. I must add that this was the date when the Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill 1991 was supposed to have gone through this place, having been guillotined through the House of Representatives. It was included in a package of three Bills that were supposed to be passed at that time. Senator Richardson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>For all those like Senator Lees who think that in some way getting the disability Bill referred to a committee will give those affected time to consider it, I should say that I have been with officers of the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled this afternoon. They are keen to see this legislation passed and implemented. The disability community itself has given a great deal of support to this Bill and takes a different view from that of the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS). I would have thought that if we are going to look at who among community groups is actually representing the disabled, we cannot go past their own organisations. They are, by and large, in support of this package. I know that there are those in the Australian Democrats and those in ACOSS who have an absolute view that giving some of these people the opportunity to work is not a good thing. I am not in accord with Senator Lees's views on this and, I hasten to point out, neither are the organisations which represent the disabled. They welcome this package and they reiterated that to me today.</PARA>
<PARA>Having read that, I must ask: who did the Minister really consult, apart from the one group mentioned, and what exactly was he talking about with those groups?</PARA>
<PARA> As we passed through the committee stage it became very evident that this Bill was far from perfect. Indeed, as Senator Alston has already mentioned, we now have well over 100 amendments. If the Government did not consult with key groups such as the Australian Council of Alcohol and Other Drug Associations and the Australian National Association for Mental Health, why not? Did not the Government recognise these groups as key groups in this area? I understand that the Minister has certainly been talking to these groups in general terms about general disability issues and about areas that obviously do need some reform, but it seems that at no stage was this Bill on the table. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the Australian Democrats who pushed for this legislation to be delayed and sent off to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. Part of the reason for doing so was our experience with the Newstart legislation. We were determined not to let this Bill also be pushed quickly through the Senate. We were convinced at that stage, after only a brief look at the Bill, that the Government had failed to consult with disabled people, their families and the various disability organisations that represent them. If we look at the amendments before us now, we can see that they bear out the lack of consultation with the key groups who were very concerned-and, indeed, are still concerned-that this legislation was not going to be in any way for the long term benefit of the majority of people that they are representing. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess that some comments could be made with regard to how much time the Department of Social Security actually spent with Senator Richardson going through some of these proposals in the Bill. Basically, the Minister came into this chamber and presented a piece of legislation which would have had serious detrimental effects on the lives of thousands of disabled and sick Australians. Indeed, we now still have before us tonight a Bill that is by no means perfect and will disadvantage the very people it is supposed to be assisting. </PARA>
<PARA> Disabled groups are asking a number of questions as to why they were not more involved in the lead-up to this legislation, and why the majority of these groups did not even see the legislation until it was passed through the House of Representatives and we had posted it out to them. I will run through the list of groups that made submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. These groups said very clearly to the Committee that they had certainly not been consulted about the detail of the legislation. They had not seen the Bill at the time that the Government-if, indeed, it did-discussed any disability issues with them. At the time that this legislation was supposed to be being discussed, the actual Bill was not before them. They also said very clearly, in varying degrees, that they were not happy with what was in it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just run through those groups that made submissions. They were the Australian Council of Alcohol and Other Drug Associations; Schizophrenia Fellowship of Australia; Australian Council of Social Service; Australian National Association for Mental Health; the Welfare Rights Centre; Disabled Peoples International; Disability Resource Centre; Office of the Public Advocate; Disability Employment Action Centre; Villamanta Legal Service; Victorian Trades Hall Council; Alliance for the Mentally Ill; Women's Information and Referral Exchange; St Kilda Community Health Centre; and ACROD, which I do acknowledge had had some contact with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, I have been contacted-as late as today-by numerous organisations across the country expressing their concerns about the legislation. Many of these groups have only just caught up with the amendments-which have only been available for about a week and a half-and are now in the position where they are trying to mesh into the Bill the new amendments and trying to make some sense of what is now a very different piece of legislation. Some of those groups that have contacted me are the Consumer Advocacy Programme of South Australia; the Australian Association for Speech and Hearing; Parent Advocacy; Parent and Adolescent Conciliation and Counselling Service; Queensland Council of Carers; welfare rights centres in Canberra, Adelaide and Melbourne; the Association of Relatives and Friends of the Mentally Ill in Victoria and Queensland-and the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> This says a lot for the Senate committee process and, I must add, the work done by the Committee secretary, Dr Pauline Moore, and her staff. These groups were provided with an excellent opportunity to express their concerns. The Government was ultimately forced to take many of these concerns on board, hence the amendments. One hundred and three changes are, indeed, a lot of changes. We certainly acknowledge that at least the Government was prepared to make these changes and that this late consultation process certainly was very valuable. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Government is still ignoring several major concerns about the Bill. The Democrats believe that it would be in the interests of all concerned-and, indeed, may save the Minister some further embarrassment down the track-if the Government, after we finish the second reading stage, deferred this legislation, did a bit more work on it and got more serious about consulting properly with all sections of the disability community. I stress that we really must start putting people before numbers on a balance sheet. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988, the Government Social Security Review, headed by Professor Bettina Cass, produced Issues Paper No. 5: Towards Enabling Policies: Income Support for People with Disabilities. This was a very comprehensive report. Its underlying thread was a desire to provide increased opportunity for people with disabilities to enter the work force. Not many people, if any, would take exception to that goal and it has long been the aim of many organisations working in the disability field. But the Government, claiming to be in pursuit of this goal, has ignored many of the major recommendations in its own report. This total disregard for its own research, combined with the sheer stupidity of forging ahead with the so-called active employment strategy when a million Australians are already out of work, makes a mockery of the Government's professed aims for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The actual detail of this Bill clearly demonstrates that the Government is opting for an approach that is based upon misconceptions about the lives of people with disabilities. I believe that it is not much more than another opportunity to further tighten the screws in the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> We still have major concerns about this legislation along with, I must state again, many community groups, people with disabilities, academics and doctors. In particular, we all have major concerns about the elimination of non-medical factors and the use of impairment tables. I will go back to the Social Security Review and its comments with regard to this. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . for some people with disabilities `incapacity' to undertake gainful employment may not result from total physical or intellectual inability to perform the tasks associated with the range of jobs for which the claimant is broadly qualified. Rather, incapacity may be the consequence of the interaction of an impairment with other non-medical factors which significantly reduce the likelihood that the person will be able to obtain and hold regular, full-time gainful employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, we should look at the actual recommendations of the review. Recommendation 7.7 states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . while a major component of reduced potential for substantial gainful employment should be attributable to a physical, psychiatric or intellectual impairment, this would not be established by a rigid threshold level of impairment, but rather by the interaction between:</PARA>
<PARA> - level of impairment;</PARA>
<PARA> - relevant socio-economic factors (eg age, sex, educational qualifications and skill level, literacy, and previous work history), and</PARA>
<PARA> - labour market factors pertaining to the reasonable availability and accessibility of job opportunities which are appropriate to the capacities and skills of the person.</PARA>
<PARA>It is further recommended that level of impairment be assessed using the impairment guide currently being developed by the panel of medical experts. It is recommended that the assessment refer to broad bands of impairment denoting effects on function, rather than discrete degrees of impairment, and that the level of impairment assessed in this way be taken as indicative rather than as rigidly determinative. In other words full account would be taken of the possible compounding effects of socioeconomic and labour market circumstances on the level--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the last sitting week I rose to speak on the adjournment debate to address the need for Australia to recognise the independence of the Baltic states. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) on the action he has taken in this regard. However, I think it is also appropriate that at this time we cast our minds a little further ahead and consider the consequences of what is happening in the Soviet Union. It could be said that events are occurring so rapidly in the Soviet Union and everything is in such a state of flux that it is difficult to do this. But there are evidently going to be problems in certain areas, if not in the next couple of weeks, in the next couple of months or years. It is the obligation of all of us in this place to consider Australia's reaction to those possible developments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My concern relates to the economy of the Soviet Union and the effects it will have on Australia, in terms of both our trade-either directly with the Soviet Union or with other countries, or our competition in markets where the Soviet Union is a large buyer: for example in beef, which I will turn to in a moment-and the consequences for the Western world of a possible default on the Soviet debt obligations. I will address the debt obligations first, because this is an area to which nobody seems to have paid enough attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union is one of the world's largest debtor nations. At the moment we are seeing developments which will result in at least some of the republics splitting away from the existing USSR and not joining a new federation. I note, for example, that in the last couple of days the proposals for a new greater Russian federation have been put forward by just 10 republics: Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kirgizia, Turkmenia and Tadzhikistan. Of course, a number of republics have sat out of this process: for example, Georgia has been a participant as an observer only; Moldavia has declared that it will not be part of a new federation; and the Baltic states have already declared their independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence is that there will be fewer republics to share the Soviet Union's existing debt burden. It is very clear that every one of the republics which wants to break away from the federation will say, `We don't have an obligation for the Soviet Union's debt'. There is very little chance of our being able to persuade these republics to pick up even a portion of that debt obligation. The logical consequence of just the developments to date is really quite simple: there will be fewer republics and fewer people to bear the obligations of the current USSR to its international creditors. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already seen predictions that, even if the USSR were to stay together, there is a very high risk of default in the next year to 24 months. For example, I think Westpac predicted recently that the likelihood of a default on the Soviet Union's wheat debt to Australia was quite high. We have to consider what response we will make in the event of the Soviet Union running into difficulty on its debt- particularly as a large portion of that debt is owed on the trade of Australian agricultural exports. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me, as I am sure it concerns most honourable senators in this chamber upon reflection, is the fact that we cannot afford to have the Foreign Minister agree to write off debts owed to Australia and to Australian farmers in the same fashion as he wrote off the $200m wheat debt which was owed to Australia by Egypt-a $25m cost to Australian farmers. If we were to write off the Soviet Union's debts to Australia just in agricultural commodities, the loss to Australian farmers would be even greater. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage nobody seems concerned with putting a plan in place to deal with possible Soviet default. There seems to be no attempt around the world to consider the ability of the republics which remain in this greater Russian federation to meet their debt obligations. It is my grave fear that in the next 12 months to two years this will become a problem. Unless we give it thought in advance, we run the very real risk of getting caught out. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this has immediate consequences for our aid program. It has been suggested that we must give aid to the Soviet Union in the form of loans to purchase commodities. Two months, or even two weeks, ago this may have been a viable alternative; but not now. It is my belief that if we are to give any aid to the Soviet Union-especially for the sale of agricultural produce-unfortunately, it must be in the form of assistance with purchases, not by loan but by way of a grant. If we clock up the loan, because of the nature of the incomplete national interest cover of Australian agricultural exports, we will expose our farmers, our primary producers and other exporters to a performance risk by the Russian federation which is clearly unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA> The final area of concern for me is what will happen if the Soviet Union is incapable of buying the agricultural commodities which it has been purchasing in international markets in recent years. For example, what if the Soviet Union does not purchase as much beef as it has in the past? I recently visited the Cattlemen's Union conference. I believe it is of concern to everybody that the Soviet Union may pull out of the international beef market because it does not have the hard currency to purchase beef. We do not export a lot to the Soviet Union but everybody knows who does: the European Community, which faces the very real prospect of a one million tonne stockpile of beef by the end of this year. If it cannot unload some of that stockpile on the Soviet Union, it is not unreasonable to expect that it will try to unload some of that stockpile onto our traditional markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, it is important that we act now to coordinate international efforts to ensure that the events in the Soviet Union do not have a calamitous effect on international commodity markets or international markets for agricultural produce. Accordingly, I believe it is the responsibility of the Government and the Parliament to encourage efforts now to ensure that the beef market around the world does not collapse and drive prices down further for Australian producers. I note that only last week the cattle price index slumped below 110 points. We have to give the matter immediate consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise these matters because I believe it is important that Australia looks ahead to the future. There is a prospect of a brighter future, but only if we plan and consider matters carefully. If we do not, we will be caught napping and all Australians will pay-particularly those in the Australian agricultural exporting sector. </PARA>

Some good Queensland representation in the Ministry is what is needed in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, you will recall that on 15 July I drew the Senate's attention to the fact that Mr Hawke now has the dubious honour of being the first Prime Minister since Federation to preside over a Cabinet without anyone from Queensland in it. The recent redistribution in Queensland makes it appear that there will be even less Queensland representation on Labor's front bench when the Liberal Party defeats one of the sitting members, Mr Beddall, in the southern Queensland seat of Rankin. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times the Prime Minister has paid much lip service to getting people from Queensland into the Ministry. He breezes into the north, where I come from, and keeps saying-as he has done prior to the last four elections-that there are good north Queenslanders who should be in the Ministry, that he knows that they would make good Ministers and that he is considering it. He has done it all of the time and he did it again the other week. Poor old Mr Lindsay, the Federal member up my way, has been overlooked time and time again. The Prime Minister was up there just a few weeks ago again saying what tremendous ministerial potential Mr Lindsay had. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons why we do not have Queenslanders in the Ministry is that both of the two Labor parliamentarians from the Northern Territory hold ministerial or Parliamentary Secretary rank. The Northern Territory does not do too badly-it gets two out of two. In Queensland, out of 19 ALP figures we have two junior Ministers and one also-ran. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the problem. I suppose the Minister is a little concerned because he does not hold his position by anything other than the Prime Minister's favour. Maybe if there is a leadership change, he would be one of the ones to get knocked out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was reported in the Courier-Mail of last week that there had been a secret meeting of members of the Queensland right wing of the Labor Party to talk about the continuing leadership crisis. I hope that in that secret meeting about the leadership crisis-about whom Mr Ludwig said the Queenslanders should vote for-something was done to extract from Mr Hawke a promise of some additional representation in Queensland. Maybe that is what Mr Swan is down here to do today. Maybe he has seen the writing on the wall. Maybe he is down here talking to Mr Keating and saying to him, `Mr Hawke would not give us any representation, although we supported him en bloc; maybe you will do it'. Maybe that is what Mr Swan is doing down here-trying to extract a deal from Mr Keating to get a few more Queenslanders in the Ministry. If that is what Mr Swan is doing here, he comes with my support. He has got nowhere with Mr Hawke in the past. At least, if he could get a commitment from Keating-Mr Keating-to get more Queenslanders in the Ministry, it would be good for Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> As Queensland Labor people would know-and I do not address you, Mr Deputy President, because you are in the chair-members of the Queensland Right are petrified that they will lose preselection because of threats from the Australian Workers Union. It is a bit the same as Mr Goss being too petrified to sack Mr Prest, the Deputy Whip, for his outrageous racist slur in the Queensland Parliament. Mr Goss will not dismiss Mr Prest, in spite of that outrageous slur, for fear of upsetting the fragile AWU faction with the right wing Old Guard faction in the Queensland area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor member for Leichhardt, Mr Gayler, quite openly boasts that he has no chance of a ministerial guernsey because of his failure to join the AWU faction in Queensland. It is common knowledge that Mr Gayler may be toppled by the AWU at his preselection because of his tendency for individual thought. I understand that Mr Bates, a prominent north Queenslander, is trying to get that preselection from Mr Gayler. No doubt, Mr Bates will have to come to some accommodation with the AWU. By the way, I would be interested if anyone could tell me which members of the Queensland public elected Mr Ludwig to sort out these matters for Queenslanders; but that is another story. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's leadership brawl is perpetuating some of the many failures of the Hawke Government. It has a Ministry in which Queenslanders are grossly under-represented. I emphasise that this is the first time since Federation that Queensland has not had any representation in the Federal Cabinet. Queenslanders are so under-represented that Mr Goss has had to ask West Australian Mr Kim Beazley to represent Queensland's interests in the Cabinet. Could you, Mr Deputy President, or any of your colleagues, think of anything more stupid than asking a West Australian, Mr Beazley, to represent Queensland's interests in Cabinet? Maybe, Mr Deputy President, I underestimate Mr Goss; maybe he is cleverer than Richo and Senator Ray--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I do not know whether the honourable senator has been deliberately doing it but he is not using proper titles and then he is coming back to use them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Maybe Mr Goss is cleverer than both the numbers man for Mr Keating, Senator Richardson, and the numbers man for Mr Hawke, Senator Ray. Maybe Mr Goss realised a few months ago-long before Senator Richardson or Senator Ray realised it-that the third man, Mr Beazley, would come out on top. Maybe Mr Goss was being terribly clever in getting Mr Beazley to look after Queensland's interests. Mr Goss does not just go around the edges; he goes right to the person who will be at the top.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suspect that if Mr Goss has done that, maybe he has much more intelligence than I have ever given him credit for before. If he has got that commitment from Mr Beazley, that is tremendous news for Queensland. We do, in fact, desperately need some Queensland input into the decisions that this Cabinet makes. </PARA>
<PARA> This Cabinet is principally made up of Victorians; 11 in the outer Ministry, nine in the Cabinet. Look at the mess the ALP has made of Victoria and look at the mess it is making of Australia. Perhaps we could get some of them out and try to get in good people such as Senator Colston, Senator Jones and Senator Reynolds, who used to be the only woman on the front bench in this chamber but who was tossed out ingloriously by the Labor Party which claims to be an equal opportunity party. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, I just hope that, having seeing Mr Swan in these hallowed halls tonight, he is down here to try to crank up a bit of support for whoever-whether it be his old mate Mr Hawke, or maybe he has switched sides and gone to Keating or maybe he is just following up Mr Goss's--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The portfolio includes a number of Statutory Marketing Authorities (SMA), which conduct operations which are commercial in nature. The following information does not include SMAs. It includes expenditure by the Central Office of the Department, the three specialised research Bureaux within the Department and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and agencies in the portfolio which conduct operations which are not commercial in nature.</PARA>
<PARA>  For the purposes of this question, I have interpreted `advertising and public relations' to mean expenditure on print and/or electronic means to promote Departmental programs. It does not include expenditure on management activities such as classified advertising of Departmental job vacancies and the like.</PARA>
<PARA>  I have also specifically excluded expenditure on calls for tenders or applications for research projects, such as those issued under Departmental funding programs such as the former National Energy, Research Development and Demonstration Program or by the Research and Development Corporations in the portfolio as it is in the nature of classified advertising and is always placed through the government contractor and does not involve significant expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Yes. I am advised the most recent sighting of koalas in the south east forests was reported by volunteer surveyors on 20 April 1991 but that subsequent investigation has failed to verify this sighting.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) I understand that harvesting has taken place on private property in the area recommended as a research zone by Dr. Fanning. In the one case that I am aware of, logging was undertaken under an agreement between the land owner and a private company (not Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd) and the timber was purchased for use within Australia. As the timber being harvested was not intended for export, land use in this instance is a State responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>  However I am informed that the reported sighting was brought to the attention of the Koala Steering Committee of New South Wales, which is developing a management plan to ensure the conservation of koalas in the region. I understand that in developing the plan, the Committee will take into consideration all surveys of koalas and their habitats in the area, on both public and private land, including site specific surveys being undertaken by the Forestry Commission of New South Wales, in association with the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service, and also surveys by the Tantawangalo Catchment Protection Association. The Committee is being funded by the NSW Forestry Commission, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Australian Heritage Commission and Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA>  With regard to logging operations in State forest, I have been assured that the Forestry Commission of New South Wales will not allow logging where a koala has been discovered until site specific surveys are conducted to allow management options for these areas to be considered by the Koala Steering Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) No. I continue to believe that a re-examination of the environmental impact statement of Harris-Daishowa (Australia) is not warranted in this case for the same reasons I gave in my answer to Question No. 487.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1125" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The relative costs of Australian Defence Force Regulars, Ready Reserves and conventional Reserves were estimated by comparing their direct personnel costs. In the case of Ready Reserves the relative cost was an estimate based on a possible conditions of service package. That package has now been refined and details are available in the report on the Ready Reserve Program tabled in Parliament by me on 30 May 1991. Following this refinement the estimated direct personnel cost of a Ready Reserve member is now assessed to be about 0.3 of a Regular member. However, as the Ready Reserve Program has no precedent, this estimate can only be validated with experience.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) No, these calculations do not determine the ratio of the full costs of Regulars, Ready Reserves and Conventional Reserves. Such ratios would need to take into account estimates of all indirect costs which would include administrative and operational expenses, management overheads, stores consumed and capital costs and depreciation. These estimates, which could have differing confidence levels, would impact differently on Regular, Ready Reserve and Conventional Reserve members and units.</PARA>
<PARA>  As the ratios are prospective in nature they would also need to include estimates of other matters such as expected wastage rates and the likely impact of major reviews and initiatives such as the Defence Regional Support Review, the Force Structure Review, the Defence Logistic Redevelopment Project, the Defence Commercial Support Program, Program Management and Budgeting, as well as the Wrigley Interdepartmental Committee itself. The confidence levels of these estimates would also vary.</PARA>
<PARA>  The definition and inclusion of the cost implications of the matters referred to above would have involved many additional assumptions, any of which might turn out to be incorrect. The compounding effect of increasing the number of assumptions involved would increase the probability of the resulting estimates of the ratios of costs having little relationship to actual costs.</PARA>
<PARA>  In order to broaden somewhat the basis of the estimates of the possible costs of Ready Reserves, however, the Force Structure Review assessed the relative costs of Regular and Ready Reserve members on the basis of their refined direct personnel costs, as referred to above in part (1) of this question, and operating costs. Operating costs were included because of the availability of historical data from which estimates were made. As a result, the report on the Force Structure Review, also tabled in Parliament by me on 30 May 1991, advised that Ready Reserve personnel are expected to cost about 42 per cent relative to regular personnel.</PARA>
<PARA>  As indicated in my response to part (1) of this question, even the development of relatively simple ratios of direct personnel costs involved a number of assumptions, some of which subsequently have required adjustment. As a result and as recommended by the Wrigley Interdepartmental Committee, Defence will assess the effectiveness of the Ready Reserve Program, including costing aspects, once it has been in operation for some time. In view of the time it will take for the impact of the major reviews and initiatives currently being implemented in Defence to begin to take effect this assessment will be conducted in three years rather than in two years as suggested by the Wrigley Interdepartmental Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Yes, Army constructed a costing model for the Ready Reserve which produced a higher estimated cost of approximately 0.5 to 0.6 of a Regular member. Army has advised that this higher estimated cost was basically attributable to assumptions made about higher throughput of Ready Reserves for training.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) The estimate of the cost of an Army Reservist used by the Interdepartmental Committee relates to the annual direct personnel cost of a Reserve soldier. The cost per day estimate made by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) cannot be compared with this figure.</PARA>
<PARA>  This is because the ANAO's estimates include components relating to the cost of the Regular Army manpower allocated to Reserve units and indirect costs related to administrative and other support overheads, estimated by the ANAO to be provided to the Army Reserve by other Regular Army personnel and civilians employed in the Army Program. These two elements total almost 60% of the ANAO's total estimated cost for the Army Reserve.</PARA>
<PARA>  The attribution of indirect costs between Regular and Reserve elements is difficult to assess as Army's cost structure has increasingly been based on the principles of Program Management and Budgeting. This focuses on the cost of particular Force Element Groups which, subject to preparedness requirements, may contain both Regular and Reserve personnel.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) and (2) Presumably this question refers to a statement attributed to a Mr Yves Thomas of EDF, which was reported in the 12 November 1990 issue of a nuclear industry trade journal, Nuclear Fuel. Thomas refers to a purported purchase on the spot market, at some undefined time prior to 1988, of `Nabarlek material' at a price of $16/lb.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is quite conceivable that Nabarlek material, exported from Australia at the former uranium floor price, could have been disposed of by the overseas buyer by sale on the spot market. This would not contravene Australian Government policy from either a commercial or safeguards perspective and would not entail any diminution in Australian export earnings.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Decommissioning and rehabilitation at Nabarlek will take place in accordance with directives issued by the NT Minister for Mines and Energy, under the Uranium Mining (Environmental Control) Act.

<PARA>  (1) Has the Minister seen the recent reports in the Australian of 11 June 1991 and statements by the organisation, Friends of the Earth, which claim that continued low uranium spot prices and reduced global demand for new reactor capacity are likely to make expanded uranium mining operations uneconomic.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The availability of large stocks of uranium over the past few years has led to increased trading on the spot market and a fall in spot market prices. These developments have adversely affected production at some mining centres. Although spot market prices can be expected to remain low for the short term, the reduction of stocks and the fact that current production levels are well below reactor requirements suggest that, over the medium to longer term, spot market transactions will decrease and prices will rise.</PARA>
<PARA>  Most international trade in uranium has continued to take place under long term contracts, whose prices do not necessarily reflect spot market prices. In the last few months, for example, Australian uranium producers have been successful in concluding new long term contracts at prices substantially above the spot market. These contracts confirm that buyers are concerned about security of supply and are not prepared to rely entirely on the vagaries of the spot market.</PARA>
<PARA>  The nuclear power industry is a mature industry. It is to be expected that the rates of growth evident in the early decades of the industry's history should slow as the industry expanded. However, it continues to grow. Western world nuclear generating capacity is currently about 280 GWe and even conservative forecasts expect that capacity will exceed 300 GWe by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>  As far as the uranium market is concerned and, in turn, the profitability or otherwise of existing or expanded uranium mining operations, new reactor capacity is a small but positive variable. More important variables are the uranium requirements of nuclear capacity currently in operation and, on the supply side, the growing deficit between production and requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects that nuclear energy's contribution to electricity generation in OECD countries will increase from 1558.1 terrawatt hours (TWh) in 1989 (23.6%) to 1895.7 TWh in 2000 (22.8%). The very marginal reduction in nuclear's share of total electricity generation in this time frame (from 23.6% to 22.8%) is not significant, particularly in the light of the expected growth in nuclear power in absolute terms.</PARA>
<PARA>  On 3 June 1991, the Governing Board of the IEA, of which Australia is a member, issued a communique which recognised the substantial contribution that nuclear energy makes in a number of member countries and, consequently, to the overall energy supply and mix of IEA countries. The communique also noted the view that nuclear energy provides an important response to the challenge of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions because it emits no sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides or greenhouse gases.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) The assertion that the IEA has predicted that there is unlikely to be any growth in nuclear capacity this decade is not consistent with the IEA's 1990 review of energy policies of IEA countries. In this review the IEA forecasts that nuclear capacity in OECD countries will increase from 261.1 gigawatts net in 1990 to 292.1 gigawatts net in 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) The projections of nuclear capacity growth rates made by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) and the IEA are not directly comparable. DPIE's past analyses have been based on supply and demand in the `world outside centrally planned economies areas' (WOCA), the same category used by Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, NUKEM and many others, but not IEA.</PARA>
<PARA>  In any event, projections of nuclear capacity growth rates do not differ markedly. All analysts agree that nuclear generating capacity will increase between now and the year 2000. Some analysts expect the growth rate to be about 1% per annum, others expect the rate to be about 2% per annum. For the purpose of assessing future market outlook, demand variables alone are not going to enable reasonable assessments to be made. It is the relationship between supply and demand which will determine the market outcome.</PARA>

<PARA>  (1) Officers of the Departments of Social Security, Treasury, Finance and Veterans' Affairs have met and are examining various implementation strategies for the 1995 removal of age pensioners and equivalent service pensioners from the income tax system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answers to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Since 1986 persons granted sole parent pension, with the exception of recently bereaved widows, are required to complete a review form at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the date the claim for pension is lodged. After that initial period, all sole parent pensioners have their eligibility reviewed by completing a form each 12 weeks while pension is payable. Since January 1990 selected sole parent pensioners are personally interviewed either 8 or 12 weeks after grant depending on the likelihood of a change in their circumstances. In addition, selective reviews of sole parent pensioners based upon the possibility of incorrect payments are done at any time. A Budget initiative announced on 20 August 1991 was that the percentage of sole parent pensioners interviewed at 8 or 12 weeks after grant will be increased from 30% to 50% beginning on 11 December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Review forms are bulk mailed to sole parent pensioners to minimise costs. Sole parent pensioners are serviced by 210 regional offices and 27 local offices; JET Advisers are located in 80 offices. On a trial basis, JET information has been included on two occasions with all review forms in Tasmania. In other States, individual JET Advisers are trialing distribution of JET information with the review form given to sole parent pensioners at the pre-grant interview which they are obliged to return four weeks after the claim for pension is lodged. JET information is also being handed to sole parent pensioners when they return subsequent review forms. It is intended to extend the distribution of JET information in this way.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The Employment Entry payment (EEP) was introduced from 1 January 1991. All sole parent pensioners were advised of EEP through information on a card insert which was included with their 12 weekly review form during the period 1 January to 1 April 1991. The 12 weekly review form also contains a message alerting sole parent pensioners to their possible entitlement to EEP. In addition, sole parent pensioners are advised about the availability and eligibility requirements of EEP at their pre-grant interview. JET Advisers also inform sole parent pensioners about the payment in preparation for work entry.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) For the 6 month period from its introduction on 1 January to the end of June 1991, 12,656 sole parent pensioners received an EEP. This compares with the estimated number of payments of 7,500 for that period.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) Of the 12,656 EEPs made for the 6 month period 1 January to 30 June 1991, 2,448 sole parent pensioners had their pensions cancelled following payment of an EEP. Some of those remaining on pension may have been working full-time, but their income still enabled them to receive part-rate pension.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) As at 21 June 1991, 6,791 current sole parent pensioners had self-identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders. This may not be a complete record of participants from these groups as, for privacy reasons, it is optional for social security recipients to declare their Aboriginality.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) 308 JET participants have self-identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders. This may not be a complete record of JET participants from this group for the reasons in (6) above.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) The number on record is 194 and is subject to the qualifications at (6) above.</PARA>
<PARA>  (9) As at 31 July 1991, there were 67 female JET Advisers and 13 male JET Advisers.</PARA>
<PARA>  (10) Of the sole parent pensioners who have received an EEP in the 6 month period 1 January 1991 to 30 June 1991, 10,104 were not JET participants.</PARA>
<PARA>  (11) In 1990-91, 32,000 JET new client interviews were conducted by JET Advisers. On average the number of JET interviews conducted before November 1990 was eight per week. After November 1990, when JET Advisers had the assistance of clerical support, the number of interviews conducted on average by JET Advisers was twelve per week.</PARA>
<PARA>  The first full year of operation of the JET program will be 1991-92 with 80 JET Advisers in place for the full year. The average national target number of new interviews per JET Adviser per week is 12.5.</PARA>
<PARA>  Conducting new client interviews is only one part of the JET Advisers' weekly workload. Their other duties include follow up of established clients, including second and subsequent interviews; liaison with Departmental Officers, e.g; Social Workers, Aboriginal Liaison Officers, Migrant Liaison Officers and Officers administering the earnings credit and child support schemes and other support provisions; liaison with the CES and other areas of the Department of Employment, Education and Training; liaison with the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services and JET Support Workers on child care provision; liaison with State Government agencies and Community agencies; liaison with secondary and tertiary education bodies; generating client response through invitation letters, outreach activities with community and welfare organisations and sole parent pensioners, distribution of information materials and placement of local advertising about the program; post-interview follow-up of JET clients; and telephone contact with JET clients.</PARA>
<PARA>  In most areas, and particularly in rural and regional locations, time is also spent travelling between regions where visiting services are provided. Currently the JET program provides a visiting service to 132 centres. In addition, in some JET locations, particularly those servicing special needs clients such as remote Aboriginal clients or those of Non-English Speaking Background, the nature and needs of the client population mean that the JET Adviser must spend more than the average time per client.</PARA>
<PARA>  (12) The average duration of a JET interview is around one hour.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Of the six programs in the Social Security Portfolio, one, Income Security for the Retired, is directed at providing assistance to people of or above the prescribed pension age (65 for men and 60 for women). This program also covers the wives of age pensioners and people caring full-time for disabled age pensioners who are not of age pension age themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>  Funding of $9,207.5 million was made available from Special Appropriations under the Social Security Act 1947 to cover payments for this program in 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is estimated that $61.6 million of the total Running Costs budget for the Department was directed to the administration of the Income Security for the Retired Program in 1990-91.

<PARA>  Travel by Scheduled Commercial Services: Ministers are entitled to first class travel at official expense for official purposes within Australia and to Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Norfolk Island.</PARA>
<PARA>  The spouse or nominee of a Minister may also travel for official purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>  As determined by the Remuneration Tribunal each dependent child of a senator or member may travel at official expense on a maximum of 3 return visits at economy class between Canberra and the electorate each financial year. With the prior approval of the Minister for Administrative Services the cost of travel at economy class (or at first-class if accompanying the Minister or spouse) for a dependent child will be met for:</PARA>
<PARA>  1 return visit to any place within Australia each year;</PARA>
<PARA>  travel to and from Parliamentary functions in Canberra attended by the Minister or spouse; and</PARA>
<PARA>  return visits between the nominated principal residence and Canberra when the Minister and spouse are in Canberra for lengthy periods.</PARA>
<PARA>  Charter Aircraft: Ministers are entitled to use charter aircraft for official purposes in circumstances where scheduled services are not available, or where to use scheduled services would not enable the Minister to keep an official commitment.</PARA>
<PARA>  Special Purpose Aircraft: Ministers may use Special Purpose Aircraft for official purposes for travel within Australia and overseas in accordance with Principles for the Use of Special Purpose Aircraft (tabled November 1990). The flight is to be authorised by the Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence.</PARA>
<PARA>  Car Transport: Ministers and their spouses are entitled to the use of official cars for official purposes. Ministers may utilise self drive cars for official purposes. Ministers may if they wish have access to the backbench private plated vehicle entitlement under terms and conditions determined by the Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>  Overseas Travel: With the prior approval of the Prime Minister, Ministers may travel overseas in the course of their duties. The cost of travel by an accompanying spouse or nominee and (in most cases), one member of personal staff will also be met. By government decision Ministers do not have access to the Remuneration Tribunal's provisions in respect of overseas study allowance for themselves and spouse or nominee while holding Ministerial office.</PARA>
<PARA>  Postage: Ministers are entitled to postage in relation to the duties of their office.</PARA>
<PARA>  Staff: In accordance with the provisions of Part 111 of the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 and Determinations which have been made under the Act, Ministers may engage, under an agreement in writing, three electorate staff and a number (set by the Prime Minister), of personal staff to assist them in meeting their portfolio responsibilities.

<PARA>  Office Accommodation and Facilities: In addition to the backbench entitlement to an electorate office Ministers may establish Ministerial offices in the capital city of their home State, or may upgrade their electorate offices to become combined Ministerial/electorate offices. In a combined office my Department provides basic furniture and equipment to the limit of a backbench entitlement. Any additional equipment required by Ministers is provided by the Ministers' departments.</PARA>
<PARA>  Ministers' departments may also make Ministerial office accommodation available within departmental holdings. When visiting a city where they do not have their own office or suitable office accommodation within their departments holdings, Ministers may have access to visiting Ministers' suites if available.</PARA>
<PARA>  Certain entitlements and facilities which arise from the performance of a Minister's portfolio duties and responsibilities are provided by the Minister's home Department and include official home telephone, official hospitality and newspapers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The article in the Age newspaper did not identify the school where homeless students are alleged to have had their AUSTUDY payments cut. From the numbers quoted in the paper, however, it is likely that the school is a particular Melbourne college where there is a high concentration of students receiving assistance under the homeless rate.</PARA>
<PARA>  As part of the Department's routine enrolment and attendance checking procedures, the Principal of that college was sent a list containing the names of 74 students at his school receiving AUSTUDY. Based upon advice provided by the college about these students, adjustments were made to the payments of 27 students, including 11 receiving payments at the homeless rate.</PARA>
<PARA>  The college has stated that it is supportive of action taken by the Department to adjust payments where a student cannot legitimately explain an absence from school. Many of the 27 students who had their payments adjusted were absent for lengthy periods without reasonable explanation and a number had actually left school. The school had made special arrangements to meet the circumstances of homeless students who might otherwise have difficulty providing evidence when their absences were justified.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Melbourne office of the Department followed its standard procedure of double-checking adjustments to payments of homeless AUSTUDY students, in order to minimise the possibility of penalising students without just cause.</PARA>
