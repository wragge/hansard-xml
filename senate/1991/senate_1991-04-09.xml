<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan where up to two million people are reported to be fleeing from Saddam Hussein's army, and I ask why did not the Australian Government lobby members of the United Nations (UN) Security Council to include a clause for the protection of minorities in Iraq in the cease-fire resolution as approved by the Security Council?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2023" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation in Iraq with the Kurds is distressing in the extreme at the moment. I think all honourable senators will be aware, from the news coverage, of the Iraqi assault upon the Kurdish minority and the flight of refugees that has occurred subsequently. I guess the full dimensions of the tragedy that we are now seeing unfold have only become apparent over the course of the last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The terms of the cease-fire resolution were bedded down formally by the Security Council certainly by 2 April and, in fact, largely resolved before Easter. Some attempts were made at that stage by the French and others to raise specifically the question of either sanctions provisions or some other provisions in the cease-fire resolution, bearing specifically on the position of minorities and, in particular, the Kurdish minority within Iraq. But, as I understand it, the reaction of other countries prominent in the drafting of that resolution was that it was better to focus on the already tremendously complex array of issues that they were then focussing on in that cease-fire resolution, rather than open up the matter further in that way.</PARA>
<PARA> In the event, the sanctions language of UN Security Council resolution 687 was left open enough and general enough-in particular, in operative clause 21-to enable further consideration to be given to the internal developments, including those in relation to the Kurdish minority, as they occurred. That is the provision which says that the Security Council should review the provisions of the sanctions clause every 60 days in the light of the policies and practices of the Government of Iraq, including the implementation of all relevant resolutions of the Security Council.</PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, that language has been subsequently construed as broad enough to encompass an ongoing consideration of the Iraqi Government's behaviour with respect to the Kurds, and is being regarded as a sufficiently precise peg on which to hang, in particular, the continuation of economic sanctions until such time as the situation improves.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is well aware of all of these developments as they are occurring in the United Nations, and it is simply a matter of making a judgment as to whether or not there is anything more we can usefully do than is already happening as these things are negotiated to fruition. We made the judgment that, particularly given our status as not being a current member of the Security Council, there was little we could add to a very lively debate on these issues that was already proceeding. That is the view that we continue to hold.</PARA>
<PARA> Resolution 688 of the Security Council, passed last week, deals quite specifically with the humanitarian issues confronting the present plight of the Kurdish people. That is now being used as the basis for the suggestion from, among others, the United Kingdom Prime Minister, John Major-endorsed earlier today, I believe, by the European Community-that some safe haven concept should be developed pursuant to the open-ended terms of that resolution which would make it possible for the UN to get involved in oversighting the present very unhappy position of the Kurds within Iraq. That issue opens up another very complex series of jurisdictional and legalistic questions about what the precise capacity of the United Nations is, and should be, to act in these areas when one is dealing with internal matters rather than external aggression. Certainly, the UN charter is very clear that military authority does not extend to matters of this kind. But, equally clearly, under UN practice and tradition there is no doubt at all that the international community can apply a great weight of influence, both directly and through the United Nations, in relation to internal humanitarian tragedies and problems of this kind. I go into this detail, Mr President, because it is an extremely complex issue as to just how to handle this.</PARA>
<PARA> Might I say for the record that Australia supports the continuation of sanctions until such time as the human rights of the Kurdish people are guaranteed to the international community's reasonable satisfaction. We support in principle the concept of some kind of safe enclave if that could be made to work consistently with the United Nations charter and with the assessment of the international community of its practicability.</PARA>
<PARA> We do, of course, support the question of international humanitarian relief for the Kurdish people in this situation, and I may have the opportunity to say something more about that later. We do, of course, support in any other appropriate way the maximum pressure being placed upon Iraq to do the right thing in relation to the Kurdish people-something that it has not been very good at doing over the past decades of that country's existence. We have made our voice perfectly plain in this respect whenever it has become necessary to do so, and certainly in the next few days we will continue to pursue very actively any avenue of the resolution of this matter that we see is not already being actively pursued by current members of the Security Council.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to leave that matter for a later occasion, but let me say that the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett, is today announcing an Australian contribution of another $1m to the international relief efforts for the Iraqi post-war situation, to be divided between the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross. It is the case, of course, that this donation follows an earlier donation of $1m each to the Red Cross and to the UNDRO, the United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation, specifically focused on assistance for the victims of the Gulf crisis, including refugees. It is also the case that, in addition to that, another $3m was donated earlier on for humanitarian purposes-including to non-government organisations active in the region and to UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Middle East-thereby making, together with today's additional contribution, a total of $6m-worth of Australian humanitarian contributions to the area since the Gulf crisis began.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to the Prime Minister's March industry statement. What will be the impact of the duty reductions for capital equipment announced in the industry statement, both on the developers of major projects and also on Australia's engineering industry in general?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2025" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The key changes announced on 12 March will have the effect of reducing input costs for industry by removing duty on certain capital equipment in the mineral processing, shipbuilding and ship repair industries. Split consignment arrangements will also be extended to cover additional items of capital equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The rationale for these and similar measures is the reduction of capital equipment costs for the efficient mining and agricultural export industries. This has been a key objective of the Government, certainly since May 1988. Making this cost-saving opportunity available to the minerals processing and shipbuilding sectors is a logical extension of the objective which has previously been worked towards, for example, in the May 1988 statement.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the measures encourage participation of competitive Australian supplier industries in major industrial projects. This is particularly beneficial to key engineering enterprises in Australia. Under the split consignment provisions, the ability to import parts of a machine at the duty rate applying to the total machine, while having the balance of the machine made in Australia, encourages the involvement of competitive Australian companies. It no longer means that importing the complete plant and equipment is the favoured option. Indeed, the combination of imports under item 45 of the tariff-mining equipment-and item 43, which deals with split consignments, has assisted Australian industry to play a major part in the North West Shelf Goodwin A platform project which was announced last year.</PARA>
<PARA> A further related measure in the industry statement referred to state-of-the-art equipment. While details have not been considered by the Government at this stage, the proposed state-of-the-art equipment by-law will enable Australian industry to import high performance equipment where equivalent goods are not produced in Australia. This will be important in introducing more flexibility into the commercial tariff concession and by-law system.</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the measures will have a beneficial effect in assisting Australian industry to be more competitive in major local projects, which is an essential prerequisite for a successful export industry.</PARA>

I refer him to recent media reports of comments made by the Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Tim Fischer, suggesting that the joint Australian-United States (US) defence facilities should be used as bargaining chips in retaliation for American farm subsidies. Can the Minister inform the Senate of the Government's position on this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports of Mr Fischer's comment that he would be prepared to use the joint facilities as a last resort bargaining chip if American farm subsidies became more destructive. I also note, with some disappointment, reports that in Western Australia a group of farmers vandalised a tracking station in the belief that that is in some way a US military installation. Whilst I acknowledge that Mr Fischer or indeed anyone else has the right to seek a change in United States policies affecting rural interests, it is simply ludicrous to suggest that the joint facilities should be linked in any way to the trade negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, I emphasise that these defence facilities have been established as joint Australian and United States defence facilities. Our two governments share in the management and operation of the facilities and both have access to the product. Importantly, the operations of these facilities serve Australian interests as well as those of the United States. The facilities make an important contribution to maintaining international stability and deterring international conflict. It would be contrary to our own interests as well as those of the wider international community to discontinue our cooperation over these joint facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I endorse the comments made by the Prime Minister yesterday that this Government rejects totally any suggestion that the joint Australian-US defence facilities should be linked to trade issues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would probably have a bigger chance of answering this question if Opposition members were as keenly interested in receiving an answer as in creating havoc in this place. I ask them to hold on for a few seconds. The question that Senator Parer raises is one that obviously has had some publicity in recent days. The Government has decided to ban political advertising on radio and television. It is a decision that we have taken after due consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular part of Senator Parer's question goes to the definition of the word `political'. There have been definitions of political advertising on electoral matters in the Broadcasting Act 1942 for something like 40 years now and they have not excited much attention during that period.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is drafting legislation and the Opposition, like everyone else, will have to await the final drafting and presentation of that legislation to this place to enable them to understand the definition in the context in which we are talking about it. I indicate to Senator Parer, as I have indicated to others in recent weeks, that we are using definitions currently existing in the Broadcasting Act as a basis for our definition. As I say, those provisions have applied in one way or another for the best part of four decades.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, I think it is fair to say that my first answer made it very clear that I was talking about `political' and `electoral' matter in the Electoral Act, to which Senator Parer has referred. Those definitions are the ones which will form the basis of the Government's decision. In all fairness and in all comprehensiveness, the Opposition will have to wait for the draft legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point has been made that I do not know the answer or that I will not tell the Senate what it is. It is the normal course in the preparation of legislation that definitions are worked on. We have indicated that there are a number of provisions in existing legislation upon which we will draw to specify the definition that will apply. Without going into repetition to any great extent, the Opposition, like everyone else, will have to await the presentation of the legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce aware that last week the Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA) released a paper outlining 55 recommendations for the future development of the information technology (IT) industries in Australia? The paper contained many suggestions for government action. Can the Minister inform the Senate whether the Government plans to act on any of these suggestions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very much aware of that statement because a lot of discussion took place during its preparation. Clearly, a good deal of thought and effort have gone into that document. It is a very comprehensive treatment of the problems and opportunities in the information technology industries today. However, most of the matters raised by the Australian Information Industry Association were addressed in the industry statement of 12 March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very pleased with the Association's positive response to the measures that were announced. The industry statement announced a number of measures concerning government procurement of information technology goods and services, which is an area of great concern to the industry. Last month, Senator Bolkus and I released a joint statement on the Government's IT purchasing policy, a statement welcomed by the industry with one or two minor difficulties which are still under discussion.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is now committed to open systems, to using outside data processing sources where they are cost effective and in line with public policy, to a more open tendering process and to greater accountability by agency heads. A working party is presently working out detailed guidelines about the implementation of these policies. Some of the other issues raised by the AIIA, such as micro-economic reform, are high on the Government's agenda.</PARA>
<PARA> I make the point, however, that it is clear from the report that not all the solutions lie within the public sector or within the Government's province. Many of the problems can be solved by the industry and by individual users through the more efficient use of information technology and through greater emphasis on the benefits of the technology rather than just on the technology itself.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by mentioning the importance of these industries to Australia. Information technology is an enabling industry which runs right across all industry sectors in this country. The importance and understanding of the industry's strengths and problems cannot be overestimated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I noted with great interest his answer earlier today to the question of Senator Hill on the Kurds. Following on from that, will Australia advocate the maintenance of sanctions against Iraq until the Iraqi regime ceases all human rights abuses including, but not only, the waging of an internal war against its own Kurdish minority? Will Australia advocate in the United Nations, not just a Kurdish haven but an autonomous Kurdish state in the north of Iraq? What will the Government do to guarantee that our humanitarian aid will reach the Kurds, unlike most of the international aid meant for the Kurds after the chemical weapons were used against them previously by Saddam Hussein?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2028" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the first part of the question about the maintenance of sanctions, I think I have said really about as much as I can about our general support for the principle that has been enunciated in recent days that sanctions should be maintained at least until the amnesty against them is made permanent by the Iraqi Government and the persecution stops, which is the language that the United Kingdom Prime Minister used a few hours ago. Whether or not it would be appropriate to think in terms of maintaining sanctions until a whole range of human rights abuses which that regime has been guilty of over the years against its own citizens, not just the Kurds, ceases, raises some rather more difficult questions about the scope and the capacity of the international community to maintain a sanctions regime of that kind. I will certainly take on board what Senator Bourne has said and give consideration to what Australia's position should be about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the last part of the question about guaranteeing the delivery of humanitarian aid that Australia will supply, distribution can always be a problem in exercises of this kind. All we can hope is that the particular agencies through which we are primarily working, namely the Red Cross, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation, will have the capacity-they certainly have the skill and expertise-in terms of what they are allowed to do on the ground to get the material through. We will simply be hoping that that happens. We are obviously not in a position ourselves to influence the distribution arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> The most substantial part of the question was about whether or not the Australian Government should support calls for a Kurdish homeland and an independent state. That raises very difficult questions for the entire international community. Historically, the area referred to as Kurdistan was part of the Ottoman Empire. It was not an internationally recognised separate entity. It cannot be said, accordingly, that the Kurds were ever actually displaced from a state of their own; nor is it the case, on my understanding, that the Kurds were actually displaced from the particular land area that they physically occupied. On both counts, I guess their situation is a little different from that of the Palestinian people.</PARA>
<PARA> Rather, the Kurds were, and are, an ethic minority in five countries of the Middle East and central Asia and, as such, are citizens of those countries. In Iraq they comprise three million out of a population of 17 million; in Turkey about 10 million out of 55 million; in Iran about six million out of 56 million; in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics about half a million out of 290 million-a very small minority there; and in Syria about half a million out of 13 million.</PARA>
<PARA> It also needs to be borne in mind that the areas in which the Kurds live in those respective countries are not exclusively Kurdish; many other ethnic groups live there as well. To contemplate the creation of a new state in this region out of sections of five other sovereign states, or even out of just a proportion of those, is really unrealistic in our judgment since it would be resisted by the states concerned and, moreover, it would also establish an international precedent that few other United Nations (UN) member states would accept. Obviously, there are many countries around the world within which very substantial minority groups are resident and they might be minded from time to time to do as the Kurds have done and take up arms against their host country. What then is the international community to do in response to those similarly historically based claims of minority ethnic identity?</PARA>
<PARA> Australia does very strongly support current international moves, of course, to tackle generally the problems of the Middle East region, taking advantage of the consensus that has developed over the Gulf crises. While the focus of those post- war efforts is to guarantee military security for the region as a whole, and also to focus particularly on Arab, Israeli and Palestinian issues, it will be necessary to look at a range of related issues-we have always acknowledged this-including human rights and the protection of minorities generally within the region, if stability is to be brought to the region.</PARA>
<PARA> In that context, I see every likelihood of the particular problem of the Kurds being addressed, and certainly Australia will take a strong position internationally that it should be addressed. I believe that that will have widespread support, given the way this situation has evolved. We have taken strong stances on this issue over the years in a variety of forums, including in particular the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva just in the last few months. It would be entirely consistent with that for us to follow the issue through in that way.</PARA>

<PARA> It is the case that in October last year the Government-in-exile organised a Kuwaiti people's conference in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, in which the final communique promised adherence to the principle of consultation with the people and popular participation under the 1962 constitution. It was the case that the Crown Prince and the then Prime Minister-the Government has since been in the process of being reconstituted-promised that elections would be held as soon as the situation in Kuwait allowed it. Again, there have been subsequent reaffirmations by the Emir of Kuwait of his commitment to restore a parliamentary system under the 1962 constitution.</PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the specific question about votes for women, many of whom played a very active role in the Kuwaiti opposition to Iraq's invasion, the Emir has said that, although this was not in the constitution of 1962, on which they are presently hanging these promises, it would be possible to think about it in the future. Again in February we had the Crown Prince indicating that the question of broadening the electoral franchise could be addressed at an appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia for its part takes the view that there should be no obstacles in the way of women playing an absolutely full and complete role in the totality of the life of their country. We simply hope that, with the increasingly strong voice that is becoming apparent from opposition groups within the Kuwaiti policy and with the obvious very widespread international view that, as I have said on previous occasions, the Gulf war was not conducted in order to make the world safe for feudalism, under those circumstances those pressures will combine to produce a situation where the rights of women, including the franchise, are fully respected in the not too distant future.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everybody, I think, is fairly aware of this issue because of a program which was conducted on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In fact, I even heard some people talking about it at the Boy Charlton swimming pool at lunchtime last week, and it seems to have got itself into the popular psyche. The commercialisation of gene shears and the various reports and comments relating to the recent announcement that Johnson and Johnson would be investing in the technology have received a lot of public comment. Some of the reports, however, have claimed that the participation of Johnson and Johnson and the French company, Limograin, would mean that Australia would miss out on the benefits of the technology, and these claims are exaggerated and wide of the mark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many Ministers-particularly the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Crean, and I-have expressed regret at the lack of a private Australian partner in Gene Shears Ltd, which is the company commercialising the technology. However, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)-a major shareholder in Gene Shears-is still ensuring that Australia will be a major beneficiary. In the absence of local interest and expertise, foreign investment is essential in order to maximise the return to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> International developments in genetic technologies are proceeding at such a pace that if Australia were to wait for a local investor to come forward it would risk missing the boat entirely with the technology. Instead, Australia is already profiting from the multi-million dollar investment in research by Johnson and Johnson and Limograin. Much of this investment will go to research in Australian laboratories, giving us a return many times over the cost of the original research that led to the technology. However, a condition of the investment by both Johnson and Johnson and Limograin is that manufacture of any commercial products based on the technology should take place in Australia, wherever commercially feasible.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, through CSIRO's considerable equity in Gene Shears, the possibility remains for an Australian company to invest in this company. The problem of a lack of investment in research and development by Australian companies has received considerable attention from the Government and was most recently addressed in the industry statement. Similarly, CSIRO has just completed an exhaustive study of national research priorities and is also seeking to bring Australian industry into fields of promising research earlier in the research process than previously. I am very hopeful that these measures will, over time, increase Australia's ability to profit from innovations of this kind.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the question, I hope I will not have to put up with the same barrage from the Opposition that I have had to put up with in answering the last three questions. The Opposition claims to be concerned about freedom of speech. The Opposition's behaviour this afternoon in not allowing me to get one word out puts the lie to any concern it might really have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I remind the Senate that it was the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which reported both to this place and to the House of Representatives, that made the point that the Government had to address both the costs of campaigning and disclosure. These are the two major issues confronting our democratic system and confronting democratic systems throughout the world. That is why only three or four other countries throughout the world allow paid political advertising. These countries have recognised the corruptive influence of the need for the corporate dollar to fund campaigns and have done something about it.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of electronic advertising, the rate of increase in that advertising has increased far in excess of public funding. I can understand the Liberal Party having absolutely no concern for public spending, until it has to put its hand in the till, but public funding has been introduced to ensure that the process of campaigning does not have to depend on outside influences as much as it has done in the past. If one looks at the rate of increase of advertising rates on radio and television, one will see that over the initial three or four years of application of public funding advertising rates have increased somewhere like three to five times the increase in public funding. Advertising rates are massive. At the last election campaign they exploded to somewhere near $20m for the four major political parties.</PARA>
<PARA> As I say, my information is that television rates have increased at something like three times the rate of public funding, and radio rates have increased at something like five times the rate of public funding.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government is concerned to ensure that not only do we have adequate disclosure, which is something that the Opposition has always objected to and complained about, apart from Dr Hewson, of course, who really does not know where he stands on this issue at the moment, but we are also keen to address an issue that was raised by Commissioner Fitzgerald, the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales and a joint standing committee of this Parliament, and that is the costs of campaigning. We have done that. We are doing that by addressing the costs of electronic advertising rates and, as a consequence, we have adopted the position of banning advertising in this medium.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, however, we recognise that public funding has in no way kept up with the rate of increase of public office campaigning. As I say, in those two avenues the rate of increase has been somewhere between three and five times the rate of public funding increase. The Government justifies its decision on those grounds.</PARA>
<PARA> I accept that if you come from a position, as the Opposition does, where you do not believe in public funding-it has opposed it consistently-if you come from a position where you do not believe in disclosure, and the Opposition has opposed that consistently at State and Federal level, and if you come from a position directly emanating from that, that is you do not believe in keeping the electoral system clean, honest and open, then you may raise these sorts of issues, but our position is sustainable in the context of increasing campaigning costs.</PARA>

In comparison with that, the discussions with the Democrats have proceeded fruitfully because of one premise-that is, a common understanding of the issues, a common concern to ensure that the political process is sanitised against political corruption, both currently and in the future, and an understanding of the issues that go to the heart of the democratic system. So we have had discussions; I do not shy away from that. But there is nothing in those discussions that would allude to any inference that Senator Macdonald would like to draw.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Commissioner of Taxation issued Taxation Ruling No. IT 2561 on 21 September 1989, following the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Gray and Anor v. F.C. of T 89 ATC 4640. The effect of the Ruling is that the Commissioner considers the grant of a profit a prendre such as the grant of a right to remove standing timber (as opposed to the sale of the timber), constitutes the creation and disposal of an asset separate from the land affected by that right. The owner of the land may be liable to capital gains tax on any amount received in respect of the grant, irrespective of when the land was acquired.</PARA>
<PARA>The view differs from that conveyed by the Treasurer in November 1986 in reply to a parliamentary question. The Commissioner of Taxation then considered that such grants constituted a part disposal of the land, and so would not be brought to tax under the capital gains and losses provisions where the land was acquired before 20 September 1985. This opinion was based on the Commissioner's interpretation of the law at that time. The decision in Gray's case has caused the Commissioner to re-evaluate his previously stated position, and this is reflected in the Taxation Ruling.</PARA>
<PARA>As the honourable Senator will be aware, the Commissioner is required to apply the law as enacted by Parliament and interpreted by the courts. In recognition of the fact that the Commissioner had revised his previous interpretation in light of the court's decision, the application of the views contained in the Ruling was properly made prospective from the date of its release.</PARA>
<PARA>Whether the decision in Gray's case and the Commissioner's subsequent ruling has resulted in a reluctance by farmers to grant rights to take standing timber, with a corresponding long term increase in demand on national estate forests, cannot be concluded from the information presently available to the Treasurer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 February and again on 6 March, Senator Harradine asked me several questions relating to the provision of child-care and the Government's policy in relation to that. I undertook to seek further information from the Minister. I have received further information and I seek leave to incorporate the answer I received in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Response:</PARA>
<PARA>1. The Government's primary objective in funding child care is to assist families with dependent children to participate in the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Government believes that all families should receive support and encouragement and provides them with considerable financial assistance. Most one income and many two income families receive family allowance, while low income working families may be eligible to receive the family allowance supplement. The dependent spouse rebate, which is not means tested, is also available in respect of a spouse who remains at home.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Child care is also available for non working families through the Government's child care strategies, particularly for needy families. Under the national child care strategy (NCCS) the Commonwealth is providing 2 000 new places dedicated to occasional care (non work related care), increasing the number of places dedicated to that form of care to around 7 000 by the end of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA> The 1990 election promise to further increase the supply of child care does not include any dedicated occasional care places. However, it does include 20 000 additional places in long day care centres and family day care schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> Non work related care is also available in long day care centres and in family day care</PARA>
<PARA> - the 1989 census of government-funded child care centres indicates that approximately 16% of care provided in long day care centres and 9% in family day care is for non-work related purposes;</PARA>
<PARA> accordingly, the provision of non work related care will continue to grow as the Government increases the supply of child care.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine's calculations of 6% of expenditure on occasional care in 1989-90 and 4.1% in 1990-91, relate only to expenditure on dedicated places. They do not therefore accurately reflect government outlays on this care type. His figures do not take account of expenditure on non work related care through long day care centres, both commercial and non profit, and family day care schemes.</PARA>
<PARA>3. Senator Harradine has asked if the Government has considered a voucher system for occasional care. The Government has considered and rejected this approach to funding child care on the grounds that it would not increase supply of care without a significant inflationary effect on fees and thus price low income families out of the market.</PARA>
<PARA> Existing government policy aims at improving supply through growth strategies funded jointly with the States/Territories and at providing fee relief through eligible service providers. Fee relief is available to non work related and work related users of eligible services and makes care affordable for families on low and middle incomes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 March, Senator Alston asked a question about the youth homeless allowance (YHA), which I have an answer to. In March 1991, 3,900 young people were receiving YHA from the Department. Over the 12-month period from February 1990 to February 1991, the number of homeless young people receiving YHA from the Department of Social Security increased from 2,300 to that figure, an increase of 72 per cent. Since mid-1989, the numbers have almost doubled. In the 1990 academic year, some 5,500 young people aged under 18 years were granted Austudy at the homeless rate. The figures are encouraging because they show that more young people now receive the payments to which they are entitled. We have also improved the service they get from my Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge, however, that there are many young people whom we are not yet reaching. Because we know many homeless youth have trouble dealing with bureaucracies, my Department has taken a number of steps in conjunction with other Commonwealth departments to develop information better tailored to meet their needs. We intend to do even more to help them understand and deal with our procedures, particularly when they have to establish proof of identity, which is often raised as a major barrier to responding quickly to their needs.</PARA>
<PARA> Further, we are undertaking some pilot projects. In Victoria, for example, specialist youth officers have been appointed in four regional offices. In Sydney we are experimenting with getting out of the office and providing services to young people in hostels and drop-in centres. Since the Burdekin report, we have reduced waiting periods, increased rates and introduced an independent rate of job search allowance. However, the Government acknowledges that there is still much more to be done so that the lives of homeless youth can be made less difficult. I regard that area as a priority in my portfolio.</PARA>

<PARA> John Robert Kerr was born on 24 September 1914 at Balmain, New South Wales, and educated at Fort Street High School. He studied law at Sydney University and had a brilliant academic record. He was admitted to the New South Wales bar in 1938, but temporarily suspended his legal career in 1942 when he joined the army. Until 1945 he was involved in intelligence work with the wartime Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs. Nineteen forty-six saw him appointed first Principal of the Australian School of Pacific Administration and then Organising Secretary of the South Pacific Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> He resumed his legal career in Sydney in 1948, specialising in industrial law. His career continued to prosper and he took silk in 1953. During the 1960s he held several public offices, including President of the New South Wales Bar Association, President of the Law Council of Australia and President of the Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> He transferred to Canberra in 1966 and until 1972 was a judge in the Commonwealth Industrial Court and the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. He was also a judge in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory from 1970 to 1972. His distinguished tenure as Chief Justice of New South Wales from 1972 to 1974 included a review and update of the New South Wales court structure. In 1973 he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales and on 27 February 1974 he was appointed Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John Kerr was an active and energetic Governor-General who took a genuine interest in people from all walks of life. He travelled widely throughout the country and promoted vigorously Australia's interests abroad. His dismissal of the Whitlam Government in 1975 will remain a matter of debate in this country for as long as politics is discussed. Sir John was a prominent Australian whose interests were diverse and varied. Outside the legal profession he was involved with organisations dealing with subjects such as copyright, medicine and the armed services. He also took a personal interest in, and had a strong concern for, Aboriginal issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout his public life Sir John maintained an active interest and involvement in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in Papua New Guinea. He made a contribution towards enhancing Australia's role in the region and will be missed by his many friends in the region. He received a number of overseas distinctions, including honorary life membership of the Law Society of England and Wales and honorary membership of the American Bar Association. </PARA>
<PARA> The high regard in which he was held was also reflected in the many honours bestowed upon him throughout his long career in public service. He was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1966, a Knight Commander of that Order in 1974 and a Knight Grand Cross in 1976. He was also made a Knight of the Order of Australia in 1976. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Opposition senators, I support the motion of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) to express our sincere regret at the death of Sir John Kerr on 24 March at the age of 76. He is entitled to be remembered for his lifetime of public service. Senator Button has outlined to the chamber today some of that long and meritorious service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any review of the life of Sir John Kerr it would be easy to focus on the constitutional crisis of 1975 but this was a small part of a life marked by many outstanding achievements, both academic and professional. Sir John Kerr was a man of distinction in many fields. As was mentioned by Senator Button, he was an outstanding student academically, first at Fort Street Boys High School and later at the University of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1942, already a brilliant lawyer, having been admitted to the Bar of New South Wales four years earlier, he joined the Army as Private Kerr. Almost immediately he went to work for the Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs and, once again, was outstandingly successful. He eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He became the first Principal of the Australian School of Pacific Administration when he left the Army in 1945. In 1948 he became Organising Secretary of the South Pacific Commission. In 1948 he returned to the legal profession and within five years was made a King's Counsel. John Kerr had always been deeply involved in politics and was widely known as a Labor lawyer until he resigned from the Australian Labor Party in 1956. </PARA>
<PARA> Thereafter, he was involved with an extraordinarily diverse range of activities in the 1950s and 1960s: President of the New South Wales Bar Association; Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia and subsequently its President; foundation President of Lawasia, the Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific; President of the Industrial Relations Society, which I think he helped found; and a high office-bearer in organisations dealing with an amazingly diverse range of subjects. After six years as a judge with the Commonwealth Industrial Court and the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, in 1972 he was appointed the Chief Justice of New South Wales. His knighthood was conferred in January 1974. He was appointed Governor-General in 1974 by the Whitlam Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this period in Australia's history was extraordinary, culminating in the use by Sir John Kerr of the reserve powers of the Crown to dismiss the Whitlam Government in 1975. His actions in that decision-making process are, and remain, the focus of much debate today. However, it should be remembered that this was not a constitutional crisis of Sir John Kerr's making. He had a function under the Constitution to make certain decisions to preserve constitutional government at that time, which decisions he made to dismiss the Prime Minister, who could not get Supply but who was not in those circumstances prepared to put himself before the people and go to an election.</PARA>
<PARA> The dismissal was on the basis that the new Prime Minister would immediately call an election, which duly occurred, and the people clearly vindicated the decision of Sir John Kerr. There is no doubt that the reserve powers of the Crown are a difficult area of constitutional law. There will always remain room for debate on their interpretation and their exercise. However, as we look back at the career of Sir John Kerr, it is important to remember that in that very difficult circumstance he was one who did his duty-a duty that the high office of Governor-General imposed a responsibility to fulfil. </PARA>
<PARA> He behaved thereafter, I might say, with immeasurable dignity in the face of a most vicious and unrelenting campaign of personal vilification. That vilification is something that I, as an Australian, and my Party very much regret. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John Kerr's many exceptional qualities were spoken of by his friends at his memorial service last weekend. He will be remembered privately as a warm and gentle man who was devoted to his family. Publicly, we should remember him as an outstanding Australian whose achievements throughout his lifetime are worthy of our deepest admiration and respect. On behalf of the Opposition senators, I extend to Sir John's widow and his children our most sincere condolences in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the National Party of Australia in the Senate, I wish to express our deepest sympathy on the death of Sir John Kerr. Sir John had a distinguished career in both the law and public administration. The list of his contributions to Australian public life covers a wide range. During and after the Second World War he was active in shaping Australia's policy in the Pacific. In 1948 he returned to the legal profession, becoming a Queen's Counsel-in those days it was a King's Counsel-in 1953. He held many executive positions in Australian legal associations, including President of the New South Wales Bar Association, President of the Law Council of Australia and foundation President of the Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a judge he served on the Commonwealth Industrial Court and the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, having been appointed in 1966. He also served as a judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. In 1972 he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and he is credited with bringing many reforms into its administration. Sir John was appointed a Commander of St Michael and St George in 1966 and a Knight of St Michael and St George in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> His appointment as Governor-General on 27 February 1974, although unknown to him at the time, was to see his involvement in an era that became a difficult period in Australia's constitutional history. It was in the Senate chamber, on 11 July 1974, that Sir John Kerr was sworn in as Governor-General. As history now records, it was in the Senate where the constitutional power was implemented which led to the events that were to surround Sir John Kerr with controversy for the rest of his life. In this unprecedented time in Federal political history, Sir John Kerr was duty-bound in the circumstances-and he was a man of duty. To do what the Governor-General was appointed to do-to uphold the Australian Constitution-must have involved a gigantic personal struggle for Sir John, with his Labor background. To make the decision in the exercise of his reserve power as Her Majesty's representative must have required enormous personal courage, as later events have revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John Kerr did not create the situation which he felt duty-bound to resolve. The principle of the preservation of the powers of the Parliament over the executive arm of government will always be the basis of our parliamentary democracy. Sir John Kerr always acted with great dignity. His book on the controversial times, Matters for Judgment, published in 1978, as time passes and history assesses, will no doubt form a valuable account of this major event in Australian parliamentary and constitutional history. </PARA>
<PARA> On the passing of Sir John Kerr it would only be fitting to refer to his interest in and contributions to law reform, his skills in advocacy and his positive achievements in relation to the Australia-Pacific region. To have achieved so much in a lifetime is his testimony. On behalf of the National Party in the Senate, I extend my sympathy to Lady Kerr and his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). Sir John Kerr was Governor-General of this country from 1974 to 1977. His distinguished career in the law and his receipt of many honours throughout his life have been outlined by earlier speakers. He is remembered by many. In particular he is remembered in New South Wales for his significant contribution as Chief Justice of that State in the years preceding his appointment to the governor-generalship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at that career as it was outlined in the editorial of the Melbourne Age upon his appointment, because in the case of Sir John Kerr all too often it is clear that events in his life post-1975 achieved greater prominence than events before that time. It is worth remembering what was said in the Age:</PARA>
<PARA> His career has been remarkable, at times even controversial-</PARA>
<PARA>that was in 1974-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a brilliant student, a youthful colonel on Blamey's staff in New Guinea, first principal of the School of Pacific Studies, adviser to Australia's first United Nations delegation, organising secretary of the South Pacific Commission, prominent industrial advocate at the NSW Bar, Federal judge, member of the Trade Practices Tribunal and in charge of several Federal committees of inquiry. His other interests and offices have spanned professional associations, marriage guidance, the theatre, industrial relations and cultural freedom. </PARA>
<PARA>The Age in its editorial expected Sir John to serve in his new post with distinction and flair. Then we may look at the comments of Sir John himself upon his resignation in 1977. He described his period as Governor-General as the most stimulating and challenging in his life and pointed out that he felt that the first three years of his Governor-Generalship had crowded in such action and experience as would be exceptional if spread over a much longer period of tenure. That was his comment on his resignation. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said, and as Senator Button has said in this place, his actions in dismissing the Whitlam Government will remain a matter of debate for as long as politics are discussed in this country. This was a man who found his role stimulating and challenging, a man who had a distinguished career, as I have said, in the law and who received many honours. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I express our condolences to the family of the late Sir John Kerr. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to pay tribute to the life and work of Sir John Kerr. Sir John could be fairly called, in my view, a great Australian. Through no fault of his own, he was at the centre of the most dramatic constitutional crisis in our history. Sir John Kerr is entitled to the epithet `great' because of his courage and judgment. By the application of proper constitutional principles, he brought about a resolution of the serious crisis in which we found ourselves in 1975. Sir John Kerr would not be intimidated either by the bullying of a Prime Minister or the braying of the mob. On leaving public office, Sir John was subjected to unprecedented venom and rancour, which were heaped on him by those who were incapable of understanding the real essence of 1975. The restraint with which he conducted himself in the years since, despite immense provocation, revealed a man of great inner strength and dignity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent days I have had the opportunity to read about the 1975 crisis again, including commentaries by Manning Clark, Donald Horne's Death of the Lucky Country and, of course, Sir John Kerr's own book, Matters for Judgment. All of those who lived through those dramatic times of October and November 1975 will have formed strong views on the issues and individuals directly involved in the crisis. The decade and a half which has passed has allowed us all to develop a clearer perspective on the significance of those events. For example, I think there is widespread acceptance now that Sir John Kerr's actions were soundly based on constitutional principles. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of some significance that a former Whitlam Minister, John Wheeldon, has also argued:</PARA>
<PARA>Any government functioning under the Westminster system that tries to hold on to office without having its Budget accepted by Parliament for as long as we did ought to have been dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA>John Wheeldon in the same article pointed out that Senator Ken Wriedt, Australian Labor Party Leader in the Senate, also believed that rather than following Whitlam's course of `toughing it out', the Government should have sought a double dissolution as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate over the crisis in 1975 now seems to focus on whether Sir John should have given some prior warning to Mr Whitlam. Sir John Kerr in his book Matters for Judgment looks closely at this issue and, in my view, correctly argues that such an action would not only have been improper but, given the then Prime Minister's attitudes, would have led to a further deepening of the crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Sir John Kerr strengthened our democracy by ensuring that the people were called upon to determine a deadlock between the Houses. He reaffirmed a vital principle of responsible government-that no government can carry on without supply where supply is denied by an elected House with the constitutional power to do so. As a result, he ensured that no executive government in Australia will now ever again assume that it is above the Parliament. To my mind, he showed the strength rather than the weakness of our system of government. The reserve powers of the Governor-General can be a great force for democracy. As the great Canadian constitutional expert, Dr Eugene Forsey, has observed:</PARA>
<PARA>The reserve power is indeed, under our Constitution, an absolutely essential safeguard of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>It is the rubber stamp theory which is undemocratic. It makes existing governments irremovable, except by their own consent. Such a doctrine is a travesty of democracy. It delivers every Opposition gagged and bound into the hands of its opponents. </PARA>
<PARA>In paying tribute to Sir John Kerr there are two particular observations I would like to make to the Senate today. The first is that Sir John Kerr's decision in November 1975 was not only correct legally but it has also stood the test of time. How often were we told in the months, indeed years, following the 1975 crisis that Australian democracy had been irretrievably damaged. A number of our prominent academics and lawyers made comments which bordered on the hysterical. We were on the point of revolution; Australia would become a polarised society; our political institutions had been damaged beyond repair. These were typical of the arguments that were widely canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA> From the perspective of 1991, we can see how foolish these predictions were, and how wrong. Were our institutions damaged? The standing of the Senate, if anything, has risen in public esteem. Most people continue to support its role, as evidenced by the electoral rejection of constitutional proposals which may have diminished it. Was the office of Governor-General damaged? Was the monarchy damaged? Donald Horne argued that Australia had become a `Governor-Generalate'. The office of Governor-General holds the respect and affection of our people. One of the major participants in the 1975 crisis, Bill Hayden, was honoured to accept this position. There was probably more discussion about republicanism in 1890 than in 1990. Was the Labor Party destroyed? Let us recall that Donald Horne told us:</PARA>
<PARA>It was not only the Labor Party that was being destroyed but the sense of trust of hundreds of thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Labor Party itself quickly recovered and within eight years of the dismissal returned to government. In the 1980s it achieved a political dominance in both the Federal and State arenas that it had never accomplished before and, we hope, will never accomplish again. </PARA>
<PARA> Were the people alienated from our system? Donald Horne spoke of the `extreme alienation of many Australians from their own political system'. Manning Clark told us:</PARA>
<PARA>December 13 1975 will go down in history as the day which converted the radicals from the ballot box to industrial action, from Parliament to direct action. </PARA>
<PARA>If anything, those who like to call themselves progressives have spent much of the last decade bemoaning the lack of radical activity among our youth in the 1980s compared with the 1960s. Sir John Kerr understood far more clearly what was at stake in 1975 than the Manning Clarks and the Donald Hornes. He made the point in his book:</PARA>
<PARA>A significant point about 1975 is that we were confronted by the prospect of a disaster which did not occur. The very real dangers that threatened were avoided at the last moment. In the result it is now difficult to remember how truly threatening that crisis was. We can remember terrible tragedies, depressions and wars which actually happened but it is harder to remember crises which would have been disastrous had they happened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Mr President, and I think it is appalling that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, knowing that there was not a point of order, chose to rise on this particular occasion. Sir John continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The blade may pass within a millimetre, but we will not remember it, because it did not strike. It now requires a positive act of imagination as well as of memory to appreciate how frightening the crisis would have been had things gone really wrong in 1975. The ultimate reason why our stability was not undermined is that the disaster was not allowed to happen.</PARA>
<PARA>It has to be said that the behaviour of some of our leading people and academics during and after 1975 shows once again how wise the Australian people are to hold their views so lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> The second and concluding observation I wish to make relates to the behaviour of Sir John Kerr's detractors in the last decade and a half. Interestingly, in the same article by John Wheeldon which I quoted, he commences with a comment about another famous dismissal-that of Lord Melbourne by King William in 1834. He pointed out that Lord Melbourne and his colleagues were clearly annoyed with the King's actions but accepted their fate with little fuss, and John Wheeldon said:</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that they assumed, rightly, that the Tories who took their place would not last forever. </PARA>
<PARA> `I hate to be considered ill-used', Melbourne told one of his women friends. `I have always thought complaints of ill-usage contemptible, whether from a seduced, disappointed girl or a turned-out prime minister'. </PARA>
<PARA>Coming from a former Whitlam Minister, John Wheeldon's comments are particularly interesting and no doubt are causing great embarrassment to Senator Schacht. Mr Whitlam clearly felt ill used. Along with former Senator Jim McClelland, he led one of the most contemptible attacks on an individual in Australian political history. </PARA>
<PARA> I can think of no other public figure who has been subjected to such long lasting and malicious abuse. I invite honourable senators to read Hansard of early 1978, which records for posterity the bitterness, meanness and viciousness of the attacks on Sir John Kerr. It was interesting that Manning Clark on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 7.30 Report last week suggested that members of the Labor movement:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . were very vindictive with him and, whether they were right and morally justified in doing that it is for them to decide. It was not a very pleasant sight the way they hounded him. </PARA>
<PARA>While we welcome his more moderate statements today, it has to be said that Manning Clark's own extravagant pamphleteering on behalf of Whitlam helped encourage the vindictive attitudes shown towards Sir John Kerr. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate about great public events will inevitably continue but this is different from hounding the participants in those events. It has generally been the practice in Australia and indeed in all great democracies that our leaders, once they retire from public office, should be allowed to resume their lives free of persecution and hounding by their opponents. </PARA>
<PARA> Let it be said that all of us in this chamber have a great personal interest in this convention. It is a sad fact of political life that few, if any, politicians leave high office without having offended at least some powerful interest groups or individuals. One of the costs of 1975 was that any future Governor-General, Governor, Prime Minister or High Court judge who is faced with a public issue of great controversy may well have in his mind not only the clear arguments in favour or against a particular action but must now weigh them against the nagging thought that the behaviour meted out to Sir John Kerr may well be his lot as well. We can only hope that he or she will have the strength of character of Sir John Kerr. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John Kerr never stooped to the level of his detractors. The article written by a former judge, Kenneth Gee, and published in the Weekend Australian recently, showed the real qualities of the man who will go down in history as a great Governor-General. At Sir John Kerr's greatest test, the words of Martin Luther in 1521 seem appropriate:</PARA>
<PARA>On this I take my stand, I can do no other. </PARA>
<PARA>Jim McClelland and the others who followed his example could not understand this simple principle. The principle is this: given the choice between duty to a political party and duty to the nation, there are men who recognise the higher loyalty. Sir John Kerr was such a man. It is therefore appropriate that we honour his memory today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also would like to associate myself with this motion of condolence. I support the words of my colleague from Victoria, Senator Kemp. He has put the case extraordinarily well. There is no doubt that in 1975 Sir John Kerr was faced with an extraordinarily difficult task; one which few Governor-Generals have had to face. He acted constitutionally and took what is now acknowledged-by most of those who understand what the subject is all about-to be the only course that was then open to him. However, for doing that, he was hounded by such people as former Senator McClelland and a number of others. I remember the way they spoke in 1978 in this chamber and it was shameful to hear them talking about someone who had been a former colleague. As I understand it, the major problem with Senator McClelland-he had his other own personal problems-was that he recommended the appointment of Sir John to Mr Whitlam and he certainly spoke foully about Sir John Kerr.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But then that haranguing continued, and the media had much to do with that. The media, which was brought up under their university socialist lecturers of the 1950s and 1960s to believe all was good, right and proper on the side of the Australian Labor Party and all was wrong with anyone who opposed in any way any of the actions of the Australian Labor Party, continued to hound Sir John. I would like to say to his family that it is my firm belief that the silent majority was strongly in favour of what he had done, as they proved in the election of 1975. The silent majority remained in support of his actions then and the silent majority have had sympathy for him ever since then. I am sure that many of them, like me, were upset and distressed to read and see in some of the newspapers and television productions the media continuing, even after his death, to harangue this fine Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, the debate on this constitutional matter is not whether or not a Governor-General should have the powers that he had and exercised, because that is acknowledged on all sides, but how to ensure that a Governor-General, who has these reserve powers and who retains all the powers that he has today-whether that be under a system such as it is at the present moment with a monarchy, or whether it be under an independent republic of Australia-in the future is able to retain his independence from the Prime Minister of the day. Of course, that is the crucial factor that will occur in any debate about future constitutional alterations in relation to the position of Governor-General of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the interesting points I wish to raise is that my leader today mentioned Sir John's lifetime of public service. I was not a member of the Cabinet at that stage, but I did speak with the then Prime Minister about Sir John's appointment to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). I was told that Sir John wanted to continue to serve Australia and had asked for an appointment that would enable him to continue to serve Australians and his nation. He was offered the appointment at UNESCO and that same group of people-that same media-hounded him so much in this country that ultimately he felt that he had to decline the offer. What a tragedy that was because he did not really understand, in my view, that there were just so many people in the community who felt that he was a fine person who was being unfairly hounded. I certainly wish to offer my sympathy to his widow and his family. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Button read the curriculum vitae of Sir John Kerr which showed what a fine man of the law Sir John was. In addition to the contribution that he made to the legal profession, he was an Australian who was called upon to serve his nation in a way that most lawyers are not. He was asked to make the decision which showed that our Constitution worked. He made a decision that was correct in law and right for Australia. When he ended the loans affair scandal and sacked the Government and sent the politicians to the electorate-which concurred with Sir John Kerr's decision-there was a landslide victory for Malcolm Fraser. But he was hounded. He was hounded by those who found that hatred replaced logic. He paid a penalty for having acted correctly and with courage when Australia needed him to act. </PARA>

<PARA> I had the pleasure of meeting Sir John on several occasions in recent years, particularly when attending dinners organised by the Australian Association for Cultural Freedom. At those dinners I certainly had the opportunity to recognise his intellect and, of course, become aware of his deep integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> What must be remembered at this time of remembrance of Sir John Kerr is that the constitutional crisis was created by politicians but, particularly, by two political leaders. The rights and wrongs of their actions rest with them. The issue was created by them. What had to be resolved lawfully and constitutionally by the Governor-General was, in fact, resolved with courage and integrity, and resolved totally correctly. To seek to divert any animus about the outcome of that disagreement and to try to divert responsibility for the perceived wrongs of that event to the person who resolved the problem is, of course, disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA> Creating a figure of hatred is an ancient political device used cynically to remove intellectual effort and honest debate. Hitler used it to effect against the Jews in pre-war Germany. Sir John Kerr's death has removed such a cynically created hate figure from the Australian scene and, hopefully, political debate will now proceed at a higher intellectual level, free of the sort of animus that was disgracefully and deliberately created around the figure of Sir John Kerr, the man who acted with proprietary and decency. My hopes are that political debate can now proceed free of that animus. At times today I fear that that may not be so. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard Senator Walsh's speech, and if Senator Kemp had listened to it very carefully he would have heard that it was extremely brief, and he did not blame Sir John Kerr for being the person mainly culpable for the events of 1975. Senator Kemp may not agree with his remarks about the Chief Justice, but his remarks were extremely brief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I found interesting was that Senator Kemp read from a very long speech. Clearly, irrespective of what Senator Walsh had said, Senator Kemp was going to say what he did in fact say, and had prepared to say it many hours beforehand. I heard his speech, in which he used a condolence motion as the basis to vent his spleen against politicians formerly serving in this Parliament, and I believe that he is the one who went way beyond the bounds of what is normally a condolence motion and was starting to debate the events of 1975. Therefore, I do not believe that some of those remarks can go unanswered on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Walsh that Sir John Kerr did not make the crisis in 1975. That was made by the conservative senators in this chamber who chose to follow the direction of Malcolm Fraser not in defeating or blocking supply, but in deferring it. They did not have enough votes to actually block it. All they could do was adjourn the debate, and that is certainly on the record. To say that the Parliament blocked supply is factually incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> Former Senator Jessop made it quite clear on the public record that if the matter had gone on for another week before the Governor-General had intervened, he would have changed his vote, and the Australian Labour Party Government only needed one Opposition senator to change the vote for the Budget to be carried. One could argue that Sir John's intervention-at a time before Supply had actually run out, even though it had been deferred-was precipitant but that is a matter of judgment, to use the title of Sir John's own book. I agree with some of the remarks made by senators opposite that the blame resides with the politicians, and resides overwhelmingly with the members of the Senate who chose to defer the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also say that there is one area where I think Sir John can be criticised with considerable merit. I understand that in the House of Representatives today a former independent Liberal senator in this chamber, Mr Steele Hall, now the Liberal member for Boothby, pointed this out. In fact, Sir John's error as the vice-regal representative was that he did not warn and counsel the Prime Minister of the action he might take. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people have said in this debate that Sir John was afraid that Mr Whitlam would take other action. But whatever action he was afraid of, it is quite clear that according to an all constitutional convention-if one goes back to Bagehot and other British constitutional experts who have been quoted, and the 1834 example of Lord Melbourne-the power of the vice regal representative is to warn and counsel the Prime Minister, or the leader of the government represented in the Parliament. That is something Sir John did not do. I think that is the major error that can clearly be seen in his actions; but that is only after the blame must be sheeted to where it resides absolutely-and that is on the Opposition side of the chamber in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the debates that will take place in the 1990s-and there is some indication that even conservative members of this Parliament, such as Mr John Howard and Dr Hewson, are now willing to think, for the first time, about constitutional change-leading to the centenary of our Federation, will look at the issue of how our Constitution works and at the role and responsibility of the Governor- General. As Senator Austin Lewis quite rightly points out, even if we had a republic and a president, the president's powers would have to be defined. In my view, they would have to be made explicit so that everybody knew exactly what the ground rules were. In my view, that would be a very sensible constitutional amendment that we should all consider, because the events of 1975 may occur again. Who knows-the next time around Senator Kemp's side may be on the receiving end of the powers of the Senate against the democratically elected majority in the lower House. As some people say quite cynically, the only time at which conservatives in Australia will be willing to consider appropriate amendments to the operation of this Constitution may be when those opposite pay the penalty, as the Whitlam Government did in 1975.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the events of 1975 will not be repeated because enough conservatives got a shock at the reaction in the community to realise that ripping up the conventions is just not worth the risk. I do not think those events will occur again, but I do not believe we should say to the Australian community that we should ignore the need for constitutional change in this country. I believe that the centenary of Federation, 1 January 2001, is the date that we should aim at for having achieved major reform of our Constitution-100 years on from its establishment. I make no bones about the fact that I would like to see a republic declared on that day, with a president, with codified and clearly defined powers which will ensure, above all else, that the Senate does not have the irresponsible power to bring down a democratically elected government in the lower House. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not aiming to speak on this condolence motion but others on the other side have used the opportunity to go on at some length. In conclusion, I take this opportunity to say that the family of Sir John Kerr has my sympathy. In a country such as Australia, which is a democracy, despite any number of events, I do not believe that people on any side of politics relish or welcome the death of anybody as a resolution of a political difficulty or a way of getting even for a previous political event. I am certainly not one of those and, therefore, I pass my sympathy to the family of Sir John Kerr. The leaders of the various parties who spoke to this condolence motion spoke appropriately, but it is unfortunate that after that-led by Senator Kemp and his ilk-the debate degenerated into a rehash of 1975. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join my colleagues in expressing my condolences to Lady Kerr on the death of Sir John Kerr. There can be no greater accolade given to any man than for it to be said of him that he was a great and courageous Australian and a loving and much loved father and husband. This he certainly was. Lady Kerr must be very proud of her husband, knowing full well that, although his decision in the 1975 crisis was a controversial one, no-one-I repeat no-one-has ever challenged the validity of his actions. Sir John knew that the course he took was correct, as did every other Australian. If this was not so his actions would have been challenged in the courts: they never were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir John Kerr's credentials for his appointment as Governor-General were impeccable, as the then Prime Minister's statement prior to Sir John's appointment showed. That statement outlined Sir John's career until 1974. It read:</PARA>
<PARA>It is announced today from Government House, Canberra, that Her Majesty the Queen has graciously approved the appointment of the Hon. Sir John Kerr, k.c.m.g., to be Governor-General of Australia. He will take up office at the end of June this year when the present Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, relinquishes his appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John has been Chief Justice of New South Wales and Lieutenant-Governor since 1972. He has had a distinguished career in both the law and public administration. After war service with the Second A.I.F., Sir John was the first Principal of the Australian School of Pacific Administration. He then followed a distinguished career at the Bar in New South Wales, becoming a Queen's Counsel in 1953. In 1966 he was appointed a Judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. He has also served as a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory and has held other Australian judicial commissions. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John has held a number of executive positions in the legal profession, including President of the New South Wales Bar Association, President of the Law Council of Australia and foundation President of the Law Association of Asia and the Western Pacific. He has also served on a number of Government bodies, including, in 1968 as Chairman of the Committee on Review of Administration Decisions, and in 1970 as Chairman of the Committee on Review of Pay for the Armed Services. In 1971 he conducted an inquiry into the salaries and allowances of Members of the Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John was appointed c.m.g. in 1966 and k.c.m.g. this year. Sir John's significant attainments in the field of law and administration have given him a familiarity with Australian Government and State Government affairs and he is of course, well known throughout Australia. All Australians will join me in congratulating Sir John and welcoming him and Lady Kerr to their high appointments. </PARA>
<PARA>It is extremely disappointing to me that the Australian media has focused on, and indeed distorted, the private family fune- ral held prior to the memorial service last Saturday and claimed that Sir John was lonely, friendless and a recluse. A close friend of Sir John, Mr Donald Markwell, in his eulogy, laid that claim to rest when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The man I knew was a man who enjoyed life; one whose seriousness was balanced by a buoyant sense of humour and fun-a man who rejoiced in the joy of life. He was no exile, no embittered recluse. In a crisis not of his making he had done his duty as he saw it, conscientiously and courageously, even though he knew he would suffer for it. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the description from a very close friend. His son, Phillip, told of a loving father who had given his children a love of history. Phillip said, `It is history that will ultimately pass judgment on his life'. History, of course, will relate that the Australian people overwhelmingly supported his action on that day in forcing a Government which had no respect for the Constitution of the land to behave according to that Constitution. He did this, as we all know, by dismissing the Government and sending it to the people for judgment. That judgment was made in such overwhelming numbers that the Fraser Government was elected with a greater majority than had occurred at any other time in our history. That was the judgment of the people. My deepest sympathies are with Lady Kerr and her family in their tragic loss. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to briefly associate myself with the motion of condolence on the death of Sir John Kerr and to extend to his widow and family my deep sympathy at this time of sadness for them and for countless other Australians. I think it is unfortunate that most of the concentration of attention on Sir John Kerr has been on the events of 1975. To focus attention on those is to lose the perspective of Sir John's extraordinarily rich, diverse and notable career for many years before that. His career has been chronicled very well here today and I do not propose to go over it again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The events of 1975 occurred at a time when I first came into this Parliament, as did Senator Baume and some other colleagues. The events preceding and following 1975 were of considerable trauma in Australian history and Australian political processes. At that time we had a situation where the Government of the day was a government which, when in Opposition, led by the Prime Minister of 1975, had tried to block supply in this place in 1970. In 1975 the Government placed the Governor-General-who had, of course, been appointed by Prime Minister Whit- lam-in a precarious situation by refusing to call an election. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now a matter of historical record and fact that there is no doubt at all that the action of the Governor-General in 1975 was taken to enable him to protect the Australian democratic system of government. There can be no doubt that the action taken at that time was constitutionally and legally correct. It was extreme, but it was the only possible action that Sir John could have taken in the circumstances, given the responsibilities of his position. He took that action only after great personal consideration and agony. He did the only thing that he and the great majority of other Australians believed to be correct and possible, although not popular. Subsequently, the Australian electors, when given the opportunity to exercise their democratic vote, confirmed the correctness of his decision by electing the Liberal and National Party coalition in a record landslide. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four words or phrases that have been used already in this debate that I have always seen as epitomising Sir John Kerr. The first is `intellect'; the second is `integrity'; the third is `courage'; and the fourth is `correctness of approach and action taken'. Sir John acted at all times in the true spirit of a great Governor-General. He acted for the good of all Australians. He acted to protect our cherished democratic freedoms. He did so at great personal cost and under great pressure at the time. He will, of course, be remembered in an indifferent light by some, but I really do believe that history will record his actions and his life in a much more favourable light. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope I am never again faced with the situation which I experienced in the House of Representatives in the post-1975 years of seeing a man so wrongly vilified and attacked, particularly in 1978, as was referred to earlier today. It was an ongoing attack that lasted for many years and it was a great blight on those who perpetrated it. </PARA>
<PARA> My hope is that no government will ever again act to attempt to bypass the due processes of parliament and our Constitution, that no government will again act to force the Senate to use its considerable powers to trigger a constitutional crisis, as the Government at that time did, compelling the Governor-General to dismiss that Government. Any person in such a position should not be forced into that situation in order to allow the Australian people to have their democratic say. The fact that the Governor-General was forced to exercise that responsibility and the way in which he exercised it showed a very great action of a very cour- ageous man. I join all those on both sides of this chamber in extending my deep sympathy to Sir John's family at this sad time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to speak to this motion of condolence on the death of Sir John Kerr. I observe that Sir John was required to resolve, in my view, what was a political crisis, not a constitutional crisis. There was never a constitutional crisis. There was always an obvious solution. The solution that was not immediately available to the Governor-General, of course, was of the political crisis and that was caused by the nature of a vain and arrogant Prime Minister leading a government that did not understand that it could not govern without supply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suspect that there is not a contemporary, objective commentator who would sensibly take the view that Sir John Kerr did not have the power to do that which he was ultimately required to do. The problem for the Government of that day was that it either did not understand or it ignored the role of the Senate. Perhaps that was manifested by the fact that when the Prime Minister was returning from Government House having been dismissed, he even forgot to tell the Leader of the Government in the Senate at the time, Senator Ken Wriedt, that he had been sacked. Of course, that led to the passing of supply. But it was an example of the contemptuous attitude that the Government had to the bicameral system of government. That arrogance was reflected in the Government's conduct during and subsequent to that time. </PARA>
<PARA> It has never been made clear to me what this Government would have had the Governor-General do. Presumably it would have had him do absolutely nothing and it would have allowed this country to sink inexorably into a political and social imbroglio, the pain of which we would still be feeling now. The Governor-General was obliged to resolve the political crisis by resorting-as he properly did-to the constitutional provisions, which were simply to appoint a Prime Minister who could guarantee supply and then promptly call an election. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem for the Government of the day was that it thought that because Sir John Kerr was its appointment, that made him its person and that because he was its person, he would have compromised his principles and his position and he would do as it wanted, irrespective of whether it was right or wrong. Of course, he showed enormous courage and the integrity which caused him to be appointed in the first place and he did what had to be done with a great deal of dignity. </PARA>
<PARA> The political emotions that ran from the Australian Labor Party following that event sadly showed, in a naked sense, the real nature of some of the members of that Party. I suspect-with the exception of one person who spoke today-that there would not be anyone who would be properly proud of that Government's response and its conduct following that decision when its members reflected the way they did on the Governor-General and not on their own shortcomings. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we all know that there are those in the Labor Party who are great haters. They demonstrated that well from the point of their dismissal to the day of the death of Sir John Kerr. I offer my condolence to his family. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death of the Rt Hon. Viscount De L'Isle, former Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia from 1961 to 1965, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>First Viscount De L'Isle was born William Philip Sidney on 23 May 1909 in England, son of the fifth Baron De L'Isle and Dudley. He was educated at Eton and at Cambridge University and became a chartered accountant after graduating from university. At around the same time he joined the Grenadier Guards Reserve of Officers. During World War II, Major Sidney, as he then was, led a handful of men in the defence of the Anzio beachhead in Italy, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. </PARA>
<PARA> Eight months after Anzio and while still in the Army, he was elected unopposed to the House of Commons as Conservative member for Chelsea. It was not until after his father's death the following year that he took his seat in the House of Lords as the sixth Baron De L'Isle. In 1951 he was appointed Secretary of State for Air under Prime Minister Churchill and held office until 1955. Viscount De L'Isle then turned increasingly to business interests. He held several appointments, among them managing director of Schweppes (Home) Ltd and director of Lloyds Bank. In 1961 he came to Canberra as the fifteenth Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia. He was an enthusiastic and active Governor-General who travelled widely within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On a personal note I remember being in London on one occasion and being told the story of the rather exclusive Brooks Club, where members sit at large tables. On one occasion at lunch someone was laying down the law about Australia. Another person who was sitting at the end of the table said, `I do not think you have got that right'. The first person said, `Well, what would you know about Australia?', to which the reply was, `My name is De L'Isle. I was Governor-General for some years'. That response was true not only of his position but also of the way he carried out his duties as Governor-General in Australia. He was the last Governor-General who was non-resident on his appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> It must also be said that his fondness for Australia was apparent when he returned to Australia for a visit in the late 1960s and again in 1988 when he demonstrated his affection for Australia by presenting a bronze statue for the bicentenary, which stands in the grounds of Government House here in Canberra. On behalf of the Government, I extend our most sincere sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Opposition senators I support the motion of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) expressing our deep regret at the recent death of former Governor-General Viscount De L'Isle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Viscount De L'Isle was the last British Governor-General of Australia. He was appointed Governor-General in April 1961 by the Menzies Government. Although at the time there was some criticism from those who felt that an Australian-born appointee would have been more appropriate, he proved to be a worthy choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Viscount De L'Isle was educated at Eton and Cambridge, and then became a chartered accountant. His war service record in World War II was most distinguished. Then Major Sidney of the Grenadier Guards, he was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1944 for bravery during the allied landings at Anzio in Italy. Only eight months later he was elected to the House of Commons as the Conservative member for Chelsea. As Senator Button said, when his father died the following year, he took his seat in the House of Lords. He served for four years as the Secretary of State for Air from 1951 to 1955. This time in parliament was followed by a period during which he was managing director of a number of boards, including Schweppes (Home) Ltd. He also served on the boards of a number of community organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Viscount De L'Isle was a man of great integrity with a strong sense of public duty who did not shrink from controversial issues. After the war he argued that it was wrong to put German officers on trial for war crimes, a most unpopular contention at the time. He later supported a British Labour Party proposal to abolish the House of Lords, saying that he was in favour of an elected senate. </PARA>
<PARA> He served as Governor-General of Australia from 1961 to 1965 and brought to the office great enthusiasm and warmth, and a deep affection for Australia and its people. He travelled widely during his time in office and returned to visit after he relinquished the position in 1965. </PARA>

<PARA> William Sidney, first Viscount De L'Isle, was appointed Governor-General of Australia in 1961 by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, a post which he served with distinction until 1965. He was appointed at a time when public opinion was being expressed that vice-regal positions should only be held by Australians. By all accounts, his love of Australia was enormous and he returned to Australia on visits after the completion of his term of office. </PARA>
<PARA> Viscount De L'Isle shared a role similar to that of senators here today in that he was an elected politician, having been elected to the House of Commons where he quickly received a ministry. After taking his hereditary seat in the House of Lords as the sixth Baron De L'Isle, he spent four years as the Secretary of State for Air. </PARA>
<PARA> The viscount was also a prominent businessman, both before and after his term as Governor-General. Lord De L'Isle was one of two Australian Governors-General to hold the Victoria Cross, which he won in 1944. He took many stands on social issues during his public career. The active role he played in Australian life seemed to have gained him immense popularity with most Australians. I extend the sympathy of the National Party in the Senate to the widow and family of Lord De L'Isle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I support the condolence motion put by the Leader of the Government (Senator Button) today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Viscount De L'Isle, serving as Governor-General of this country from 1961 to 1965, had a varied career during his lifetime, including his military service, where his bravery during the Second World War earned him the Victoria Cross. Politically, he served with distinction in both Houses of the Mother of Parliaments. Of course it is of interest to senators in this place, as has already been mentioned, that it was a surprise that he, as a Conservative-although he had been described as a middle-of-the-road Tory-did support a British Labour Party proposal to abolish the House of Lords, saying that he was in favour of an elected senate. </PARA>
<PARA> He was also distinguished in business, notably with the Schweppes organisation, and in the vice-regal component of his life when he served here as our Governor-General. He was, as has been stated, the last British Governor-General, and is remembered with affection by Australians. I recall in my young adulthood thinking of Lord and Lady De L'Isle as a travelling Governor-General and his Lady. Living in rural Australia, as I did at the time, it seemed to me that they travelled more than I was conscious of other vice-regal couples having done. Of course, as time has passed, travelling has become easier for public figures to undertake. As the capacity to travel with speed and comfort increased, this Governor-General took advantage of it. </PARA>
<PARA> He was well known and I believe is remembered with affection by many Australians. Upon his appointment, he met the growing public opinion, which was favouring a move towards Australian-born Governors-General, with good spirit. Despite that growing mood, he became a popular figure. Part of that popularity was due to his genuine affection of this country and its people which was demonstrated by his many return visits. </PARA>
<PARA> In common with Sir John Kerr, whose death has also been marked with a condolence motion today, Viscount De L'Isle lost his wife during his term of office as Governor-General. In that context, those two very different Governors-General come to our minds similarly on this occasion. As I say, as the last of the British Governors-General, he is remembered with affection by many Australians. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I also offer our condolences to his family. </PARA>

We believe that the implementation of these proposals would mean the destruction of the Australian National University's national and international high standing and firmly established reputation as a centre of excellence in research and scholarship. The dismemberment of the ANU would severely effect the ability of both the Institute and the Faculties to attract, or even retain, high quality academic staff, funding and support. It would also adversely affect the recruitment of top students. The maintenance of the Australian National University, as it is now constituted,-a national university with an international, national and local role-is of vital importance to the A.C.T. and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>2. We call on the Senate to reject the recommendations of the Chubb report and to support the integrity of the ANU and the existing relationship between the Institute and the Faculties.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1990 No. 460, and made under the Customs Act 1901, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a brief explanation of this, not in any way to anticipate debate but because my notice of motion is very much in the spirit of the holding operations that sometimes are used by the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances in order that further negotiations might take place with the relevant Minister, Senator Tate. It is our hope that, in fact, a vote on the disallowance may not be necessary but rather that the Government itself might amend the regulations to meet our concerns. I might say that that discussion has been taking place for some time but we believe that further negotiation might be fruitful.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>NOTICE OF MOTION TO DISALLOW CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED IMPORTS) REGULATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Opposition supports the aims underlying these Regulations, which seek to restrict the importation of firearms, we have strong concerns with a number of aspects of their drafting.</PARA>
<PARA> Time does not permit me to mention all of those concerns; therefore I will simply refer briefly to the more important ones.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, there is uncertainty surrounding the law relevant to the offence of possessing a prohibited import of the type proscribed by the Regulations. It has been argued, for example by New South Wales Police Minister, Mr Pickering, that the Regulations could apply to firearms which were legally imported prior to the commencement of the Regulations; although the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, has argued that the Regulations will not have any retrospective operation.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that this uncertainty should be resolved and the matter put beyond doubt by the inclusion of an express statement making it clear that they will not have any retrospective effect.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Regulations depart from the text of the statement approved at the Police Ministers' Council in November 1990. The statement approved by the Police Ministers (with the exception of New South Wales) provided that it would be lawful to import rifles and shotguns for competitive use in shooting competitions endorsed by certain recognised organisations such as the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia Incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA> The Regulations, in contrast to the Police Ministers' statement, do not make provision for allowing the importation of firearms for competitive use. The Regulations do, however, provide that competitors from other countries may bring in such firearms. This may disadvantage Australian sporting shooters and may well have a detrimental impact on the viability of Australia hosting international shooting competitions. In turn, this may impede the development of shooting as a legitimate and internationally recognised competitive sport.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, we are concerned that the Regulations may have an unwarranted adverse effect on legitimate collectors of firearms as military paraphernalia.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in our discussions with shooting organisations, it became clear that the Government did not undertake adequate consultations to ensure that the views of shooters were properly taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of disappointment to the Opposition that the Government has failed to address community concerns in these Regulations as presently drafted.</PARA>
<PARA> We are obviously not in a position to promulgate Regulations ourselves; nor can we amend these Regulations. The only course of action open to us is to move for their disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to foreshadow that the Opposition intends to present an alternative set of regulations for the Government to consider. This represents a sincere attempt on the part of the Opposition to create a common ground in order to work out an acceptable solution.</PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that the Opposition supports the Government's aims in proposing these Regulations; we simply have concerns with their present drafting. Those concerns are of such magnitude that we are compelled to seek disallowance of the Regulations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The necessity for this Senate to condemn the proposal of the Hawke Labor Government to restrict the freedom of Australians to impart political information through any media of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA>It never occurred to me that in my lifetime I would see the necessity to propose in this Senate a matter of urgency such as the one I have just moved. Very regrettably, that is the position in which we find ourselves today. </PARA>
<PARA> Never did I imagine either that any Australian government would propose laws to gag discussion and debate on political issues by banning anyone in this country-whether it be a politician, a businessman, a unionist, an environmentalist, a charity, a community group or a concerned individual-from ever advertising his views on radio or television. There is an immediate danger that, unless the Senate acts to condemn this proposal, the Government will introduce severe restrictions on the rights of the Australian people, attacking rights in a way which I have never seen in my lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government professes a concern for human rights, yet the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, and the Government have the arrogance and the effrontery to deprive us of a right we have all taken for granted-the freedom to express our opinions through any medium of our choice. This Government has failed the Australian people, and it is a sign of its desperation that it is seeking to limit criticisms of its actions. The approach adopted is simple: ban all political advertising on radio and television and introduce political censorship, a policy beloved of all totalitarians in the history of man. Chris Gilbert, Professor of Law at the Queensland University of Technology, said:</PARA>
<PARA>All modern dictators place the control of television stations among their top priorities. The Saddam Husseins of this world know the power of the box. </PARA>
<PARA> So, apparently, does Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Civil Liberties Union makes a similar point, saying that the ban reflects `the ALP's distaste for public participation in the political process' and is due to `an unpleasant authoritarian streak in many of its leaders'. It is ironic that at this time, when there is a tide of freedom sweeping the old Eastern bloc countries, the Hawke Labor Government should seek to erect in Australia an `iron curtain' chaining the airwaves. Let us look at what the Federal Government's own watchdog, Human Rights Commissioner Brian Burdekin, says about the proposal. He is:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . concerned that aspects of the . . . ban . . . may be inconsistent with certain fundamental human rights. These rights are contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which Australia ratified in 1980 and which are incorporated in federal legislation in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Act. </PARA>
<PARA>For the benefit of the Senate, I quote from article 19 of the Covenant:</PARA>
<PARA>Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government claims that there are precedents in other Western democracies for the banning of political advertisements. This is totally deceptive, as the Government and Senator Bolkus know. Let me point out that the following countries allow political advertising or political party free time on radio and television: New Zealand, the United States, Canada, West Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services, with his gift for Orwellian newspeak, describes the move as sanitising the political process. Under the same logic, would the Minister describe locking up people who disagree with his Government as purifying public discourse? Where will this proposal end? As the editorial in the Canberra Times on 19 March notes:</PARA>
<PARA>Freedom of speech can certainly be abused, but not by overuse. Once a society begins to regulate who has the right to spread a political message it has strayed dangerously close to regulating the opinions considered suitable. </PARA>
<PARA>I might add that the Government's initiative has been condemned by virtually every other editorialist, columnist and commentator in this nation. It cannot be claimed by the cynics that this is purely self-interest because, as a result of media cross-ownership rules, newspaper groups can no longer own broadcasting outlets. In fact, a ban on television and radio advertising would help newspapers by directing more political campaigning to the print media. </PARA>
<PARA> The move to restrict the freedom of political speech has brought forth angry protests across the spectrum in Australia, for example, from the Law Council of Australia, the Media Council of Australia, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Australian Council of Social Service, business and farmer groups and so on. I could go on and on. The list is endless. In the interest of balance, I wanted to list those who support the Government's move, but try as I might I could not find anyone willing to say so publicly, apart from Mr Bob Hogg-surprise, surprise-and, guess who else, the union bosses in the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be clear about what this Government's proposals would mean. The Minister has announced that he will amend the Broadcasting Act to ban totally any advertisement at any time that contains electoral matter as defined in the Electoral Act. During Question Time I asked the Minister what that meant and he could not answer me, so I thought I would give him a bit of a hint. I said to him, `How does the Electoral Commissioner interpret electoral matters in the Electoral Act?'. Again there was no answer. I thought it would be a good idea to help the Minister by giving him the interpretation used by the Electoral Commission. I refer him to volume 6 of the Australian Electoral Commission's 1990 election handbook, where it defines `electoral matter'. It is worth listening to this carefully because it shows us the extent of the gag. The Electoral Commission's definition of `electoral matter' is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Any express or implicit reference to, or comment on:</PARA>
<PARA> -an election;</PARA>
<PARA> -the Government, the Opposition, a previous Government or a previous Opposition of the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA> -the Government or Opposition, or a previous Government or Opposition of a State or Territory;</PARA>
<PARA> -a local authority or previous members of a local authority;</PARA>
<PARA> -a member or former member of the Parliament of the Commonwealth or a state, or of the legislature of a territory, or of a local authority;</PARA>
<PARA> -a political party, a branch or division of a political party or a candidate or group of candidates in an election; or</PARA>
<PARA> -an issue submitted to or otherwise before the electors in connection with an election . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In simple terms, it will be illegal to express political dissent by way of advertisements on radio or television. Many of us were incredulous that the Minister actually meant what he said, and average Australians could not believe that a government would set out to achieve the results I have described above. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to make things crystal clear, the Minister for Administrative Services, whose name will soon become Big Brother, put out a clarifying statement on 25 March. It is worth quoting from the Minister, this leading light of the socialist Left. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite reports to the contrary, the Government has made no decisions in relation to the effect of the proposed political advertising ban on charitable organisations; this includes that no decisions have been made to exempt such organisations from the ban . . . The Government will not allow a situation to arise where bogus or legitimate charitable organisations could be used as `front' organisations for political entities to advertise through. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought it was important to quote the words exactly, with all the grammatical errors. </PARA>
<PARA> What is so pernicious about this scheme is that the Government envisages that its own taxpayer-funded political advertisements will be unaffected by the ban. Apparently, outside election campaigns there will be no restrictions on the Government's monopoly of the airwaves. So much for the level playing field! Taxpayers are already footing the bill for the Hawke Government's propaganda machine. Already more than $232m a year is being spent promoting the incumbent Administration. Probably with the ban in mind, earlier this year the Government also established a special ministerial committee called the Government Advertising Service-or GAS which is no doubt gearing up for massive `information' campaigns once all other voices have been gagged by this sort of legislation. From these signs it is clear that the ban will not affect the amount of political advertising on television and radio, just the type. </PARA>
<PARA> Whereas now there are advertisements produced and funded by political parties and other interest groups, in future there will only be the Government's propaganda, paid for by the long-suffering taxpayer. Under the Minister's scheme, for all but one month of a three-year term governments could spend our money on television and radio blockbuster campaigns telling us what a great job they are doing. No other views or opinions could be presented in this way, and the only time the Government's advertising would be partly restricted is during the actual period of an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> During the election campaign proper, the Minister says that the Government will still be able to continue with `government advertising necessary to cope with national emergencies, advertising by electoral authorities and commercial advertising by government business enterprises'. Given this Government's track record, what is to stop it from abusing those provisions in the same way that it has misused taxpayers' money for self-promotion and partisan campaigning? There are instances I can quote. What if the government business enterprises in question are those intended for privatisation, for example, by a coalition government, and their `commercial' advertising consists of subtle-or not so subtle-messages implying that they should remain in state ownership. There are also precedents where this Government has sought unfair advantage from electoral `information' advertisements. I instance the 1988 referendum campaign where it took a High Court judgment to stop this Labor Government from broadcasting misleading and biased advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the Minister's press release expressly confirming that charities would not be exempt from the ban. Therefore, it is obvious that there will be unprecedented and draconian results from this Government's proposal. However, they cannot be excused as `unintended consequences', because the Government has been told exactly where the ban will lead. For example, the all-party Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommended against `a complete ban on political advertising'. I am interested to see on the list of speakers the name of Senator Schacht who was a member of that Committee, every member of which-Labor, Liberal, Democrat, independent-recommended against a complete ban. I think that it is worth quoting some of the paragraphs of the Committee's report. It said it recommended against a ban because it:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . would have a direct effect on freedom of speech by reducing opportunities for discussion during election periods when voters are determining the candidate or party they wish to support. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also pointed out that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . most witnesses disagreed with a complete ban on political advertising, claiming that it would have an adverse effect on freedom of speech and . . . would disadvantage citizens and groups who wished to bring issues before the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Committee was received in August 1989 and at that time the Government displayed no sense of urgency whatever about dealing with this matter. Now suddenly it argues that corruption in Federal politics is a major problem. Eight years since it came to power-in the aftermath of a Federal election where the Australian Labor Party spent considerably more than its opponents on television advertising-we are told that it is imperative that there be a complete ban on the broadcast of political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is on notice that its proposal-and this has been stated by many commentators-would further enhance the ability of an incumbent government to exploit the spoils of office and cling to power. These are the signs of a desperate government, taking desperate measures at the expense of the freedom of every Australian. It would prevent individuals and interest groups from taking their message directly to the people and prevent charities from appealing for funds if they are deemed to be `political'. It would also deny Australians in rural and provincial areas, where people rely on radio and television rather than on newspapers which often are received only weekly and are very expensive. I see Senator Schacht shaking his head. He should go out to the public and have a look; he should go to provincial Queensland or to provincial Western Australia. He will discover that people do not buy newspapers. This proposal would also limit the freedoms of 110,000 blind or sight-impaired Australians, and the one million plus people who are classified as illiterate. These are the people whom the Labor Party purports to support. It would limit their freedom to receive political information in the most direct and meaningful way, and this would also apply to the many Aborigines in the Northern Territory and in north and far north Queensland who rely entirely on radio and television. Further, the Minister has noted that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . journalists will be more powerful shapers of public opinion after the ban on political advertising comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a direct quote from the Minister who then said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the ban would allow reporters more power to get political assessments across. </PARA>
<PARA>This reflects the fact that the ban will deprive all Australians who are dissatisfied with the coverage they receive in the media or who think it is biased the right to present their views to the public direct and uncensored. The only way to put political argument to the public is through the newspapers and through the news and current affairs programs of the broadcast media. Enormous power is placed in the hands of those who control the programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht had his chance in the Committee, but he opposed a ban on political advertising. As with other changes to the political process introduced by this Government, it is necessary to look at the Labor Party's own hidden agenda. As the Daily Mirror stated on 5 April last year, just one year ago:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This plan to limit the appearance of politicians on our television screens is not really an attempt at magnanimity on the part of the government. It is a part of the desperate effort to save the party machine from going bankrupt. Labor's money problems . . . are partly the result of its poor performance . . . in the last election. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a clear-cut principle involved here, and it is urgent for this Senate to put its position on record before the Government goes down the track of destroying freedom of speech. The ban legislation will stand or fall on whether senators genuinely believe in freedom. I thought that Senator Schacht was a civil libertarian. This is a black and white issue; it should not be confused with any other issues or be the subject of any deals or compromises. It is a stand-alone matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that the Australian Democrats, whose attitude will be crucial in this place, will not succumb to the temptations offered to them by the Government. They profess to share our concern with safeguarding individual freedom, and making the political process as open and accessible as possible. When governments call for restrictions on our freedoms `in the national interest', it is time to worry. When they propose the most draconian and far reaching limitations on freedom of speech and expression without advancing one convincing justification for this move, Australians should be justly outraged. There is still a lot of force in the warning by Thomas Jefferson, which appears under the editorial of the Brisbane Courier-Mail every day. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Our liberty depends on the Freedom of the Press, and that cannot be limited without being lost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again this afternoon, we have similar fact evidence. We have a case, once again, of the same sort of contribution from the same side of politics. We have seen it not only just now in Senator Parer's contribution but also, a little while ago during Question Time, innuendo was raised in a very unfair way about the Australian Democrats and whether they in fact raised the question of increasing public funding in a way that could benefit themselves. Let me put it very clearly on the record that they have not. They never raised the matter, but it did not stop Senator Macdonald, in his own insidious way, from raising the point and then trying to draw something out of it, or Senator Parer, just a few seconds ago, when he made the same sort of implication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the same sort of Opposition, with the same lack of recognition, understanding, or keenness to address the issues that we find, once again, dominating this debate from the Opposition side. We are told, for instance, that the Government will be free to advertise as it wishes and, at the same time as government advertising is allowed, public interest and other groups will not be able to. The reality-and it has been made clear a number of times-is that government advertising will be subject to the same criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told that country people and the blind will have lack of access to political information. In reality country people will still get the same commentary and news review programs on radio and television as they get now. What they will be denied is access to political advertising. Let us bell the problems right from the start. There is a major difference between freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and a commercial right, a political right, to advertise-a right which, though not political, is one which is based very much on the level of one's bank account. </PARA>
<PARA> For eight years I have sat on this side and watched the Opposition. This Government has acknowledged from day one that there are problems inherent in our system, such as the rising costs of campaigning and the lack of adequate disclosure provisions-both interwoven, both presenting a great challenge not only to our democratic system but also to democratic countries internationally. But we have seen, at every turn in here and at every turn in every relevant State legislature-every relevant State parliament-where the conservatives have majorities in the upper House they have resisted moves to ensure, for instance, adequate disclosure provisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I kept quiet while Senator Parer spoke, so perhaps he could give me a break. What we have here is a Government very keen, as part of our democratic process, to address two inherently interwoven problems. One problem is the level of reliance of political parties and political organisations on fundraising and the second problem, and interwoven in that first one, is the question of disclosure. Every time we have raised it here, whether it has been through public funding, through disclosure or through the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to see how we could curtail costs, Opposition senators have taken blind reaction to it and the brick wall has gone up immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of disclosure, for instance, there have been calls across this country from Fitzgerald in Queensland to ICAC in New South Wales and further afield. We have in this country four inquiries either just completed or currently in operation, that addressed or are addressing the issue of the relationship between the corporate dollar and government. If that is not a clear sign to us that we have to act to ensure that that infectious nature does not go any further, I do not know what the Opposition needs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is argued that this issue of the corporate dollar and its influence on the political process have not really come onto a national level.

Opposition senators were the ones who opposed, for instance, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC). They are still committed to its abolition. However, they are the ones who come in here this afternoon and quote the words of Commissioner Burdekin. What sort of hypocrisy and double standards are they showing and continuing to show? If they believe in HREOC why are they still committed to its abolition? If they believe in the sorts of fundamental freedom that they talk about, why did they resist such basic freedoms as the right to vote, the right to one vote one value, the right to freedom of religion, the right to trial by jury and the right to fair compensation? Why did they resist those at a referendum? Because of short term political gain, and that is precisely the motivating factor in this particular instance as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me talk about democracies. I will quote Mr Justice Skelly Wright of the United States Appellate Court. I think he sums up, as far as I am concerned, the most basic premise of our democratic system and that of the United States (US). In summarising his position, he states:</PARA>
<PARA>Financial inequities pose a pervasive and growing threat to the principle of `one person one vote' and undermine the political proposition to which this nation is dedicated-that all are created equal. </PARA>
<PARA>What we draw directly out of that is that, if one's voice in the political process is dependent on the size of his or her bank account, we do not have a fair and equal system. Advertising is an inherently undemocratic medium. It is not free speech; it is bought speech. It is speech that can only be bought, in terms of television, for $13,000 a minute and, in terms of radio, at an ever expanding rate of $1,300 a minute. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic point is that this sort of financial inequity-this sort of medium which can only be a bought medium and which directly implies that one's voice and one's role in the political process depend on the level of one's bank account-is not a democratic right. Another thing about advertising that has been recognised internationally is that it leads to money, not people, setting agendas. I do not have to quote radical, left-wing thinkers in respect to this. Let me quote Senator Barry Goldwater of the US Senate. In a very telling and stark three lines, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>It's not . . . the people . . . but moneyed interests who are setting the nation's political agenda and are influencing the position of candidates on the important issues of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Barry Goldwater, an extreme conservative in the United States of America, makes that very telling point. In terms of supporting that statement, one really has only to look at the former Director of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Tony Eggleton, who, recently in the Melbourne Age in an interview with Michelle Grattan, in terms of setting the agenda-in terms of the very inherently interwoven point that, by setting the agenda, what those who donate want is not influence in terms of the result but influence with the government, whoever it might be after an election-admitted that during the Fraser era donors might get quicker access. But he goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>If a company asked me (for access to Fraser) I wouldn't intimate how big a donor they were, but I might say that a friend of the Party wanted to see him. It might get them in the door marginally more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA>Malcolm never asked how much they donated but the basic point is that it got them through that door quicker. What we are talking about is an access to decision making, which goes through the back door. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Parer might raise the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). While the Opposition resists disclosure of campaign funding of the accounts of political parties, as it continues to do, it can see what the ACTU donates to political parties. Annually, all unions and the ACTU have to declare their income and expenditure to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and the Opposition can look at those. But let us have a look at the Opposition's accounts. What is it trying to protect? Dr Hewson tries to move away from the Opposition's position, but the organ-grinders of the Liberal Party have dragged him back. Hopefully, he will be able to present and develop this image of an honest politician and support the Government on this but, with the likes of honourable senators opposite, Andrew Robb and the secret donors behind him, I would not put my money on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are talking about undue influence in the process. The Opposition comes in here today and says, `You are going to stop all these community groups from having access to the system'. Let us look at the facts, the reality. For instance, at the last election where third parties had to declare their expenditure on political process, $1.75m was spent by third party groups on the campaign. Of that, $63,000 was spent by those community groups that the Opposition talks about and $26,000 by the Australian Conservation Foundation on radio advertising. As opposed to that, the loggers spent $1.1m. Quite obviously, radio is a medium which depends on the level of one's bank account; one's access to the system depends on the level of one's bank account; and one's influence after the event also depends on the contributions made beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer quoted the Society of St Vincent de Paul. The Society of St Vincent de Paul wrote to my office and said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell Senator Kemp who is supporting me on this particular point. The Opposition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters-the Committee that has been quoted recently in debate-had this to say about political advertising:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We reject as absurd the assertion that political advertising is a social good.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We have seen no convincing evidence of any co-relation between election results and either the quality or quantity of political advertising on electronic media. </PARA>
<PARA>It also said:</PARA>
<PARA>It seems likely that it is the news and current affairs programs, and not the party advertisements, that provide the information which makes television a significant influence on individual political choices. </PARA>
<PARA>These comments come from colleagues of Opposition senators who told the Joint Standing Committee what they think of political advertising. What we are talking about is the defence of the concept of freedom to advertise. It is an inherently undemocratic concept and has dangers within it. I have expressed why it is inherently undemocratic; so let us look at the dangers. First of all, one does have that undue influence in the system-as Tony Eggleton paid witness to. But it also takes participation in the electoral process right out of the hands of ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA> If the two major parties in this country have to sell assets-the Liberal Party has in Queensland and Victoria-and if other parties are struggling, how can we expect minority groups in this country to have their voices heard? How can we expect them to be part of the system? What we are talking about here is a late twentieth century revision of the property franchise. If one's participation in the process and one's voice depends on one's bank account, then we are talking about the reintroduction of a property franchise and about censorship by stealth. Let us have no misconception about that. If people do not have the power, the money, to advertise, then they are frozen out of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I return to a couple of points about the need for this legislation. To this Government, to any thinking people, and to any libertarian not living in a vacuum, it is not an attack on freedom of speech or on freedom of the press. The ban goes very much towards the commercial transaction of advertising. It does not go towards anyone in this place or elsewhere having their views carried by news, news services, current affairs or review programs on radio and television-and it only goes to radio and television. </PARA>
<PARA> We are levelling the playing field. We are taking out of the playing field the factor that one needs a big bank account to play in the game. From now on, everyone will have equal access to the media and that should be the driving force for governments. I recently read a book called The Best Congress Money Can Buy, a book about the United States, which shows very starkly the power in the US of the corporate dollar because of one factor, that factor being the amazing and exploding demands on political parties of campaign advertising. The US, New Zealand and Japan have uncontrolled advertising on television whereas other countries allow for free time. But those three countries have paid advertising-apart from us and apart from Canada, which bans it in the last 28 days of a campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no coincidence that the costs of advertising and the costs of campaigning have led to a situation where, in the US, members in the same position as us spend three-quarters of their time going out campaign fundraising because they have got to raise millions of dollars to get into Congress. That is a great example of the democratic process not being available to people. What we are concerned about here is to contain costs and also to ensure that those who play the game can be exposed. If the Opposition has got nothing to hide, if it has got nothing to protect in terms of its secret bidders and the organ-grinders that run Senator Parer, his Party and his leader, then the Opposition should be supporting the disclosure provisions. Senator Parer knows what they are. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give this challenge to the Opposition. Opposition senators have seen the Joint Standing Committee report, entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune, and know what is contained within it. There is no need for Opposition senators to drag their feet and drag their leader around and around on this particular issue. The challenge to us on this side is one that we have met consistently, no matter what the issue. If we have to make a hard decision, we do. In this case, we are concerned to maintain campaign costs. We are also concerned to ensure that the system is cleansed from undue influence and corruption, both currently and into the future. That is what we are on about. We cannot do that by just having disclosure. John Howard mentioned the case of Spiro Agnew the other day on television. Spiro Agnew was driven by the need for funds, despite the disclosure laws in the US. We cannot approach this problem by just one arm and not the other. </PARA>
<PARA> The package we present is one that will enhance the democratic process. However, we expected the Opposition's reaction-given its history in the last eight years of opposition to any endeavour by the Government to ensure that the system works cleanly, openly and honestly and to any endeavour from the other side to protect people's rights and to enhance them and to acknowledge the inequities in our society-because there is nothing new about it. Having regard to the Opposition's soiled record in Utah mines in Queensland, I would tread rather gingerly about how it approaches this matter. </PARA>

<PARA> This motion speaks only of a part of what is a package. It is for that reason that we seek to suspend Standing Orders in order to be able to amend the motion as put forward by Senator Parer. I would leave aside the grammatical problem with the motion, however, as Senator Parer also raised grammar in the context of, I think, the Minister's press release. It should read, `through any medium of their choice'. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned that this debate should take place but equally concerned that the debate, as it has taken place in public thus far-apart from some fairly hysterical responses to what is a serious issue, I will agree-has been very limited in the context of an overall package. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, the motion talks about the restriction to impart political information. Quite clearly, what little detail we do know of the Government's proposal does not do that in toto. In the first couple of days of debate in the community some people seemed to see the implication that no broadcasting of any kind of any political material would be permitted. It is not part of the Government's package that no political information will be imparted through any form of media, only that which is paid for and, in the case of television, paid for very expensively. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats, in particular, are interested in a full debate. As Senator Parer has pointed out, and as we have pointed out, as our position in the public arena is important we are not making a precipitant decision on any aspect of the package. In order to have a rational debate which will be productive we are seeking advice, we are listening to debate, we are listening to representations and we will seek advice from within our own Party next weekend at our national executive meeting. So we are interested in a full debate. Therefore, we believe that this motion should be amended. </PARA>
<PARA> Should this motion to broaden the debate be successful-I seek it for this reason-we will move to extend the framework of Senator Parer's motion. First of all, it will exhort the Senate to give due consideration to the Government's package and emphasise, in particular, addressing matters such as the high cost of electronic advertising, ensuring disclosure of all political donations and ensuring honesty in political advertising. There are more, but those are the crucial issues that we think the Senate should be debating today. They do not at all exclude the issues raised, as I say, somewhat oddly by Senator Parer. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that this debate definitely needs to encompass other aspects. This is a package to change the conduct of election campaigns. This is an area in which the Democrats have operated consistently throughout our time in this place. Of course, disclosure of election campaign funding was a move in the right direction, pushed and promoted by the Democrats. The issue of disclosure of all party funding is an urgent issue for us; therefore, we believe it should be the subject of this urgency motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I have moved that we suspend Standing Orders at this point to allow me to move an amendment to this motion to broaden the debate. It will make it useful-certainly for us-if the Opposition has any useful contributions and if the Government is going to put forward any further elucidating material at this stage, and not waste the time of the Senate by trying to whip up again the hysteria on a very limited, although important, part of the package which has been put forward by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA>Omit all words after `urgency', substitute the following:</PARA>
<PARA>`The necessity for the Senate to give consideration to the Government's package of proposals to change the conduct of election campaigns, addressing in particular, measures to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) stem the high cost of electronic election advertising;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) ensure disclosure of all political donations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) ensure honesty in political advertising.'. </PARA>
<PARA>I have amended Senator Parer's motion because what he brought before us today is a mere fraction of what the Government is putting forward. What he has done is limit the debate in this place. The Australian Democrats agree with the Opposition that it is important that there be debate on the package for the change of conduct of election campaigns which the Government has brought forward. There has already been considerable public debate of which we have been a part. We have been acknowledged as playing a leading role here each time it happens-and those occasions become rarer and rarer-that the Government and the Opposition disagree. </PARA>
<PARA> In this particular case, immediately the package was announced a position of opposition was taken by the Opposition parties with the exception, however, of an initial statement by Dr Hewson at the National Press Club, I believe, in which he said in answer to a question that he thought that it was probably a fair thing that the Australian people did have full information about the sources of funding of political parties. As we have subsequently seen, very quickly after what I thought to be a reasonable and rational response to a very important proposal of the Government, Dr Hewson has been pulled into line by the party operatives-those who know what is in the books; those who know where they want to go for funds for the upcoming election. Those who know?</PARA>
<PARA> They are not the members of the Australian public who, we believe, have an absolute right to know where their political parties and other political organisations are getting their backing from. Quite clearly, this aspect of the package put forward by the Government is something that the Opposition opposes absolutely. We want to hear more about that issue from the Opposition in this debate. We have inserted that as part of our amended motion because we do want to hear from the Opposition. As a political party now coming up to fifteen years of existence-which began with, and has had ever since its inception, full disclosure as a matter of firm policy-we are absolutely delighted that this Government has finally come all the way. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators know, for several elections now donations to political parties for campaign purposes have been disclosable. Until now, that was as far as we had been able to push the Labor Government on disclosure. Of course, it was a situation which left massive loopholes, through which, as we know, the old brown paper bag or the shiny black briefcase, which was mentioned today, has been able to find its way very easily. It is a particular delight that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) of Senator Loosely and the Harris-Daishowa donation should now be prepared to put forward, on behalf of the Australian people, the right to have full disclosure of political funding of all kinds to all political groups. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a part of this proposal which must be passed, and the Australian Democrats will do all that is within our power to ensure that it is passed. We want to hear arguments with substance from the Opposition-not rubbish about union funding of the Labor Party, which is already a matter of open public disclosure. The Liberal Party may not want the unions to fund the Labor Party; that is entirely a different matter. All Australians deserve to know where all of the funds of all political parties come from-not just the Liberal and National parties but the ALP and, indeed, the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> It was very important to us that we not engage in this debate without addressing that issue and that we not allow the Opposition, in the hysteria of this campaign on a limited aspect of the Government's proposals, to side-step that issue. It has been assisted by the media, which has not probed that position or the reasons for the Opposition's position on this issue. I could not count the number of journalists to whom I have said, `Where is your analytical piece about the Opposition's intransigent approach to maintaining the secrecy about where it gets its money from?'. This continues in spite of royal commission evidence that we do have problems in this country. Admittedly, at this stage at least, we have seen nothing at the Federal level beyond perhaps a misuse of the limited disclosure which we have had so far with regard to campaign donations, but not of the level that we have seen within the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that the Democrats have not yet seen legislation on this package-none of us have. When we do see the legislation relating to disclosure we will go through it with a fine toothcomb. As I have said, this is the ALP of Stephen Loosely-now Senator Loosely, a colleague in this chamber-and Harris-Daishowa. With that in mind, we will certainly look closely at that legislation. We do not want any sham full disclosure. I am not accusing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), who is putting forward the legislation, of having that in mind, but we often find unfortunate lapses in Government legislation. Within weeks of coming into this chamber, my colleague Senator Kernot was able to fix a piece of Government legislation on a technicality which seemed to be beyond everybody else. We will be looking at that aspect of the legislation very closely. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Senate should give due consideration-and those are the terms in my amendment-to this whole package, as the Democrats are, and as we will continue to do right up until we see the exact legislation that the Government intends to put before us. During that process we will not speculate ridiculously about things we do not know about, but we will negotiate. We reserve that right to negotiate; so does the Opposition. Is Dr Hewson not currently in negotiation with Prime Minister Hawke about the question of four-year terms? I have not received a letter from either Prime Minister Hawke or Dr Hewson. The Prime Minister and the putative Prime Minister will no doubt want to do a deal, particularly on the question of whether a four-year term should be fixed. Of course it should be fixed. They will do a deal which suits whichever one of their parties comes into government next time, the time after or the time after that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the right of the Australian people to have a fixed four-year term so that elections are not a matter of political opportunism but a matter of the proper administration of this country. Dr Hewson and Mr Hawke will do a deal on that, and they are currently negotiating-make no mistake about that. That is their right, but I just wish that one of them would drop me a line so I could tell them how to do it properly-instead of which I have written to all the newspapers in this country to tell them our view on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We will negotiate and we will do it with the goal of improving the Government's package. We will improve it, as we improved Medicare, the industrial relations legislation and the privacy legislation-as we do, day after day, week after week in this place. That is what balance of power is about; that is why the Australian people have given us back the balance of power year after year, election after election, under both types of government. Make no mistake; if there is a change of government at the next election, those on the Opposition benches now will have to frame their legislation so that it suits the Australian Democrats. I can assure them that if a new government should appoint Senator Macdonald in any way to negotiate with the Democrats it will be entirely unfruitful. We are accustomed to that role, and we relish it on behalf of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> We know why there was an attempt to limit this debate: it is because the Opposition does not want to talk about disclosure. In our negotiations we will continue to press to get rid of the licence to lie. The Commonwealth Electoral Act is just that at the moment, and we want amendments to that Electoral Act to get rid of the licence to lie. We are realistic and we know that we will never stop politicians from lying altogether, but in May 1990 Senator Macklin, as he then was, after years of pursuing this issue, brought forward in this place a very simple and quite limited amendment on that question to ensure that basic truths are contained in political advertisements. We have put that before the Government again and we hope that it is getting due consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I will pay Senator Parer the same courtesy. However, it is contained in Hansard and I am sure he is very well aware of it as he would have been aware of the debate at the time Senator Macklin put that amendment forward. That is another advance that is needed in the context of this package. </PARA>

The Democrats have said that we will continue to consider this package and not go to our Party forum next weekend with any firm position on any aspect of it because we want to take advice from our Party. However, at Question Time we had what should be the last of a range of attacks on the Australian Democrats on this package, relating to one aspect of it. That is the aspect whereby the Government proposes to bring the entitlement for Senate campaigning under public funds up to the level of entitlement for the House of Representatives-which, in effect, will double the current value, for public funding purposes, of each Senate vote. Simply, it aims to bring the Senate and the House of Representatives into parity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been accused today by Senator Macdonald and various editorialists around the country, most notably David Barnett in the latest edition of the Bulletin-fine company Senator Macdonald finds himself in-of being prepared to back everything the Government says for the sake of some $500,000, which is what would have come to us on 1990 figures, had the House of Representatives and the Senate votes achieved the same level of public funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Editorialists, David Barnett, Senator Macdonald and other people-including his Opposition colleagues who have been flinging press releases all around the backblocks of Western Australia and Queensland-have all ignored the $4m plus that the two other parties will get. If the Opposition gets the landslide victory that it is expecting next time, it is looking at $3m or so. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, in spite of the fact that we have not consulted our national executive, I am announcing our party room decision to vote against that aspect. Then Opposition senators will have the ball in their court. We will vote against that aspect because, as Senator Bolkus said, it was not our proposal. Honourable senators know what our priorities are: truth in advertising, disclosure and the issue of increasing costs of election campaigning. We will vote against that which was not our proposal. David Barnett and the Opposition should understand that the bulk of our funding-as is the case with the bulk of everyone else's funding-comes from our House of Representatives candidates who stand all around Australia, who do not get elected, but who will get elected at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> We have amended this motion so that Opposition senators will address all the issues, so that they will stop being hysterical about one aspect of it, so that they will stop misrepresenting our position and so that they will be confronted in the rest of this debate with having to come forward with what they believe regarding the disclosure of political funding. They will have to state why they do not want any form of truth and honesty in advertising and why they are hiding behind one aspect of a comprehensive package which can bring to Australia better and more effective election campaigns if we all debate the issue responsibly and not hysterically and if we address all of the issues in doing so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to debate the matters before the chamber and to look at some of the issues which were raised by Senator Bolkus and Senator Powell in their contributions today. It was interesting that Senator Bolkus drew attention to the enormous cost of advertising. He argued that this matter was out of the hands of ordinary Australians, that the strength of one's voice depends on the size of one's bank account. He told us he was trying to level the playing field. I wonder whether exactly the same arguments could not be applied to direct mail advertising. I ask Senator Bolkus how many pieces the Australian Labor Party (ALP) put out in the last election and what the cost of that was. Is direct mail advertising of the scale contemplated by his colleagues out of the hands of ordinary Australians? Does it depend on the size of one's bank account?</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Schacht will have a chance to make his contribution, so let us leave it at that. The reality is that the arguments that Senator Bolkus put forward to ban political advertising on television and radio are precisely the arguments which could be used by Senator Bolkus for banning direct mail. Senator Bolkus knows that that is very expensive and that it is out of the hands of ordinary Australians. Those arguments could also be used to attack political advertising in the media, which is also very expensive, and to quote Senator Bolkus, out of the hands of ordinary Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Powell in her contribution berated us all here for not addressing what she regarded as the wider substance of the issues before the Senate. I say to Senator Powell that we waited patiently for her to outline in detail what her policies were. We waited in vain because she told us that she had to go to her executive. I do not know who these faceless people are, but Senator Powell said that she had to go to her executive to hear what it wants to do. If Senator Powell wants to come in here and berate other senators-both on the Government side and on this side-and call for us to come up with specifics, then I think the onus is on her to do precisely the same. The fact is that she failed to do so. Senator Powell gave us a number of wish lists.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bell will have his chance to make a contribution. Senator Powell wishes to stem the high cost of electronic election advertising. The best way to stem the high costs of electronic advertising is for parties to spend what they are able to raise. In the last election, the Labor Party spent and spent and spent again even though it did not have the money. It has now run itself into what can only be described as a massive debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we really want to stem the cost of electronic advertising, surely the initial onus is on the parties themselves. I ask Senator Powell why we want to stem the cost of electronic advertising only. Do we not want to stem the cost of direct mail advertising? Why does Senator Powell effectively exclude that from her amendment? Perhaps later speakers may stand up and explain why the focus is on electronic advertising. If Senator Bolkus has his way, the vast bulk of election funds will be spent on direct mail advertising. I ask Senator Powell whether there is a need to control those costs. Let us have her views on that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell's second point related to ensuring disclosure of all political donations. I have a question for Senator Schacht who will shortly address this motion. Does he support disclosure to all trade union members that a certain proportion of the funds they have contributed to the union has been given to the Labor Party? Do we really want to go down that track? Let us see Senator Schacht answer that question. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell and her colleagues might like to address themselves to the next issue. If we have disclosure of all political donations, what procedures would she recommend we have in place to protect those who will inevitably suffer intimidation from the Labor Party? Senator Bolkus should read the articles in the newspapers about the building industry in New South Wales. He would learn a little bit about intimidation from the Labor side of politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht is going to have his chance. I know he is excited by this issue, but he will have a really good chance to make his contribution. The third point Senator Powell raised was about ensuring honesty in political advertising. There is an onus on political parties to be truthful; I have always felt that and I am sure my colleagues on this side have too. But how would the Labor Party react to this? Senator Schacht may remember that we warned the Government about a capital gains tax. That was a terrible campaign. What happened? The Labor Party brought in capital gains tax. Does Senator Schacht remember the Government's promise in 1987 that there would be no children living in poverty? That was one big lie. Senator Faulkner, who is in the chamber, may remember the big lie of the Government during the 1990 election that there would be no recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will be interested in and will look forward to the Labor Party contributions from Senator Schacht and Senator Faulkner about truth in advertising because both of those senators will go down in history as members of the Government of the big lie. It has to be said that this Hawke Labor Government will go down in Australian history as being quite remarkable for its total lack of principles. It has never shown any loyalty to the principles which have guided the ALP through its first 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Who would ever have believed that a Labor Government in this country would boast that it cut the living standards of Australian workers or would take such pleasure in being cosy with the rich and powerful? Let us recall the John Curtin Foundation of Western Australia and that famous photograph. Who would have believed that a Labor Government would give priority to rich mates and trade union bosses rather than to the interests of Australian workers? Who would ever have believed that an Australian Labor Government would have attempted to limit the freedom of speech? We will look forward to listening to Senator Schacht answer that question today. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion was worded to pick up the sentiment, and indeed the wording, of article 19 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Freedom of speech, as enshrined in that article, is a basic principle of democracy. In view of what is currently emerging from Western Australia, I have to say that it is with some wry amusement that we read the headline on Senator Bolkus's infamous press release on 19 March which sought to ban political advertising. Does he remember how that headline read? Senator Bolkus said that the Government will not tolerate political corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Royal Commission in Perth goes about its work and as the evidence unfolds, we will see how effective the Labor Party leadership has been in avoiding political corruption. We shall also see whether the leaders in the Federal arena have their hands clean. That will be of great interest. Apparently some $300,000 or $1m-Senator McMullan cannot tell us-was paid. Nevertheless substantial sums were paid. Senator Bolkus, you were very embarrassed at Question Time today when you were asked a number of simple questions about your Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> I will conclude my remarks on Senator Powell's comments by saying that, at the end of the day, the resolution of this debate and the legislation which comes before this chamber will largely depend on Senator Powell and her colleagues. Some of us may deplore that, but the reality of the numbers shows that that is the case. I remind Senator Powell in regard to her considerations which will be going before this executive, this faceless group of people about whom I know nothing but which presumably will tell her what to do, that Don Chipp, who actually founded the party that Senator Powell belongs to and actually got her into this chamber, has argued in the press recently that:</PARA>
<PARA>It is now proposed to turn the clock back 20 years and prohibit any person, political party or concerned publicly spirited lobby group from advertising their policies, beliefs or objections on radio and television. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem Senator Powell has is that after all the debate, compromises and deals that Senator Bolkus and his colleagues will offer, in the end the Australian Democrats will be faced with making a choice on a great principle of public policy. The principle is whether they support the right of any aggrieved special interest group to bring its views to public attention in what is the most effective way, which is political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that Senator Powell will have to choose whether she will accept an unfettered right to freedom of speech or whether she will join with the Labor Party and attempt to save its neck and, undoubtedly, the neck of Senator Bolkus. Because of the chaos that will continue on this issue, I think that his colleagues will be very pleased to see the back of him. At the end of the day that is the choice that Senator Powell will have to make and all those special interest groups that she spends so much time cultivating and all those individuals who believe in an unfettered freedom of speech in relation to politics will be watching her moves with great interest. Senator Powell has a great responsibility. I ask her to consider very carefully the issues which we have raised today. </PARA>

<PARA> My interest in this issue goes back about 15 years when I was a full time official of the Australian Labor Party in South Australia. I have never equivocated in supporting major electoral reform, including full public disclosure, public funding and banning paid television and radio advertising. Opposition senators can look back at the records of the Labor Party in South Australia and they will find that I have always argued for that platform and have never deviated from it-and I never will. When it comes to the basic proposition of observing other countries and the functioning of the process of democracy, the best thing that we can do is to get the power of money out of the political process, to ensure that the process is as transparent as possible, so that people know who is calling the tune, know the sources of the donations and who is putting the pressure on so that people in the community can condemn us accordingly and make a judgment when they cast their votes. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators and the Liberal Party of Australia are about hiding as much information as possible from the general public so that they can go on with the old back-room system of politics. I have to say to Senator Parer and the Opposition that I am uncomfortable about the disclosures that appear to be coming out of the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia. It proves my point that money is linked with the desire for political parties to survive and to pay for expensive election campaigns. In the end, political parties start making judgments about getting money, irrespective of whether it is the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the National Party of Australia-and where is the National Party in this debate? No-one is listed to speak. No-one is in the chamber listening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not notice Senator Brownhill because he is not sitting in his normal seat but in the seat usually occupied by the National Party Whip. However, where is the Leader of the National Party in the Senate (Senator Boswell)? Where are the Queensland National Party senators? I will tell honourable senators where they are: they are in a bunker with brown paper bags over their heads rather than filling those bags with money. They do not want to take part in this debate because they have been exposed in Queensland, first of all, for taking donations for the Bjelke-Petersen fund and, secondly, for having a number of their former Ministers go to gaol for rorting their expenses. We will not hear anything from the National Party in this debate. Its members have been proved guilty of corruption and of corrupting the system. They wanted to raise money to enable their Party to pay for its election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Independent Commission Against Corruption report has proved that money is being used in the political system in New South Wales. I make no bones about the fact that the John Curtin trust fund was established because the Western Australian Labor Party, like all political parties in the long run, was faced with how they would raise funds to pay for effective campaigns. Political parties must rely on corporate funding. Unless we deal with the problem of knowing that the only way in which we can pay for a $10m or a $20m election campaign is to get it from the corporate sector, we are putting ourselves in the hands of a very small number of people in the community-people with real power. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be much more interested in hearing the Opposition's arguments regarding the banning of advertising in the electronic media if it said that it was in favour of full disclosure. The Opposition is not in favour because it is very afraid that people will see who really is running the Liberal Party. Honourable senators opposite have claimed that the ban is unheard of in the Western world. They do not realise that most European countries and most countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development that are defined as first rate democracies have limitations and bans on advertising. Even Margaret Thatcher-the neo-type New Right leader who, for example, Senator Bishop models herself on-for 10 years supported, and never moved to get rid of, the complete ban on paid advertising on radio and television in Great Britain. She made not one move to change that. There is also full disclosure in Great Britain. Public companies in Great Britain make full disclosure as to which political parties they give donations. There has been no evidence of intimidation. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite say, `What about the trade unions?'. At least a trade union's donations have to be published in an annual report. There is no requirement on the Opposition's mates in the company sector to disclose publicly to whom they give donations. Why are companies not forced to tell their shareholders that they have given $500,000 to the Liberal Party, and/or $500,000 to the Labor Party? If the Opposition were serious about that, it would be forcing changes to the Companies Act so that companies would be forced to disclose political donations to their shareholders. There is not a word from the Liberal Party on that. Companies are afraid to explain to their shareholders where their money has been going for 50 or 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard that the international covenant on human rights may be breached. If it is breached on this piece of legislation that is soon to come into this place, it means that every country in Western Europe has also breached that covenant. </PARA>

He mentioned some of them, including the Law Council of Australia-the last resort of utter privilege in Australia; an organisation that represents the highest income earners in this country in a vested and protected position. When will the Law Council of Australia start arguing that it should publish and put into the public domain so many of its own procedures to ensure transparency of its operations? Members of the Law Council were in the courts trying to stop the publication of the Westpac documents. They had no ethics about free speech. They used the system to stop disclosure of documents and to stop free speech.</PARA></TALK.START>

Not one statement came from the Law Council of Australia opposing the rigging of appointments to the Supreme Court in that State. The Law Council is a body of utter hypocrisy on this issue. It represents privilege; it represents money. The reason that the Law Council does not want the ban is that sometimes, when governments may choose to change the law to affect the income of members of the legal profession, it wants to be able to pull in millions of dollars from its wealthy supporters to run campaigns against the Government-whichever Party that might be. The Law Council is representative of utter privilege in this community. </PARA>

To return to the debate, I said that we are seeing a precursor of the connivance that will go on between the Democrats and the Government to achieve the curtailment of the freedom of speech. I said that what we have seen take place is the replacement of our motion, which was designed to uphold the freedom of speech and uphold the principle of article 19 in the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights, with one which is contrary to it in all terms. Indeed, Senator Bolkus, I dare say, could be renamed `Censor Bolkus'. Government senators could ask themselves why the Australian Labor Party (ALP) today has protested so much at the concept of freedom of speech being protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What do we mean by the term `freedom of speech'? What does it mean to the ordinary man and woman in the street? It means enjoying the right to utter words and sentences, exempt from arbitrary control. Arbitrary control is what Senator Bolkus wishes to impose upon the Australian people. We have the right to speak free from intimidation. Today in Question Time we asked whether we would remain free from intimidation; whether the penalty for breaking this ban would be a fine; and whether a person who refused to pay the fine for breaking that ban against freedom of speech would be imprisoned. That to me is intimidation</PARA>
<PARA> We have heard those on the other side pontificate about the need for disclosure and make some sort of claim about moral ethics. I ask: why does this need to be on now when we see a need for the Australian Labor Party to somehow ease itself away from the sleaze of WA Inc. and what we might call the golden-shoe brigade-far richer than anything we ever saw in Queensland, I might say? These are the people who had slush funds of $300,000 for the secretary of the Premier of the day-and it came in cash. She brought a bag to collect it in, take it away and divide it up. The initials on the bag were whose? They were Brian Burke's initials. He is the man who is supposedly serving this country in a diplomatic way in Ireland at the present time. Every time the Minister responsible, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), is asked the question, he washes his hands like Pontius Pilate and says, `It is no business of mine'. It will not do!</PARA>
<PARA> As the WA Inc. inquiry continues, honourable senators on the Government benches will be dragged further and further into the mire. To counteract what will happen to them, they come out strong and say that everybody should be denied freedom of speech. They say in defence, `Well, look here, we are actually going to ban the right of everybody to have freedom of speech, including St Vincent de Paul, charitable groups, and anybody who comes along'.</PARA>

Let us look at how intimidation can be brought to bear on someone who may donate money to someone who is not of the persuasion of honourable senators opposite.

As I said the other day in a press release, when we examine the way the Government will curtail speech, when we look at the questions of definition that are involved and at the competing definitions, we will ask, `Who is to be the arbiter; who is to be the person who decides whether one advertisement is allowable and another is not?

<PARA> As we come to these issues in this chamber, there has been consistency in attitude from me on freedom of speech. As I was saying before, on the question of the curtailment of freedom of speech and the right to advertise in regard to tobacco, alcohol and snack foods, the regulators will move speedily every time to advance their cause. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we come to the question of direct mail, which is very dear to the heart of the ALP. This has already been raised by speakers on this side. We saw $3m of taxpayers' money illegally spent by the Labor Party with retrospective legislation passed to legitimise what was an illegal act. We are now adding more money to make funding available for direct mail. Let us look at the scenario. Here we have compulsory registration, compulsory voting and that very sophisticated tool of campaigning which anybody who has looked at the United States or the United Kingdom will see as a very accurate and targeted set of campaign tools. Let us go further and look at the data banks which the Labor Party has put together under a de facto Australia Card. Once data banks exist, information leaks. The Government combined compulsory voting and direct mail, accurately targeted, yet it sees fit to curtail the right of oppositions and individual groups which represent freedom of speech to put their point of view across using the television and the electronic waves. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus may rise, turn his back to me and walk up the stairs because the plight of freedom of speech falls deaf on his ears-the rights that we have in this country to speak in an unfettered way and the right to have that speech made public, which is what happens through radio and television. Indeed, radio is one of the most cost-effective methods of getting a message out. It is cheap, it is efficient and everybody has access to it. A radio commercial can be put to air for as little as $40. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments that are put forth by the people who want to exaggerate an advantage that they say comes to some in fact are covering up the fact that they are unattractive and therefore will not attract funds to compete with, that in the market place they can no longer compete and that they are broke because they overspent, and that therefore they want to take away the precious right of freedom of speech. It is pathetic. It is a very sad day indeed when we see a government attempt to fetter the right of individuals to speak out and when we see difficult and complicated legal aspects of definitional problems being put to an arbitrary tribunal as the body determining whether or not something is allowed to go to air. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, if we take that argument to its logical conclusion, every political statement that we make will be interpreted, filtered and fettered by a journalist who will publish his or her interpretation of what the political message is. If we take that to its logical conclusions, we should also regulate to require that every newspaper employs on its staff 50 per cent who are paid-up members of the Labor Party and 50 per cent who are paid-up members of the coalition.

Its stance is sure to maximise the potential for corruption. It supports paid advertising, but it opposes full disclosure of political donations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was about to talk about the soaring costs of election campaigning, and there is no doubt that a major component of those costs is broadcast advertising. In relation to spending by political parties on television alone, in the 1983 Federal election some $3.75m was spent; in 1987, $7.17m; at the last Federal election in 1990 that amount had risen to well over $10m. The cost of an advertisement on television is up to $13,000 a minute; on radio it is up to $1,300 a minute. The costs are very great indeed. I noticed an article in the Weekend Australian written by Phillip Adams who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Free speech-here is the one form of speech that isn't free at all. Indeed it can only be afforded by the wealthiest of corporations or by lavishly funded pressure groups. Compare the $30,000 spent by green groups in the last election to the millions spent by front organisations for the timber interests. Even the political parties cannot afford this sort of free speech, which is why they have to go grovelling for donations doing their squalid backroom deals.</PARA>
<PARA>One may or may not agree about squalid backroom deals, but the reality is that the only way a political party in 1991 can fund an election campaign with a significant level of electronic media advertising is through donations from the corporate sector. There is absolutely no other way of doing it. The money must come from big business interests. I join Senator Schacht as one of those people who certainly do not want to see the Australian Labor Party at the beck and call of those sorts of vested interests. Frankly, I would not like to see any Australian political party at the beck and call of those vested interests. But of course in relation to the Liberal Party we have had that situation since its formation. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is: how does one raise that amount of money? Who has that amount of money? If one does get that amount of money, does one admit it to the Australian people? That is the crucial point. When this Government proposed a package of reforms in this area, two fundamental proposals were put forward. The first was a ban on electronic media advertising. The second was full disclosure of all donations to political parties. That was how Senator Bolkus announced the Government's package. As soon as it was announced, Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Liberal Party, jumped in and, for the first time, actually took a principled position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins is also right. For 24 hours he supported full disclosure of donations to political parties. An article appeared in the Australian on Thursday 21 March this year under the front page heading `Libs accept disclosure of funding sources'. The article read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, yesterday overruled party policy and declared that the Liberal Party would accept full disclosure of the sources of political funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite Dr Hewson's clear statement, the federal director of the party, Mr Andrew Robb, denied this meant the Liberals favoured the Hawke Government's proposed electoral reform to require full disclosure of funds . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Hewson is now facing a fight in the Shadow Cabinet and the party over his policy backflip on disclosure of funds, which has consistently been opposed by the Liberals . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Robb told the Australian Liberal support was not certain, because Dr Hewson was talking about disclosure in a perfect world . . .</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's spokesman on electoral matters, Senator Parer-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that this is a classic-</PARA>
<PARA>was also caught out by Dr Hewson's comments, saying the disclosure provision could lead to Liberal donors being intimidated by unionists. </PARA>
<PARA>What claptrap. But, as I said, Dr Hewson took a principled position for a few hours, and then came the back down at his press conference on 28 March. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I've said it quite clearly, and it seems that some on the media have real difficulty understanding what I've said. I've said it very clearly, that my disposition is of course in favour of disclosure. But in the past there's been a lot of concern about the potential for intimidation and inequity and so I've said that I would need to see the legislation. Look, my disposition is there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision to knock over Dr Hewson was endorsed by the shadow Cabinet. I suppose it is typical of what a weak and ineffective leader John Hewson is. Yet again we have seen John Hewson comprehensively rolled in his own Party. Last time it was a party room rebellion over the dismantling of a few Federal departments, such as education and social security. This time he has been rolled by his Party machine. It is typical Hewson, the Clayton's leader, the leader one has when one does not have a leader.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no wonder that the Liberal Party has changed its mind on this issue. Let us look at its record. Let us take for example, Community Polling in New South Wales. I do not think I shall have enough time tonight to go into all the details about the rorts, the funding of independent candidates, the funding of Liberal Party candidates through a shonky outfit called Community Polling, deliberately established to breach the electoral laws in New South Wales under the guiding hand of machine apparatchiks like Senator Bishop and the others in New South Wales. Then we had the Independent Commission Against Corruption report on the investigation into north coast development. Who will ever forget the role of the National Party of Australia in the north coast of New South Wales? The paper bag mentality. Completely exposed by Commissioner Roden in his inquiry. This is what Commissioner Roden said:</PARA>
<PARA>The alternative to compulsory public disclosure, I believe, is an unacceptable risk that through financial necessity, influence with Government (of any political colour) will be a purchasable commodity. </PARA>
<PARA>No doubt he is right. There is no doubt also that this proposal from the Government to amend the electoral laws in this manner is a principled move and one which will receive the support of the overwhelming majority of Australians who believe in fair elections and genuine democracy in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I wanted to enter the debate because I have had considerable experience on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. As a matter of fact, I think I am now the longest serving member on that Committee. I want to make it perfectly clear, as I think it was made clear during the debate, that the current proposal by the Government is not the proposal that was recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Incidentally, I wrote a very brief dissenting response to the report of that Committee. Nevertheless, I was a member of that Committee and went through all of the difficulty and trouble of going through submissions and trying to come to a conclusion on the matter. I, along with a lot of other people who presented evidence to the Committee, was concerned that election campaigning these days is about image making and very, very rarely is the voter given the opportunity of considering the policy issues in a reasonable, in-depth way through political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems of the recommendation put forward by the Committee was that the free time proposal contained no stipulation as to the form that it would take to ensure that information about policies would be given to voters and that there would be real debate. The slick political image makers are the bane of voters at election time. However, the current proposal of the Government to ban television and radio advertisements will not prevent the modern political campaigns being dominated by this type of sloganeering and image first politics. The image maker minders will simply divert the money saved to slick advertisements in the print media- magazines, video trailers, direct mail and junk mail. They will be able to pour more money into the production of campaign launches with accompanying razzamatazz, which the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and commercial television stations are required to carry during election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> Together with current affairs programs, whose agendas are set by the producers or the political minders and the 10-second news grabs, glib campaign launches will be the only political messages received by television viewers and radio listeners. So, with this proposal, if voters get their information from television and radio, they will get only the razzamatazz and political campaign launches or what the television current affairs producers or news producers think are important. Everything else will be censored out. </PARA>
<PARA> If the views of community groups or individuals on policy issues do not coincide with those of the political image makers or by the producers, or are not considered important by them, those citizens will be prevented by law from airing their views over television or radio. Voters who rely upon the electronic media for information are entitled to know where political parties and candidates stand on issues of concern and why. It can be argued that this right has become sullied in recent elections by the dominance of glib image making television political advertisements inflicted on viewers by the political parties. There are, in my view, ways to reverse this costly dominance without resort to decisions which attack civil and political rights.</PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Senate to consider why, if we are considering the cost of election campaigning, we do not have a ceiling on the amount which political parties and candidates can spend on elections. </PARA>

I submit that it is no longer an urgency motion under that standing order because the Australian Democrats have suspended Standing Orders in order to have their own motion put, but that is not an urgency motion under that standing order and, therefore, it does not require a vote in accordance with paragraph (7) of that standing order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) which was tabled today is only in respect of that period from 5 March 1990 to 30 June 1990. In so far as it therefore relates to only a restricted part of the financial year, it is important to note that most of it draws on what would previously have been undertaken in reports of the former Department of Aboriginal Affairs. In fact, much of the report reflects the style, the tenor and the information that has formerly flowed from that Department. I will await either the Estimates next week or, alternatively, a later stage to talk on the more interesting aspects of the operations of ATSIC as they have unfolded in recent months. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I would like to take the opportunity to refer to the particular comments on page 25 which relate to the community development employment projects (CDEP). Honourable senators will be aware that a number of my colleagues and I have placed on the Notice Paper of the Senate a series of very comprehensive questions from each State and Territory in Australia with regard to the operation of the CDEP program. The answers that have come in across every State have revealed that there are serious problems with the operation of this program. </PARA>
<PARA> In its concept form the CDEP is an excellent scheme in that it basically replaces unemployment benefits with a better form of arrangement in Aboriginal communities-in fact, many hundreds of them. This report shows that as at 30 June there were 166 participating communities with over 27,000 people affected-workers, spouses or children. However, the concerning fact was that the vast majority of those communities and the programs that have been implemented were subjected to either qualified audit reports or unsatisfactory management comment by ATSIC in the answers that were tabled over the past month to the questions on notice. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important that if we are to have a program of this nature and cost magnitude operating we need to be very careful in ensuring that all of the objectives are being properly met. I know that from the point of view of the Northern Territory the amount of benefit that is being paid in the current financial year to the 30-odd communities and over 7,000 participants well exceeds $40m. </PARA>
<PARA> The answers that were given to the questions on CDEP cause me again to reflect on the urgency of this matter and the need for strict audit, comprehensive management of ATSIC and close attention in each of the communities in which they are intended to serve where we must ensure that the benefits are properly flowing to those families that are affected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to speak on the annual report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). In keeping with my normal concern about the timeliness of annual reports I mention the fact that it is now April and this report is for the few months that ended in June 1990-in fact, the period from 5 March 1990 to 30 June. It has taken an extraordinary amount of time for this report to come to the Senate. The letter conveying the report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) was dated 4 March so there has not been an enormous delay in the Minister's office, but I think we do need an explanation as to why this report took so long to get here, particularly in view of the fact that the Office of Evaluation and Audit (OEA) has been established within the Commission pursuant to Section 75 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the purposes of that office is to ensure that reports are relevant, constructive and timely. On the issue of timeliness it certainly has not started off too well. We recognise that obviously there are a lot of problems to be faced and the Office of Evaluation and Audit has set out on a course to try to make certain that reporting is more effective in the future. I notice that the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>OEA evaluations and audits are directed not only to ensure the maintenance of the highest possible standards of administration and accountability but also to assist ATSIC management in program review and policy development. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, OEA has been given the responsibility for the development of risk assessments and a fraud-control plan for the commission. </PARA>
<PARA>I would hope that the problems we have seen so far in this report will be absent in the future particularly, as I understand it, as a fraud control plan is expected to be finalised early in the current financial year. The report continues as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>OEA's work program will be reviewed in the light of the risk assessment of commission activities. </PARA>
<PARA>I would also like to point out, as I do with any organisation which has qualifications to its report, that there are qualifications from the Australian National Audit Office on this report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commission acknowledges that due to inadequacies in its accounts and records it is unable to verify that all expenditure relating to Community Development Employment Projects has been made in respect of participants resident in the relevant Community . . . For the reasons detailed in Note 9 to the statements, I am unable to attest to the value of plant and equipment acquired from the former Department of Aboriginal Affairs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The auditors' report on Morr Morr Pastoral Company Pty Ltd was qualified because . . . it did not conduct a stocktake as at 30 June 1990. Accordingly, the auditors were unable to satisfy themselves that the value of stock disclosed in the statements at that date was accurate. The auditors' report on Yeperenye Pty Ltd was qualified because the auditors were not present at the stocktake conducted at year end, and were unable to form an opinion on the value of the stock. </PARA>
<PARA>In fairness, I should say that these qualifications in the auditors' statement do not, in the opinion of the Auditor-General, have a material effect on the state of affairs of the Commission as at 30 June 1990. All they demonstrate is that there are still some problems yet to be resolved in the accounting function in this area of government. I should also mention that there is a substantial provision for doubtful debts of $6.7m required in the gross receivable loans of $178m. That is not a large amount in view of the outstanding amounts, but I would hope that the new procedures will diminish the risk of bad and doubtful debts. I think the only other matter of moment is to note the following:</PARA>
<PARA>A liquidator was appointed by the Supreme Court of Queensland on 5 February 1991 to wind up the affairs of Warrama Living History Centre Pty Ltd, following its earlier appointment of a Receiver to the company on 29 October 1990. Realisation of the cost of the Commission's investment in the company will be dependent upon the outcome of the liquidation. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I should just mention briefly that the qualifications about Morr Morr Pastoral Company Pty Ltd are about its stockholding, which has something like $2.1m or $2.2m, and the profit for the company was $238,000. Something like a 10 per cent variation in that stock valuation could have a significant impact on the stated profit. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The report relates to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 and to the report on financial assistance granted to each State in the calendar year 1989. I note that shortly the Senate will also be considering the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 report in respect of non-government schools for the same calendar year. This is an important report because it sets out and establishes the various grants that are given by the Government for many reasons-whether they are for ethnic purposes, for non-government schools or for various financial assistance reasons-and whether they are capital or recurrent. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the issue that I want to address relates to my electorate in the Northern Territory, where one of the beneficiaries mentioned in this report is an important school-an independent Aboriginal school-called Yipirinya School in Alice Springs, which has been set up to provide for the special educational needs of Aboriginal children. The finances that are made available through the Federal Department of Employment, Education and Training are, of course, well-targeted and well-established for the purposes that they must serve in each community, particularly where the education of Aboriginal children is concerned. The Yipirinya School receives financial grants, as has been pointed out in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me that in recent weeks there has been a continuing protest in Alice Springs relating to the proposal to construct a flood mitigation dam very close to the region of Alice Springs. It has been reported to me that a number of staff, including senior staff, from the Yipirinya School have been engaged almost full time in manning various protests which have resulted, subsequently and consequently, in work on the flood mitigation dam being stopped. I hope that the resources, and in particular the financial benefits that are made available to Yipirinya School, are not being applied to fund what I can only describe as extracurricular activities which must be outside the scope of Commonwealth funding programs. Indeed, it would be a great irony if we found that one arm of government was funding a school for the purpose of providing education and that those resources were being applied to fund activities against other arms of government-particularly within this portfolio, where the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Tickner, has had to take deliberative action with regard to that flood mitigation dam. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that during the Estimates Committee hearings next week I will receive an assurance from the Department of Employment, Education and Training that none of the funding that has been so generously and properly provided for the provision of educational services for Aboriginal children has in any way been syphoned off or applied to these other activities. At the same time, I note that groups such as the Central Land Council and Aboriginal Legal Aid, which have provided professional assistance to Aborigines with regard to the protest at the dam site, would be acting totally within their charters of responsibility, both as land councils and as legal aid providers. However, I would be annoyed if any other organisation which is funded for specific purposes, such as education in this instance, relied on government money to fund the protest purposes. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>David John Gundy, a 29-year-old Aboriginal man, died as a result of receiving a wound prior to six o'clock-and that is material-on 27 April 1989 when a police shotgun discharged in his bedroom during an unlawful police raid on his home at 193 Sydenham Road, Marrickville. The important point to note, even at this stage, is that the police had no legal right to be at his home at that time. If the police had had reasonable grounds to believe that Porter, the suspected criminal that they were pursuing, was in any one of the premises-and there were six of them-which they forcibly entered on that day they would have needed no warrant to make a surprise and forced entry into those premises to arrest him. In fact, they had no information to justify a belief that Porter, the man whom they were seeking, was in any of the particular premises-including the one where David John Gundy was asleep. </PARA>
<PARA> A search warrant could be validly applied for and issued only if there were reasonable grounds to believe that Porter's gun and clothes were in the particular premises for which the warrant was sought. As the evidence unfolded before the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, it became quite clear that the police had relied on an unreliable witness who had simply pointed out to them a number of premises where Porter could be. The police, in their anxiety to get hold of Porter, decided that they would stage a series of simultaneous raids on the basis of search warrants. </PARA>
<PARA> But police demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in other ways when carrying out that particular raid. They did not bother to wait until 6 a.m., which was the earliest time at which the warrants authorised the searches. The premises were entered and David Gundy was shot six minutes before six o'clock. The written notice required to be given to the occupier of the premises was never served. Peaceful occupants were held at gunpoint and made to lie on the floor, although they had not resisted the execution of the warrant in any way. The required report was not made to the justice of the peace until seven weeks after the raid, instead of the prescribed 10 days. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear, therefore, that the police had no right to be in David Gundy's bedroom, much less to point a loaded and cocked shotgun at him. It was found that he was accidentally shot by the gun of a trespassing policeman when he sought to turn the intruder out of his room. Despite the fact that the police officer had been highly trained to enter premises and confront dangerous criminals, he had not been trained to cope with an unarmed, near-naked man who reacted angrily when woken from his sleep by armed men bursting into his house. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of this case is causing concern. Regrettably, to this day, police have refused to recognise the shortcomings in the training and methods used by the Special Branch, the unlawfulness of the raid and the patent untruth on which it was based. Police have continued to have this particular attitude. The killing of the man was followed by an assassination of his character, to which some sections of the media all too readily lent themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner examined carefully all physical evidence of how the shooting actually happened. He examined Mr Gundy's body and the patterns made by his blood on the walls, floor and furniture of the bedroom in which he was shot. He reached the conclusion that the man's left hand must have been touching or very close to the muzzle of the shotgun at the time it went off and that he was probably leaning forward near the doorway. The Commissioner was satisfied that Dawson, the policeman who shot Gundy, believed that it was necessary to pull the shotgun back in order that it should not be taken by Gundy and that in the process, his finger quite accidentally went onto the trigger and pressed it as he used his hands to pull the gun back. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Commissioner goes on to say that, firstly, it is quite clear that the police need to have greater respect for the law, which they are intended to enforce, and secondly, that their training was quite clearly deficient. In addition to that, I think it must be said that the policeman who was the unfortunate perpetrator of this killing has indicated his regret to this day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report into the death of David John Gundy is a report of a shameful, horrifying and dismaying event in the history of New South Wales, indeed, in the history of Australia. A lot has been said about the way in which Mr Gundy was shot. In the beginning of the report, it says that Mr Gundy was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . in truth a law-abiding hard-working family man who had no criminal association and who had no contact of any kind with Porter and no contact of any kind with him after his shooting of police. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gundy was shot; he was killed. The point I want to mention this evening is the way his son, Bradley, and his wife-his widow by that stage-Mrs Doreen Eatts, were treated by the police immediately after his death. On page 134 of the report, we read about what happened to Bradley. Bradley was not told what had happened to his father. He saw some blood on the floor. He obviously heard the gunshots, but he was never told that his father was dead; or that his father had in fact been shot. The police decided that he should go to a relative's place. In the police car on the way to his uncle's place, Bradley heard over the radio that his father had died. He started to cry. One of the police officers stopped the car and tried to calm him. The police then drove on and left Bradley with his aunt. This was apparently the end of police interest in Bradley. That is a really horrifying thing to say about the police in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> While Stephenson, Wilson and other police officers displayed great concern for the psychological effect on the man who shot Mr Gundy when his shotgun discharged, they seem to have been much less sensitive to the terrible experience of young Bradley whose father had been killed in the next room by a police officer's gun. No real attempt was made to explain anything to Bradley or to obtain any professional assistance for him. He was simply driven to a relative's place and left there. This is another particularly striking example of the lack of sensitivity and concern shown on the part of police for the effect of their activities on civilians. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what happened to Mrs Doreen Eatts. On page 138 she told the coroner that while she was talking to a police officer on the phone about her husband-and we understand at that stage the police officer had told her that her husband had been injured-she saw a film of her house on television and heard the news that her husband had died on the way to hospital. That is another truly horrifying occurrence. She was unable to continue to speak to the police officer and her mother took over the phone. Doreen is now unclear about the sequence of events and still finds talking about it very distressing. I find reading about it very distressing. The whole thing is extremely distressing. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I would like to join the very large number of my fellow New South Welshmen and women, including the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Robert Tickner, in giving my strong support to the recommendations of Commissioner Wootten, which call for compensation for Mrs Doreen Eatts and Master Bradley Eatts, the widow and son of Mr David Gundy. The sooner the New South Wales Government comes up with some fair compensation for these people, the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to support the remarks made by the previous two speakers. The report is sober reading for anyone. I would certainly commend its reading to anyone concerned about the proper administration of the rule of law under which we all live. A police officer's job is a difficult one at the very best of times and my sympathies are often with the police. I know many of them in the Northern Territory extremely well. They work under difficult conditions, particularly in domestic situations. I also know that to many dedicated and professional police officers, this entire sad and sorry incident is of the most extreme regret.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was profoundly disturbed when reading this report not only for this unfortunate man's own loss of life, but also for the way in which his wife and son were treated afterwards. They were treated in an unfeeling and insensitive manner which I am sure most police officers would regret. Also of great concern to me are some attitudinal problems that exist within the police force. In some of the interviews given by police officers after the incident, the police blamed the victim. I have not forgotten an interview with an officer of the New South Wales Police Association whose argument was quite simply that if Gundy had not struggled in the way described in the report-and described briefly by Senator Spindler-with a police officer whom he found pointing a shotgun at him at six o'clock in the morning in his own bedroom, he would not have been shot. Therefore the fault for his being shot was his-the victim's-not the police officer's. That kind of attitude, expressed even after an incident like this has occurred, causes grave concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I join, as others have done before, in expressing my concern to the family of this unfortunate man who was shot unlawfully by police on his premises while he was peacefully asleep in his bed at six o'clock in the morning. I certainly join all others in the Senate in hoping that such an incident is not repeated. I must say that I hope that some of the attitudes that were unfortunately expressed by serving police officers after this incident occurred are not perpetuated. </PARA>

<PARA>I do not want to speak too long on this report, but it happens to be one of those reports by a governmental body which is having, as one would expect, some difficulties coping with the change to that awful word `corporatisation' The Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) shakes his head and I agree, but it is the go word. </PARA>
<PARA> Corporatisation is an uncomfortable halfway house between being a governmental body and being privatised. This organisation has moved to trust account handling of its finances, which may well remove it from the scrutiny of Senate Estimates committees, despite the fact that it will be spending what could be described as large amounts of taxpayers' money or could be acting under guarantees of taxpayers. Nevertheless, it still is receiving budget allocations. So for that reason, even though it has moved to trust account funding, it will be subject to some sort of scrutiny at Senate Estimates. One problem is the extent to which those trust accounts will be readily available for a detailed examination in a timely way by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's report does raise some interesting questions. These questions are outlined in the response from the head of the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL) to the audit report. He starts off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the final recommendations are positive and that their implementation will be of significant assistance to AGAL's future operations . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Then the Auditor-General goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This Report highlights some of the problems faced in publishing the results of efficiency, as distinct from financial, audits of `commercial' programs in the public sector; particularly those which are required to recover their full costs and to compete with the private sector for much of their work. One of the principal concerns is that the public reporting of deficiencies, irrespective of their gravity, will be likely to promote selective criticism from competitors either in the market place or through parliamentary or administrative processes. The reasons will, of course, be more related to commerce than any desire to improve efficiency, and, in the service industry market, be likely to aim at changing public perceptions. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no obvious simple solution to this problem since similar arguments could be advanced to restrict the publication of a whole range of criticisms of administrative processes. Nevertheless, this issue has clear implications for a large number of DAS programs which are trying to establish and maintain their market in a competitive environment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That raises some serious problems for us. If by implication there is a suggestion that governmental bodies like this should not be subject to detailed scrutiny, that there should not be exposure of their deficiencies and that these inquiries, properly conducted by the Senate, for example, at Senate Estimates should not expose these organisations to scrutiny which may embarrass them or cause difficulties in their marketplace, the way to resolve it is not to block inquiry; on the contrary it is to get rid of this uneasy, halfway corporatised position and privatise these bodies so that they compete reasonably, openly and properly in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the first time I have seen this kind of problem raised by a corporatised body. It should encourage the Government to proceed further down this road rather than remain in this uncomfortable halfway house. I hope to see AGAL largely capable of maintaining a position in a privatised form, even though the great bulk of its business is with governmental departments. If it is felt that it could not survive in a privatised state, surely the fact that it is competing with the private sector to provide services to government should encourage it to reveal all and behave in the most competitive way possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make the point and agree with the head of AGAL that there should be recognition of the magnitude and complexity of the task that the Government gave AGAL to achieve in a tight time frame and with limited resources when in fact it changed the nature of its functions only recently. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National Audit Office acknowledges, and I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Australian Government Analyst's concern that AGAL's competitors might attempt to use the published audit report to disadvantage AGAL in the market place.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Unlike a private sector body, however, AGAL is part of a Department of State and is therefore subject to a higher level of accountability to the Parliament and the public. External audit is part of that higher accountability, and, because of the assurance it provides, can be to AGAL's advantage. Any adverse commercial effects arising from a published audit report can be minimised when references to deficiencies are accompanied by reference to remedial action taken or in hand.</PARA>
<PARA>At this point it should be noted that remedial action is in hand in almost all the matters raised by the Auditor-General so that there will be higher efficiency in AGAL. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall point made in the report is that AGAL, in the opinion of the Auditor, has been managing well in the transitional stage of its move to commercial operations and has developed a greater client focus in the conduct of its work. There is scope for further improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations, particularly in the management of its public interest functions. I simply say that what the Auditor-General says is required is this: AGAL would benefit from having a coherent program for its public interest activities; some of the costs currently charged to public interest should be charged instead to clients, either directly or through overhead costs; AGAL would benefit from having a long term marketing and promotion strategy; AGAL should ensure that its pricing policy results in charges sufficient to achieve full cost recovery of its commercial activities; AGAL has generally achieved a high level of quality in its work, but there is a need for clients to be more involved in establishing acceptance criteria for analytical results; and AGAL should establish minimum standards for quality assurance applicable to all of its laboratories. In conclusion, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Implementation of the recommendations contained in this Report could achieve savings on expenditure on public interest activities and reduce the need for finance from the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, this report points very rationally to the sorts of problems facing these bodies. I would like to make only one further point where the Auditor-General deals with the Government decision to establish AGAL's public interest arrangements. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The government decision establishing AGAL's public interest arrangements also required that AGAL's clients pay the full cost of services. There are several reasons for this. AGAL's clients (mainly Commonwealth departments) are likely to impose higher efficiency demands than if AGAL were to do the work for the taxpayer via the public interest activities. If client departments bear the full cost they are in turn more likely to pass these costs on to the final users (for example, importers or agricultural producers) thus giving the necessary signals that will encourage improved behaviour (for example, better scrutiny of the overseas suppliers and better use of agricultural chemicals). </PARA>
<PARA> Costs passed on to the private sector reduce the burden on government revenue and thus the taxpayer. Should clients react to paying full costs by cutting back analytical programs it is they, not AGAL, who should properly be responsible for this decision. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is an acknowledgment of the role of the marketplace in the Office of the Auditor-General and certainly in the decisions corporatising AGAL. However, there is still a long way to go and the problems involved in corporatisation, and not privatisation, are clearly outlined in this report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for inquiry and report by 30 November 1991:</PARA>
<PARA> The relations between Australia and the republics of Latin America, with particular reference to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) extension of political and cultural exchanges;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the further development of trade and transport links;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the prospects for investment and joint economic ventures;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) joint participation in multilateral and other international organisations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) co-operation on matters of international law enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my remarks in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Until recently Australia's interest in Latin America, at both official and unofficial levels, was relatively limited. This was due to geographical realities; differing linguistic, cultural and institutional heritages; an absence of substantial commercial contact; relatively little person to person contact in the political and business spheres; and perceptions that the region was both remote and of little strategic significance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Other powerful perceptions which limited Australian awareness and understanding of the region arose from Latin America's traditional orientation towards Europe and North America; the fact that Australia's exports were largely competitive with, and not complementary to, those of the region; and a historical absence of substantial trade links, compounded by poor transport connections inhibiting the development of new trade opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>However, over recent years, interest in Australia-Latin America relations has increased considerably, due to developments both within Australia and in that region. This fresh focus marks the beginning of a process which can only be of benefit to the countries concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>The Latin American region comprises some twenty-three separate states or entities of government: the 11 republics of South America (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela); the eight nations of Central America (Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama); one independent Commonwealth State (Guyana); one colony French Guiana; as well as the chief neighbouring islands: the Falklands (Great Britain) off Argentina and the Galapagos (Ecuador) off Ecuador. </PARA>
<PARA>Although Australia's relations with the USA, Japan, the Asian region and Europe warrant the high priority presently accorded to them, the expansion of our links with Latin America also deserves serious attention. In recent years, due principally to the consolidation of democracy in Latin America, its republics have increased their efforts to explore new forms of, mainly economic integration, to make possible stronger economic negotiating strength and establish a more attractive market for foreign investment. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia can seek to strengthen its ties with the Latin American republics in several ways, among them the extension of political and cultural exchanges; the further development of trade and transport links; increased investment and a greater readiness to participate in joint economic ventures; stronger joint participation in the activities of multilateral and other international organisations; and greater cooperation on matters of international law enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA>The new opportunities open to Australia and other nations by the liberalisation of Latin American trade are immense. </PARA>
<PARA>More regular government to government contact at the political and public service levels between Australia and the Latin American nations would be highly beneficial to all parties. Attempts at increasing bilateral cooperation in the cultural sphere are already underway. A Consortium for Iberian and Latin American Studies in Australia (CILASA) is to be established in July 1991, and it is planned to eventually set up an Institute of Latin American Studies at the Australian National University. </PARA>
<PARA>Latin America, with a population of 450 million, plays an important part in world trade. The region has a productive and commercial capacity and record which is often under-estimated. It produces 40 per cent of the world's silver and 25 per cent of its copper. Brazil is the world's largest sugar exporter. Australia's major Latin American trading partners are Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Trade between Australia and Latin America grew from $A393 million in 1980-81 to $A1,346 million in 1989-90 (i.e. 1.5 per cent of Australia's world trade in 1989-90). Australia's overall trade volumes in the region-while not great-are nevertheless significant. In 1990 Australian-Latin American trade flows were greater than those with South Asia and about the same as with Eastern Europe. Clearly Australia is in a sound position to embark on a campaign aimed at increasing the volume and extent of Australian-Latin American trade. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a process is underway but Australia needs to do more and quickly because other nations and groups of nations have already divined Latin America's trading and investment potential. Japanese investment in the region has been steadily expanding since the mid 1980s. Like the USA, Japan has recognised that the issues of debt, aid, trade and investment are strongly linked. The provision of aid and the financing of debt are increasingly becoming the chief means by which new investment in Latin America is being financed. </PARA>
<PARA>Equally important have been recent developments in the free trade area between North and South America. In June 1990 President Bush announced the ``Enterprise for the Americas'' Initiative, committing the USA to playing a constructive role in making the Americas the first fully free trade hemisphere. And last November came the ``Partnership for Democracy and Development'' which aims to make it possible for Central America to participate in the ``Enterprise for the Americas'' Initiative. On 5 February 1991 the USA, Canada and Mexico began negotiations to establish (in 1992) what would in population terms be the world's largest free trade zone (360 million people compared with Western Europe's 326 million). </PARA>
<PARA>The need for quick and determined trade and investment approaches on Australia's part cannot be overstated. I would like to illustrate this by reference to two Latin American nations-Venezuela and Mexico. </PARA>
<PARA>Venezuela, mainly by virtue of its enormous oil reserves, has played a central role in encouraging greater economic integration within Latin America. Australia's exports to Venezuela have increased substantially in recent years ($A10.7 million in 1987-88 to $A66.2 million in 1989-90). Australian imports from Venezuela during the same period rose from $A1.3 million to $A12.7 million. </PARA>
<PARA>Venezuela's economic restructuring, including privatisations, offers considerable scope for Australian involvement in areas such as mining, agriculture and telecommunications. One Australian mining company is currently engaged in a joint venture gold mining operation in Eastern Venezuela. The Venezuelan oil industry has expressed an interest to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in securing Australian participation in oil exploration and development in Venezuela. BP Australia is already involved in the Venezuelan oil industry through co-operation in technology and research. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Gareth Evans' visit to Mexico in October 1990 and President Salinas of Mexico's recent trip to Australia have confirmed that the Mexican/Australian economic relationship has significant potential. Areas of possible trade and investment interest for Australia include:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the possibilities opened up by the privatisation process, including the banking, transport and minerals/metals sectors;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the emerging demand for coal imported from Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Australian agricultural exports, particularly dairy products. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Blewett will lead a high level business delegation to Mexico early in May. It has been organised by the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI). Specific areas to receive attention will be banking, telecommunications, coal exports, transport, minerals development and the provision of port infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia has a solid base on which to build in the area of multilateral relations with Latin America. Our participation in recent years in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in the context of the Cairns Groups has forged closer ties with the five Latin American members of the Group (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay). </PARA>
<PARA>Australia chaired the Cairns Group Meeting of Ministers held in Chiang Mai, Thailand in November 1989, at which agreement was reached on a comprehensive proposal for the global reform and liberalisation of agricultural trade. Australia subsequently played a central role in presenting this proposal, on behalf of the Cairns Group, to the GATT Negotiating Group on Agriculture in Geneva. These efforts to secure more equitable conditions for world agricultural trade, combined with Australian-Latin American co-operation on Antarctic matters and Australia's evident environmental concerns, especially in relation to Brazil, have strengthened Latin American-Australian ties significantly. </PARA>
<PARA>Some Latin American nations are looking to Australia with increased interest because of their wish to integrate more with the other Pacific Basin economies. A number of countries are already participating (or wish to participate) in regional economic organisations, for example, the Pacific Economic Co-operation Conference (PECC) and the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC). </PARA>
<PARA>The benefits that could follow from greater cooperation with the countries of Latin America in combating drug trafficking is another area that needs to be more fully explored. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that considerable scope exists for establishing closer ties between Australia and Latin America for the substantial mutual benefit of both continents. The Committee aims to contribute to this process. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats commend the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. The Committee's work is a most important part of the work of the Senate, and that work is not often recognised and acknowledged as it should be. </PARA>
<PARA>However, there is a real concern that, very often, undertakings given to the Committee have not been honoured by the Minister who has given them. This is a matter of particular concern where those undertakings relate to the rectification of deficient or poorly drafted items of delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Ministers make promises based on the advice of public servants and those promises are made in good faith. However, in some cases the advisers have no intention of delivering on the undertakings they have persuaded their Minister to give, and in other cases, other more pressing matters interfere and the undertakings are forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA>In situations like these, the Senate is powerless. Even the most conscientious of Ministers-considering their workload-is tempted to treat the matter as water under the bridge. </PARA>
<PARA>My colleague, former Democrat Senator Norm Sanders, introduced a similar Bill in 1989 and the problem is no less important now than it was then. In essence, the Bill provides that when an undertaking is given but not honoured subsequently, the delegated legislation in question comes before the Senate again, as if for the first time. This means that the Senate again has the power of disallowance that it had the first time. This renewed sanction should concentrate the minds of those who advise Ministers to give such undertakings.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that all Senators will welcome this Bill, which gives the Senate the power to ensure that promises made are promises kept. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1990 seeks to ensure that a corporation is not able to avoid the merger and acquisition provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 by making acquisitions through associated or related companies. The background is that section 50 of the principal Act prohibits the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of any shares in any capital or assets of the corporation where either the acquisition would result in the corporation being in or being likely to be in a position to dominate a market for goods or services or the acquiring corporation is already in a position of market dominance and the acquisition would substantially strengthen the power of that corporation to dominate the market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principal amendments proposed by this Bill were announced by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in a media release in 1990. The amendments relate to the acquisition of interests in entities that may lead to a breach of the principal Act but, due to technicalities, fall outside the current scope of the principal Act. The issue was raised in a court judgment in the Trade Practices Commission v. Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd and Others. In a sense, the judgment stated that an acquiring corporation would fall under the provisions of the Act but only where the subsidiary, acting for the acquiring corporation, acts as an agent for the acquiring corporation. It has become necessary to ensure that this loophole is closed and that where the subsidiary or associated corporation does not act as an agent it is still caught by the provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposition was queried in the lower House. The Australian Democrats do not see any difficulty about confirming that this loophole is closed and will therefore support the Bill. However, we do intend to look at other provisions of the Trade Practices Act and wish to take this opportunity to rectify what we consider to be some deficiencies in the legislation as it currently stands.</PARA>
<PARA> The competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act prohibit various forms of conduct. The relevant provisions are section 46, dealing with misuse of market power, and section 50, dealing with mergers. The test for the former is whether the corporation has a substantial degree of market power and is prohibited from engaging in certain conduct, eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor, preventing entry to the market and preventing or deterring a person from engaging in competitive conduct in the market. Section 50 prohibits acquisitions which result in the acquirer being in a position to dominate a market. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be useful to advert briefly to the historical context of these provisions. Between 1974 and 1977, the Trade Practices Act prohibited acquisitions which resulted in a substantial lessening of competition in the market for goods and services. In 1976, the Swanson committee report recommended a narrowing of the test because it interfered unnecessarily with mergers of no real significance in the context of competition policy and also imposed administrative burdens on the Trade Practices Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event, the 1977 amendments to the Act significantly narrowed the merger provision by inserting a test which prohibited acquisitions which result in or substantially strengthen, as I have said before, a position of control or dominance in a substantial market. The merger authorisation test was changed so that the Trade Practices Commission was not to authorise a merger unless it was satisfied that the proposed acquisition would result, or would be likely to result, in such a benefit to the public that it should be allowed to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> Some further major amendments were made to the Act in 1986, after the release of the 1984 Green Paper. The Green Paper included a proposal for a return to the substantial lessening of competition tests, in conjunction with the existing limitation that the affected market constituted a substantial market. It is this position that the Democrats prefer to the current dominance test. It will be the burden of our amendments to return to that position. </PARA>
<PARA> The context in which the present controls operate is, of course, the Government's emphasis on the need for Australian industry to become more efficient and internationally competitive. The only test that seems to be applied is that of size and long production runs. However, it is clear that, with advancing technology, long runs are not the only measure of efficiency; that we can, indeed, produce efficiency by shorter runs; and that we can sharpen up our competitive stance in international markets by greater competition. I believe that the history of Australian industry in the last few years shows quite clearly that we have had aggregation in size that has not sharpened our competition and that has in fact allowed people to occupy a position of monopoly in their particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, we need to look at the media. We now have a situation where one corporate entity can control in excess of 60 per cent of that industry. It should, of course, be noted that an additional criterion enters the considerations of the Trade Practices legislation: the public interest. That a critical industry, such as the media, should be allowed to be aggregated to that extent is surely against the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that, taking into account all of these factors, the time has come to take another look at the provisions that govern the acquisition and mergers in Australian industry. While this will be dealt with in greater detail during the Committee stage of the Bill, I would like to foreshadow at this stage that we will seek to reintroduce the criterion of substantially lessening competition for mergers and other acquisitions; that we will, at the same time, introduce a requirement for the Commission to be notified when such mergers or acquisitions are planned. We suggest that the criterion for notification should be where the target of an acquisition is $10m. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, we will seek to introduce an amendment to empower the Commission to investigate, in certain circumstances, the existing State situation of market dominance in certain cases and may, as a consequence, if it finds that such market dominance is not outweighed by the public benefit, apply to a court for divestiture to ensure that an element of competition is reintroduced in that particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the intentions of the Australian Democrats on the trade practices legislation. I hope that the Government, which has been so active in promoting deregulation in Australian industry generally, will support these measures which will ensure that the consumer does not pay the bill and that Australian industry becomes more competitive in international markets. Similarly, I believe that the time has come for the Opposition to have a close look at that. A former Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, has recently stated that we should return to the pre-1977 criterion. I believe that that should give Senator Panizza and others some food for thought. If the Opposition is serious in its position that we must have more competition in our industry, it should be pleased about tightening up the criteria and about introducing measures which will further competition in the Australian economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although the Opposition does not intend to oppose the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1990, we have several grave concerns that are philosophical in nature and practical in application. Basically, the intent of the Bill is to extend the application of section 50 of the Trade Practices Act, which deals with the prohibition of mergers and acquisitions found to result in market dominance. The amendments are intended to close a suspected or yet to be proven-although in one sense proven-loophole concerning the ability of a company to gain effective commercial control of another company through subsidiaries or unincorporated bodies, thus purporting to circumvent the existing provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Under this Bill, section 50 of the Trade Practices Act will take account of bodies corporate indirectly related or associated with a corporation when assessing whether a merger or acquisition results in market dominance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is substantial doubt as to whether this Bill is a condition precedent to effecting better trade practices law. This is borne out of the fact that there was concern that this loophole could be utilised by News Ltd in acquiring the assets of the Fairfax Group. News Ltd has denied any such intention. Even the outgoing Trade Practices Commissioner, Bob Baxt, has indicated that such a move would breach the Trade Practices provisions already in existence. So, in a way, the man of straw that was set out to be knocked down has been admitted by Professor Baxt to be just that-a man of straw. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of concern that this Bill demonstrates a push by the Trade Practices Commission for greater powers and tougher penalties under the Trade Practices Act, including greater powers to order the divestiture of asset holdings. A problem with such laws is the difficulties which arise in defusing anti-competitive commercial activities. It is ironic that in some areas where market dominance is clearly defined, the Commission is totally without power. I particularly refer to those regulatory government schemes where the lack of competition is enshrined by legislation or institutional arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> Take the area of telecommunications, where there is a most inconsistent application of trade practices law. The Commission claims that the tele- communications market will be treated in the same way as other markets but has been totally silent on the merger of Telecom Australia and OTC Ltd. This merger would have to rank as one of the largest corporate consolidations in this country's recent history. But, using the criteria of market dominance, the merged entity is indeed without peer. The debt ridden Aussat Pty Ltd is hardly a viable competitor under the current climate, and yet, despite this unambiguously clear market dominance by the megacom, not a word in opposition has been raised by the Trade Practices Commission, nor has there been any comment on Austel's plan to allow Telecom and OTC to price discriminate between themselves and a third carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> This is but one example of the inconsistency of the current approach. Indeed, there has been applause and encouragement from the Government on the amalgamation of unions and trade associations. The fact that this type of cartel goes unchallenged by the Commission and the deafening silence on statutory government monopolies raises serious questions as to whether the Trade Practices Commission is seriously a champion of consumer sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> It is curious that, even though private sector mergers and acquisitions provide much greater problems in defining market dominance, the Commission has no hesitation in raising doubts supposedly on behalf of the public interest. A problem in seeking to define dominance arises, for example, when a particular drawing of market boundaries is made irrespective of the inevitable expense of recognising markets for substitute goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> At the very root of this legislation lies the myth that market dominance is inherently evil. Studies of mergers and takeovers indicate that they generally tend to succeed where there are reduced costs of production and tangible benefits to consumers. To accept the foundation of this legislation would be to ignore the simple truth that many firms obtain and, indeed, hold a market share by virtue of being consistently more efficient and competitive than their rivals. </PARA>
<PARA> Behind this legislation lies the view that near enough is good enough. I have never resiled from my rejection of that second best option, and I would not let this opportunity pass without registering my concern in regard to this Bill. I have spoken on many occasions in this chamber on the need for freer trade. I find it slightly hypocritical that, at a time when the Government has finally accepted our calls for reduced protection, it is erecting a further barrier to free trade of goods and services through the trade practices legislation. On one view of it, the Bill does amount to greater industry protection. Indeed, it flies in the face of many of the hopes and aspirations expressed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in their much vaunted industry statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, at a time when the Government, following its industry statement, is supposedly winding back protection, it is important to note that the Government does not have the courage to admit that it is prepared to maintain, if not increase, protection in other forms. Perhaps it is not really courage that is at stake: perhaps it is intelligence to realise where the good cause of free trade is best served. </PARA>
<PARA> But my concerns about the Bill extend beyond my commitment to freer trade. I also question the accountability of some of the Commission's actions. Given that the Trade Practices Commission is the only body that can undertake proceedings for breaches of the Trade Practices Act, on matters such as market dominance that which is said by the Commission is then de facto law in that area. The onus is therefore put upon the Commission to act in a certain, disciplined and predictable way. When the law is not certain, it is put into disrepute. Merger and takeover policy requires consistent reasoning rather than an ad hoc, informal negotiation, as is now the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Added to this is the question of due process. The Commission has questioned the capacity of ordinary courts to deal with issues of anti-trust policy and has expressed its preference for them to be handled by the trade practices tribunals. But the fact remains that the result can be frequently arbitrary, retrospective and capricious when proceedings are initiated by the Commission. For this reason alone, I think we should proceed with caution before the Commission is endowed with further power. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the timing of the Bill itself is worthy of note. In this period of recession, there is a tendency, as firms close their doors as a result of this Government's policy failures, for market power to be concentrated in the remaining enterprises in any given industry. But legislation such as this closes the only pressure valve that the market possesses in times of economic downturn. Thus a firm that could be sold or merged simply will have to go to the wall because otherwise it would be in breach of the Trade Practices Act. Should such legislation be taken to its logical conclusion, it is clear that those firms which are in dire straits because of Government policy and facing that decision to close are condemned if they do and condemned if they do not, because competitors that remain in the field are allowed to become more dominant simply by the other firms going out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> Having outlined our concerns with the Bill and having said that we will not oppose its passage, there is one request that I put forward to the Trade Practices Commission-that in the interests of consistency the Commission be asked to address the market dominance of government trading entities and statutory authorities, to engender consistency and predictability in decisions on mergers and takeovers and to be aware of its duties to be finally accountable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no objection at all to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill and support all that Senator Bishop has had to say about it, but what has been proposed by the Australian Democrats causes me grave concern. The Democrats are proposing to move into an area in relation to section 50 of the Trade Practices Act about which I have grave concerns and about which I think honourable senators, if they were to apply their minds to what the Democrats are talking about, should also have grave concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The history of this matter is that for the period from 1974 to 1977 section 50 had a provision relating to mergers which in effect said that mergers, including takeovers and acquisitions of assets, are prohibited between corporations if they are likely substantially to lessen competition in a market for goods or services. That provision in section 50 was the subject of an inquiry by the Swanson Trade Practices Act Review Committee, which reported in August 1976. Following that report, in 1977 the Fraser Government introduced amendments to this provision, amendments which stand in place today. Those amendments refer to acquisitions as a result of which a party in effect obtains a position of dominance in the market. I suppose that to non-lawyers they are just some funny words about a merger which is likely substantially to lessen competition in a market and a merger which enables a company to obtain dominance in a market. </PARA>
<PARA> I stand on a fundamental principle of more competition in the market place. It is my belief that competition in the market place is an aim that we should all be pressing towards and an aim which will assist consumers. After all, they are the people that we are most concerned about-our consumers, the ordinary people of Australia. They want to be able to get good quality at the right price. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what the Trade Practices Act is all about. It seeks to ensure that there is an opportunity in the marketplace for such reasonable competition as will enable consumers to be sure that they are obtaining the best quality available at the best price so that they shall have some choice. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a degree of debate as to whether the 1977 amendment substantially weakened section 50 so that this competition was weakened. It seems to me to be a matter of grave concern for the Parliament of Australia as to whether there has been a weakening of competition in the marketplace. I know that Senator Schacht has referred in this place on a number of occasions to his concern about, for example, the alleged lack of competition in the media. Some people have the audacity to suggest that the Fraser Government's amendments of 1978 were designed to enable Mr Murdoch to acquire additional newspapers. I do not know whether there is any merit in that proposition, but I think that Senator Schacht would allege that. Therefore, he would be interested in what is happening here at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, to its detriment, has not addressed that problem in this amendment. It has brought forward this amendment to the Senate because of a problem in connection with a case concerning Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd. I should have thought the Government at that stage would have applied its mind to the whole of the provisions of section 50 as to whether the 1977 amendment had weakened the Trade Practices Act to such an extent that there should be further amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of the Government bringing this forward, the Australian Democrats are bringing it forward in their usual manner as some sort of amendment to be whipped into the Senate at the last moment for consideration. This is far too important a matter for that sort of consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked Senator Spindler on a number of occasions to let me have a copy of his proposed amendments; they are still not ready here tonight. He says that we will adjourn the debate after the Minister has spoken and he will bring in these amendments during the committee stage. I say to Senator Spindler here and now that, although I am gravely concerned about the existing provisions of section 50, I will not be able to give this matter five minutes consideration tomorrow morning when I read his amendments and say yes or no one way or the other. I hope that the Government and the Minister will address this problem and perhaps defer further consideration of this Bill for a period of some weeks while the Government considers the matter, or else refers it to a Senate committee to enable it to consider the matter. I believe that this is a matter of grave importance and one to which the Senate should apply its mind thoroughly and not casually. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have indicated their support for the Trade Practices Amendment Bill which has been presented to the chamber. The Bill attempts to fill a gap which might enable exploitation of some supposed weakness in the Act. I am sure that Australian competition law would be strengthened by the passage of this Bill. Honourable senators will know that the Bill is expressed to come into operation from 21 December 1990, the date of its introduction into the House of Representatives. We believe-and I take it that there has been support around the chamber-that will be an appropriate response to a matter of some technicality which was indicated to be a matter of concern arising out of the Trade Practices Commission on what is colloquially known as the New Zealand steel case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think there is no need to go over that ground. In fact, I agree with almost everything that has been said by my friend and colleague Senator Austin Lewis, that the attempt by the Australian Democrats to use this Bill as a vehicle for consideration by the Senate of the very essence of the law relating to mergers, takeovers, monopolies, dominance, lessening of competition and the whole way in which the marketplace in Australia might operate is inappropriate. Indeed, there should be some other mechanism open to the Democrats to enable both chambers of the Parliament in a more considered and deliberate fashion to discuss the issues which are of great importance and to which Senator Spindler adverted. </PARA>
<PARA> I note, for example, that as recently as only two years ago, in May 1989, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs tabled its report Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies: Profiting from Competition. As this was a report of the House of Representatives, I realise that the Democrats were unable to participate in that Committee. A range of members, both from the Government and Opposition parties in the House of Representatives, discussed all these matters and put together a considerable report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is probably not of the standard that we would anticipate from a Senate committee, but nevertheless it tackles some of these problems. It does so in a way which is appropriate, by taking evidence from a wide range of interested parties and considering it in an atmosphere that is different from that which obtains in the chamber, or even in the new committee type meetings that we hold on Fridays on suggested amendments to Bills before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would ask Senator Spindler, if he intends to press for the deferral of the committee stage tonight, that we take the time of such a deferral to work out whether some other mechanism might be more appropriate for consideration of these issues. There is no doubt that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), having had the benefit of this report and having been asked by that Committee within five years of the tabling of the report to undertake a comprehensive review of the whole area of mergers, monopolies and the tests that might be applied, is already undertaking such a discussion with his ministerial colleagues as to whether there is cause to re-examine the test, and, if so, how this re-examination should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is very aware that there is a lot of interest in this matter out in the general community, particularly in the business and legal communities. There would need to be extensive discussion and consultation before one could sensibly put forward any proposal, whether in support of the present position or seeking some modification of it. There is a lot more to possible modification than a simple reversion back to the lessening of competition test. There are many other threshold tests that might be applied, and we should take the time to hold discussions and consultations and to look comparatively at other mixed economies, to take Senator Bishop's point, where one has a range of corporations-statutory corporations, private sector corporations-acting in the marketplace. We could perhaps deal with Senator Bishop's matter of concern, namely, where one moves from a government owned enterprise with a monopoly position into a market situation of some competition being introduced by way of, for example, permitting a second carrier to operate in telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> These are very difficult questions. I do not think they can be dealt with in the committee stage of a Bill. I think that such is not an appropriate forum for such discussion if what is desired at the end is a very considered view. I believe that the Government would not be in a position either this week or next week, or possibly this session, to reach any view on the merit of any proposal which, for example, the Democrats might put forward by way of an amendment later this week, next week or during the course of the Autumn session. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it would take many months of deliberation and consultation. The Attorney-General is discussing with his ministerial colleagues how such an examination might be undertaken, and I do not think I can take it any further than that. However, I indicate to Senator Spindler that, should it be desired that there be a deferral of the committee stage, it should be to enable us to have some discussion as to a more appropriate and parliamentary means of deliberating upon these important issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening the Senate has before it the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1991 for scrutiny and debate. This Bill is essentially the old Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1990. It is, once again, an omnibus, difficult taxation Bill covering a vast range of matters, many of which bear no relationship to each other. In fact it is appropriate that I should draw the attention of the Senate to the extraordinary handling of the Bill in the House of Representatives. I mention this because the handling of the Bill in that place was in stark contrast to the way in which it has been handled in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the House of Representatives, not only was the Bill brought forward with notice given only on the morning of the debate but less than half an hour before the debate was to commence a series of extensive amendments was introduced. The Opposition drew attention to these amendments and welcomed them but nevertheless the lack of notice was inexcusable. However, in addition, the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill, though technically available, was not distributed to members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> So I ask the logical question in this chamber: what has this Government to fear from the House of Representatives spokesmen on taxation matters, either Mr Reith or Mr Rocher, to the extent that neither was given the courtesy of adequate time to even read the amendments or certainly have the opportunity to read the explanatory memorandum? Was it a question of the Government being afraid that they would point out problems in these amendments or was it just another example of the Government in that place preventing any meaningful debate?</PARA>
<PARA> With that sort of approach and attitude, it puts an additional responsibility on the Senate to get things right. I am encouraged by the support I have received from the Government in trying to ensure that we get the best legislation that is technically possible, even though we might disagree with some of the philosophical background to some of the particular matters. However, the Opposition notes that there are a number of problems with these Bills, such as the imputation provisions relating to life insurance companies, the treatment of partnerships, roll-overs into company group funds-all of which we will discuss later-and the need for different treatment in accident disability matters, because one accrues to profits and the other to shareholders, so the Government needs to distinguish for equitable treatment in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is appropriate that where we do receive assistance, we acknowledge and express gratitude to the Government and in particular the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) for the willingness to give us answers to a number of questions that I put in a form of notice. It was not the normal form of notice, except that the Opposition did provide the Government with 16 major areas of concern, and today we received extensive responses to most of them. I understand that Senator McMullan has agreed to incorporate these answers in Hansard and has organised with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to provide a disc that will incorporate both my question and the subsequent answer to ensure that the issues are dealt with seriatim. I should ask Senator McMullan at which stage he would like that incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I also applaud the introduction of the bereavement allowance in this omnibus Bill, the extension of the mining, quarrying and all prospective deductions to expenditure outside Australia and, in principle, to the reduction of the 21 per cent marginal tax rate to 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I signal our opposition to the intention of the Australian Democrats to move an amendment cutting out those deductions which would be available to Australian companies operating abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, I should point out what I perceive is a general overall problem in the drafting of the Bill. The Bill implements the wage tax trade-off announced by the Government on 20 November by amending the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 and reducing the lowest marginal tax rate from 21 per cent to 20 per cent. This is, naturally, a change that the Opposition applauds because the Opposition is strenuously in favour of reducing the impact of taxation and the income tax rates to very much lower levels. </PARA>
<PARA> However, together with these fundamental changes, which will affect every income earning citizen in Australia and will therefore need to be implemented quickly, we have, amongst others, complicated, intricate measures relating to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill, changes to capital gains legislation in relation to companies and partnerships and to changes to dividend imputation arrangements for life assurance companies. They are some of the more complicated matters. Naturally, such issues require extensive debate and consideration. Therefore, we submit that the taxation changes to the pay as you earn (PAYE) and provisional tax rates really should not be part of an omnibus, complicated tax Bill. We saw the complication last year when an election was called and there was a failure to pass Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Government, for the purpose of simplicity and to help itself and particularly the Taxation Office which was put in a difficult situation on previous occasions, to ensure the speedy passage of such legislation, which involves changes to income tax rates, by having those changes in a separate piece of legislation rather than in omnibus tax Bills which often require debate and amendments, and have many technical aspects associated with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I appeal to Senator McMullan that in future we have a separate Bill. When a complicated tax Bill does come before the Senate it is sometimes referred to a Senate standing committee and, consequently, the swift passage of this Bill-so relevant to all Australians who pay tax-is prevented. In fact, the Opposition indicated that if the Government was prepared before Christmas to separate these income tax changes we would have passed this section of the Bill. But, regrettably, the Government did not heed our encouragement on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditionally, we have had two Bills when tax rates have been changed, one imposing the tax and the other declaring the rate. This Bill contains a new tax and Medicare rate, reducing it from 21 to 20 per cent, resulting from a previous imposition due to the amendments proposed by the Government and supported by the Democrats. However, today, because of those past changes regarding the imposition of taxes, we do not have an imposition Bill. This Bill is the first since that change. I believe that the effect will be to give greater powers to the Senate to amend because rate change legislation, as opposed to imposition tax Bills, is now amendable by the Senate in the first form but not in relation to the second. As part of a question on notice that I submitted to the Government, I specifically asked the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>Since this is the first taxation bill . . . since last year's legislation placing certain income tax impositions under permanent legislation, has the Government raised an unintended consequence of providing an additional power to the Senate in making Taxation Laws Amendment No. 6 an amendable Bill by the Senate since there is no current supporting Bill?</PARA>
<PARA>I have been informed that:</PARA>
<PARA>Section 53 of the Constitution imposes limitations upon the powers of the Senate to amend legislation. Where the Senate may not amend a Bill it may request the House of Representatives to make the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The Senate's powers to amend a Bill are established by section 53 of the Constitution, and clearly can't be amended simply by implication in a Statute.</PARA>
<PARA>I heartily agree with that. But, with respect, I do not believe that Senator McMullan has fully answered my question, because there is still an unintended consequence in that there is now a new range of amendable Bills. The difficulty arises especially where the tax burden increases. However, in this case, no problem arises because the tax burden has actually been lessened from 21 per cent to 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> So, in addition, the Opposition was surprised at the tabling of Statutory Rules 1990 No. 398, the Income Tax Regulations (Amendment), which estimates the tax payable from January 1991 to reflect the decision of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 20 November 1990. It does seem strange that governments nowadays can issue regulations adjusting tax, including provisional tax for 1990-91, before the Bill is enacted. The Opposition really did not raise any major problems to that because we believed that the tax paying community had an entitlement to know the tax scales for deduction-and certainly for PAYE-purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> We note that the Crown law advice at the time was that the regulations adjusting the rate of tax instalments could be validly made before the Bill is enacted. I suppose we accept that, but it is an unfortunate practice and I hope it does not become too much of a precedent. So long as the regulations simply estimate the tax payable over the year and so long as the regulations are made for that purpose alone, then they are sufficient. But people do not always appreciate whether regulations are made for that purpose or for other purposes. It remains quite a moot point, because the regulations do not actually impose the tax rate. But I still hold to my point that there is no supporting legislation imposing these rates. </PARA>
<PARA> What this Bill is doing is opening the taxation Bill to the Senate and allowing the Senate a greater opportunity to amend. In this area of taxation rates the rates should be definite and not just estimates. I thank the Government for the answers to my question on notice in this area. When Senator McMullan tables the answers to the question I am sure that this chamber will understand the point I am making. I give him the courtesy of tabling his answers, but he has given me the opportunity of looking at them in advance. </PARA>
<PARA> A further area of concern is the answer that has been given that there is no particular time limit in terms of the law of how far the regulations in question can precede statute law. I believe that is a legitimate concern and one that should be raised by every responsible Opposition. Another concern is that the present situation of provisional taxpayers still being assessed on the old 1991 rates really should not occur. Again, I have raised this matter previously in the Senate, stating that provisional taxpayers will be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in response to my questioning on this matter, stated that the financial impact on taxpayers will be minimal. The term `minimal' of course is relative. What may be minimal in terms of total revenue to the ATO may not be minimal to provisional taxpayers in these difficult economic times. Consequently, in clarifying the statement as to what was minimal in relation to my question to Senator Button on 6 December 1990, we have now received further advice from the Government that on an income of $25,000 the extra payment for provisional taxpayers as a result of being assessed on the old 1990-91 rates will be $96.10. I leave it to the discretion of individual people to decide whether $96.10 is a minimal payment, in difficult economic times, on $25,000. I think it is a matter of some concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I now make some general comments relating to the legislation. The Bill contains the amended imputation arrangements for life assurance companies, as announced in the 1991 Budget. The Life Assurance Federation of Australia (LIFA), following the announcement by the Federal Treasurer in August 1990 of the proposed changes to the arrangements, entered a submission pointing out to the Government a number of problems with the Budget announcements. I am pleased to acknowledge that the Government has acceded to the request by LIFA to provide for the apportionment of franking credits on receipt dividends, as well as tax paid on the statutory funds. In other words, under the amending legislation currently before the Parliament, franked dividends received by the statutory funds of non-mutual life companies will be able to be used to generate franking credits or franking dividends as paid to shareholders. As a result of this change, the 80 : 20 formula now should be much more acceptable to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, with the legislation and new rules regarding the cancellation of franking credits which have been built up by mutual life offices there is, according to a number of tax experts with whom I have spoken, the possibility of some constitutional difficulty and the ATO and the Government have been made aware of it. In fact, one tax expert went so far as to say that it really invalidated section 55 of the Constitution. We tested this with the Government. The answer that we have received from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is that the franking surplus does not constitute property. Because it does not constitute property, the requirement relating to the acquisition of property on just terms under section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution was, therefore, not applicable. But this question of what is property would really be the arguable point. I do not think that has really been satisfied. Furthermore, the Office of General Counsel does not consider that there is any authority for the view that the removal by the Commonwealth of this imputation credit really constitutes a tax and, therefore, is not affected by section 55 of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, the life insurance industry is disappointed that the Government has not accepted the force of LIFA's argument on a number of the other issues that it has raised, including the parity of treatment of mutuals and non-mutuals under transitional rules. I understand that the Government is concerned about the takeover of these non-mutuals in the use of the built-up franking credits-it is worried about the anti-avoidance provisions. Nevertheless, it is a cancellation of an entitlement-a built-up benefit-and I believe such action is always somewhat retrograde. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, I understand that the industry has accepted the Government's decision on a number of issues with the possible exception of the formula method relating to accident and disability business. I wish to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that while it would be appropriate to incorporate a factual basis of apportionment of franking credits into income tax law, the development of a basis acceptable to Government and industry would be somewhat complex and difficult to exercise. Therefore, it is outside the time frame of the current legislation and we have been assured that it will examine in future. I believe it would be a good idea if further consideration could be given to this in the future, particularly in the light of the experience of the 80 : 20 formula, and if people applied their minds to the issue a satisfactory resolution could be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> The formula for the determination of franking credits is not appropriate in relation to non-participating businesses-for example, accident and disability insurance-because there is no statutory restriction on the amount of profit or surplus arising from such business which can be distributed to shareholders. In fact, the Life Insurance Act allows for shareholders to receive 100 per cent of profits from non-participating businesses and, in practice, a proportion, if not all, of such surplus derived by companies is generally distributed to shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also relevant that accident and disability business transacted by life insurance companies is akin to general insurance in that it generally involves the underwriting of specific risks rather than the provision of savings investment facilities. Such business, in fact, is undertaken by both life and general insurance and is taxed on a similar basis to general insurance business, that is, the tax base is net premium-net of reinsurance and unexpired risk reserves less claims and expenses incurred plus net investment income. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, the industry believes that franking credits arising in respect of accident and disability business should be determined separately from other business. We have received an assurance from the Government that it intends to provide a mechanism to distinguish these. We look forward to the amendments at some future time because we believe that amendments are necessary to ensure that there is uniform treatment of accident and disability business, whether it is transacted by a life or general insurer and, thus, we have a concept consistent with a level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Opposition is generally satisfied about the Government's resolution of a number of problems. I realise that we have embarked on new ground by giving the Government advance notice and, consequently, this speech during the second reading debate may appear to be something of a hotchpotch in that we are not making a general attack as we would have otherwise. In view of the fact that the Government has acceded to so many of our requests immediately, and has also given us undertakings that other aspects are under active consideration, perhaps other matters are subject to longer term review. Perhaps section 160ZZO comes within that. Those aspects have been addressed by virtue of the very late amendment that appeared in the House of Representatives that I referred to earlier, and also by amendments which the Government has yet to move in this House of which we have received some notice. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now go on to another aspect. I must also acknowledge certain changes to division 19A. That did reflect very sloppy drafting. We notice that there are certain changes to pick up the problems in new section 61. At this point I believe that the Government has certainly partly clarified the problem, particularly with relation to third party indebtedness or third party loans which were a problem in the original drafting. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to draw attention to aspects of the Bill which I refer to as somewhat cumbersome and complex and which produce unintended consequences. I indicated in one of my 16 questions the need to adopt a practice that is now widely accepted in New Zealand where the tax section of the Treasury, the tax office and the Parliamentary Counsel, who are all instrumental in framing the tax laws, come together and form a consultative committee. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have an unsatisfactory situation where a concept is devised in the tax office of the Treasury, passed on to the Tax Office which then puts on its own provisions and interpretations and the parliamentary draftsman then seeks to protect his position. I believe that perhaps we get over-technical wording in terms of the presentation of Bills because of the separate box-like approach-a protection that people feel they have to build into the pending legislation to ensure that nothing slips through. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to draw the Senate's attention to a matter which was raised by Mr Turnbull, the First Parliamentary Counsel, before Senate Estimates Committee. He referred to a lack of communication that occurred between these three elements as being a problem in the drafting of legislation. Therefore, I believe that we could be well served by adopting the New Zealand example, as Professor Arnold has suggested, by implementing a consultative committee when framing taxation legislation. I believe that our taxation laws and our amendments to those laws would be better served if the Government framed its laws in this manner through the use of a consultative committee. Of course, this Bill already illustrates the need for such a committee. I think the commercial world was aghast at the original changes to section 160ZZO. A number of submissions from prominent businessmen and commercial institutions within Australia were forwarded to the Government at the time of the original drafting. I believe that this is the third or fourth attempt that we have before the Senate to try to overcome these particular problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Government for giving consideration to the number of problems that I raised in those 16 questions and other discussions that I have had with it. I must say that I have received some criticism about this particular approach-that we are giving the Government notice, and forewarning and forearming it about the issues that we intend to raise in this debate. However, I would like to point out to the Senate that on this side of politics, particularly when I am in charge of Bills, I intend to try to get the best possible legislation to remove as much complexity as we can, and to improve the understanding of our taxation laws in a manner which is acceptable to the Taxation Office, the practitioners who have to advise on them and the taxpayers who have to obey them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1990 which was formerly the Taxation Laws Amendment (No. 6) Bill 1990. The contents of this omnibus Bill were competently detailed by Senator Watson, the previous speaker. It is, as I said, an omnibus Bill dealing with a number of areas of taxation law including the personal tax cuts which commenced on 1 January 1991 and a reduction in the medical expenses rebate from the existing lowest marginal tax rate of 21 per cent to the new rate of 20 per cent. The Australian Democrats are not happy about this particular change. We opposed the reduction to 21 per cent when it was before the Senate last year, and we believe that the further reduction to 20 per cent does not take account of the needs of people who are on low incomes and who incur substantial medical expenses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill further includes a simplification of the capital gains tax consequences of company group restructurings and contains a further strengthening of anti-avoidance provisions dealing with such restructurings, and these provisions are welcome. Further, there is the cancellation of imputation credits which would otherwise arise for mutual life insurance companies and 80 per cent of those applicable for the statutory fund of non-mutual life insurance companies to ensure that unintended advantages do not arise for prospective new owners of these institutions. Once again, the Democrats are supportive of these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Bill contains an exemption from income tax for certain bereavement payments made under social security and veterans affairs legislation, and we welcome those. There is also provision against the double dipping of bad debt deductions by financial institutions and the protection of taxation information held by the Commissioner of Taxation. However, the second last point is one that the Australian Democrats are concerned about because we believe that in this particular area the Government has left a loophole which should be closed. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of double dipping on bad debts incurred by foreign branches of banks was in fact identified by a House of Representatives committee as long ago as 1987. In our opinion, the proposed provisions-which, incidentally, pick up an alternative Budget proposal of the Australian Democrats-can be easily circumvented and may also be technically flawed. The legislation appears to allow institutions with non-performing loans-just another euphemism for bad debts-held through branches in comparable tax countries to transfer those loans to branches in low tax countries and subsequently write off the loan as a bad debt, thereby obtaining partial tax relief in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The only way that such a practice could be stopped appears to be through the use of the general anti-avoidance provision in part IVa of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This appears doubtful as the proposed provisions assume that such transfers are legitimate. We believe the onus with regard to this matter needs to be shifted to the taxpayer to prove that when such transactions are being carried out they are bona fide and do not require the use of part IVa of the taxation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that the Australian Democrats are extremely concerned about is the fact that concessions are being made available in many areas to companies which engage in commercial activities offshore. Concessions are available to domestic mining operations, industrial property and income-producing buildings, and it is proposed that these concessions be extended where these activities occur outside Australia. This was announced in last year's Budget and conforms with Treasury's policy of capital export neutrality. What this really means is that Australian businesses are in fact encouraged to shift their operations overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Democrats' view that Australian companies should be encouraged to carry out their commercial operations in Australia rather than shift them overseas, thereby occasioning a considerable loss of commercial activity and employment in Australia. Since many countries provide incentives to encourage foreign investment, these foreign countries will often be preferable for Australian firms over Australian opportunities. We believe we should not be adding to these incentives. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that Senator Panizza would love to have more companies go offshore. He clearly seems to favour that. If he does not, he will obviously vote for the amendment that I propose to move in this particular area. I argue in fact that the tax system should favour Australian economic activity over foreign activity by restricting concessions to local development in Australia which would assist our economy rather than the economies of countries overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed extension of depreciation to buildings is particularly deplorable. It can do nothing but encourage the development of Australian companies outside Australia-for instance, the building of a head office in Hong Kong. I am sure that Senator Panizza would welcome that. The proposal also extends to buildings used for research and development activities. But the question remains: why should Australia encourage the offshore development of such facilities? The Australian Democrats will certainly oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will take this opportunity to move several other amendments which we believe should have been considered by the Government in this Bill, as it is an omnibus Bill. One of them is to remove tax deductibility for that part of salaries which exceed $200,000 per annum. In recent years we have seen a veritable explosion of executive salaries in Australian industry and, in particular, in those companies which have accumulated paper profits but have not contributed to the productive efforts of Australian companies and the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is also useful in this context to look at what has happened to the income and tax scales in Australia to see how they have worked out in recent years. I quote from a recent article entitled `Wealth by stealth' a rich irony for the lower paid' by Richard Farmer:</PARA>
<PARA>The truth is that a trade union-based party, which has skilfully sold the virtues of wage restraint to the masses, has delivered amazing wealth to the minority. From 1982-83, the year before Labor came to office, to 1988-89, the last year for which the Taxation Commissioner's figures are available, after-tax incomes of the top fifth of taxpayers have increased by about 57 per cent. Down in the bottom fifth, they have gone up by just 14.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In another portion of the article he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The bottom 80 per cent of taxpayers benefited from wage rises and tax changes to see their after-tax incomes rise from 14.1 per cent for the bottom fifth, 33.2 per cent for the second fifth and around 38 per cent for the third and fourth fifth. At best they kept up with the changes in the cost of living. Yet top-bracket tax rates were cut and together with imputation, they provided the top 5 per cent of taxpayers with an 88.8 per cent increase in after-tax income. </PARA>
<PARA>These figures show clearly that the Government should pay some attention to shifting our income tax scales towards a more progressive scale but at the same time-and this is what this present amendment is directed to-it should ensure that it is not the community or the taxpayer that funds the explosion in executive salaries. It is clear that salaries above $200,000 per annum do not deserve community support and subsidisation through the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment which the Democrats wish to move on this occasion concerns the removal of tax deductibility for advertising of alcohol and tobacco products. In terms of revenue, it would gain $32m for tobacco and $40m for alcohol. We believe that the Australian taxpayer should not subsidise, by allowing a tax deductibility, the immense costs that are being incurred by the Australian community-some $14.3 billion every year-through the detrimental effects on health which are a burden on our health system, and absenteeism and sickness at work which cause considerable losses to our industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak very briefly. While it is a valued role of parliamentary privilege to bring to light examples of injustice suffered by ordinary Australians at the hands of larger institutions, it is equally important that this right is not abused. We have a duty not to malign people on the public record on the basis of totally misleading and inaccurate information. This is exactly what happened in the adjournment debate in the House of Representatives on 6 March when the honourable member for Kennedy, Mr Hulls, launched a savage attack on Lumley General Insurance for being `charlatans' and for `kicking its clients when they were down'. These are serious and destructive allegations about a fine insurance company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to the honourable member for Kennedy, the barge Tasma overturned in January when conveying essential supplies to isolated Gulf communities cut off from road communication by flooding. I emphasise the words `essential supplies' because the honourable member used those words a number of times during his speech to the House of Representatives. He told the House of Representatives that because the goods were insured for road transport only, Lumleys had denied liability without a formal claim having been submitted. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a strong inference, not to say an allegation, that Lumleys has refused to assist a client in an emergency when the goods in question were essential supplies. The honourable member for Kennedy had talked about shortages of milk, fresh produce, sugar, flour and toilet paper. The salient fact conveniently ignored by the member-anxious to impress his constituents and to bash the insurance industry-was that the goods in question were alcohol supplies for the Normanton Hotel. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Colston" NAMEID="PF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator Colston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is essential!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps in the view of Senator Colston and some others, alcohol is a necessity of life, but this does not alter the fact that the Parliament was misled. The question could well be asked why the crew of the barge was put at risk for the delivery of such a cargo. The emotive charge of a heartless insurance company refusing to assist clients and contributing to the hardship suffered by Gulf residents is baseless and dishonest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second aspect of the attack on Lumleys was its alleged rejection of its client's claim. Again, it is a fact that the client in question has not so much as asked Lumleys for a claim form. When a company has not heard from its own client, it is premature, to say the least, for instant judgments to be made as to the propriety of its actions. Lumleys would never refuse to send a claim form when so requested. I do not believe there is any insurance company in this country that would refuse to send a claim form when so requested. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Kennedy did not see fit to treat the truth with respect. It is an absolute untruth therefore to assert, as the member for Kennedy did, that Lumleys `has even refused to issue my constituent with a claim form'. The insurance policy in question specifically restricts the transport of liquor to road transport because of problems experienced with sea transport. It was accepted that the marine cover would cost more. </PARA>
<PARA> I have risen to put straight this record, not merely because I despise the use of misleading statements, but because I am concerned at the possible damage to a reputable company chosen as an arbitrary target by a member of the Hawke Labor Government. With singular vindictiveness, the member for Kennedy stated that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) should institute an effective witchhunt against Lumleys, an investigation as to `its fitness to be involved in the insurance industry'. This is not, therefore, just a matter of an unfair, mistaken accusation. It is a deliberate use of parliamentary privilege to damage a commercial reputation. Indeed, the Minister should look at the matter to learn of the disgraceful conduct of the honourable member for Kennedy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is truly no excuse that the honourable member for Kennedy is unaware of the truth of the matter. This was conveyed to him by facsimile on 11 March by the managing director of Lumleys, Mr Sprangers. Yet as at the end of last week, Mr Hulls has chosen not to respond to this communication. It was open to him to have the matter clarified over the three sitting days following 11 March. He saw that he did not need to do so. Perhaps the honourable member for Kennedy is so nervous about the next election that he resorts to such unfactual statements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to tonight's adjournment debate will hopefully be brief. It will be on a subject that is dear to my heart and indeed dear to the hearts of all honourable senators, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), who is so encouraging to me. I thank him for that. My topic is Ireland and I want to break it up into four particular themes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Three years ago-in 1988-Australia celebrated its bicentenary. This year we celebrate or remember another 200-year-old event in the development of this nation. It is 200 years ago this year that the first convict ship left the shores of Ireland to bring those unfortunate migrants to this country. A large number of other people arrived since that date until deportation was stopped in the 1850s or so. Some 40,000 people came directly from Ireland as convicts and 16,000 others came from other parts of the world. A lot has been written about those convicts and the injustices that they have suffered, both in their conviction and in their transportation. Unfortunately, their lives in Australia were very short. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to recognise that particular anniversary and move on to another theme of injustice. I refer, of course, to the release from prison in England some three to four weeks ago of a group of people who are worthy, I believe, to be named in this place-Richard McIlkenny, Patrick Hill, Hugh Callaghan, Gerard Hunter, William Power and John Walker. Those people are collectively known now and have been known for a number of years as the Birmingham Six. They have something in common with another group of people from Britain, the Guildford Four, who were released from prison in 1989 after serving 14 years in prison for crimes they did not commit. Previous to that, a group of people known as the Maguire Seven were gaoled in 1976 for allegedly running bomb factories but were subsequently released as well. The convictions against those people were supposedly for unlawful crimes. In each instance it has been found by the British system of justice that the evidence on which they were convicted was indeed forged. That was the case with the Birmingham Six. After 16 and a half years of incarceration in the system, the prosecution in the final appeal was not able to offer evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very grateful for the final release of those people. I look forward to the payment of compensation to them, their families and their friends in the vicinity. The incarceration not only hurt the individuals but also hurt their family members and relatives throughout the world. Compensation in monetary terms will not be enough. I do not know personally what will be enough. I do look forward to the results of the royal commission which has been set up to inquire into the system of British justice. Hopefully in future years we will find that travesties of justice, such as I have indicated here tonight-I have only instanced three and there are indeed many more- will never be allowed to happen again. </PARA>
<PARA> At a future time in the Senate I will be pursuing the fact that the Australian system of justice is very loosely based on the British system of justice. I wonder and certainly hope that travesties of justice such as I have indicated earlier have not occurred in Australia and indeed will not be allowed to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to send out a very salutary message particularly to my electorate in Western Australia, although I know that this has happened in other parts of Australia. In my electorate of Western Australia there has recently been a demand for the reintroduction of the death penalty or capital punishment. There is no death penalty or capital punishment in existence in England at the moment and there has not been for years. Had there been a capital punishment system in Britain 16 1/2 years ago, six people proven innocent by the system of justice might actually be dead. There is no way that we can compensate people for lawfully taking a life. I argue against capital punishment. I certainly will do everything in my power to resist its reintroduction. I ask those who advocate the reintroduction of it into Australia to think of the lessons of these people. The Birmingham Six were convicted of murder under the British laws of justice on evidence which has now been proven to be forged. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there is yet another Australian link between Britain and Ireland. I have it from the Sun Herald newspaper of 17 March this year, which incidentally was St Patrick's day, that the former detective superintendent who led the prosecutions on these particular individuals, George Reade, is currently resident in Australia. I hope that Australia is not being used as a clearing house for people of the calibre of George Reade. </PARA>
<PARA> My next theme is another historic link that has recently developed between Ireland and Australia. Yesterday afternoon in the Irish Embassy, the Irish Minister for Social Welfare, Dr Michael Woods, TD, and the Australian Minister for Social Security, Senator Graham Richardson, signed a bilateral agreement on social security between Ireland and Australia. The main purpose of the agreement will be to protect the rights of persons who have worked in Ireland and lived in Australia. It does this by allowing social security contributions paid in Ireland and periods of residence in Australia to be counted towards benefits in either or both countries. It is an agreement that will have benefit bilaterally for people from one nation to another. I hope that many people will live long and successful lives in retirement and will enjoy those reciprocal agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a pleasure to meet Dr Woods whilst he was in Australia. I was fortunate enough to be able to attend a number of functions with him, as indeed were some members of the Senate. He is a very pleasant individual with a wonderful singing voice that some of us were able to enjoy on a number of occasions. He has the honour of being maybe not the first politician to sing in the Sydney Opera House, although he certainly gave that a try at an impromptu concert last Sunday. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I want to express an immediate thank you to a Mrs Nancy O'Donnell who is the president of the Irish Week Association in Sydney or indeed Australia. Nancy was instrumental in dragging me down to Sydney on 15 March this year, allegedly, as it now turns out, to present the trophy to the Irish Australian of the Year. After four trophies for different purposes were presented, I realised that something was wrong because nobody had given me a brief or told me who the recipient of the fifth and main one was going to be until I was called up to receive that trophy. </PARA>
<PARA> I must admit publicly that, on this occasion, despite my profession as a politician, I was left somewhat speechless. I am glad that we did not have Hansard in the Parliament House in New South Wales at this bipartisan function organised by the President of the Legislative Council and the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Fahey. I was speechless on that night. When I did manage to utter some words, they were not the best set of words I have ever put together, so I am grateful that Hansard was not present on that night. </PARA>
<PARA> I am deeply honoured to receive this award. Whilst the award was presented in Sydney, the nominations came from Irish clubs and associations across Australia. This is the first occasion on which a Western Australian has been honoured to receive the trophy, which proves that the New South Wales Irish community is not narrow-minded and secular and that it looks further than its own State. I have since found out that my nomination for the award came from an organisation in Canberra. During the coming year in which I will hold the honour, I trust that I will be able to serve well the Irish community within this country and that I can work towards the settlement of its members and their assimilation into the community. I will be doing all things possible within my power as a member of this Parliament to ensure that the number of Irish people-it is rumoured that more than one-third of the Australian population are either Irish or of direct Irish descent, which makes us a not insignificant force-as a proportion of the Australian population is maintained or perhaps grows. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly thank Nancy, the person who nominated me. I wish that she had given me some warning so that I might have been better able to construct my speech. As I say, Hansard was not present on the evening. After all, it is a night for honesty. </PARA>

<PARA> Naval personnel are not madly keen on marching. Their attitude, in much the same way as the Royal Australian Air Force, with which I have some acquaintance, is that if they wanted to march they would have joined the Army.

Further, this would be an opportunity for that unique band of Australians-those veterans who have served this country in World War I, World War II, the Malayan Emergency, the Korean War, Konfrontasi and the Vietnam War-to be welcomed back as having served their country in a war, to be recognised as colleagues and to pay a tribute to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditionally, Anzac Day has been devoid of political posturing and the inclusion of these Gulf veterans in the position of honour in Anzac Day parades would be an appropriate means of recognition of them. I do hope that the opportunities which are presented on the return of these veterans do not lead to political posturing. I am a little concerned that there may be some of that. I remind the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that these people are the troops of the Governor-General, not the troops of the Prime Minister, and that if there is any formal welcoming and salutation to take place it should be done by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, I envisage that communities around Australia that are having Anzac Day marches ask their returning Gulf personnel to lead the parades. Of course, we are fortunate that we suffered no casualties in the 43-day Gulf war. However, our service personnel were exposed to all of the hazards, dangers and stresses of the war and their kin were subject to all of the associated anxieties which, I might say, could only have been exacerbated by the extensive television coverage of the war. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia owes a particular debt of gratitude to the Royal Australian Navy and the other services that supported our ships in the Gulf during Operation Desert Shield and the war. I put to the Senate: what better way to acknowledge their contribution to the coalition forces than by inviting our Gulf war veterans to lead the 1991 Anzac Day parades?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last time I spoke on the adjournment in relation to a matter that concerned an Aboriginal was, as I recall, very early in my term in this chamber. That matter related to an occasion when I had been leaving my electorate office and saw three policemen using what I regarded as excessive force to put a young Aboriginal into a paddy wagon. The complaint I raised was that my complaint to the police complaints authority had not been dealt with as promptly as it should have been. It is perhaps appropriate to say that that matter has now been dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that a change was achieved, albeit a small change. The change that I am told is to be achieved-I have not checked that it has been achieved-is simply that a change will be made to the training manual for police officers in the use of their batons. Apparently, we need to tell police officers that they do not smash people in the kidneys with a baton. I do not know whether that says anything about the brightness of the people who are employed or the manuals as they were written. I am told that the training manuals are to be changed. I am also told that the police orders, or daily orders-whatever they are properly referred to-will be changed to make it abundantly clear that whenever a baton is used an incident report will have to be made. I believe that there is a possibility that more than that could have been achieved by complaining, but at least that was achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight, I want to raise a separate matter in relation to the training of Aboriginals in Australia. Again, this incident was gained from first-hand experience. This area is not one that I spend a lot of time looking at in terms of Federal funding. This is a personal experience. On Saturday, I had occasion to be driving from Ulanda, a town on the west coast of South Australia, to Adelaide, which necessarily meant that I had to go through Port Augusta. I stopped to have lunch at a chicken shop in Port Augusta. While waiting for the lunch to be prepared, I felt the presence of someone behind me whom I assumed wanted to look at the counter that I was standing in front of. I moved aside and said, `I am sorry, do you want to look at this counter?'. I found myself looking straight into the eyes of someone who must have been pretty close to being a full blood Aboriginal. He seemed a happy enough bloke and there was a mutual exchange to the effect that he did not really want to look at the counter anyway. Nonetheless, I had some passing and light-hearted conversation with this fellow, as did my husband. </PARA>
<PARA> We moved to the back of the shop to get some drinks out of the fridge and three young men came in, one of whom chose to make not that offensive a remark but a passing derogatory remark about the Aboriginal person's dog, which was sitting outside. We may not have expected it to, but the remark occasioned some concern. The Aboriginal took that as something of an insult and marched outside saying, `Well, I will wait for you outside'. He obviously thought better of this after a few minutes and came back inside, and a further exchange of words took place between these three gentlemen and the Aboriginal.</PARA>
<PARA> I should have said that at no time did I feel any apprehension as a consequence of his presence; nor did I see any apprehension in the Aboriginal's eyes. He might have had a few drinks-I do not deny that-but from my perspective he was not causing anyone any trouble or any harm. It is also fair to say that the young man who had made a derogatory remark about this tough-nut looking dog outside the chicken shop realised that he had made a mistake and tried to make some complimentary or appeasing remarks about the dog to ease the situation but, as I have said, the Aboriginal left saying, `I will meet you outside', and then came back into the shop. At that point the two gentlemen who thus far had not spoken launched into some further remarks, not about the dog but about the Aboriginal himself. </PARA>
<PARA> It is probably not appropriate to repeat those remarks in here, but they were not complimentary. A portion of them at least should be left out. I do not think it is necessary, wise or does any credit to us for young teenagers to be saying to people who appear to be full bloods, `It is just a b . . . shame that the whole damn lot of you were not shot when we first got here'. That sort of thing in what one would otherwise regard as a civilised country strikes me as being indicative that our race relations are not all that they should be. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to emphasise that this fellow was not causing any trouble. This is an example of where someone came into a chicken shop and was making a few light-hearted remarks. Sure, he had a few under his belt, but at that point he had not been causing any trouble. A fair round of abuse came from the two gentlemen who prior to that stage had not spoken. Again, the gentlemen who had first made some semi-insulting remarks about the Aboriginal's dog tried to calm the situation down, but not to much effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The woman who owned the chicken shop, or appeared to be managing it at the time, basically pointed at the Aboriginal and said, `You, out', and he left in compliance with that instruction. She made a remark that she had had trouble with him before and that he did not like her. She had to say, `If you don't go, I will call the police', and as he was going she called the police in any event. She indicated that she had had trouble with him in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no judgment with respect to her because she was looking after premises that may or may not have been owned by her. She indicated that she had had some trouble in the past, and perhaps from her perspective and the historical knowledge that she had she could see trouble brewing and thought the best thing to do was to call the police. But I do not say the same with respect to the three gentlemen at all. I do not know from their perspective what trouble they may have had with the Aboriginal community or with this particular Aboriginal in the past, but there was certainly no indication that they had had any trouble in the past and there was certainly no indication that they were going to have any trouble that day but for the remarks they chose to make. </PARA>
<PARA> The story does not end there. It gets slightly better. When the police arrived, it appeared that they did what I would have thought was the right thing: namely, they had a chat with the fellow and reintroduced him to one of his mates on the other side of the road, and he left quite happily. I assume that nothing was done to him as a consequence of that, but it was a bit galling to see these three teenagers smiling quite happily at the policeman, waving and saying, `See you later. Thanks very much for coming to bring some calm into the situation'. But for the involvement of these teenagers, the situation would have remained calm in any event. </PARA>
<PARA> If it were I calling the police, I would have been calling them for the disturbance created by these three young men. While I normally take the view that one is entitled to use whatever language one likes, either in private or even perhaps in public if one is not offending others, if there are any bones to be pointed, there were certainly some bones in terms of breaches of the peace that could have been pointed at these three young men. But they appear not to have been. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, I do not go through Port Augusta that often. I do not have that much experience with Aboriginals at all. But, from an outsider's point of view, this was a pretty disgusting thing to witness. If I were a tourist in Port Augusta, I could be forgiven for wondering just exactly where I was. One certainly would not think one was in the sort of country that we say we are. I think those teenagers did no credit either to Port Augusta or, for that matter, to the race relations that we want to see practised in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The topic I wish to address tonight is that of arms sales, the international arms trade which is going on apace in the wake of the Gulf war. I am particularly pleased that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is here this evening. He probably will not listen to a great deal of what I have to say, but some of it may percolate through. I know that the Minister is concerned about this issue of arms transfers internationally, and of course has spoken, with some effectiveness I believe, in the United Nations on this subject. I look forward to the recommendations that come out of the United Nations expert committee on that subject, which I believe will be forthcoming in a few weeks or months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very important that we see all of this business of arms trading and arms transfers in light of the huge arms bazaar which is planned for Canberra in November this year-the Australian International Defence Equipment Exhibition 91. Since I spoke about this issue in the Senate a couple of weeks ago, Newsweek has published an article called `Arms for Sale'. It makes very depressing reading indeed. A few of the lines from it are enough to indicate that there is a big bonanza on, and of course Australia, hosting this huge arms bazaar in November, indicates that Australia as a nation supports this push and that we will try to cash in on it wherever possible. I think that is totally reprehensible. To quote one buoyant lobbyist who was speaking to the writers of this article for Newsweek:</PARA>
<PARA>The next big push in the defense industry will be to exploit the Middle East. This is not arms control. This is an arms opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>The countries of the Middle East are still recovering from the war, which I think is far from over, of course, as we can see-particularly with what is happening to the Kurdistan people in northern Iraq-but their governments are already thinking about how to prepare for the next one. This is one of the terrible legacies of any war, that it creates the seeds for the next war. We have seen it happen so many times in the past, and as a society we do not seem to be able to learn the lessons of history, that war creates more violence and does sow the seeds of political instability for the future. That is exactly what we are seeing in the wake of this Gulf war, claimed by the United States and its cash box coalition as a great victory. It is no victory in any sense at all if one is opposed to war as a method of conflict resolution, and I think that any civilised people ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA> We really have to understand, too, that yesterday's enemies become today's friends, as we have seen so clearly demonstrated in this tragic situation in the Gulf. We should remember the adage that there is no such thing as a permanent ally, only permanent interests, and this is as true today as it ever was. A couple of examples from the recent conflict would include Jordan and Syria, while not so long ago Iraq was a good guy and a suitable market for weapons until Saddam Hussein blotted his copybook by invading Kuwait. When he invaded Iran in 1980, Britain and the United States actually blocked a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Iraq's aggression against Iran. How is that for hypocrisy?</PARA>
<PARA> As for Iran, the West sold vast quantities of expensive and very sophisticated arms to the regime when the Shah was in charge but, after the revolution, Iran became a bad guy, and the United States then had to arm Iraq against Iran until the next change. This is how it goes on-the seesaw in geostrategic interests-largely, I would say, dependent on the arms sales opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen since the Gulf war is a $30 billion tally of arms sales. Some countries, paid by the United States to go in such as Syria and Egypt and other countries such as Israel are paid to stay out, and all being rewarded with massive arms sales in the follow-up to that war. </PARA>
<PARA> Even before the recent collapse of Soviet power, Pentagon and arms industry officials were hard at work searching for new enemies and devising new worst-case scenarios to justify preserving and extending the global reach of the United States military apparatus. Not surprisingly, all the new candidates to replace the Soviet Union in the role of public enemy No. 1 now reside in the Third World. An ensemble cast of terrorists, madmen, and drug traffickers has been pushed to the forefront as the rightful objects of public ire and the military resources formerly devoted to thwarting the Soviet threat. The elegant simplicity of focusing on one great super power enemy is being replaced by an emphasis on fighting a rotating coalition of Third World regimes and guerilla movements that are viewed as a threat to continued United States political and economic dominance of critical regions. </PARA>
<PARA> This has dangerously backfired on the United States in areas other than the Middle East. It was not so long ago that General Noriega of Panama was the bad guy of the year, having formerly been a recipient of CIA largess when he was a good guy. Before that it was Colonel Gaddafi of Libya. I was interested to see in the papers recently how the United States decided to resume aid to Kenya because the Kenyan Government has offered a refuge to a group of Libyans, formerly based in Chad where they were training to overthrow Colonel Gaddafi's regime. However, the government in Chad which had originally hosted them had been overthrown and replaced by a pro-Libyan government, so the unfortunate exiles had to go somewhere else-very expedient but having to fit in with United States' geostrategic plans. There is no evidence that the Government of Kenya has improved its human rights record, but President Moi had to be paid off somehow for hosting the unfortunate Libyan exiles, and hard luck on the Kenyan dissidents who continue to languish in detention, mere pawns in the international power play. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the United States that makes these mistakes with arms sales, of course. The Soviet Union's attitude is equally cynical, except that it does not get so heavily embroiled in Third World adventurism these days, I suppose largely because it cannot afford to with the Soviet empire collapsing or in danger of collapse. Even so, President Gorbachev was somewhat embarrassed over all the arms his Government had supplied to Iraq and he tried to make amends by passing on the details to the Americans, although this infuriated more conservative elements in the Red Army who had enjoyed Baghdad's hospitality since 1958. Britain, too, got a dose of the same treatment in the Falklands war when Argentina was using equipment supplied by British companies. Often the arms sold backfire literally to the selling countries. </PARA>
<PARA> French arms companies have suffered heavily as a result of the embargo on sales to Iraq as they had replaced the Russians as lead suppliers to Iraq by the late 1980s. As for the Brazilian arms export industry, it has virtually collapsed since the embargo on Iraq last August. Another Third World country which must be embarrassed is Egypt, which was also selling its wares to Iraq until the invasion last August. </PARA>
<PARA> In a multipolar world marked by shifting alliances and continuing instability within many Third World nations, the possibility that arms transfers will come back to haunt Western policy makers is likely to increase, particularly for the United States as the major supplier. This blind spot to the way in which lax United States arms transfer controls often end up expanding the arsenals of potential United States adversaries is even more dangerous in the realm of advanced military technologies such as fighter aircraft, ballistic missiles and nuclear and chemical weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> By promoting co-production and licence production arrangements that result because of the transfer of arms-making capacities to Third World states such as Egypt, South Korea, Taiwan and Pakistan, and by signing off plans to loosen restrictions on exports of high technology items that are critical to ballistic missile and nuclear weapons production, the Bush Administration is pursuing a path that can only make it easier for the so-called madmen like Colonel Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein to acquire advanced weaponry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bush Administration's record on controlling sales of dual use technologies with applications in the development of nuclear weapons and long range ballistic missiles is only marginally better than its non-existent policy on export of arms making technology. A United States Government document released recently-on 11 March-showed that between 1985 and August 1991 the United States approved the export to Iraq of $1.96 billion worth of dual use items with military as well as civilian application, including powerful computers, precision machine tools and advanced electronics. An edited list of 771 export licences was released by the Commerce Department of the United States, according to this document, although it did not list the companies selling the items. </PARA>
<PARA> As Michael Maloof, Director of Technology Security Operations at the Pentagon's Department for Trade Security Policy, observed, the United States military in the Arabian Desert were facing their own technology sold to the Iraqis over the years by the Commerce Department. Germany has had the same trouble tracking what it sold to Iraq. The same excuse of commercial secrecy has been used here in Australia when I have tried to find out what military exports Australia has made in the last financial year. This shield of commercial secrecy has been used to block the information. This leads me to suggest possible measures that can be introduced at the international level to control arms transfers. </PARA>
<PARA> If the countries in the Gulf coalition had worked together during the Iran-Iraq war to forge an embargo on military supplies to both combatants, the current confrontation might never have come about and would certainly have posed far less danger of escalation. That is why I am so disappointed that the United States has started a new round of arms transfers in the Middle East, openly pushed by Defense Secretary Cheney and Secretary of State Baker. The United States and the Soviet Union still control close to two-thirds of the world's arms market, and their cooperation and leadership are essential to the inauguration of any workable system of multilateral arms transfer controls. </PARA>
<PARA> Former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze stressed the need to curb the international arms trade in his September 1990 address to the United Nations General Assembly and in an earlier letter to the United Nations Secretary-General. The Soviets have agreed in principle to abide by the guidelines of the United States inspired missile technology control regime. Furthermore, unlike the United States, the Soviet Union already has an active program of converting military plants to civilian use, which should diminish institutional pressures to continue massive weapons exports. On the other hand, arms exports have become a critical source of hard currency for the battered Soviet economy. Like their US counterparts, moreover, many Soviet strategists see arms transfers and training as the easiest way to exert influence in the developing world. </PARA>
<PARA> Another danger is that both the United States and the Soviet Union might prefer to sell off equipment they have to get rid of as a result of conventional arms limitation agreements in Europe. The United States is already considering the sale of tanks to Egypt that would otherwise be destroyed. The Soviet Union is likely to fall to similar temptations with regard to all the hardware it must dispose of, as it has found it very difficult to date to convert its tanks and very expensive and time consuming to destroy them. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with the leadership of the United States and the Soviet Union, the support of the arms-supplying nations of Europe will be essential to any progress on the arms sales issue. European suppliers, with their smaller domestic procurement budgets, have always had a greater economic need to export in order to maintain an affordable modern armaments production base-the same argument used by this Government as well as the Opposition. Political motivations, such as France's efforts to curry favour with oil states like Iraq via military technology transfers, will have to be confronted as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The final piece of the multilateral arms control puzzle and perhaps the hardest to put in place is the participation of the emerging arms suppliers. Many countries, such as China, Israel, Brazil and South Korea, among others, see arms exports as a critical adjunct to high-tech industrialisation as well as a means of increasing their independence from more powerful countries. The political half of the equation can be addressed only through regional arms control agreements and assurances that the major industrial powers will pursue disarmament and forswear unilateral intervention in Third World conflicts in exchange for a slowdown in Third World arms production and sales. </PARA>
<PARA> These good faith efforts will undoubtedly have to be accompanied by political and economic pressure on regional powers such as China, whose role in arming the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, assisting Pakistan in its development of ballistic missiles and supplying both sides in the Iran-Iraq war indicates how much even a secondary arms supplier can damage the prospects for curbing the international trade in weaponry and, in turn, damage prospects for peace. </PARA>
<PARA> Daunting as the political challenges may be, the key to encouraging Third World powers to join in a multilateral arms transfer restraint arrangement may be economic. As long as arms deals are viewed as the road to access to high technology, moral appeals to curtail armaments programs in the developing world are likely to fall on deaf ears. As part of a revived dialogue on North-South trade, the United States and other industrial nations, including Australia, should offer concrete assistance to Third World countries for developing non-military industries and exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States and the Soviet Union should take a lead in developing a multilateral approach to implementing arms transfer controls. Once the former leaders of the two Cold War blocs have reached a consensus on basic principles, they should invite European and Third World suppliers to participate in multilateral negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> Ideally, a United States-Soviet approach would build on existing mechanisms such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the missile technology control regime, both of which need to be strengthened in coverage and enforcement and expanded in membership. As an example, as far as the Middle East is concerned, there is no way the world can get the Arab states to agree to such proposals until Israel signs the nonproliferation treaty, opens its nuclear facilities to inspection, and ends production and research on its ballistic missiles. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a United States-Soviet proposal should include several key provisions to guide multilateral arms transfer control discussions; a ban on exports to areas of active conflict; limits on the sale of arms production technology; a tightening of restrictions on sales of dual use technologies with applications to nuclear weapons and ballistic missile development; and regional limits on offensive conventional weapons such as heavy tanks and deep strike aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some discussion about strengthening COCOM, otherwise known as the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, which was created at the height of the Cold War and which caused some controversy in Australia in the early 1980s. According to a press report on 26 February, the United States is lobbying support for more stringent COCOM controls to prevent countries like Iraq and Libya from acquiring the means to build mass destruction weapons. But several European nations say there are already bodies whose charter is to attend to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and arms controls, and they do not want to see the activities of COCOM extended. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Michael Klare wrote an article for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist in January this year in which he outlined seven ways to curb arms transfers. To summarise the seven measures: firstly, reconvene the conventional arms transfer talks; secondly, expand and enhance the missile technology control regime; thirdly, establish controls on other advanced military systems; fourthly, convene an international conference on nuclear and chemical disarmament in the Middle East; fifthly, impose economic and trade sanctions against nations developing nuclear weapons; sixthly, reduce or restrict international aid to nations developing domestic arms industries; and, seventhly, establish an international clearing house for intelligence on clandestine arms technology transfers. The full details are on pages 24 to 26 of the journal, which is obtainable from the Parliamentary Library, through its Media Information, Current Awareness and Hansard section. </PARA>
<PARA> The point, then, is not for the United States and the Soviet Union to impose a solution on the rest of the world but to develop a common framework and negotiating position to facilitate multilateral discussions. These are ambitious proposals for curbing the international arms trade and they assume a high level of leadership on the part of the United States and the Soviet Union, which have been the world's most prolific and diversified arms trading nations throughout the Cold War era. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, for the United States to play a constructive leadership role in limiting arms exports, there will need to be a domestic political consensus in favour of ending the United States role as a global policeman or global rent-a-cop, which has better characterised the nature of United States participation in the Gulf crisis-as I said, the cash box coalition-and it could be argued that the United States forces and the so-called alliance were the mercenaries doing the work that the Germans and Japanese were unable to do because of their constitutional limitations but which they have paid others to do on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> If the United States is to wean itself from its arms sales addiction, a new and truly defensive military strategy must replace the concepts of containment, forward development and the propensity for meddling in low intensity conflicts across the globe. The art of diplomacy and negotiation must be restored to its rightful place at the centre of United States foreign policy, with military action contemplated only as a last resort, which was hardly the case in the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> In tandem with the new, more realistic defence strategy must come a new economic strategy that targets technological resources for growth industries without relying on military rationales to justify economically necessary investments. </PARA>
<PARA> These arguments apply to Australia. We can work at a regional level to limit arms transfers. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should take precedence over the Department of Defence when it comes to regional security and conflict resolution. I guess I am not telling the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) anything new there, but I wish it were so that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did take precedence over the Department of Defence-with the emphasis on peace making and peace keeping at a non-military level rather than on acquiring expensive and irrelevant high-tech military hardware that this country neither needs nor can afford. We need to promote economic conversion instead of trying to develop military technology and military exports, particularly when sales are directed at such an unstable part of the world as south and east Asia-a new growth area. </PARA>
<PARA> As Greg Sheridan's article in the Weekend Australian of 9 March headed `Disarming figures in our losing battle to export defence' pointed out, attempts to promote military exports have been a failure to date. `Thank goodness!' is all I can say about that. But maybe I will not be able to say that following the arms bazaar called AIDEX 91 in November in Canberra this year, which I believe should be the first item on the agenda of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) for withdrawing Government support. There will be continued pressure on him to do that. If we are to act effectively to ensure that the new world order includes strict controls on the activities of the merchants of death, we have to get our own house in order first. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I am in a position to make any substantive reply to Senator Knowles's speech. I am sure the honourable member for Kennedy, Mr Hulls, will not feel so inhibited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The speech made by Senator McKiernan was one that demonstrated amply his worthiness to be the recipient of the title of Irish Australian of the Year. On behalf of the Government and the Senate, I would formally like to congratulate him on that high honour. From the discursive nature of his comments tonight, it would seem he was putting in a bid for that trophy being a perpetual one in the future. But we do acknowledge the work that Senator McKiernan has done on behalf of the Irish community and in drawing attention to Irish issues over the years. We do think the award is one that is entirely justified. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government shares very strongly-even though Senator Kemp did not appear to-the views that Senator McKiernan expressed about capital punishment in the context of the Birmingham Six, making it perfectly clear, as that case does, just what an appalling risk societies take if they do keep capital punishment on the books in situations where manifest injustice and miscarriages of the legal process can occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis made the point about Anzac Day marches and Gulf war veterans being invited to lead those marches. I think that would constitute an appropriate recognition of the very substantial and credible role these Navy people played. I am sure that is a suggestion that will go to the appropriate quarters and be treated with the appropriate enthusiasm. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to learn that Senator Vanstone has been doing something constructive in South Australia and Port Augusta on behalf of Aboriginal people. The points she made were noted by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, from Senator Vallentine we had another tour de raison of advice for the Governor-General and me in particular about the conduct of various aspects of foreign defence policy. I must say that a number of the things in particular she said about the anxiety that does exist about a re-creation of the arms race in the Middle East in the immediate aftermath of the very unhappy demonstration of just what can follow from unrestricted arms sales are points that should strike a responsive chord around the world. They are points that Australia has been making in our own discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that there be an emphasis not just on the weapons of mass destruction but on conventional weapons control and, in particular, we are working-as she acknowledged-through the United Nations expert group to try to put into place international provisions for arms registers and things of that kind which will ensure some degree of transparency, and hopefully a reduction as a result in international arms sales. I have to say, however, that the most central line in her speech is one that one does have difficulty in accepting, that is, the absolutism of her attitude towards arms sales of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter, as we have said constantly-and I will not go on at length on this occasion-is that it is legitimate for countries to build up a defensive capability, a military capability, to secure their self-protection. Very few countries are likely to be in a position to do that from their own resources. They are going to have to buy arms as a result, and if it is legitimate for countries to buy arms in those circumstances it is manifestly legitimate for other countries to sell them. Some degree of international arms trade will always be entirely legitimate, and it is in that context that we should view things like the Australian International Defence Export Exhibition. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's arms control policy, or policy in relation to defence exports, is not one of unlimited open slather. It is a policy that is built around existing guidelines which are being reviewed at the moment to ensure their continued sensitivity to some of the concerns which we all share in this place. With those reasonably brief remarks, Mr President, I think it is about time that we adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) In view of the disturbing video footage showing repression of the people of Tibet by the Chinese on the ABC report of Wednesday 1 August 1990, has the Government applied any sanctions against China for its treatment of the people of Tibet.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Government has not applied sanctions against China in respect of human rights abuses specifically in Tibet. As called for in the Senate Resolution on Tibet, adopted on 6 December 1990, the Government will continue to make representations to, and seek responses from, the Chinese Government on the human rights situation in Tibet.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The question of possible sanctions against China on the basis of its human rights record in Tibet has not been considered in any United Nations (UN) forum. There are a range of steps within the UN system short of sanctions which may be, and are, applied in relation to human rights violations. These include such moves as raising the issue in the UN Commission on Human Rights and establishing special investigative mechanisms. Resolutions on human rights violations are frequently employed within the Commission on Human Rights and the UN General Assembly. Australia supported an attempt by a number of Western countries to bring a resolution on human rights in China before the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva early in 1990. However, the move was unsuccessful due to adoption by CHR of a no action motion.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The material available to the Government on Tibet includes that sourced from official Chinese publications, Tibetan exile and overseas Tibet support groups, Amnesty International and other non-government organisations. This material is supplemented by personal observations of individual travellers in Tibet.</PARA>
<PARA>It appears that the health and education services provided to the Tibetan people are now better than they have been for much of the time since the departure of the Dalai Lama in 1959 and especially during the period of the Cultural Revolution. At the same time, the Chinese authorities continue to stress the primacy of political stability and economic development in Tibet. This has led not only to large-scale deployment of troops and security forces in the Tibet Autonomous Region, but also to a significant and reportedly growing number of Han immigrants. While a number of temples and monasteries have been restored or are undergoing restoration, religious life in Tibet remains under close control. Moreover, international human rights organisations continue to report instances of alleged arbitrary arrests, detentions, torture and executions of Tibetans.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Government is not aware of any action by the United Nations or any peace-keeping force to provide advice or assistance to the people of Tibet.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I understand that the SGIC holds an interest amounting to 30% of the issued capital in First Radio Ltd, the licensee company of commercial radio service 5DN Adelaide. The SGIC also holds a prescribed interest in Austereo Ltd, which company wholly owns the licensee of commercial radio service 5SSA Adelaide. Consequently the SGIC has an interest exceeding 15% in two licences (5DN and 5SSA) with a substantial market in common.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. I have been advised that SGIC is not subject to the requirements of the Broadcasting Act 1942 because of its status as a Crown corporation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice, on 6 November 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) What is the rationale for discriminating against taxpayers such as investors and others who may not strictly come within the term `people in business' as defined in a recent income tax ruling, IT 2582, that appears to restrict a taxpayer's ability to deduct interest on funds borrowed to pay income tax to `people in business'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Given the significance of the ruling, does the Government intend to incorporate this ruling into legislation.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2127" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Taxation Ruling IT 2582 deals with the ``Deductibility of Interest Incurred on Moneys Borrowed to Pay Income Tax'' under subsection 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act (``the Act''). That provision contains two limbs, the first limb applies to persons who might be described as ordinary salary and wage earners or investors, the second limb deals with taxpayers carrying on a business. Although the two limbs of subsection 51(1) cover essentially the same ground there are situations in which the second limb may have a wider application. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal determined, in 1988 (Case V48), that taxpayers falling within the first limb of subsection 51(1) of the Act are not entitled to a deduction in respect of interest expenses incurred on money borrowed to pay their personal income tax liability. However, the Commissioner has accepted that other legal precedents apply so that taxpayers who carry on a business, such as companies, are entitled to a deduction in respect of interest on money borrowed to pay income tax. Taxation Ruling IT2582 simply reflects the application of this approach.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Since the Ruling represents the Commissioners's interpretation of the present law based on existing legal authority, it is not intended to incorporate the Ruling into the law by way of statutory amendment.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of the Canberra Times report which alleged there was an error in the computer program listed by Joint Scientific Committee (JSC).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Professor Bryant Richards, Chairman of the JSC, advised the Department of Primary Industries and Energy on 7 December 1990 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The so-called `bug' in the computer program would not have altered the Committee's conclusions and recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in section 3.2.3 of its report, the Committee was aware that in the initial simulations climate was weighted more heavily than the other environmental attributes (terrain and nutrient supply). The computer classification procedure groups areas of land having a similar array of environmental attributes. The actual number of groups (environmental domains) recognised is determined by the similarity or association criteria chosen by the user. This choice, while ecologically based, is essentially subjective and is determined by examining the output of successive computer runs using different association thresholds. The earlier runs did not discriminate sufficiently between areas of land known to differ in their nutrient supply rating. The classification finally chosen produced 127 environmental domains and captured the variation in nutrients supply known to exist.</PARA>
<PARA> It follows that the environmental domain analysis was not unduly skewed by climate factors, and hence can still be regarded as truly reflecting the environmental diversity of the study region. This is quite evident from examination of the tabular summary of key environmental attributes for each of the 127 environmental domains, given in Appendix 3.3 of the JSC report.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of Professor Richards advice I do not consider any further consideration of this matter is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No; I became aware of this question and the Canberra Times report following my return to duty from overseas on 19 December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No; I will not review the reserve boundaries for the South East Forests of New South Wales. As I outlined in my response to the second question, I am advised that the alleged error would not have altered the JSC's considerations and recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The figure of 11.5 per cent of resource removed was calculated by the Forestry Commission of NSW using the Commission's resource data. I do not have a breakdown of this figure into (a) newly reserved; and (b) total timber resource.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) and (7) The removal of 11.5 per cent of the region's resource refers to the wood resource that was available to industry for harvesting prior to the reservation decision and therefore includes timber remaining from both cutting cycles.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) and (9) Prior to the reservation decision the first cutting cycle was scheduled to be completed around 1994 and the second cutting cycle was scheduled to be completed around 2014. The long-term strategy currently being formulated for the South East Forests will take into account resource losses due to the reservation decision and improved resource utilisation arising from the Commonwealth Government's industry development studies. I expect that industry activity will be adjusted in light of the long-term strategy to ensure that the cutting cycles will remain substantially as they were before the reservation decision.</PARA>

The outstanding matters in relation to Upurl Upurlila are in the process of being resolved and acquittance will soon be finalised.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Oombulgurri, ATSIC grants identified in the audited financial statements do not match actual releases. The Regional Office has taken this matter up with the Community and Auditor and an early resolution is expected.</PARA>
<PARA>1989/90 Grants</PARA>
<PARA> In the Kununurra Region, audited financial statements are still outstanding for Kalumburu, Mandangala, Woolah, Muliarkar and Lamboo Gunian. Recruitment of additional resources are currently being undertaken to commence the acquittal process of these outstanding grants.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Derby/Broome Region, all 1989/90 annual audited financial statements have been examined and, where possible, grants have been acquitted.</PARA>
<PARA> Where grants cannot be acquitted at this stage, appropriate action has been undertaken as detailed below:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Queries highlighted in Annual Audited Financial Statements have been raised in correspondence to relevant communities; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Copies of correspondence where queries have been raised have also been sent to relevant Auditors.</PARA>
<PARA> Upon receipt of satisfactory responses, relevant grants can be acquitted.</PARA>
<PARA> In this Region, audit reports for 1989/90 have not yet been received from Pender and Mowanjum. The auditor and community Chairperson have been advised of this breach of funding conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>In the South Hedland Region, audit reports have been received in the Regional Office but have not yet been analysed.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) ATSIC is not aware of an official review expressing reservations or inadequacies with regard to cash payments by any of the Western Australian CDEP communities.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Qualified audit reports have been received for 17 (one third) of the 52 CDEP communities in Western Australia. The communities concerned are:</PARA>
<PARA> Djarindjin; Bardi; Lombadina; Junjuwa; Yungngora; Junjuwa (Muludja and Ngalingkadji); Wangkatjungka; Kadjina; Looma; Mulan; Beagle Bay; Punmu; Strelley; Burringurrah; Ngangganawili; and Upurl Upurlila.</PARA>
<PARA> The audits reveal a number of shortcomings common to these communities, primarily in the areas of bookkeeping, cash systems and management, records maintenance, and accounting systems and procedures. Problems of this nature are not uncommon in remote communities where experienced staff, qualified accountants and training facilities are all scarce resources.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has taken steps to rectify inadequacies in all the instances identified by the audit reports. Action undertaken includes implementation of financial management training programs for staff and councillors of several communities; the installation of new financial management, internal control and wages systems in a number of communities; and assistance given to communities in the appointment of bookkeeping or management staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) An evaluation of Grant Acquittals for all Programs is currently being conducted by the Office of Evaluation and Audit on a national basis. The Office will be involved in an evaluation of CDEP this calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) It was discovered that at Yungngora Community one of the staff members was falsifying names on CDEP wages payments. An amount of between $5,000 and $6,000 was allegedly re-directed to her personal account. The matter was referred to police authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> The projects officer at Upurl Upurlila, investigated in connection with payments for items of personal benefit, was charged by the Kalgoorlie Criminal Investigation Bureau, convicted and ordered to undertake 180 hours of community service and to pay restitution of approximately $600.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANS</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission acknowledges the importance of community development plans. Work has commenced on developing a program. Both the Commission and the Department of Employment, Education and Training are examining options for providing assistance to communities in the preparation of community development plans.</PARA>
<PARA> Under new administrative arrangements for CDEP, communities will have to provide a CDEP works program when making applications for CDEP grant funds. The works program will comprise a list of projects that the community sees as important to its social, cultural, recreational and economic development.</PARA>
<PARA> Communities are being encouraged to develop specific CDEP plans and/or community development plans. The CDEP works program would be an integral part of either of these plans.</PARA>
<PARA>ASSESSMENT CRITERIA</PARA>
<PARA> All CDEP grants are assessed by the Commission on the annual ``Grant Assessment Form'' which is completed by Regional Officers as part of the annual draft estimates documentation.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the annual grant assessment all CDEP projects are to be fully reviewed on a three year cycle commencing in 1991/92. It is envisaged that these reviews will be undertaken by officers from the Commission and the Departments of Employment, Education and Training and Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA>PRIORITY SETTING</PARA>
<PARA> Under new administrative arrangements, priorities for the allocation of CDEP Oncost and Support funds will be determined by Regional Managers in consultation with Regional Councils and CDEP communities and organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>INACCURATE PAYMENTS</PARA>
<PARA> It is acknowledged that some communities have not always submitted fortnightly variation schedules. However, while this can cause short term inaccuracies, community entitlements are adjusted when subsequent schedules are received.</PARA>
<PARA> While delays occur between the Commission and DSS this does not result in over or under payments by ATSIC, as any adjustments necessary (after DSS checking) are made in subsequent quarters.</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of sanctions under the standard grant offer have been corrected by additional mandatory special conditions for CDEP.</PARA>
<PARA>The administrative changes to the CDEP system to take effect from 1 April 1991 have been designed to simplify the calculation of communities' entitlements and should reduce the possibility of inaccuracies.</PARA>
<PARA>MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING</PARA>
<PARA>TRAINING</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of qualified Aboriginal people has been a problem for DAA/ATSIC and communities alike. Training initiatives have been taken by DAA/ATSIC and the Department of Employment, Education and Training to address this issue.</PARA>
<PARA> As a part of new administrative arrangements for CDEP, a Training Needs Schedule and a training program to meet these needs for each CDEP is required. Under the Department of Employment, Education and Training (Training for Aboriginals Program) funding is available for communities to engage a consultant, where appropriate, to prepare training needs analyses and/or training schedules for project participants.</PARA>
<PARA>ENTITLEMENTS, ALLOWANCES AND</PARA>
<PARA>AWARD PAYMENTS</PARA>
<PARA> Since the ANAO audits of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were conducted there has been a significant improvement in the take up rate of the Family Allowance Supplement by CDEP participants. The Department of Social Security is promoting this allowance through its Aboriginal Liaison Officers and Community Agents.</PARA>
<PARA> While ATSIC encourages the payment of wages at award rates, the setting of hours worked is left to the discretion of community councils and organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> Award coverage for CDEP communities is a complex issue as the nature of the work generally is only part-time. The Commission is currently in the process of contracting a consultant to undertake research into industrial relations issues associated with CDEPs including the question of award coverage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Under arrangements agreed at the inaugural meeting of the Ministerial Council, established by the Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation Treaty, two officers with the dual responsibilities of technical officer and security liaison officer are to be appointed to the Technical Directorate of the Joint Authority established under the Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation Treaty. The Technical Directorate is to be located in Darwin. Under the terms of the Treaty the Executive Directors of the Joint Authority are responsible for the selection and appointment of the Joint Authority's staff from amongst individuals nominated by both Indonesia and Australia. With respect to the two positions of Technical Officer, with security liaison functions, it has been agreed by the Ministerial Council that one will be nominated by Australia and the other by Indonesia. At this stage Indonesia has not made a nomination to the Executive Directors of the Joint Authority. I am therefore unable to say when the individual to be appointed by the Executive Directors following Indonesia's nomination will take up his or her place.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian Government has made a nomination for appointment as Technical Officer with security liaison functions and the Executive Directors have signed a contract for the Australian Technical Officer to commence work on 11 March 1991. However, under the arrangements currently agreed by the Ministerial Council security liaison functions will not be required until closer to the time at which exploitation commences, that is, between 6 to 12 months after entry into force of the Treaty. Accordingly, the Australian Technical Officer will not be performing these functions at this stage. The Australian Technical Officer with security liaison functions will be located in Darwin not Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Under the Treaty the Joint Authority is responsible for controlling movements into, within and out of Area A, the joint area, of the Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation of vessels, aircraft, structures, and other equipment employed in exploration for and exploitation of petroleum resources and for requesting action by appropriate Australian and Indonesian authorities for search and rescue operations and in the event of terrorist threat to the vessels and structures engaged in petroleum operations in Area A. Under the Treaty the two countries have the right to carry out surveillance in Area A of the Zone of Cooperation and are obliged to exchange information on surveillance and on likely threats or security incidents relating to petroleum exploitation in that Area. The Ministerial Council has agreed that the two countries will keep the Joint Authority appropriately informed of such matters. The Ministerial Council has therefore agreed that the two Technical Officers with security liaison functions will be responsible for liaising with the appropriate Australian and Indonesian authorities and will be the point of contact within the Joint Authority on all security matters and incidents for both the contract operators and national response organisations. These Officers will also be responsible for ensuring that contract operators establish appropriate and consistent procedures for responding initially to security incidents on structures engaged in petroleum operations in Area A.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The two Technical Officers with security liaison functions will only be responsible for security liaison in Area A of the Zone of Cooperation, the area in which there is joint control by the two countries of the exploration and exploitation of petroleum resources. They will not have any role with respect to Areas B or C which are under the exploration and exploitation regimes of Australia and Indonesia respectively. Neither will they have any role in respect of activities other than those relating to petroleum development. The monitoring of security matters will be handled as set out above in answer to question 3.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The following answer is provided to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) While the past 12 months have seen a period of rapid change in South Africa, with President de Klerk commiting his country to a democratic and non-racial future, we have not yet seen the complete dismantling of apartheid. At the London ``special session'' of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa (CFMSA), agreement was reached on a Commonwealth response to developments in South Africa. The communique, issued at the conclusion of that meeting, represents an important advance on previous CFMSA positions in that it maps out a plan for the phased lifting of sanctions. The communique states that the most important forms of pressure are trade, investment and financial sanctions which ``should not be modified until some further major step has been taken down the path of constitutional reform. This could take the form of the establishment of an interim government, the establishment of a constituent assembly or some other agreed constitution-making process marking the commencement of final negotiations, or any other form agreed by the multi-party conference.'' (para. 10 (b)).</PARA>
<PARA> For a number of products we could face increased competition from South African products in third markets as sanctions are lifted. In these circumstances, the Government's advice to Australian exporters will be to maintain and improve their competitiveness and to continue to work hard to develop new markets for their products. The Australian Government will continue to monitor South African Government trade and industry policies in areas of interest to us to ensure they are consistent with South Africa's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not appropriate for the Australian Government to ``guard against competition on the export market'' from any country provided the competition is fair and the trade is conducted on a non-discriminatory basis. Rather it is in our interests to develop fairer and more open international markets for primary products and minerals. This is an important objective of our efforts in the GATT Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is not possible to estimate with any precision the amount of export trade we could be competing with South Africa to sell. However, in general terms it is clear that a global lifting of sanctions will have an impact on Australia's share of international markets. With a devalued currency, low wages and a lean, self-sufficient economy, South Africa is well positioned to challenge in world markets for commodities produced by Australia, such as coal, wine and fruit. The small but active South African wool industry is not likely to have any impact on Australian trade; nor will wheat exports be affected as South Africa is at present an importer of wheat.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) ADFILS has been involved in a variety of initiatives in spouse employment. These initiatives have taken due cognisance that they must reflect the needs expressed by Defence spouses; that spouse employment issues and needs vary from locality to locality; that maximum use should be made of organisations, services and structures already existing in the community and that the realities of the Australian industrial and employment scene must be recognised. Spouse employment initiatives can be grouped into three areas as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Provision of employment information to spouses:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) During 1990, a range of Spouse Information Days has been conducted in each State at major Service locations, providing spouses with information on the present local employment situation, the services and programs offered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Commonwealth Employment Service, and the potential to revise or enhance employable skills through the variety of programs such as offered by the TAFE system.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) ADFILS has sponsored advertisements and advice in local service family newsheets and local newspapers on spouse employment needs, information/training days and courses which may be appropriate for Defence spouses. ADFILS also assists in providing information on the community, including employment matters, in welcoming packages for families arriving in their new locations.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) ADFILS assists in the provision of guest speakers on employment matters for a variety of spouses meetings.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) On its FIND 008 service, ADFILS maintains a register of 96 addresses of State registration bodies covering 20 professional/semi professional groups to assist spouses seeking registration as they move from State to State.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Assistance in Developing or Renewing Employment Skills.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) ADFILS in conjunction with the Department of Employment Education and Training (DEET) and the TAFE networks have assisted spouses to participate in the Skillshare Program, Return to the Workforce Courses; other courses run by various TAFEs, Outreach programs and some special courses conducted by DEET/CES tailored to meet local requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Emphasis is also placed on self-help. With ADFILS advice and assistance, spouses groups have been successful in receiving grants from State and other agencies to conduct spouse employment activities. As an example, a spouses group in Western Australia has recently received a grant of $18,900 under the National Agenda for Women Grants Program to conduct a series of spouse employment workshops.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) As well as the more formal approach, spouses are involved in the wide variety of family support activities conducted by Defence families. This involvement also provides spouses with the opportunity to improve their skills and confidence, thus enhancing their job-seeking skills. Key volunteers in family support activities often move into the paid workforce.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Liaison with Other Agencies on Defence Spouses Needs. See (3) below.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) ADFILS continues to monitor developments in family support in the UK and USA systems as well as those of the Canadian and NZ Defence Forces. The main spouse employment issues in all systems are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the need to improve the confidence and the skills of spouses who wish to enter or re-enter the work force; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the need to improve the availability of, and access to, employment of choice. Developments in family support programs overseas do not always translate readily to the Australian situation because of different needs, different social and cultural circumstances and differences in the size of the Defence population and hence the scope and availability of resources.</PARA>
<PARA> The steps being taken to assist Australian Defence spouses to develop self-confidence and to gain, improve or update job-seeking and employment skills reflect the emphasis given in overseas programs. Although the emphasis in all programs is still on the acquisition of personal skills, some overseas programs also use a spouse employment register-job agency approach. This has not been adopted in Australia, but spouses in a number of locations, with assistance from FLOs and ADFILS, have taken informal steps to register skills and to attempt to match these to advertised vacancies. Normally speaking, however, the comprehensive employment and developmental services offered by DEET and the CES in all localities already provide a sufficient service for Defence spouses. Spouse employment issues tend to be local rather than national in nature. Establishment and maintenance of a national job register by Defence is not appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> It is understood that, in some instances, the US program accords Defence spouses some priority of employment in the Defence organisation. Given the size and nature of the Australian Defence Department and the practicalities of the Australian industrial and employment scene, this approach is not regarded as practical.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) Close liaison has been established between ADFILS and DEET and the CES at the State/Regional and local levels. ADFILS staff are in regular contact with DEET officers. While levels and frequency of contact vary from area to area, cooperation is rated as excellent. ADFILS staff have briefed DEET/CES managers and staff on the employment needs of both Defence spouses and dependents. In particular, ADFILS staff have been invited to brief DEET Women's Contact Officers and counter staff on the special needs of Defence spouses. DEET staff are closely involved in the dissemination of information and in the provision, design and conduct of training and assistance for spouses mentioned at (1) above. DEET also provide advice and suggestions on spouse employment issues and have, in some locations, developed special packages or courses to meet Defence spouses needs. The ADFILS Queensland Coordinator has appeared on the DEET sponsored program ``Jobspot'' on Brisbane Channel 7 to discuss employment issues.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) The difficulty in assessing the effectiveness of the spouse employment program is selecting the assessment criteria. The employment needs of spouses are individual and diverse. Employment opportunities are dependent on national and local influences. Success in obtaining employment involves many intangibles. Given that the primary goal of the programs is for spouses to gain or develop job-seeking and employment skills, the best criteria for assessment is not numerical but the degree of the satisfaction of the participants with the scope and relevance of the various programs. Feedback to ADFILS and DEET staff across the range of activities indicates that participants are generally satisfied. Varying with the location and the need, there is a continuing and increasing demand for the range of programs presently provided. Information gathered as part of the Defence Family Census in March 1991 will also help to determine the extent of spouse employment needs and indicate areas where more detailed surveys should be conducted. This will aid in the design and provision of further appropriate programs to assist Defence spouses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In May 1990 I announced an internal Defence Review of the Australian Defence Force's force structure. The Review is examining the relative priorities for present and planned capabilities in light of the Government's endorsed strategic guidance. The impact of Government financial allocations and other pressures, including manpower and operating costs is being addressed, as is an examination of the balance between Regular and Reserve forces.

No decision has yet been made in relation to particular inducements additional to the conditions already applying. In evaluating the potential usefulness of any such financial inducements, the Government is aware that reliance on financial inducements alone to solve recruitment problems is inappropriate and can be counterproductive- rather, solutions other than financial inducements have the potential to lead to more effective results as they may remove the underlying causes of any dissatisfaction. In this regard, lifestyle influences-excitement, adventure, challenge-effective management, quality of training and quality of equipment may be more significant attraction and retention issues than remuneration. These factors need to be supported, of course, by an appropriate conditions package which addresses all aspects of Service life. The current examination of the conditions package will ensure the continuing relevance of the package, in relation to the interests of members as well as the attraction and retention needs of the ADF.</PARA>

This will leave HMAS Derwent as the only serving ship of the original Royal Navy Type 12 or River Class frigates built in Australia between 1959 and 1965. Two further ships of a significantly enhanced design, HMAS Swan and HMAS Torrens, commissioned in 1970 and 1971 respectively, continue to serve. The replacement of wasted hull shell plating on ships in refit (particularly a ship 25 years old) is a routine procedure which ensures the future serviceability of the ship. In the case of HMAS Derwent, a thorough survey of the hull structure was conducted using modern ultrasound techniques which enabled the shipyard staff to pinpoint exactly which plates should be replaced. This process was further expedited by experience gained during the intermediate docking of HMAS Stuart last year whereby areas of weakness in HMAS Stuart's hull plating enabled HMAS Derwent's survey to be more accurately specified.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Social Security pensioners are subject to income and assets tests. In order to apply these tests, Social Security asks clients about shares when they claim a pension and as part of its periodic Income Review Program.</PARA>
<PARA> An Investment Review Form was sent to pensioners likely to be affected by deeming on accounts and cash.</PARA>
<PARA> The form asks questions on the full range of financial investments including shares because I have been urging pensioners to reinvest money which they have in cash or in cheque accounts to earn extra income so that they can be better off. While most pensioners will prefer conventional accounts with banks and other financial institutions, some pensioners will have chosen to use other kinds of investments including shares.

<PARA> (1) No agenda has yet been circulated for the 1991 CHOGM.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Communique issued at the end of the 1989 CHOGM in Kuala Lumpur included a reference to the question of Cyprus and reiterated the need for a quick solution. Given the continuation of problems in Cyprus, there may be discussion of the Cyprus question at the Harare CHOGM.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australia will continue to support UN Security Council resolutions and the Commonwealth approach to a resolution of the problems in Cyprus. The Australian Government believes that negotiation and dialogue between the two communities are essential if a lasting solution is to be found for the Cyprus problem, and that that process of dialogue is most effectively conducted through the UN Secretary General.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) &amp;(5) The Australian Government is not aware of recent calls from the Cypriot and Greek Governments for economic and trade sanctions to be applied against Turkey. The imposition of economic and trade sanctions against Turkey would create great difficulties for the UN Secretary General's efforts to resolve the dispute through negotiations between the two communities, efforts which have the full and active support of Australia. Australia's position is consistent with the attempts of others including the US and the European Community to resolve the Cyprus issue. The recently announced EC initiative on Cyprus which is expected to involve greater EC Presidency contact with the interested parties is not intended to supplant or detract from the efforts of the UN Secretary General.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories promotes community interest and understanding of environmental issues, including in the arts community, by its support for World Environment Day (WED) held annually on 5 June. Each year the Department coordinates an information kit on a WED theme for distribution to schools, community and conservation groups throughout Australia, and encourages other organisations to undertake appropriate activities to highlight the issue.</PARA>
<PARA> This year community arts organisations, Contemporary Arts Spaces and Craft Councils have been approached to undertake exhibitions, and to promote the concept of `No Excuse Let's Reduce'. To encourage this involvement, the Department has offered assistance in the form of advice, limited funding and the promotion of exhibitions throughout Australia as part of WED's general promotional activities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department also administers a Greenhouse Information Grants Scheme to support community groups in undertaking projects which raise community awareness of greenhouse issues, promote action to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and contribute to the development of adaptation strategies. The guidelines of the Scheme allow for the promotion of these issues through education and the arts.</PARA>
<PARA> In late 1989 the Australia Council established the Community, Environment, Art and Design (CEAD) program to encourage communities to actively intervene to improve their environment by working in cooperation with artists, architects, designers, planners or landscape architects, in partnership with local and state government authorities and sympathetic developers. Since the inception of the CEAD, the urban design projects funded by the Council have shown a much stronger emphasis on addressing major national and global environmental issues.</PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, Tasmania, and the British Council, the Australia Council is currently sponsoring a tour of Australia by Ms Sue Clifford, lecturer in rural and natural resources planning and co-founder of the unique British environmental body `Common Ground'. This organisation assists in linking artists and environmentalists in a similar way to that of the Council's CEAD program.</PARA>
<PARA> The other Boards and Committees of the Australia Council fund projects as a result of applications which reflect artists' areas of special interest. Many of these include projects pertaining to environmental issues.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) At this stage it is not proposed to provide additional funding to establish a special Australian Artists Creative Fellowship for artists who focus particularly on environmental issues. The guidelines for the Scheme allow for the possibility of awarding Fellowships to such artists.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There was no significant cut in paid training days for the Army Reserve in January 1991 or indeed for any period in the current financial year. In 1990 Army Office advised the provisional allocation of Army Reserve Training Days for Financial Year 90/91 to be 1,040,000 days. This allocation was confirmed, unchanged, in July 1990. On current usage of training days it is expected that the full allocation will be utilised in this Financial Year.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As there was no reduction in paid training days no monetary savings resulted.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Members of the Sydney University Regiment were requested by their Commanding Officer to undergo voluntary unpaid training for part of their Annual Field Training in January 1991. I am happy to say that Sydney University Regiment has recently advised that all its members were paid for the full period of training. Sydney University Regiment had been allocated sufficient days to meet essential training. This allocation did not allow the Commanding Officer to conduct all the training he wished and therefore he chose to request members of his unit to forego pay. It is worth noting that the Commanding Officer of the University of New South Wales Regiment faced with a similar situation chose to cancel his Annual Field Training. Training Day allocation is based on unit strengths and the training obligation of its members. In most cases this amounts to between 35 and 40 days per member. This allocation is adjusted for units with greater commitments, for example, recruiting units. While allocations may not meet all units initial requests they are sufficient for essential training and, in the majority of cases, for additional training also to be conducted. Army policy is actively to discourage unpaid training, except when related to charitable or community support activities.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Army Reservists undergoing unpaid training have the same compensation protection as if the training were paid. In December 1990 instructions were issued to units advising the administrative action necessary to ensure this compensation protection.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Attendance Allowance is not paid to Army Reservists undergoing training. The allowance is paid to assist a member with travel expenses when required to attend a specified place of duty. In the case of unpaid training the attendance by the member is voluntary and therefore the allowance is not payable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Australia has been a member of the International Criminal Police Organization, commonly known as Interpol, since 1948. Interpol is an international organisation made up of 154 member countries. Its headquarters is at Lyon in France and each member country has an established link with Interpol Headquarters known as a National Central Bureau (NCB). There is some popular confusion about NCB's: it is frequently assumed that they are staffed by Interpol personnel allocated on posting to member countries. In fact the reverse is true: certain staff of the law enforcement agencies in member countries are assigned to work in the NCB. Each NCB is part of the member law enforcement agency. Responsibility for the control, operation and administration of an NCB rests with a member country: it is funded and staffed by the member country; its staff are subject to the internal rules of the member agency; and both the staff and the NCB as a whole are subject to the laws of the member country.</PARA>
<PARA> In Australia the NCB is administered by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and is located in the AFP Headquarters in Canberra. The NCB operates strictly within Australian law and the personnel who work in the NCB are AFP personnel. They are subject to the AFP disciplinary provisions including the overseeing of complaints by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Australian NCB is not an ``office'' of Interpol, and there are no plans to open one.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The role of Interpol is to facilitate the exchange of information between law enforcement agencies in the apprehension of criminals. The Australian NCB is part of this international network which provides the law enforcement agencies of member countries with an effective communications channel and an established avenue of obtaining assistance from other member countries to combat the international activities and movements of criminals. Through the Interpol network the Australian NCB also provides a community service by, for example, locating lost or missing people and conveying information about deaths to relatives of the deceased. The NCB also undertakes overseas character or criminal checks for Australian authorities where required by law and where the subject of the check has consented.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian NCB is the Regional Communications Centre for Interpol in the South Pacific. Australia offered its NCB to undertake this function at Interpol's 59th General Assembly last year and the Interpol delegates accepted this offer.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Interpol is an international network of 154 member countries, able to act as an information exchange between law enforcement agencies. The AFP, as a national law enforcement agency, does not have this capacity.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The functions of Interpol and the AFP are completely separate: Interpol is an international information exchange network and the AFP is the Commonwealth's primary law enforcement agency.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minehunter Inshore (MHI) is currently structurally seaworthy in sea states up to and including sea state 4. An assessment of the vessel's operational sea state limitations in the minehunting role cannot be provided at this time due to the poor performance of the minehunting sonar. Trials of potential alternate sonars are progressing.</PARA>
<PARA> To satisfy Navy requirements, when operationally complete, the MHI must be able to conduct minehunting operations at speeds up to 4 knots in sea states up to and including sea state 3 and transit in sea state 4.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a wide range of likely operating areas for the MHI and the sea states within those areas are subject to seasonal variations. The following tables provide information for four such areas over the calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA>[THE TABLES ARE OMITTED FROM THE DATABASE; SEE HARDCOPY PAGE 2149]</PARA>

<PARA> These figures only take account of the effect of the prevailing sea state conditions on MHI operations and transit periods.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Present Indonesian plans envisage the construction of 12 nuclear power reactors to become operational progressively after the year 2003.</PARA>
<PARA> Nuclear power is only planned for the island of Java. A first site has been identified on the Muria Peninsula on the central north coast of Java, though this is subject to further evaluation studies.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. In addition to the United States, Indonesia has approached groups in France, Canada and Japan concerning a consultancy arrangement covering a feasibility study and site investigations.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) West Kalimantan has been identified as having uranium deposits with potential for development. A decision on whether these deposits can economically be exploited has yet to be made.</PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of sales of Australian uranium to Indonesia at an appropriate time in the future has been discussed informally between officials.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No decision has been made regarding final disposal of nuclear waste from the projected reactor program. Current radioactive waste management practice, for sound environmental, technical and economic reasons, is for a lengthy period of storage of the wastes before final disposal. Developments in nuclear waste disposal methods between now and the time when spent fuel after the storage period would require disposal would clearly influence any final decision on nuclear waste disposal taken by the Indonesian authorities.</PARA>
