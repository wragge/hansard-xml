<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to his recent efforts to persuade leading banks and life offices to bear the major burden of providing up to $1 billion in risk capital for small and medium sized businesses. Will the Minister confirm that this proposal has been killed off because the Government agrees with the industry that there is no logic in handing over vast sums of money to those with considerably less expertise, especially when the industry is already involved in a number of similar initiatives? Will the Minister also confirm that this harebrained idea has been permanently shelved and not simply deferred so that the Minister can have another go at a later date?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I do not agree with the proposition in the first part of the honourable senator's question. Secondly, I think the significant reaction in large sections of the industry was that the financial sector in Australia lacks the required expertise. That view was put to me in writing on several occasions by financial institutions. It was never a question of government expertise; it was never a question of government involvement in funds administration. It was a question of private sector involvement in funds administration. The general view was that it lacked the expertise, which is an unfortunate thing for this country. In regard to the latter part of the honourable senator's question, discussions are still proceeding with various institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. I refer to a recent speech by Sir Arvi Parbo in which he talked about the global marketplace and the success of transnational companies that have forged alliances with their traditional competitors. What initiatives has the Government introduced to stimulate industry to seek development partners specialising in the same or similar products in other countries, if any? Is the Minister aware of any industries which may already be working in partnership with similar industries in other countries to produce world class products?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the best illustration of this is to look at Australia's top 20 exporters compared with Australia's top 20 exporters of a few years ago. If we look at today's top 20 exporters, we will see in that list the emergence of telecommunications companies, computer hardware and software companies and even motor vehicle companies which were not there several years ago. Of course, pre-eminent among them all we will see that the major exporter of Australian manufactured goods now is Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd with steel. It was not there among the top exporters a few years ago. A new range of companies has moved into that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard the comments of Sir Arvi Parbo as being constructive, particularly as they come from a leading Australian industrialist. With some notable exceptions, Australian industry has been slow to get into the global marketplace through strategic alliances. There are some good examples, apart from those I have mentioned in terms of manufacturing performers, such as the North West Shelf team and the frigate and submarine projects, which are predominantly domestically focused but do involve substantial interrelationships with overseas companies.</PARA>
<PARA> Some industries are, however, ahead of the game. I speak of the aerospace, telecommunications and information technology industries. For example, the significant growth in exports in the information technology industries has been done by alliances between major international and local computer companies, particularly software companies. Several local companies have had their products and technologies incorporated into international product lines and won large export orders as a result. The momentum of that process is building, too.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in the aerospace industry Hawker De Havilland Ltd, for example, is now in a risk sharing arrangement with McDonnell Douglas Ltd to build a helicopter, Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd is working closely with Airbus in its A330 project, and so on. I think that the point of the question is that other sectors must follow these examples if they are to prosper in the next century. Sir Arvi's words, to that extent, are apt; and I hope his audience took them to heart. The Government is, of course, encouraging that process, but it is up to firms to actually do it in the context of commercial relationships.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. Is it the case that women in the Australian Federal Police are serving in Cyprus?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that female Australian Federal Police officers have been serving with the contingent in Cyprus since 1988. At the moment there are two female officers in the Cyprus contingent. Senator Maguire would be aware that the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, of which he is Chairman, is holding an inquiry into Australian peacekeeping operations around the world. The fact is that for the last 26 years Australia has made a contingent of police officers available to the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus as part of the international efforts to enhance stability and order on that island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I visited the contingent in July, 18 months ago, and I found that there was a very high regard for the Australian Federal Police in the maintaining of the cease-fire, in its aid to the Red Cross as the international committee requested assistance from time to time, and generally in the way in which it gave a certain security to the two communities-Turkish and Greek-in relation to their difficult relationships across the buffer zone, particularly in regard to locating, interviewing and providing aid to Turkish or Greek Cypriots living in the opposite community.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the role of the Australian Federal Police has been very beneficial as far as both of those communities are concerned. I am quite sure that the fact that female officers are now able to work in an operational role within that contingent has also been of great assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> General Milner, the Canadian commander of the force on Cyprus, appears to take a more enlightened attitude than some of his predecessors as regards the contribution which female police officers can make operationally in Cyprus. I believe that at the moment the way in which female officers are deployed operationally indicates that he has an appreciation-as, of course, Australia does-of the principles of equal employment opportunity, which Senator Maguire has been interested to see observed in this respect. I believe that the Australian Federal Police operation in Cyprus has played a very substantial role in maintaining good relations between the Greek and Turkish communities on that island. I know that has been recognised by the representatives of both those communities.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to the failure of our trade mission to change the decision of the United States Government to double wheat subsidies to American farmers under its export enhancement program (EEP). I ask: did the Australian Government point out to the United States of America that its decision is contrary to its own professed commitment to reduce agricultural subsidies the world over and to bring them under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade? Secondly, did the Australian Government also advise the United States that Australia is no longer prepared to sacrifice Australian farmers and Australian industry while the US and the European Community (EC) ignore their obligations, and that Australia will now feel free to use carefully selected bounties, subsidies and tariffs to advance the interests of Australian industries and primary producers? If not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1539" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To describe the bipartisan mission led by Dr Blewett which visited Washington between 6 and 9 March as a failure, as Senator Spindler does, implies expectations of success of that mission in terms of changing the United States position at this stage which were simply not in the real world. The point of the matter is that, in terms of what was realistically achievable, Dr Blewett's words speak for themselves when he said, as reported, that on balance the outcome of the mission was better than expected but not as good as hoped. What the mission did was to make plain to officials in the Administration and members of Congress the damage that the fallout of the export enhancement program was causing fair trading nations such as Australia, forcefully registering yet again the very deep concern of the Australian Parliament and people about the damage being done to the wheat industry in particular by EEP subsidies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The mission was given two assurances about better targeting of the program, which provides some small degree of hope that the damage caused to Australian farmers by the EEP might be reduced. In the first place, the Bush Administration did undertake to take what it described as all possible care to avoid disruption by the EEP to Australia's traditional wheat markets, including the Middle East, in the post-war period, which is obviously potentially of great significance. Secondly, the Administration has also agreed to consider a proposal to establish a process of consultation with Australia on sales under the EEP. It does not sound like very much but it would be a very considerable advance on what the situation is at the moment, where these subsidies come into particular markets out of a clear blue sky.</PARA>
<PARA> Almost every congressman that the delegation saw accepted that the American subsidies under the EEP did impact on Australian sales, despite the stated intention of the EEP simply to challenge the unfair trading practices that hurt US exports, particularly those of the EC. It was made clear, nevertheless-and this I guess is what we all expected the response to be-that the US would maintain the basic EEP for as long as the European Community continued its massive agricultural subsidies. The US Congress will very shortly-and this, of course, governed the timing of the mission-be considering a Bill which would increase EEP expenditure for the fiscal year 1991 from $US425m to $US900m. It does seem that, despite the efforts of the mission and other representations that we have been making, the Bill is likely to pass, given its very widespread support within Congress. It is not clear, however, at this stage whether the passage will be for the full amount requested, and any reduction in that respect will, of course, be helpful.</PARA>
<PARA> So I think one can say that the visit of the delegation to Washington has clearly underlined, which we wanted to do, the importance of a satisfactory outcome to the Uruguay Round, especially on agriculture, and left no doubt in anyone's mind that the Cairns Group of countries, led by Australia, are not going to rest until we achieve in this respect a more liberal international trading regime.</PARA>
<PARA> The last part of Senator Spindler's question talks in terms of bounties, subsidies, tariffs and all the rest of the enthusiastic agenda now being promoted by some people. The Government's response to the appropriate place of measures of this kind in the country's total industry policy will, of course, emerge in the Prime Minister's statement and associated statements to be made tomorrow.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industrial Relations.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to Senator West's question is, of course, yes. A fortnight ago I had the privilege of releasing a study that Worksafe Australia had conducted-a study which took six years to complete, was refereed by world experts and is regarded as world-class research. That study found a direct causal link between the amount of exposure workers might have to asbestos and the propensity to contract the lung cancer mesothelioma. The study also made a finding in respect of what had hitherto been a point of some contention-whether the inhalation of blue asbestos fibres was the sole cause or whether there was indeed a toxic potency in the inhalation of white asbestos fibres of the same degree. The study found in that respect that while white asbestos fibres are unlikely to have the same potency as blue asbestos fibres, in fact the lung can clear them more quickly. White, blue and, indeed, brown asbestos are extremely toxic and are likely to give rise, if exposure has been at all prolonged, to the lung disease mesothelioma.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The study also found that, because of the biological time taken for these diseases to incubate-there is a 35-year gestation period for these diseases to occur-when they manifest themselves in the lung, there is no known cure. When one is diagnosed as having the disease, there is no way one can be cured, and life expectancy from that point on is about seven months. It has been found that the number of people likely to die from mesothelioma between now and 2010 is greater than the known number of people expected to die because of the AIDS virus.</PARA>
<PARA> Worksafe Australia is therefore giving urgent attention to a review of standards for exposure to asbestos. While at the present time it thinks its standards are adequate, in the light of these findings it will review those standards.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, refers to the continued underfunding of higher education in Queensland. Given that the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission has stated that only 12 of every 1,000 students in north Queensland go on to higher education when the figure is 29 per thousand in Canberra and Melbourne, and given that three-quarters of the students at a far north Queensland youth congress I attended yesterday said the lack of a campus in Cairns might prevent them from going to university, why does this Government continue to underfund higher education in Queensland, particularly in north Queensland?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know where Senator O'Chee was last week when Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked a similar sort of question. He cites one set of figures. I think it is fair to reflect also in any answer that should be given to him that the proportion of students going from secondary to tertiary education in Queensland is in fact, I believe, the highest in all States of the Commonwealth. That must reflect the Government's priorities and initiatives.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Parer says, `Rubbish'. It is a pity that in his case we could not have made it retrospective. The Government, through Mr Dawkins, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, and also Mr Baldwin, has a commitment to ensure that students throughout the country do have equal access to education especially on a tertiary level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is fair to say that the claims that were made last week by Senator Bjelke-Petersen and by Senator O'Chee this morning are difficult to substantiate. When we look, for instance, at Queensland's share of funding in higher education, we should recognise that in allocating growth amongst the States and Territories the Commonwealth does take into account a range of factors, including the current levels of participation and unmet demand and projected figure demand associated with population growth increasing to year 12 enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA> Having considered these factors, the Commonwealth has recognised Queensland's case for a share of growth above its population share, and this is also the case for some other States. The growth allocations provided to Queensland by the Commonwealth are such that Queensland will receive 25 per cent, 1,215 places, of all additional intakes in 1991 and 23 per cent over the years 1991 and 1993, well above its population share of 17 per cent. That is a direct rebuttal to the essential point that Senator O'Chee makes.</PARA>
<PARA> I will go further: in 1990 the higher education participation rate in Queensland was slightly below the national rate-39 per 1,000 of 17 to 64-year-olds compared with 40 per 1,000 nationally. There are some other States-notably New South Wales-which have the same or lower participation rates than Queensland. Their rate is 37 per 1,000, Tasmania is 34 per 1,000, and South Australia and the Northern Territory are about 39 per 1,000. Further to that, it is estimated that on 1990 figures an additional 13,200 students would have been required to bring New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory to the 1990 national rate.</PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the point that I made in terms of funding for the current financial year. In the years 1991 to 1993, Queensland will receive over and above its entitlement in the provision of growth allocations to tertiary education.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I ask: was the Minister present at a conference on the weekend convened by the Industrial Relations Society of South Australia to examine policies and practices in the Australian industrial relations environment? At that conference, was the employers perspective, as articulated by Mr Ian Spicer of the Confederation of Australian Industry, supportive of a number of the Australian Government's current programs and initiatives within the Australian industrial relations system? Can the Minister advise the Senate as to what conclusions might possibly be drawn from Mr Spicer's observations?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1542" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the weekend I did have the pleasure, at its invitation, of addressing the Australian Industrial Relations Society Convention. I think it was quite a successful one, and that is a tribute to the organisers of that convention. I was struck at the time by the amount of common ground evident between the conference participants on their vision of Australian industrial relations for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has become increasingly apparent to me that there is currently an unprecedented converging of views between the main employer bodies, the ACTU and the governments on the direction for change in the industrial relations system. I must say, however, that despite this convergence the Opposition remains as much out on a limb with its non-practical, sand-castles in the air industrial relations policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The best example of that is, I think, Mr Alan Brown in Victoria who is currently threatening to use parliamentary numbers to block a consensus reform to industrial relations and has achieved nothing other than the absolute stout defence of those reforms by employer organisations, and criticism of his actions by employers as well as the other participants in industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Spicer made a speech at the South Australian conference, and that speech is a graphic example of what I mean. In his speech, Mr Spicer made the following points. One, that the existing system is `able to deliver extraordinary flexibility, if that is what the employer really wants'. `An employer', he went on to point out, `can choose between a regime of minimum rates awards with enterprise flexibility provisions, enterprise specific paid rates awards, or section 115 certified agreements to suit the needs of any particular enterprise; and that following the forthcoming Industrial Relations Commission decision on the National Wage Case, there may soon be scope for enterprise bargaining within the system'.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Spicer was at pains to point out that the Industrial Relations Commission has a very important role to play in managing the change to a more decentralised system. Mr Spicer pointed out that the lack of management skills and lack of employee participation are real bottlenecks in the reform process under way through award restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA> To its credit, the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI) is undertaking a crash training course of some 6,000 managers from all over Australia-various States, industries and localities-for the next three months. That is a course which the Commonwealth Government is funding in part with the CAI to better equip managers at middle management level with industrial relations responsibilities to take advantage of the avenues of flexibility offered by the current system.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Spicer concluded, `It is no good blaming the system for not delivering if we have not also delivered'-in talking of himself-`in terms of our management practices. It is no good blaming the system if we do not have the courage or ability to get the benefits which are currently available from it'.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Mr Spicer was not complacent about the current system and made some useful suggestions for further change. There do remain areas where there are disagreements between ourselves as the Government and the employer groups, particularly the way in which we view the importance of equity considerations in these matters. However, the fact remains that this Government, through its practical measures undertaken over the past years to reform the industrial relations system in this country, has provided a framework for employers to achieve improvements in productivity and efficiency, and that employers generally understand that.</PARA>
<PARA> People like the Opposition, who blame the industrial relations system for hindering change, are, in the words of Mr Spicer, the Chief Executive of the Confederation of Australian Industry, `simply making excuses for those who want to avoid the hard task of planning for change and then setting about achieving its delivery'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. The Government in its Budget Papers has indicated that, with the scheduled completion of the current program of major asset sales, such revenue will no longer be available to mitigate the net growth in forward estimate outlays.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have said on numerous occasions in the Senate, the decline in the surplus is essentially a counter-cyclical decline in the surplus. We are very lucky to have had in this country a surplus of the order that we had. It is counter-cyclical in the sense that unemployment benefits have risen, corporate profits have been reduced as a result of the recession, and corporate tax has accordingly been reduced. In addition to that, there have been some reductions in the surplus as a result of Government policy: for example, approximately $1 billion associated with the wage-tax trade-off, some $300m which has gone to the wool industry, and some $700m associated with the sale of the pipeline which was lost as a result of the decision by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator's question is couched on the assumption that, because there is a decline in the surplus, therefore that decline should be compensated for by further sales of assets. That is not the view of the Government. As the economy recovers, the structural surplus will come back as corporate profits rise and unemployment declines. It is not the view that one compensates for these things by a further program of asset sales as a means of redressing an imbalance in the Budget. That has never been so and it is not our view now. That view was fairly prevalent in the early years of the Thatcher Government in England and has become somewhat discredited since, particularly as a result of the North Sea oil.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, affects every Australian, since it relates to the Medicare card. Has the Privacy Commissioner endorsed the Government's plan to use Medicare cards to check eligibility for pharmaceutical benefits by having a direct compulsory computer link-up between pharmacists and the Health Insurance Commission? A month prior to the last Federal election, due to the Privacy Commissioner's concerns, the Government aborted the system. Do the Privacy Commissioner's concerns still apply to this system and, if so, what has the Government done to allay those concerns?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated last week, the Privacy Commissioner has certainly been involved in lengthy discussions and deliberations with the Minister concerning the issue of the Medicare card, which will be used in relation to entitlement to pharmaceutical benefits. I believe that those discussions, whilst continuing, have laid a foundation where the Privacy Commissioner has approved the proposal. I do not know about every aspect; I do not know whether I can reply in relation to each part of the project and how it will be implemented piece by piece. But certainly as to endorsing the proposal in the large, I believe that the Privacy Commissioner has done that, but there has never been any question that his involvement should stop with that general endorsement. I believe that he is being consulted as to the details of the implementation of the project.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the need for consumers to be able to exercise their power in the marketplace to support Australian farmers, orchardists and those involved in various horticultural pursuits, I believe it is extremely essential that they be given the fullest information on the label of the origin of the goods which they purchase. I believe that the health Ministers, who are in charge of food labelling laws around Australia, are in general agreement with that principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If South Australia has acted in the way that is suggested by Senator Olsen, I believe that that is because it is acting to deal with a matter of concern in South Australia but before all health Ministers have a chance, through their combined and joint forum, to consider the proposal which I put to them late last year. I believe in the joint discussions that will be held and the consultations and deliberations which precede that that the merit of the proposal I put will be apparent and ought to be adopted as an Australia-wide standard. As I said, I am in the hands of various health Ministers around Australia in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the question of indicating the fact that the ingredients in, say, a fruit juice come from overseas, where there is a mixture of juices from three or four different overseas countries it may be difficult to indicate exactly which countries of origin contributed to the particular bottle or container of orange juice and it may be sufficient for the consumer to know that the ingredients were imported. That should be sufficient to enable a distinction to be made between that juice and one which is definitely a product of Australia if the consumer is to act in support of the Australian orchardists.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of a strike and reports of a fear of associated unrest at the Vatukoula goldmine in Fiji, which is owned by the Emperor goldmining company. Emperor is not a subsidiary of the Western Mining Corporation, which withdrew earlier this year from joint venture ownership of the mine with Emperor. However, it does retain a management contract for the Vatukoula mine for a period of three years. I can confirm, on the basis of advice received from the Australian Embassy in Suva, that the strike is a result of a dispute over allegations of racism and complaints about safety and living conditions, pay and union recognition- so it has a number of different strands. I am advised that approximately 500 workers are currently on strike demanding recognition of the Fiji Mineworkers Union and improved pay and conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The strike organised by that union is aimed primarily at securing employer recognition of the union. The union claims to have a membership of at least half of the workers, as required under law to ensure recognition, but management claims it does not, as compulsory recognition could be achieved through the Fiji Ministry of Labour if it did, without resort to such strike action. I have been aware of workers' grievances at the Emperor goldmine since early last year when I sought information about the situation from the Chairman of Western Mining. At that time, as I have said, Western Mining was still a major partner in the mine joint venture. My information is that wages at the mine are set in accordance with Fiji Government guidelines, and that other industrial disputes have been the subject of continuing discussion between the union and management at the mine. Essentially, the matter of employment conditions at the mine is one for the union, the mine owners and managers and the Fiji Government to consider.</PARA>
<PARA> The Embassy in Suva is following the situation closely because it is a major issue in Fiji at the moment, but for us to do any more in this case would not, I think, be particularly appropriate, given WMC's very significantly reduced role, nor do I think it would be potentially very helpful in terms of achieving any progress in the industrial dispute. Indeed, any very heavy-handed representations by us could risk a counterproductive response from the authorities in Fiji. Naturally, we continue to have a real concern, as we do on a universal basis, for workers' rights, but on balance this would not seem to be the kind of case where we could usefully do anything more than keep ourselves closely informed of developments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia currently has operational reciprocal health care agreements with a number of countries: the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Malta, Italy and Sweden. I know that negotiations are being undertaken with a number of other countries. Under these agreements, short term visitors or non-residents have access to the host country's public health care system as public patients on the same basis as residents of that country. That is very useful, of course, in a situation of an acute illness, where one needs treatment immediately for the onset of some disease or when some terrible accident has occurred. These arrangements do not extend coverage to prearranged or elective treatment. Likewise, treatment received through the private sector, including treatment as a private in-patient of a hospital, is not covered by these agreements. These reciprocal health care agreements cover all necessary medical, paramedical or hospital treatment to the extent that such treatment is provided under the host country's public health care system, but they do not include repatriation costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the point of Senator Jones's question probably is to say to those Australians visiting countries other than the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Malta, Italy or Sweden that they would be strongly advised to purchase a comprehensive travel insurance package which includes an adequate health cover component in order to deal with the very considerable health care costs that can accrue, particularly if they have hospital treatment in a country such as the United States of America.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do have some information in respect of at least the 33 Indo-Chinese and 35 Cambodians who have arrived in Australia. As Senator Tambling mentioned, the boat with 35 Cambodians on board arrived in Darwin harbour on 6 March. Twenty-five of these have already been transferred to accommodation in Sydney and Melbourne. The persons on the vessel identified themselves as Cambodians. The vessel was escorted into Darwin harbour late on the evening of 6 March. The available details correspond with those in recent press reports of a boat load of 35 Cambodians heading for Australia. There were 19 adults, and 16 children under the age of 18. All aboard appeared to be in good health. However, there were two pregnant women on board and they were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure. The group states that it left the Cambodian port city of Kompong Som on 21 January and spent some time in Indonesia en route. Assuming that the boat is Cambodian, it will be the fourth boat from Cambodia to reach Australia, the first three having arrived in November 1989, March 1990 and June 1990. I am informed that there are no further boats on the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, 25 of these people were flown south on 7 March to accommodation in Sydney and Melbourne. This was due to a shortage of suitable accommodation in the Darwin area. Eighteen of them are in Melbourne and seven in Sydney for the initial processing period. The remaining 10 will stay in Darwin for the time being. Five are being detained for further questioning and the other five are a family group obliged to stay behind because of the wife's advanced stage of pregnancy. I am informed that the entire group of 35 should be collocated later in either Melbourne or Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has informed me that it is of real concern to him that the people who undertake these hazardous sea voyages reach Australia. His concern is compounded in that people who are seeking asylum choose to pass through other countries on the way without claiming protection. This does cause another problem. People seeking asylum are searching for protection that they do not believe their own country affords them and are not setting out for a preferred destination in which to settle.</PARA>
<PARA> About 224 direct boat arrivals from Cambodia are already in Australia. I think that Senator Tambling mentioned 220. In the main they have not yet finalised their refugee applications. I reject the allegations as to why that has happened. I am informed that, although the Sydney and Melbourne groups had lodged applications, they sought to revise them.

In terms of planning unemployment, which is the implication of Senator Bishop's first question-unemployment was one of the most lagged things in the indicators which were available to the Government in the calendar year 1990 and which made it quite distinct from the 1982 recession when unemployment grew much more rapidly and to a much greater extent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be last week's question but it is still this week's problem, and it might be a problem for a good many months and indeed years yet. As such, I think it is important that the Senate understand the dimension of it. I think all of us know the circumstances in which the fires have been caused in Kuwait-the immense program of destruction that the Iraqis embarked upon in the course of their retreat. The scale of the damage that has been caused is beginning only now to be appreciated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our own ambassador to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait visited Kuwait just a few days ago. In his report he referred to the extraordinary pollution being caused and tangibly feelable by a visitor-the extensive smoke pall, the strong smell of burning oil, the oily feel to the rain; and he said that, generally, with the darkness and the cold, it was as if being in Kuwait was being in a northern European city in the depths of winter. These are merely impressionistic observations, of course.</PARA>
<PARA> The concern is that the damage is going to be very real indeed. Fires are burning at least three million barrels of oil per day and, according to Japan's environment agency, producing smoke containing 35,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide per day. The smoke could cause the temperature in the Gulf region to cool up to five degrees. The cloud has spread over Bahrain, Qatar, south-western Iran and part of Iraq. It is not expected at this stage to affect the broader region in the sense that predictions of environmental damage to the Indian subcontinent have been premised on 10 million barrels of oil burning each day rather than the three million that represents the current estimate.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the prospects for putting these fires out, it is going to take up to two months alone to clear the area of mines before fire fighters can move in. Then the task ahead is manifestly enormous. Current estimates are of the order of two years or more to put out the fires. There have never been so many oil fires burning at once, and their extinguishment even by the expert resources now being flown in from all around the world will manifestly be an enormous task.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 March, Senator Powell asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, a question on World Heritage. I agreed to provide additional information, and I am now pleased to provide the following advice. With respect to the report on World Heritage boundaries that the Tasmanian Government released on 1 March, I have been advised that it is a departmental report compiled by a small team from within the Tasmanian Department of Parks, Wildlife and Heritage. I understand the document does not reflect Tasmanian Government policy. It was produced as a result of the commitment made under the Labor-Green accord.</PARA></TALK.START>

This has been done so as to involve the States and Territories in events leading up to the nomination of properties to the World Heritage List. When the views of the States and Territories have been received, the Government will be in a position to consider in detail the preparation of an indicative list for submission to the World Heritage Committee.</PARA>

<PARA>BALTIC INDEPENDENCE RALLY- 9 MARCH 1991 BRISBANE: RESOLUTIONS</PARA>
<PARA> On 9 February and 3 March 1991 residents of the Republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia participated in an `advisory vote' on the proposition: `Do you support a democratic and independent statehood for the Republic?'. More than 70% of the voters in each Republic supported this statement. Following these convincing independence plebiscites, we ask the Australian government for a formal, authoritative statement in reference to the renewal of the independence of the Baltic states which could include the following actions:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Establish de facto recognition of the elected governments in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by sending diplomatic and government representatives to the Baltic states and receiving Baltic diplomats and government representatives in a manner befitting the opening of relations between sovereign governments.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Establish Australian information centres in the Baltic states and support the establishment of Baltic information centres in Australia. Such an exchange of information centres-already implemented by Sweden, Denmark and Belgium-would serve as the foundation for formal diplomatic missions in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>3. Make aid available directly to the people of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The major need is for technical and educational assistance in repairing damage to the environment, rebuilding economic and government infrastructure and renewing social services.</PARA>
<PARA>4. Inform the USSR explicitly that the Baltic states issue is not for the USSR to deal with alone, but is a matter of international concern-the last unresolved issue from World War II. The Baltic states did not join the USSR of their own free will. The renewal of Baltic independence should be raised in all available international forums, particularly in the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA>5. Persuade the USSR to enter into good-faith negotiations with the governments of the Baltic states, to end Soviet occupation and to renew their independence.</PARA>
<PARA>6. Express dissatisfaction to the USSR, and discontinue aid to the Soviet central government, if it avoids meaningful negotiations or encourages armed intervention in the Baltic states.</PARA>
<PARA>We feel that a firm stand must be taken to support the wish for independence of the majority of people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Such a stand, under the auspices of the United Nations, has successfully restored an independent Kuwait. Concerted international action is now necessary to achieve peaceful resolution of the Baltic states independence issue.</PARA>

<PARA>GPO Box 5218</PARA>
<PARA>SYDNEY NSW 2001</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Commissioner,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Determination of Application No. 2 made under s. 72 of the Privacy Act 1988, tabled in the Senate on 26 November 1990 and considered by the Committee at its meeting of 20 December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted that this was the second such Determination tabled in the Senate. This revised version appears to differ only slightly from the earlier version. However, there was no indication in the supporting material tabled with the Determination to indicate why it was necessary to table a further copy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted the advertisement reproduced in Schedule 1 of the Determination, which refers to an application from the DPP, who wishes to be able to disclose certain information to ``professional disciplinary bodies and the Victorian Mental Health Revierw Board . . . ''. The advertisement invites expressions of interest and preliminary views from the public. The Committee assumes that the advertisement was intended to carry out the duty imposed on you by s. 72 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is concerned at what appears to be a substantial expansion, from this limited application, of both the scope of the subsequent Draft Determination and Conference and the scope of the final Determination. The original application seems to have expanded by the addition of the employing authorities of the public services of the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, and certainly other bodies as well. These public services employ hundreds of thousands of persons.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee appreciates that you have discussed this question at page 6, second last paragraph, of your Reasons for Determination. However, the Committee wouild appreciate more detailed advice on your reasons for expanding the scope of the subsequent inquiries and the Determination beyond that set out in the advertisement to bodies which, with respect, appear to bear no relationship to the bodies in the advertisement. In particular, your advice would be appreciated as to whether these actions affected the validity of the process leading up to the Determination. Perhaps you could also address the natural justice implications, including the opportunity to be heard, during this process, for the hundreds of thousands of affected individuals and the organisations which represent them.</PARA>
<PARA>In this context of notice, presumably so that persons affected can take any steps that are available to them under the Act or otherwise, the advertisement advises that ``This matter will be the subject of further public notices at a later time.'' Did these later notices advise of the qualitatively different nature of subsequent proceedings? The Committee would be grateful if you could send it copies of these later public notices.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also noted that the Determination appeared to provide no list of the organisations to which information may be disclosed. To this extent the Determination appears to be uncertain in its effect. Again, you have mentioned this in the Reasons for Decision. You state that a list approach would lead to confusion. The Committee would be grateful if you could provide an estimate of the number of agencies affected. The Determination refers to ``an organisation permitted to receive the information.'' What are these organisations? How does a member of the public, or an organisation itself, know which organisations are permitted to receive information? The Determination also refers to a ``recipient agency'', ``the recipient of information'' and ``the recipient''. None of these four terms is defined. Are they synonymous?</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes that the power effectively to exempt individuals or agencies from the provisions of an Act of the Parliament, as in the present case, should be exercised in a manner which pays the highest regard to personal rights, such as the right of those adversely affected to be heard when public officials deliberate on such exemptions. When an Act provides for procedures to be followed before delegations under an Act are exercised, as in this case, those procedures should be observed with a view to appropriate safeguards for affected individuals. When a Determination is made, such as the present one, which appears to grant wide discretions to another public official, the Determination shouild be as precise as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Committee, on 20 December 1990 I gave a protective notice of motion of disallowance in respect of the Determination, in order to preserve for the Committee the option to recommend disallowance to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee wouild welcome your advice.</PARA>

<PARA>Canberra</PARA>
<PARA>ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 21 December 1990 raising certain concerns in relation to the public interest determination dated 29 October made under section 72 of the Privacy Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>(1) Tabling of second document:</PARA>
<PARA>As noted by the Committee the determination was tabled twice in the Senate. After the first document was tabled, the Senate Tabling Officer advised that it was not in order in one respect. He considered that the heading on page 10 needed to be amended to indicate that the determination was made under section 72 of the Privacy Act and because of that change, the date on page 11 also needed to be amended. These changes are incorporated in the second document tabled.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) Range of bodies and individuals consulted:</PARA>
<PARA>While the application and the concerns of the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to disclosure for public service purposes focused on the needs of Commonwealth agencies, it was clear at the conference that the concerns applied equally to cases involving state public service bodies. In my view once an exception was given allowing disclosure to one set of public service bodies (Commonwealth agencies), it followed that the same standard should apply in relation to all public service bodies, whether Commonwealth, State or Territory. Otherwise the situation could arise where the Director of Public Prosecutions would have differing powers of disclosure in relation to a public servant, simply on the basis of whether he or she was a Commonwealth officer or not. Such a determination would I think have been viewed by many as illogical.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee raises the question of the adequacy and degree of notice given. I have so far followed the practice of giving notice in The Australian newspaper because of its national circulation and in The Canberra Times because of the relevance to federal government of the applications. This practice was followed in the case of the application currently under consideration. I have been reluctant to advertise more widely-say in every major newspaper-because of cost considerations. The cost is high and borne by my budget. However, I would be happy to consider any Committee comments in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA>I have seen circulation to potentially interested bodies and organisations as a more effective and less costly way of giving notice. My office mails to individuals and organisations considered to have an interest in public interest determinations generally, a copy of the application. This list is regularly updated and expanded. I acknowledge that the circulation in this case could have possibly been wider and included a wide range of union groups. I will keep that concern in mind when dealing with any failure similar issues. But I shouild emphasise that circulations of this kind are at my discretion and not required by the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) Scope of determination and notice:</PARA>
<PARA>It would appear that the Committee is particularly concerned about the inclusion of public service bodies in the final determination. The application from the Director of Public Prosecutions in fact did refer to the need for that office to be able to make disclosures to public service bodies. Individuals receiving a copy of the application would have been aware of the possible scope of the final determination.</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that the public notice did not cover, expressly this element of the application. The notice sought to give the public a general indication of the nature of the application. Short of republishing the application in full, there will always be an element of judgment in how extensive the particulars given in the notice are. My aim at the time was to give a general indication of the scope of the application. In future, in light of the concerns, I will seek to be more specific, possibly confirming the notice with the applicant.</PARA>
<PARA>The clause which appeared in this public notice foreshadowing further possible notices no longer appears in determination notices. Our experience in this case was that further public notices proved not to be necessary. This determination was one of two initial public interest determinations and during the conduct of this determination procedures were being developed and refined. The final procedures while not precluding further notices have not stated that such notices are mandatory.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) Absence of list of organisations to whom disclosures may be made:</PARA>
<PARA>I explained in the reasons for the determination why a ``list'' approach would not be practical; and in that regard accepted the submission of the Director of Public Prosecutions. If the ``list'' approach had been adopted a new public interest determination process would have to be undertaken each time a change to the list was envisaged. There are nin Parliaments in Australia dealing regularly with the scope and structure of occupational discipline and regulation; as well as nine governments, through administrative arrangements and regulations. I do not see it as productive to invite a process which involves the need to continually seek amendment or variation of a list of approved recipients. What instead I sought to do in the determination was to impose procedural safeguards on the exercise of discretion by the Director of Public Prosecutions which would enable my office or anyone with a relevant concern to ascertain quickly whether the discretionwas being properly and reasonably exercised.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) Defining Permitted Recipients:</PARA>
<PARA>The three terms queried by the Committee (recipient agency; recipient of the information; and recipient) are synonymous. I will seek to avoid, in future, variations in terms of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA>``Permitted recipient'' and similar terms are intended to cover any body with the functions referred to in the primary clause of the determination. I would be happy to table a further amended determination to meet any concerns in relation to lack of explicit reference to who is entitled to receive the information. I would propose the inclusion of the words ``to a body which has the relevant regulatory or disciplinary function'' after the word ``disclosure'' in line 3. An alternative to taking this step might be to obtain a written undertaking from the Director of Public Prosecutions that the determination will be applied in that way.</PARA>
<PARA>(6) Impact of the determination:</PARA>
<PARA>Your letter also raised the question of the number of agencies affected. The Director of Public Prosecutions was not able to provide a detailed list of bodies affected. However, the Director did provide examples, as mentioned in the determination, indicating the range of bodies covered. It should also be kept in mind that although the possible number of organisations may be large, the number to whom the Director releases information in any one year is quite small, estimated by the Director's office to be no more than 10. In addition the determination provides for a monitoring role in which the Director must, annually, provide me with a list of disclosures made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The urgency motion we are debating today seeks the Senate's endorsement of an ecologically sustainable development strategy for the forestry and forest products industry. It calls on the Hawke Government to phase out the economic and environmental vandalism that is decimating our native forests and has left us with an enormous trade deficit in pulp and paper products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter is indeed urgent because the Government, far from encouraging a shift to a sustainable strategy, is poised to lock this country for the next 10 to 15 years into the discredited practices of the past-under pressure from an industry which refuses to face the fact that it has to change in order to survive. By agreeing to enact resource security legislation, Cabinet has ensured that the 1990s will be a lost decade for the forests, and for the forestry and the forest products industry. The spectacular growth in plantations and the burgeoning interest in recycling are presenting the Government with a golden opportunity to restructure the industry for the long term benefit of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely with the Government's industry statement about to be tabled tomorrow, this is a time when we should be looking for such opportunities. That the Government has rejected this opportunity is testimony to its failure of vision, and its panic response to the blackmail tactics of industry groups which are exploiting the recession to get their hands on as much of the nation's ecological capital as they can before the market collapses altogether and turns against them. </PARA>
<PARA> Cabinet Ministers have tried to defend their decision by claiming that assessments will still be made under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and the Australian Heritage Commission Act before resource security legislation is put in place, and that section 30 of the Heritage Commission Act will only be overridden after that point. According to newspaper reports, Cabinet is exploring mechanisms to ensure that any rare or endangered species found to be threatened by logging can still be protected by providing alternative supplies. How naive does the Government think we are?</PARA>
<PARA> These assurances are hollow for three fundamental reasons. First, our knowledge of the ecological value of many of our forest zones is sketchy. The Government's own environmental databases, the national forest inventory and the national wilderness inventory, are far from being completed. Once timber companies gain access to vast tracts of publicly owned native forests, there is nothing to prevent them from deliberately-and I stress deliberately-logging areas of potential ecological value before they have been fully evaluated. I pose the rhetorical question, Mr Acting Deputy President: what would you do if you had invested a large sum of money, in excess of $100m, and found a rare species in part of your concession which would perhaps prevent you from continuing to exploit that concession?</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is far too little knowledge about the impact of logging on the natural values of forests. Mr Justice Stewart, Chairman of the Resource Assessment Commission, recently observed in answer to a question at the National Press Club:</PARA>
<PARA>The vital question is, is there enough timber to guarantee resource security? Let me tell you quite frankly that no-one, but no-one knows the answer yet. </PARA>
<PARA>Justice Stewart's views were echoed in last Saturday's Canberra Times by Philip Smiles. I stress for the benefit of Opposition senators that I am referring to Philip Smiles, the Liberal member for Mosman in the New South Wales Parliament and Chair of the Public Accounts Committee in that State, which recently released a damning report on the New South Wales Forestry Commission. Mr Smiles was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Until we come to a realistic estimation of what sustainable yields mean in each locality, we cannot talk about resource security. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Smiles, a member of the Liberal Government in New South Wales, is rejecting, at least at this stage, the idea of resource security. The Federal Government simply cannot simultaneously claim to be providing resource security and protecting the environment when no-one knows what a sustainable yield is and, moreover, when no-one knows what the values are in the forest which need to be sustained. I am referring to the values beyond simply the values of the timber. Thirdly, it is quite obvious that logging our forests causes more ecological damage than logging plantations on previously cleared land. But if the Government clings to the outdated and, I stress, incorrect view that plantations cannot supplant native forests over the next decade, then it will simply accept the environmental damage and loss of national estate forests as a regrettable necessity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this context that the plan to override section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act assumes great significance. Until now, section 30 has allowed the Government to regularly examine and re-examine whether prudent and feasible alternatives exist before authorising further logging of a national estate forest. Under resource security legislation, that circuit-breaker will be lost. Within a short time-and I am referring to the next five to 10 years-the Federal Government will belatedly discover that Australia's timber demand can be met largely from plantations and that the export woodchip market will increasingly be supplied from eucalypt plantations in other countries. It will then regret having signed away its powers to redirect the industry to meet these challenges and to preserve our environmental heritage. It will instead be stuck with an agreement which will become increasingly expensive to honour. It is this failure to read the writing on the economic wall that particularly concerns the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government would do particularly well to examine the work of Judy Clark, an economist and timber industry consultant, who studied the domestic and international markets in forest products. In a speech to the Australian Conservation Foundation forum, Ms Clark identified a number of key trends. First, maturing pine plantations will produce enough timber to meet most of Australia's sawn timber needs by the year 2000, assuming demand growth. Presently, it supplies some 45 per cent of our sawlogs. Secondly, New Zealand pine is entering our market at close to Australian production costs. New Zealand will shortly have sufficient capacity to meet both its own and Australia's sawn timber needs. This will force Australian plantations to be brought into production as early as possible to maintain competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, State forestry commissions will come under increasing pressure to lift their financial performance, resulting in price increases for native forest logs. Fourthly, hardwood sawlog quality is declining, affecting economic viability. Indeed, only some 5 per cent of logs now being taken go into sawlog and many are then sent straight to the chippers. This factor is behind the demise of the sawmilling industry and the disastrous slide into export woodchipping of native forests. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, regrowth forests are unlikely to be able to supply large scale sawmilling developments. Sixthly, the world's supply of hardwood chips will change dramatically over the next three to seven years, as, I stress, seven million hectares of eucalypt plantations come on stream in Brazil, South Africa, Portugal and Spain. These plantations will produce enough timber to supply Japan's woodchip demand 10 times over, dwarfing Australia's output. Indeed, Australia will be able to supply some 5 per cent of the world market. </PARA>
<PARA> Seventhly, Australian demand for fibre to meet our projected paper consumption could be met without logging native forests by the year 2000, by relying instead on hardwood and softwood plantations and recycled paper. By the mid-1990s four Australian companies will have enough hardwood plantation resources to feed medium scale pulp and paper mills. </PARA>
<PARA> Miss Clark concludes that native forests will almost cease to supply the domestic sawlog market by the year 2000, with softwood plantations taking over the market. Small, labour intensive hardwood sawmills producing high quality products will remain competitive. Many other mills will close, continuing the present trend. The export market for Australian woodchips, pulp and paper is likely to decline rapidly throughout this decade. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government pursues its present export oriented development strategy, the Australian economy will be vulnerable to this shrinking market. We could well be left with a number of world-class pulp mills which are unable to earn enough to pay off the foreign loans which finance them. What will the subsidy be then on developments undertaken behind the guarantee of resource security? A strategy of replacing imports and seeking niche export markets for paper products offers less risk. </PARA>
<PARA> The upshot of this analysis is that logging of native forests is an activity whose days are numbered. It is being kept alive only because plantation resources that will soon drive native forest hardwoods from the market are still maturing, and because it is being subsidised by low royalties and underpricing. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Public Accounts Committee report on the Forestry Commission of New South Wales demonstrates this point. That is the report to which I referred earlier. The Committee found that native forest timbers were being underpriced by the Commission, which was, in the words of this report, `bloated, inward looking, poorly managed and provoked needless confrontation with environmentalists'. Conversely, the Commission had depressed some parts of the market for pine logs by overpricing. It has paid no dividend-I stress: no dividend-to the New South Wales Treasury. The Public Accounts Committee recommends real price increases for native forest pulp logs. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor is this problem confined to New South Wales. I turn to Tasmania, where the question of resource security will loom somewhat larger, perhaps, in the weeks ahead. The Tasmanian Forestry Commission has outstanding debts of more than-wait for it, Mr Acting Deputy President-$450m; an operating deficit of $20m a year; and has failed to pay a dividend to Consolidated Revenue since 1926. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The State Government has tried to conceal some of the Commission's debt by taking out equity in its own forests, thus transferring the debt to the Treasury. The Auditor-General has responded to this mess by accusing the Commission of using unsound accounting practices in its 1989-90 annual report. I am glad that Senator Walters interjected, because the value placed on the Tasmanian Forestry Commission is zero.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the economically mismanaged, publicly subsidised industry into whose hands the present Government proposes to entrust our remaining native forests, with no real prospect of recall. This is an industry which not only is not ecologically sustainable, but also is not yet within a cooee of achieving economic sustainability. There is a crying need for a major overhaul of the forestry and forest products industry in Australia. One of the results of a thorough shake-out would be to force native forest logging to compete on a level playing field with plantations. Instead, the Federal Government is determined to entrench the bad practices of the past by opening up our native forests to accelerated and guaranteed destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> The push for resource security is an attempt by the forestry industry to rip as much timber as possible out of our native forests before market trends and public opinion turn against it. A quote from the Private Forestry Council of Tasmania-part of the industry itself-made in only 1990, just last year, illustrates this thinking. It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>It is imperative that as much of the remaining private old-growth pulpwood resource as is available for sale is marketed over the next 15 years whilst market acceptance of this comparatively low commercial quality wood is relatively high. Quota restrictions on the harvesting of this resource must be lifted immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>There one has it in a nutshell. The pressure from the industry is to move in on this resource, rip it out-recognising that it is of low value at this time but that there will be a market for it over the next 10 to 15 years-and destroy it, and the market will then collapse. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Federal Government is serious about pursuing an appropriate development strategy for the industry, it must take a long, hard look at the economic prognosis for the forestry and forest products industry and come up with a strategy that is environmentally and economically sustainable. In particular, the work of Judy Clark, to which I referred earlier, and the Australian Conservation Foundation, while not purporting to provide definitive answers to this question, deserves close attention. It is precisely for this reason that the Federal Government initiated the Resource Assessment Commission's inquiry into the industry. The Commission's task is to make recommendations consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. It has been specifically asked to look at the Conservation Foundation's strategy in reaching its conclusions. But the Government has now decided on a long term strategy before the Commission's reported deadline at the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year Mr Justice Stewart made it clear to the National Press Club that he would not welcome such a move. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> While our enquiries are going on . . . the Government [does not] cease to govern . . . but what could impact on [the Commission's] enquiry is that the Government purports to take a decision which is irreversible. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has made a decision which appears irreversible. I refer again to what Phillip Smiles, a Liberal member in the New South Wales Government, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian taxpayer is entitled to demand that the Commission not be sidelined in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>The resource security fiasco is a sign of panic. It has nothing to do with environmental protection. It is not based on any comprehensive long term economic vision. It is a kneejerk response to the political blackmail of an industry which needs for its own sake to be hauled, screaming, into the 1990s by resolute Government action. Instead, it has been given permission to protect itself from today's political, economic and environmental realities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noteworthy that only one Cabinet Minister strongly believes that resource security is necessary and desirable. Media reports state that Ministers Keating, Richardson, Beazley, Kelly and Hand opposed it in Cabinet. Minister Kerin supported it even while believing that it should not be necessary. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) stated publicly only a few weeks ago that it was not necessary but decided to support it to satisfy industry demands. Only Senator Button is a passionate advocate of the legislation, as he is with other cargo cult myths such as the multifunction polis. The Government has ceased to govern according to its own convictions. It is now being driven by industry forces in a pragmatic way acting against the public interest. It is a matter of urgency that the Government take charge and plan for an ecologically sustainable economic future. It is for that reason that I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by refuting the concluding remarks of Senator Coulter. Senator Coulter has premised this so-called urgency motion upon rumour, speculation, innuendo and press reporting. He has fabricated an argument based on that, knowing full well that in about 24 hours the Government will be putting down, both in the House of Representatives and in this chamber, a statement on industry policy in which it will say precisely and absolutely what its position is on the question of resource security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter has been proposed by the Australian Democrats for debate by the Senate without their knowing what it is that the Government will say, but with their believing the speculation, rumour, innuendo and reporting in the press. Therefore, the whole premise of this debate is wrong and it is, indeed, promoted to obscure responsible argument, considered analysis and dispassionate and objective analysis of the real issues that the Government stands for. When we have views presented on where particular Government Ministers stand in the privacy of the Cabinet debate as though they are true, I must say that I am offended. Those comments are really based on hearsay and they have nothing at all to do with the truth. The Government is united on this issue. Tomorrow the Government will say what it proposes and we will then invite debate. Let the debate be about the facts. Let the debate not be about assumptions. </PARA>
<PARA> In my contribution today, I want to start on a definitional note. Last week-I think it was Wednesday-Mr Chaney, in one those rare displays from him as the shadow Minister for the environment, asked a question of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the House of Representatives on resource security. In the ensuing few minutes there was an argument within the House that has become somewhat notorious since then. What was displayed during that argument-and which Hansard, to some extent, reveals-was that the mask of the Opposition has slipped on environmental matters; some of the unguarded comments in the heat of battle in the House reveal an extraordinary attitude of resentment towards the environment or environmental organisations and spokesmen in Australia. That is not at all surprising. One has only to ask any member of the National Party of Australia-none of whom, I notice, are taking part in this debate-to see that there is in this country an extremely wide chasm between the major political parties, the only parties that can form a government, as to where they stand on matters of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chaney is a case in point. As spokesman on the environment, many of his remarks are led by comments such as, `We must do more', `We must look further at that' and `I am interested in this'. He refers in his comments to land degradation, biodiversity and ecologically sustainable development. Indeed, in June 1990, he said, `Sounding green is a bit easy'. What we have from the Opposition is a collection of phrases going nowhere, being unspecific, not explaining an Opposition alternative and giving voters in this country no chance to judge the contrast of the competing policies of the Government and the Opposition, which aspires to government. In this country there is a huge political chasm between both parties. The Opposition is all talk, no substance. When pushed, it generalises; it sounds sympathetic and it never makes a commitment. That is the position of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact and in reality this is a green government and one that is not an anti-environment government. We are recognised as that. We recognise and take seriously our responsibilities in this country for development and economic management. We have a process to reconcile what in the 1990s and the next century will remain as one of the thorniest questions in world politics: we have a policy to deal with the conflict between protecting the environment and aspiring as a community to better environmental standards and at the same time maintaining economic development to assure the citizens of this country a standard of living to which they too equally aspire, with no particular contradiction in terms of their demands in respect of the environment and of a secure, safe and high standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a policy for ecologically sustainable development. We have a process by which we can implement that. We see a desirable outcome in this debate as being a win-win outcome so that both development and the environment are brought into a convergence, not into opposition, so that we can manage intelligently the art of meshing those two objectives. The Opposition, for its part, has a win-lose mentality. It slips back into the rhetoric of the 1950s. It talks as though nothing has changed. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my definitional point by saying that, in terms of the parties which aspire to government in this country, there is a clear contrast between the Government and the Opposition which is unassailable. We have a responsible policy; we are going about implementing it. It is a policy for ecologically sustainable development that tries intelligently to mesh the important environmental considerations and those of growth and development. It is an art which we do not always get perfectly right, but an art which, since we are a consultative government, not a confrontationist government, we are bound to follow, with the support of the social partners in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> With those words, I turn to the motion of the Australian Democrats. I do not, in the beginning, question the sincerity of the Democrats because they have been consistent in their views on the environment at all points. But they are not, if I might say this, a party that aspires to government. They are a party which can afford to be all care and no responsibility on a matter such as this. Whatever the Government does, they can always say that it has not gone far enough. Whatever the Government proposes about industry development, they can always say that it can be dealt with some other way, without specifying how it can be dealt with and how workers' jobs in this country can be protected without their being lost unnecessarily in a situation such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are in a perfect position-what Americans would call the catbird seat-in terms of this debate. Whatever anyone does, they say that they can do it better, they can do it further, they can do more of it and they can do it in a more fulsome and more rounded way. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not responsibility in government. That is not having to front up every day for the hard decisions. Nonetheless, as I have said, despite that many of the things that the Australian Democrats say are trite and superficial, I believe they are passionate in their convictions about them. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the issue. As I have said, I cannot, as the Democrats know, defend myself in this debate by resorting to the facts. I cannot do that because the facts will be announced by the Government tomorrow. I will not be sucked in by the invitation to speculate on or announce prematurely what the Government intends to say tomorrow. That is not appropriate or responsible government. So I say to the Democrats, who have based so much of what they put here on the newspapers, speculation, rumour and innuendo, that they should have waited until tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those in my own Party who have gone public on this matter have been at least courageous enough to admit that they were mistaken. I particularly acknowledge the public comments by Senator James McKiernan, on my side of politics, who was associated within the factional system of the Labor Party with a resolution calling on the Government to change its course. But when, in the consultative way in which we go about managing our affairs, Senator McKiernan learnt more about what it was that the Government proposed to do, he said publicly and honestly that he had reason, therefore, to change his view. If a man of infinite integrity such as Senator McKiernan can be misled into joining a public clamour and then, when confronted with evidence, say, `Well, I was wrong; I must now change my position', I hope that many more in the Australian community will wait until the facts of the statement come forward so that they can see what is intended. I think that many more will then change their position too. </PARA>
<PARA> With those words, I go to the question that is fundamental to many of these things. It could be said that, following the all care, no responsibility route of the Democrats, at best their motion today is idealistic, if not practical. That is a reasonable and respectable thing to do. It does not necessarily mean that all idealists have to be practical. It does mean that governments have to be, but idealists do not have to be. We have to mesh both. </PARA>
<PARA> If one were a harsh critic of the Democrats' motive in proposing impossible tests to fulfil, one could see in this motion a mask for destroying an industry central to the Australian economy. This motion proposes to do things by the year 2000 which are not capable of being done. It proposes that we should obtain the vast bulk of our wood supply from plantations. That is something to which this Government aspires. However, as the fastest growing eucalypt for Australian hardwoods is the Tasmanian blue gum, and as it takes 15 years to get to a level where it is pulpable for paper manufacture-not sawable for plank timber-even if we started today, the question of how we would achieve self-sufficiency out of plantations in nine years is indeed a practical question to ask. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other elements of this. If the worst case is true and this motion is a mask for destruction, I think it does raise a fundamental question of morality-one that has plagued me in this timber debate for the years that I have followed it. This is the moral question as I see it: the Australian timber industry is an industry which cannot supply its own domestic market. It is an industry in which we import more than we provide for our own needs. In terms of imports, timber represents about 10 per cent of the current account deficit. We buy timber from other countries. Imports have increased by 120 per cent since 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government came to power, by following the course of demanding responsibility in forest management by the States-given that we ourselves do not have the constitutional head of power; it is a State responsibility-and by using our export control powers to ensure that they manage their forest resources better, there has been a blowout in terms of the amount of imported timber in this country. We do not apologise for that. We say that that is a necessary recognition of harsher, better, more stringent, environmental controls in the management of what is a rare and unique Australian resource. So, we do not resile from that. </PARA>
<PARA> But if a sensible way of cutting and managing those forests is not provided, how do we curtail the thirst that this developed country has for the consumption of paper and timber products? This is where the question of morality comes in. It means that the responsibility for supplying the market is pushed offshore and onto Third World countries-onto the shoulders to the Penan people in Sarawak, onto the shoulders of pirate loggers in the forests of Indonesia, onto the shoulders of people who were so excessive in the exploitation of native forests in Thailand that the then democratically elected government, now disposed by a military dictatorship, closed down forestry development to allow its forests to regrow. </PARA>
<PARA> The moral questions are whether we should manage our forests in this country in accordance with ecologically sustainable development, taking care of biodiversity, taking care of rare and endangered species and taking care of proper, sensible, environment development in a way in which we can meet demands that are reasonable of our timber industry; whether we should develop a plantation strategy alongside that so that so that we can shift our primary reliance on native forests into plantations; whether we should learn how better to utilise the resource so that we take more from the forest floor than we used to burn; and whether we should learn better cutting techniques so that the same volume of resource goes further and is used more wisely. </PARA>
<PARA> Should we do all of those things rather than think we are achieving something by asking that our forests not be touched and be held as some antique museum for posterity, thereby pushing the demand that this community unquestionably has onto the Third World and acquiesce in the poor management practices that those countries unfortunately have? It seems to me that that is the challenge. Unless the Australian Democrats can come forward and ask us how we can manage to do that, the more this industry will be closed down. Without doing something about demand, the more we acquiesce in the rape of tropical forests in our near north. </PARA>
<PARA> With those words, I now turn to the provisions of this motion. The motion asks the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA>ensure that nearly all of Australia's sawn timber requirements are met from plantations from the year 2000;</PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, the fastest growing Australian eucalypt is the Tasmanian blue gum. If one were planted tomorrow in proper environmental, weather, soil and fertiliser conditions, it would take 15 years to get to a level at which it could be pulped, not sawn for plank timber. I ask the Democrats: how can they expect a government to support a motion which defies the biological growth rates of the fastest growing tree by some six years? The Democrats ask us to do it in nine years. We point out to the Democrats that it can only be done in 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Democrats ignore the fact that we have a strategy to convert more of our demand to plantations. We have a strategy to encourage Australian farmers to grow Australian eucalypts on unfertile or little used parts of their farms at a guaranteed buy-back rate so that they have, if you like, a cash crop which weans the industry's demands off native forests. Farmers can utilise sections of their land for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a strategy which promotes broad acre plantation cultivation in Australia and a number of experimental and commercial farms are now in existence. We have a strategy for better management of regrowth forests. It seems to us that by better management of those forests we may in fact get a higher yield for commercial timber resources and thus not need the high capital expenditure of acquiring land and developing the broad acre proposal. So, in terms of the utility of the first proposition, I say that it has no practical application to reality. It does not recognise the trends or the changes and it is, therefore, pie in the sky. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Democrats ask us to phase out woodchipping by the year 1995. I would like to phase out woodchipping in Australia today. That is what I would like to do. It is a waste of a rare national resource, in my view. But the way in which it should be phased out should be to turn it not into chips but into pulp or paper to go up the value-added developmental route. The only way that can be done is to have investment in companies that will turn it into pulp and paper. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing in this motion that suggests how we will attract investment if there is not a security in some form or other-a properly guarded, a properly hedged, a properly balanced and a properly managed security-to ensure that there is a supply of resource. Which entrepreneur will put in millions of dollars to develop the turning of chips into pulp and paper if there is not some form of security such as that? The Democrats do not recognise those practical questions when they talk about the phase out of woodchips by 1995-unless they want to say that we should close down the industry and put a number of Australians out of work, and end forever the opportunity to realise the true potential of this native resource. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to refer to the last point which concerns value-adding. The Democrats have prescribed in the motion that there should be some downstream processing but only in the ways that they say. As a member of this Government, I must say that I cannot anticipate the mind of future science. I do not know what the perfect ways of developing a resource might be and I am not proposing to tie myself down to a prescription which is articulated in a motion which says, `It can only be this way because we can imagine no other'. I have learnt that more innovative, imaginative and scientifically sound ways may be found in the future. Paragraph (c) in the motion is too prescriptive; it is meant to choke off or to stifle any possibility for development. While some of the elements of the motion are idealistic and relate to things about which we would like to see more done, this may not of itself be the only way. </PARA>
<PARA> In the half minute left to me, let me say in summary: there is no choice for Australians concerned about balancing industry and environment in this country. Only one party-the Hawke Labor Party-is showing a clear interest in that subject. The Opposition does not and that is fundamental. I say to the Democrats: please push us harder; please carry the debate more strongly on scientific merits, on matters of fact, because we are dedicated to getting the combinations right. But do not expect us to respond when they come up with airy-fairy, wide ranging, idealistic options that are not realistic in practice and which will destroy the industry. </PARA>

I have strong feelings for the bush and for the people who are still associated with it. I am not one of those who see it as just something else to convert or to shut up and close down. I see it very much as one of those vibrant and living things that we have a lot to be thankful for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember very well my young days on a farm when removing the remains of trees was, from time to time, a very major undertaking. I still look on those days with some fondness, difficult and all as they may have been. I have seen trees from that area cut into scantling and into finishing timbers; I have seen it go into veneer boards, firewood and wood pulp; and recently I have seen it go into chips. I have seen that land running sheep and cattle and growing crops of potatoes, oats, swedes, peas and various other things. More recently I have seen the wheel turn full circle and much of that land has now been planted with trees, both radiata pine and eucalypts. </PARA>
<PARA> As a child, I knew our area very well. I knew every type of animal and bird in it and I knew every type of vegetation that grew upon it. I saw the trees grow and I saw them die. I saw the fires and I saw the regrowth. Of course, that is all very much part of the continuing cycle of the forest, and every part of it is important. I am not one, I believe, who is out of touch with the trees and the forests. So today we find ourselves with the Australian Democrats' motion, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The need to establish a pattern of ecologically sustainable development of the forest products industry requiring the Federal Government to:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) ensure that nearly all of Australia's sawn timber requirements are met from plantations by the year 2000;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) phase out export wood chipping of native forests by 1995, and;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) increase value-adding in the pulp and paper industry through an import replacement strategy based on moderate scale, chlorine-free pulp mills fed from hardwood plantations and recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure what it means. I was wondering, when I first read it, whether it was the first flicker of light at the end of the tunnel. I wondered whether the Democrats had come to realise that some form of industry, even in some way, was essential; that we have to have something to live on. If that were the case, I thought we ought to take it reasonably seriously. It is a concession I gather that they do understand that we must have and use trees, that we must make pulp and paper and that we must survive in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA> It says, `The need to establish' but it does not say by whom. Is it the Democrats, the Senate or the Parliament? I cannot really imagine but, according to the motion, there is a need for somebody to do the establishing. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the motion refers to the question of sustainability. There never has been any doubt that this party has always seen sustainable development as an absolute national essential, and the position still stands. We must sustain Australia as a viable operation. The forest products industry must play its part. The forest products must be maintained and developed, and they must be developed in perpetuity as they are currently. We hope, of course, that that will be done in a continuing and increasing way. </PARA>
<PARA> In the State of Tasmania, with all its forest land, there are large areas of degenerate mixed forests that have little or no beauty, are of no use, are poor habitat and are not unique. Large areas of them have been badly damaged by age, fires and predators. A lot of them are badly needing renovation and restoration. A lot of these areas must be recycled so that the best of them can be regained for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . ensure that nearly all of Australia's sawn timber-</PARA>
<PARA>How much is `nearly all'? Is it 51 per cent, 75 per cent or 95 per cent? Who is going to determine it? What are we going to do with it? Does the use of that timber matter? Whatever it is, it has to be `met from plantations by the year 2000'. Well, really! I have seen a lot of the trees that we are talking about-these Tasmanian blue gums and nitans that are the main varieties of the area-and I have seen them growing at extraordinary rates, but they will not grow at a rate that is quite as extraordinary as expected by the motion, I can promise honourable senators. So I ask: is the motion serious to put the year 2000 on it? It really makes the whole thing incredible. </PARA>
<PARA> Private forestry, particularly that coming from the forestry companies, is heading well on the way to becoming self-sufficient, as it has been for some years. In my own area, Associated Pulp and Paper Mills, the division of North Broken Hill, has done a lot of work in reforestation, and has developed many new techniques. It has one of the best plantation seedling areas that I could ever imagine and, with the use of all types of methods, it has produced exceptionally fine trees. It has already planted 18,000 hectares of eucalypts and 12,000 hectares of pines. It is increasing its plantings year by year, but those trees will not be ready by the year 2000, and certainly there is no way they can be ready by the year 2000 to meet the sawn timber requirements. I think any sort of discussion on the subject would clearly demonstrate to anybody who is interested in our becoming self-sufficient that it will take longer than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, we also have the woodlot farmers, those growing areas of upgraded native forest, putting in plantation areas and so on. We need to look after those people because we are going to rely on them. I gather from the motion that the Democrats would like to see something happen there as well. But their own policies make this extraordinarily difficult because, when I look at their policies for those sorts of people trying to make a living on the land, I find the Democrats would introduce death duties for properties worth more than $300,000; they would introduce federal land tax; they would continue to strengthen the capital gains tax; they would place stricter bureaucratic controls over all areas of agriculture, including land use; and they would repeal the planned variety rights legislation and so on. What sort of encouragement is that for people who would like to see an expansion of their development of farming in this form?</PARA>
<PARA> We must produce our own because we are getting further and further into debt. I found that in 1974-75, after 75 years of federation, we had a gross overseas debt of $6 billion. By 1988-89-15 years later-the debt was $139 billion. We cannot go on heading in that direction. Whatever the Labor Party in government may do or may have done, I think the people of Australia now realise that that trend must stop, and it can only stop by our producing more and selling more. </PARA>
<PARA> We have various problems in Australia and it was only recently, when I was trying to explain to people how it was becoming difficult, that I realised that the average Australian business in employing labour is up for these sorts of costs and conditions: a 35-hour week, 17 1/2 per cent leave loading, 10 public holidays, things they call `RDOs', four to six weeks holiday, 13 weeks long service leave, flextime, sick pay, redundancy payments, maternity leave, training levies, workers compensation, smokos, superannuation, paternity leave, specially listed clothing in many industries, transport, danger money, height money, cold money, hot money and all the other sorts of moneys that Senator Cook was able to organise in his years in the business, equal pay, equal opportunity, junior pay levels-all these sorts of things; and that is before one comes around to company tax, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax, payroll tax on fringe benefits tax, fuel taxes, land taxes, municipal rates and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do people face trying to go into business when they have these types of imposts compared to their competition around the world? Our working conditions in industry are the envy of everybody in the world, and all these benefits, conditions and awards were produced while Australia was one of the most profitable and prosperous countries ever. We no longer can say that; it is not so by a mile. We have to keep on going and we have to get back on track. We cannot get out of export woodchipping by 1995. What would we do with the heads, the rubbish and the off-cuts and so on? What would we do with our contracts, our debts and our unemployment? Do the Australian Democrats give a continental about these things? Do they, or do they not? We have to make these targets reasonable, attainable and sensible. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we come to the import replacement question, and that has to be reasonable, too. To say what sort and size of plant we are talking about is quite ridiculous. The chlorine plant is the current state of the art in the world. It may change, but the new plant is as good as anything we could wish for. Why do we want to produce a moderate size-by which I presume they mean an uneconomic size-plant? Then there is recycled paper: the paper processors in Australia tell me they are already using the maximum amount of recyclable paper they can without lowering their standards below what the market requires. We cannot produce paper that is not required; we must look to the future to be able to see that we supply what the world wants, not what the Democrats want. It must be what the market requires. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give notice of an amendment to be moved later, which says:</PARA>
<PARA> Remove all words after `urgency', substitute:</PARA>
<PARA>The need to establish a pattern of sustainable development of the $8 billion a year forest products industry in order to lessen Australia's annual $2 billion dependence on imports and increase the value of its exports, requiring the federal government to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) encourage the industry to meet the bulk of its sawn timber requirements from plantations and those areas of native forests that are not reserved for the maintenance of necessary environmental and bio-diversity requirements; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) provide a base of confidence and security to enable the pulp and paper industry substantially to increase value adding through a strategy of development of pulp and paper mills meeting agreed national standards in line with the best available technology so that Australian wood resources have as much `added value' as possible in Australia rather than overseas. </PARA>

What Senator Archer has just indicated also leads me to straighten out Senator Cook on one of his misunderstandings of what it is the Australian Democrats are actually doing here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cook was under the misapprehension-and I direct him to the Hansard record-that we were talking about a matter of public importance. I have only just learnt about these things; I expected Senator Cook to have it straight by now. In fact, the letter from Senator Coulter clearly says that today he `shall move the following as a matter of urgency'. For Senator Cook to address it as a matter of public importance is quite misleading. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Cook" NAMEID="RF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It doesn't change a single remark I made, however.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it does not, it probably means that Senator Cook has a little packet of words which he carts about and throws around whenever something like this comes up; that in fact it was not a speech addressed to this matter, but rather a speech he trots out on provocation. Senator Cook's speech was based upon the idea that we needed to have some facts before us before we could address this particular problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as I understand it, in addressing Senator Coulter's urgency motion we need a set of principles. It is those principles which really determine how we react to this motion. Senator Cook did not address those principles, but seemed to think it was important to spend some time dismissing the speculation in the press. While he was addressing and dismissing that speculation and trying to hose down the concern of some members of the Cabinet about it, we did not hear what I would have expected to hear from a Labor senator. We did not hear concern about the principles of what is our Crown land, who owns our forests, how should we use them, who should use them, who should be entitled to exploit them and whether any exploitation should be allowed whatsoever. They are the principles, concerns and policy directions with which we are concerned and it matters very little about anything other than the title of the proposed legislation, about which we have heard so much in the past few weeks; that is, the legislation about which we Democrats have been asking a series of questions and have been receiving very little satisfaction on: the legislation referred to as resource security legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook also mentioned his idea that the Australian Democrats can afford to be critical because we have no responsibility and will not have the responsibility of reaching government in his foreseeable future. In case Senator Cook has not noticed, the Democrats occupy a position in this place at the moment which gives us what is referred to as the `balance of power'; it is a position which requires the daily exercise of a responsible attitude to all legislation. That means that every day and on every issue nothing that this Government proposes can be passed in this place without critical and responsible evaluation by either the coalition or the Democrats, and sometimes the coalition has lately reduced our impact by forming its own greater coalition with the Government. That greater coalition has taken us down the path of abandoning many of the very Labor principles with which this Government should be concerned. I suggest that Senator Cook realises that responsibility is not necessarily only responsibility in government; it also applies to responsibility in consideration of all legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told some of the facts, with which we have no dispute: approximately 10 per cent of our current account deficit is due to timber imports. This is a matter which has concerned me personally for some time. Some 30 years ago, in the area in which I lived when I was much younger, I was fortunate enough to be aware of what was going on in my environment. As children quite often we do not take much notice of our environment, but I listened and observed. I lived in an area which was used for some of the earliest pine plantations established in Tasmania. I was aware at the time and took notice of the fact that when the early plantations were established some of the timbers which were trialled, some of the plants which were established as trials, were not just pinus radiata, but pinus insignia and what we also call Douglas Fir or oregon. I think we still import oregon to a great extent from North America. Oregon grows very well in conditions similar to those required for radiata, which covers extensive areas of softwood plantations in Australia. Although I was aware that some plantings took place earlier on, I still cannot understand why more extensive plantings of Douglas Fir were not made. Perhaps the investors at that time could not see the need to make plans over such long periods which the Douglas Fir requires to grow. </PARA>
<PARA> During his information sharing session, Senator Cook told us what would happen to imports if we reduced our dependence on Australian native timbers. I was a bit troubled, as was Senator Archer by his reference to the word `we'. Senator Cook also used the word `you', and I do not understand whom he meant. He said, `You push responsibility on to Penan, Sarawak, et cetera, to provide us with the sorts of timbers that we need to supply our building needs'. I do know a little about this. In the past, before I was enlightened, I used some of the timbers which are supplied as Asian rainforest species. I realised that the timbers, such as Meranti and Merbau, are often supplied as architraves or as skirting boards, et cetera. We do not need to use that type of timber for that particular application. There are many others, and certainly the softwood plantations could and should provide the timber which is used in that way. It is certainly not used in an exotic manner which requires it to be that particular timber; if anything, it is almost a substitute for it. We do not require the rainforest species of South East Asia to be used in that way. The simple fact is that we should not import it at all. We can and should use radiata for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told, again in an information sharing exercise by Senator Cook, that 15 years is required to grow eucalypts for pulp. That is precisely the reason Senator Coulter's motion reads that `nearly all' Australia's timber will provide for that. People have a certain blindness when asked: what should we do? Should we replace all that we are importing or all that we are cutting down tomorrow with something which does not exist? It does not exist simply because there has not been enough foresight, planning or forward notions in industrial circles by the very people who wish to exploit our native resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I spent most of the day in areas with which Senator Archer would be familiar-Scottsdale, Branxholme, Weldborough and Myrtle Park. I spent a considerable time at Myrtle Park. I lived there some 30 years ago. Yesterday I noticed the changes in those areas as being considerable. Much of the native forest has been replaced with plantations. But only recently has there been any effort whatsoever to establish the eucalypt plantations mentioned by Senator Cook. On the ground, where timber is produced in Tasmania, we can see very little evidence of eucalypt plantation. There is not enough planning and not enough investment in the establishment of the industry's own resources. Senator Cook asked which entrepreneurs would invest billions of dollars in pulp mill projects without the security that the resource will be available in the future. That is the crux of this whole matter; that is the essence of it. That was the threat-legislation or we do not establish our industry. That is what it is all about. I ask: which entrepreneurs are prepared to back up a plan to establish industry with investment based not on the exploitation of our resources, but rather on the establishment of their own resources, on their land bought and paid for using their trees and established and nurtured with their money through their own efforts? We will then see who is serious about establishing industry. Anything short of that is exploitation of our resources; anything short of that should be condemned for what it is-greed. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984 I spent three months in New Zealand. I visited an 1890 prison farm which had been established to accommodate those who were incarcerated at Her Majesty's pleasure. The work that was to be undertaken by those unfortunate souls was planting trees. Some 94 years later I visited the area and I was surprised and pleased to find a tree that I could not identify. It was a specimen remnant left after the initial clearing, which was done in the 1940s, and the last clearing, which was done in the 1960s. A specimen or two were left, and they were Tasmanian blackwoods. Some 90 years earlier New Zealand had shown the foresight to establish a plantation of timber which we considered to be far too slow growing to provide a predictable income. </PARA>
<PARA> The other evidence of foresight in that area was the existence of Californian redwoods. They were approaching their 100th year and still had 50 or 60 years to go before they provided the fruits of investment which that country had placed in them. I see that as being foresight and planning; I see that as the sort of thing upon which we should base industry proposals. Until that occurs we will not see a real commitment from those individuals or corporations which really have the benefit of the country at heart rather than their own personal wealth. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand that a motion will be moved which alters the urgency motion. I suggest that the motion I have received consists of complicated words which hide the principle that full and complete exploitation of our forests is the right of industrial developers. Senator Archer has indicated that Senator Coulter's urgency motion may be subject to alteration. It certainly goes a long way towards achieving the establishment of the sorts of principles which I would have thought this Labor Government would have endorsed and should endorse in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is little doubt that the motion before the Senate today from Senator Coulter is motivated by the current debate on resource security legislation. In my contribution to this debate, I intend to deal with four broad areas. The first will be an overview of our Government's approach on this question of resource security; the second will be an examination of the Tasmanian approach through the Tasmanian forest industry strategy, which to a significant extent has contributed or led to this process of resource security legislation; the third area will be an examination of the motion presented to this Senate by Senator Coulter; and, fourthly, I want to highlight the disjointed approach of those opposite in their contribution to this issue generally, not just in this debate today but in the community at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As desirable as it may appear to some for society and governments to embrace a nature conservation ethic, there is a danger of over-reaction, of moving beyond that equilibrium where adequate account is taken of the wider public interest. The critical threshold question to be addressed by governments is what is a fair and reasonable balance between wood production and forest conservation. Until comparatively recently, governments had not established an adequate planning framework within which that question could be addressed and appropriate forest strategies developed. A new sectoral approach to forest policy is required if we are adequately to identify and protect the environmental and heritage values of our native forests and concurrently-I emphasise the word `concurrently'-meet the objectives of economic and social policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Commentators have invariably focused on the issue of resource security. It should be emphasised that resource security is only one part of a comprehensive, transparent and integrated approach to these issues. In spite of attempts to introduce the concept of a forest conservation and development process into the forest debate, most of the discussion is still a potent mixture of assertion, distorted claims and doomsday prophecies, such as we have seen over the last two or three days. Much of this has centred upon the little understood term `resource security', which is a fine example of just how dangerous words can be in the political debate. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate this point, many commentators have pre-emptively condemned resource security, without having had the benefit of understanding what it means, where it fits or where it comes from. They have replaced fact with assertion. The essential point that should be strongly put is that resource security is not about providing uncontrolled access to Australia's valuable forests-as the Australian Democrats would assert, for example-but about providing access for use by the forest products industry. Nor does it involve governments, particularly the Federal Government, abrogating its commitment to protect Australia's precious forest environment and heritage values. Indeed, the contrary is the case. Resource security is the final stage in a comprehensive process to identify and protect the environmental and heritage values of our forests and, importantly, to enhance employment-which is a big issue in the community at the present time and particularly an issue in the State I represent-through encouraging a secure and thriving forest products industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The process represents a new approach by the Commonwealth and State governments to better coordinate and integrate existing government policies. It is worth noting that the Commonwealth Government accepts the need to provide resource security. The issue to be resolved is whether the level of security should be based on legislation or remain at the current level of security, or lack of it, as provided for under existing non-statutory Commonwealth-State forestry agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> With that background, I am concerned to explain the quality of the environmental and heritage assessment process which will precede any secure access arrangements. Only when we can be assured that environmental and heritage values have been identified and adequately protected can we be confident in providing State governments and the industry with an appropriate and assured level of access to multiple use forests, the lifeblood of our renewable timber and paper products industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I should point out that the forest conservation and development process consists of five sequential stages, each dependent upon the satisfactory completion of the previous stage, which are as follows: stage 1, the formulation of a forestry conservation and development strategy by State governments and the forestry industry; stage 2, the integrated Commonwealth-State assessment of environmental, heritage, economic and social issues; stage 3, Commonwealth-State agreements which are to be ratified by respective governments; stage 4, Commonwealth legislation, if accepted by Cabinet, to clearly define areas of forest available for multiple uses, including wood production; and stage 5, implementation of the resource security process. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together, rather than weakening the Government's environment and heritage legislation, the elements of the process leading to legislative support for value adding investments would strengthen the integration of environmental and economic considerations by ensuring that all relevant aspects are addressed in advance of government decisions on forest use. The Australian community will realise only the benefits from properly managed and conserved forests if a secure Commonwealth and State forest conservation and development process is in place which encompasses an appropriate level of resource security. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1989-90 years Australia's trade deficit in forest products accounted for 10 per cent of our total account deficit. Australia now relies significantly on imports of forest products, and the value of forest product imports has increased by over 120 per cent since 1983-84. The industry is also Australia's second largest manufacturing industry, employing around 250,000 people in the forest, forest products, printing and allied industries. </PARA>
<PARA> If an appropriate policy framework for resource security is not provided, Australian forest product companies will continue to invest offshore. Some of Australia's largest forest product companies now derive a significant proportion of their revenue from recent offshore investment in the pulp and paper sector. Recently I visited Indonesia and, in conversation with various industry officials, including those of Austrade, it was made very clear to me that that process of investment offshore from Australia will continue and increase very rapidly unless in this country we get this debate right. This pattern can be expected to continue unless governments in Australia can restore confidence in this sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent advice from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and the Bureau of Industry Economics suggests that the macro-economic effects of increased investment in the hardwood industry are very substantial. The long term macro-economic effects of an assumed increase in investment and production in the hardwood processing sector have been analysed by the Industry Commission's Oriana model. The simulation was based on a $4.1 billion investment in the pulp and paper sector. The effects were found to be as follows: an increase in real gross domestic product of 0.4 per cent, approximately $1.5 billion per year; an increase in real wages of 0.6 per cent; and an improvement in the trade account. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, the advice also considered the effects to the year 2000 of a cessation of investment in additional capacity in hardwood processing. Frankly, that is really what the Democrats are all about-a cessation of investment in this industry to bring about its very substantial reduction in this country. The sobering effect of a cessation was found to be an increase in the value of imports, in 1988 and 1989-90 prices, of forest products, exclusive of such paper manufactures as boxes and bags, from $1.8 billion to $2.5 billion in the year 2000-an increase of 39 per cent. In addition, assuming that there is no change in the value of exports of forest products from the 1989-90 level of $0.5 billion, the value of net forest product imports is expected to increase from $1.3 billion to $2 billion in the year 2000-an increase of 54 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Those sorts of figures this nation can ill afford, given the current problems we face with our balance of payments. These statistics have an important message for this Government and for this country. There can be no doubt that the concessions for a higher level of security of resource access have had an impact on investment in the forest sectors. Security of access is, of course, only one of a number of factors that determine whether investment in modernisation, restructuring or value adding occurs. Notwithstanding the other commercial aspects of an investment proposal, unless there is certainty of resource there will be no investment in projects of any significance and particularly-and this is the next area I wish to come to-in my home State of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> In Tasmania the State Labor Government, led by Premier Michael Field, embarked on a strategy some two years ago of drawing together the various parties in the forest industry and over a period of 18 months it has produced a report known as the forest industry strategy. That strategy is a total document in terms of the problems it addresses in the forest industry. It does not just examine the problems of pulpwood and paper production; it does not just examine the issues of conservation. It has a totally integrated approach to such matters as veneer products, forest operations and the practices code, pulpwood, forest resources, conservation, wood supply agreements and the end of the concession system. </PARA>
<PARA> This point has been missed in the entire debate on resource security legislation. In Tasmania the companies, as part of this strategy, have agreed to the end of the concession system, a system under which previous governments gave enormous slabs of the forest in Tasmania to companies which, until quite recently, virtually had carte blanche in terms of the way in which they exploited those forestry concessions. The companies have agreed that this system should end but they want a firm commitment on wood supply to enable them to invest. Last but not least, there are the important people's issues such as health and safety and other industrial issues that affect people who work in the industry, and such problems are all too often forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of urgency moved by the Australian Democrats is in three parts. The first part, as Senator Cook said, is an idealistic approach and may well be something that we can work towards. But in terms of the practical parameters of what is achievable in the forest industry, paragraph (a) is frankly nonsense. That paragraph says that by the year 2000 nearly all of Australia's sawn timber requirements should be met from plantations. That is simply not attainable because factually and biologically it is an impossibility. We in Tasmania cannot possibly convert our sawn timber industry to a plantation based industry in the next 10 years. The forest simply will not grow fast enough. The reality of paragraph (a) is that it would bring the Tasmanian forest industry to a substantial grinding halt. There would be a reduction of some 50 per cent of output. Therefore, the proposal is simply not achievable. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (b) relates to the phasing out of export woodchipping of native forests by 1995. I say yes to that, and the sooner it happens the better. The only way that will happen is if we start to build some of the pulp mills that have been held back in recent years. The only way to ensure the end of the woodchipping industry in this country is to ensure that the pulp and paper mills are built. As for the time scale of 1995, if we could sit down tomorrow and reach agreement on this issue, it would still be at least another 10 years before there is a substantial reduction in our export of woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, paragraph (c) requires the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . increase value-adding in the pulp and paper industry through an import replacement strategy based on moderate scale, chlorine-free pulp mills . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The only problem with that part of the matter of urgency is that no-one wants to build moderate scale, chlorine-free pulp mills at present. In Tasmania the only proposal before the State Government is for a world scale-a large scale-integrated mill using a chlorine base for the operation of the mill. When one looks at the scientific studies-and there have been a significant number of such studies into this issue-I very much regret that we have to continue to use a chlorine base, but it is the only feasible, practical option that appears to be able to be used in this country for the next five to 10 years. Again, by proposing to adopt paragraph (c), in effect the Democrats are saying no to any new development in this area at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I close by saying that the Liberal Party's approach is little better. The Liberals do not have a policy in Tasmania. The former Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in Tasmania, Mr Groom, accepted this forest industry strategy. But when Mr Gray, who is notorious for his attitude to environmental questions, decided that that was not an appropriate way, Mr Groom resigned in disgust. </PARA>

This has resulted in an enormous drain on the financial and manpower resources of the industry. But even more importantly, the position remains exactly the same. Things have not changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite the memorandum of understanding that was signed between Mr Kerin and Mr Gray in 1986-a matter of great hope because we thought this would have had the desired effects-the Government wanted to kowtow to the greenies at later elections and so reneged on that agreement. We are still debating whether companies, willing to spend large amounts of money in the State, will have the ability to invest confidently, will have a guarantee of resources that they need for that investment. If not, once again they will walk away without spending a cent. We cannot allow this to happen. </PARA>

It is all very well for the Democrats to bring forward this motion today with its airy-fairy wording that does not mean a thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the abandonment of the mill, the Tasmanian Government pleaded with the Federal Government to come out with protective environmental guidelines which Senator Richardson felt were necessary for the building of that mill. But there was an election in the air, and Senator Richardson refused point blank to come out with any guidelines whatsoever to allow the mill to go ahead. The Democrats, of course, were terrified that they would lose support and, in conjunction with the Australian Labor Party, refused to have anything to do with the mill or to allow it to be built in Tasmania. Part of the wording of the matter of urgency refers to:</PARA>
<PARA>The need to establish a pattern of ecologically sustainable development of the forest products industry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they want ecologically sustainable development. Why did they not come out with this prior to the election?</PARA>
<PARA> If only we had had an environmentally safe pulp mill in 1988, Tasmania would have benefited by now by 2,400 additional direct and indirect jobs during that construction phase. There would have also been an additional 700 jobs on completion. I would like to quote to the Senate the promise given by the then State Government before the election:</PARA>
<PARA>The strictest environmental safeguards will apply-if the safeguards are not met the mill will not go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>Another promise was that there would be no environmental exemptions. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>The project requires both State and Federal Government environmental approval.</PARA>
<PARA>The company plans to spend $97.4 million on environmental safeguards-almost one tenth of the total cost of the development.</PARA>
<PARA>What more was needed?</PARA>
<PARA> I note the hypocrisy of Senator Cook, the Australian Democrats and Senator Sherry in standing in this place and saying, `We need downstream processing; we need value added'. Senator Cook said he would like to see woodchipping stopped from today, but we cannot do that without a pulp mill. The Government and the Democrats stopped the pulp mill and they cannot turn around now and pretend that they support the mill. It is far too late. They did it for cheap votes from the conservation group, and that is all. Let me read again from the Democrats' motion. They require the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . ensure that nearly all of Australia's sawn timber requirements are met from plantations by the year 2000;</PARA>
<PARA>Many of my colleagues have spoken about this. What is `nearly all'? Is it a majority? There is not even a Democrat in the chamber. How can they possibly ask for nearly all of our sawlogs to come from plantations in the next nine years? They are fairly dishonest because Senator Coulter said that 40 per cent of sawlogs already come from plantations. He is not talking about hardwoods; he is talking about softwoods. Indeed, that is not putting across the situation in a respectable and honest fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> The hardwoods take many years to grow-80 years for a sawlog. At the moment, Tasmanian plantations are only between five and 10 years old and yet the Democrats have asked that by the year 2000 there be no sawlogs taken from anything but plantations. The motion would not even allow logging in regrowth areas. These areas must be available. If we cannot use our regrowth forests, what are the Democrats suggesting? Are they suggesting that all the forests that have been logged for years but not turned into plantations from now on must not be touched? What rubbish it is. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to direct the attention of the Senate to a map that I have. All of the black area has already been put away. I point this out to the Democrats. It has already been put away for ever and cannot be touched. Thirty per cent of our island is locked away, not to be used at all for timber logging. Nearly a third of my island! What do the Democrats want us to do? Go back to basket weaving or the alternative lifestyle?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the change in land tenure over the last two years. Two years ago State forests and unallocated crown land in Tasmania comprised 45 per cent; in the restricted area, it comprised 16 per cent. Now, two years later in 1990, there is 25 per cent unallocated crown land in wood production areas-it has gone from 45 per cent to 25 per cent-and nine per cent in deferred forests. What have the restricted areas gone from? The restricted areas have gone from 16 per cent to 27 per cent. It is absolutely ridiculous. The Democrats' motion requires the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . phase out export woodchipping of native forests . . . </PARA>
<PARA>in another four years. They say that all woodchipping of native forests should be abandoned. Where do we get the resources from for the pulp mill we are to put up-solely from plantations? Australia needs the proposals put by Senator Archer, the ones he explained to the Senate. Let me explain to the Democrats that presently our forest industry is worth $8 billion a year. We have $2 billion dependent on imports and we badly need to increase the value of our exports, otherwise we will continue to go down the banana republic road that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) promised us a couple of years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> For heaven's sake, let the Democrats come back to reality; let them do a little bit of research; let them not be dishonest and talk about softwood only. Let them explain to their followers that softwood really cannot be used for sawlogs only; that hardwood sawlogs are required for the furniture industry, for the veneer industry, for the plywood industry and for the building industry. We need our hardwood forests and we cannot rely only on softwood timbers. They must tell the truth to their supporters and make them realise that we need the timber industry in Australia and that for our State it is essential. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tragedy of this debate today is that, if the arguments put forward by the conservation movement had been heeded 15 or so years ago when there was first the promotion of the plantation option, the timber from plantations would now be available to come on line and we would probably not have needed this urgency motion today, which I wholeheartedly support. Two overriding points need to be made clear. The first deals with the myth of jobs versus the environment and the kind of argument put forward by people like Senator Walsh-that greenies are against jobs. The second concerns the fate of our old growth forests which can never be replaced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been an overall decline in the number of jobs in the forest industry over the last two decades, a decline which has nothing to do with the greenies. This decline continues despite Senator Walsh's allegation that conservationists are middle-class trendoids living in the eastern suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne and that they do not care about blue-collar workers with limited skills and education, living in areas of high unemployment. Many of these blue-collar workers will lose their jobs in the next 20 years and would lose their jobs even if the eastern suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne were to vanish this afternoon-blasted out of existence by Senator Walsh's venom. The unemployment Senator Walsh refers to has been caused largely by automation, by changing market forces in the harsh export climate; not the big city suburban trendoids with which he has such an obsession. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook, in his speech this afternoon, also resorted to abuse by saying that Senator Coulter was ignoring serious analysis while he, of course, was calling for a dispassionate objective critique of the issue-a classic tactic when one has no substance on which to build one's own argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Before continuing, I think it is also worth referring to the ongoing campaign to save the south-eastern forests, some three hours drive from Canberra. The Canberra Times on Saturday had an excellent article on the fight for the forests by Maria Taylor outlining the economic factors that are changing the face of the forest industry, whatever measures the Government might introduce tomorrow evening. The writer also dealt with the highly critical report of the New South Wales Forestry Commission which, according to the Liberal State member for Mosman, Phillip Smiles, is one of the most damning reports the New South Wales Public Accounts Committee has brought down. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking ahead, the fact is that the majority of the Australian hardwood sawmillers are unlikely to survive the competition now emerging from New Zealand, South Africa, Brazil, Portugal and Spain, and the forest industry knows this, which is why it is making a strong bid to utilise the narrow window of opportunity available to it in the short term and why it has got to rip the guts out of the native forests before that is not a viable option for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The outcome of the rapidly increasing supply of softwoods from domestic and imported plantation sources will lead to a substantial decline in native forest sawlogging over the next 10 years on purely commercial grounds, which will have nothing to do with the push by environmentalists to preserve the old-growth forests. The National Association of Forest Industries claims that, without resource security legislation, up to $4.99 billion worth of investment in the industry will be forgone, yet Dr Robert Bain, the Director of NAFI, has clearly indicated that the passage of resource legislation would not guarantee that investment would proceed. In other words, as Mr Keating would describe it, we have the legislation that we do not need. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) has argued, the current push for resource security is, above all else, aimed at securing large volumes of woodchips from native forests for the manufacture of paper pulp. This argument was backed up by Maria Taylor in her article in the Canberra Times on Saturday. She made the point that the resource security debate to date has been unclear, because politicians and some industry lobbyists have downplayed woodchip and pulp exports and couched the appeal for resource security in terms of jobs for Australian workers and survival for small town sawmills. Her article states:</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, most of the profit now is in woodchipping. Japanese chip exporter Harris Daishowa has enjoyed extraordinary profits exceeding 20 per cent on annual sales in recent years. Analyses submitted to the Resource Assessment Commission variously translated this into after-tax shareholders' dividends of between 60-100 per cent since 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>The full page advertisements placed by NAFI in the major daily newspapers last week are a good example of the industry's approach, with the list of small towns whose future is allegedly at stake without resource guarantee legislation wanted by the industry. But, of course, the industry is not making any reciprocal guarantees to the Government, and the Government may end up having to pay compensation to the industry at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the conservation movement is, and always has been, concerned about employment. In submissions made to the Resource Assessment Commission inquiry environmental groups have argued that, in the long term, jobs can best be guaranteed through the establishment of plantation grown hardwoods, not through the logging of our irreplaceable old-growth native forests. Once the old-growth native forests have gone, they have gone for ever. With them go countless numbers of species of the animal, bird and insect world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also relevant at this point to draw the Senate's attention to an article in today's West Australian by a leading Perth scientist, Jennifer McComb of Murdoch University's school of biological and environmental sciences. She made the point at a biotechnology conference that Australia's genetic heritage in native trees could be exploited for sale to countries fighting severe land degradation problems. Here is another potential loss if we continue to log our old-growth forests at will. </PARA>
<PARA> A Saulwick poll last year indicated that 78 per cent of people asked agreed that native forests were a valuable part of our environment and should be preserved wherever possible. The ACF has pointed out that all of Australia's pulpwood supply could be met from plantations within 15 years, and most sawlog needs within 30 years. That is why Senator Coulter carefully worded his motion to say that nearly all of Australia's sawn timber requirements can be met from plantations by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> Why, then, is there this push from industry to guarantee it access to the old-growth forests? Export woodchipping is highly profitable at the moment although the situation will change within a decade, as I have already indicated. The pulp and paper industry knows that it will have to rely much more on plantation supplied resources but, in the meantime, it wants ready access to an underpriced, largely publicly subsidised, resource-our native forests. This is a classic example of why the conservation movement insists on ecologically sustainable development, looking ahead to the future, rather than going for quick profits with no long term employment prospects for workers in the industry and the decimation of what remains of our old-growth forests. </PARA>
<PARA> Those members of parliament who have bothered to read the ACF briefing paper on resource security prepared for them this month will know that the issue we are really addressing in the third part of Senator Coulter's motion is whether or not the shift to domestic value adding in the pulp and paper industry is accompanied by a transition to plantation based supply. Environmentalists know that it is no good being against something even if you are not in favour of a constructive alternative. Mahatma Gandhi, who has inspired so many of us in our non-violent resistance to save native forests, repeatedly stressed this point. </PARA>
<PARA> Our critics constantly misrepresent us, as Senator Walsh did last week in Adelaide, by making the inaccurate allegation that, every time the ACF has a political victory, more Australians lose their jobs. What absolute twaddle! Conservationists have argued time and time again for a transition strategy for the forest products industry which implements a move to a plantation based import replacement industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As the ACF briefing document put it, such an industry should rely on moderate scale pulp mills using a variety of feedstocks and extensive recycling. Where bleaching is necessary, this should be chlorine free. Discharge of organochlorin effluents into the environment should not be permitted. This is an ecologically sustainable alternative which would put the industry on a secure, long term footing and ensure protection of Australia's remaining unique native forests. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn my attention to my home State of Western Australia. This debate has particular relevance to the Western Australian forest industry where a timber strategy is in place that sets aside only 30 per cent of native forests for conservation, and guarantees the timber industry access to 70 per cent of that resource. This is hardly a balanced or sustainable approach. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the first part of Senator Coulter's proposal that most of Australia's sawn timber be met from plantations by the year 2000, Western Australia has already established pine plantations on State owned land and has introduced a pine share farming program whereby it has established a lease agreement with farmers to grow pines. However, the Government, under former Premier Dowding, made a commitment to establish a tree trust to encourage direct incentives to farmers and members of the public to develop major plantations, and the promised incentives have not been fulfilled. The State Government needs to diversify from its existing pine plantations into hardwood, which was a major thrust of the tree trust which has not reached fruition. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the phasing out of woodchipping in native forests, this has particular relevance to the jarrah and karri forests of the south west which are under threat from the forest industry and where questions have been raised, as in New South Wales, about the lack of efficiency in the industry. We urgently need to reduce the volume of forests clear felled through smaller, more efficient timber mills with better recovery rates. </PARA>
<PARA> As for pulp mills, much of the focus will be on Tasmania but the Western Australian State Government also has a proposal for a pulp mill near Bunbury which would process 1.3 million tonnes of pulp, a far greater volume than could now be sustained locally from plantations. Where they would get their resources from is a big question mark at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also siting problems with this proposal because of the scarcity of a fresh water resource in the south west and the need for large volumes of water for the processing. The organosolv process of pulp production seems to be the cleanest process in the near future. In this process timber is treated with a mix of water and alcohols to produce bleached pulp. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a group based in the Netherlands which has the cleanest process, but it is still a couple of years from commercial production. Another reason why some of the big companies want to get in, in the very short term, is that they realise that there is environmentally sound technology very near to fruition in other countries. In Germany there is a mill, but it will not be in full production until 1992. The mills in the Netherlands and Germany have the advantage of being able to use a wide variety of fibres-softwood, hardwood and plant fibres. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the Western Australian Government must see that there is great potential for regrowth of monocultures other than just pine to support a plantation pulp system. Blue gum monocultures are now being introduced, but the Government must integrate its proposals as part of a holistic farm planning strategy so that plantations can be placed on cleared farmlands and salt affected areas near water courses so that they benefit the environment in a holistic way. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in this debate both the Labor and Liberal speakers have chosen to stray away from the motion and to abuse each other because, essentially, they agree with each other. The real difference in Australian politics is now between the Laborials on one side and the Greens and Democrats on the other. This motion is an excellent example of what I am talking about. It reminds me of the eighteenth century English diarist, Hazlitt, who compared the Whigs and Tories to a couple of passenger coaches going down the same highway, splashing each other with mud but both going to the same place. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sherry rightly pointed to the resource security issue as the trigger for this debate, although I am sorry that he once again repeated the hoary old chestnut that environmentalists are against job creation, which is a nonsense. Environmentalists are very concerned about job creation, and make that a basic platform for all of their arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> Why, then, has the Government chosen to make the decision it will announce tomorrow night? We have not been privileged to hear the details of this decision, we only have the broad framework of it at the moment. This is because the Government is in a panic. There is a huge split in the Cabinet that has been well documented. The thin veneer of luke-green scratches off very easily post election, despite Senator Cook's claim to represent a green movement, which I find highly offensive. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is in a mad scramble to give a signal, no matter how high the price, to show industry that Labor really cares about jobs. If only that were the case. The public sector job cuts in rural areas do far more damage to country areas than the decline of the forest industry. Yet Labor stands by an industry which has neglected its own responsibilities to plant its own timbers. This Labor Government has happily given export licences without conditions to companies which should be having plantations established. </PARA>
<PARA> The resource security legislation is unnecessary, as Mr Keating has said; it is undesirable and it is unworkable. It is not actually going to please the timber industry all that much-apart from the environmentalists. It is economically unsound. It is ecologically disastrous. The way forward has been outlined by the conservation movement in any number of articles and speeches. It is a tragedy that the Government, in its blind panic, chooses to ignore those arguments and continues to allege that the choice is between the continued destruction of old growth forests and jobs, which is simply not true. </PARA>

No wonder that this industry is in the chaos it is. The Standing Committee of the Australian Forestry Council, in its report to the last meeting, noted this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . any company seriously considering a major forest industry development based on native forests will not proceed with that development unless resource security, and/or commercial indemnity against resource loss, is provided; and</PARA>

<PARA>Standing Committee INFORMED the Council that it was extremely concerned that unless the question of resource security for forest industries is achieved, major investments in forest industry which are essential to maximise value-adding, employment, and economic returns generally will not occur. </PARA>
<PARA>The Standing Committee noted that it is estimated that in excess of $2 billion worth of investment in forest industries, plus consequent growth in value adding processing, which could occur within the next 2 years will largely not take place unless the resource security questions are resolved between Commonwealth and State governments. </PARA>

<PARA>That situation has now been corrected by subsequent legislation. It ended up pointing to the need for guaranteed resource access, either through formal Commonwealth-State arrangements or legislative provisions, to facilitate major resource based project developments. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen here today an example of why the industry does not trust this Government. We have heard from the corner why the greenies do not trust this Government either.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to address the Commonwealth Grants Commission Report on the Interstate Distribution of General Purpose Grants for Local Government 1991. One of the problems concerning this document is that it is so large and so extensive that it is impossible for one to digest it in the short time available. Senator Short alluded to this earlier and also to the five minutes which has been allocated to speeches in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe after a cursory glance that the report is absolutely guaranteed to throw the cat among the pigeons. It examines the two basic methods of funding local government in the specific grants area. The two methods of issuing grants to local government through the States grants commissions is the per capita allocation, which is the existing situation, and fiscal equalisation, the alternative. It appears from the report that the Commonwealth Grants Commission comes down strongly on the side of fiscal equalisation. It is worth quoting some aspects of the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Treasury and the Commonwealth Office of Local Government agreed that, in principle, fiscal equalisation should be used, but that cost effectiveness should also be considered. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . only Victoria questioned the appropriateness of fiscal equalisation as the basis of future distribution of local government assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>This appeared to be somewhat of a shock to the State grants commissions because, in another part, the report says, in effect, that if under investigation it was found that fiscal equalisation approximated per capita grants it would be better to stay with per capita grants for simplicity. No-one will disagree with that, but the investigation showed that the fiscal equalisation approach was quite different in its outcome from making per capita grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The two methods used by the Commission to look at general purpose assistance showed that under the institutional per capita relativities and implied interstate distribution-one method which, I might say, the Commission rejected, or at least did not recommend-the existing allocation to Victoria, for instance, of $182.4m would drop to $40.2m; the existing allocation to New South Wales of $243.1m would drop to $74m; and for Queensland the allocation would increase from $120.4m to $293m. </PARA>
<PARA> Under table 2 on page xviii, the complementary per capita relativities and implied State distribution show that the following changes would occur. For Victoria, the existing allocation of $182.4m would drop to $90.3m, and for New South Wales the present allocation of $243.1m would drop to $81.9m. For Queensland the existing allocation of $120m would increase to $260.4m, and for Tasmania the allocation of $19m would increase to $37.4m. It is quite obvious that under fiscal equalisation, even though that method was supported by the Treasury and the department responsible for local government, the bigger States would lose out and the smaller States would gain. I could not help but notice that a lot of mathematical formulae were used which are totally unintelligible to the layman. It reminded me that Einstein on his theory of relativity said that, when the mathematicians came to prove them, he could not understand his own calculations. It is somewhat disappointing after 12 months that another study is suggested. This is a major report which is impossible to digest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission is a very complicated document-as Senator Parer has pointed out. It comes about as a result of a request on 22 March 1990 from the then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Stewart West, when he wrote to the Chairman of the Commonwealth Grants Commission stating, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the terms of reference for a review by the Commonwealth Grants Commission of inter-State distribution of local government general purpose grants. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission was asked to reply to the Government by 28 February 1991. It has done that, and I compliment the Commission on its promptness. As Senator Parer said, it has given us a 254-page, very complicated document. </PARA>
<PARA> As is pointed out in the overview of the report, the then Minister's letter specified six separate requirements for that inquiry. Senator Parer has already mentioned requirements one and two. I wish to comment on requirement five. The Grants Commission was asked to make an analysis of whether the application of the principle of fiscal equalisation is appropriate to determine the distribution of general purpose assistance for local government among the States in the future. In response, the Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe it is feasible to determine per capita relativities suitable for distributing general purpose assistance for local government . . . on an equalisation basis. </PARA>
<PARA>To a lot of local government areas, that is very good news. The Commission did say, however, that whether it is appropriate or not to adopt relativities based on fiscal equalisation is something that has to be looked at because it is not a simple question. The Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In principle, we believe it would not be appropriate to continue indefinitely an interstate distribution of general purpose assistance for local government on a basis (equal per capita) which departs so markedly from fiscal equalisation. </PARA>
<PARA>Then it goes on to say that in practice there are several different ways in which it can be done. It makes the point that the per capita basis of distribution of funds is simple and predictable, and that equalisation would be much more complex. In the second part of this recommendation-and this is interesting-the Commission says:</PARA>
<PARA>A change to an equalisation system would entail extra administrative costs for both the Commonwealth and the States . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA>A move to an equalisation basis would be very disruptive to local authorities in New South Wales and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it would be. As Senator Parer has pointed out, those States would suffer quite badly under the fiscal equalisation principles because at the present time they are being paid on a per capita basis. When I read this report-I know it is long and I have had a chance to glance only at parts of it-it is almost like the Self report of some years ago revisited. Professor Peter Self's major recommendations to the Government were that there should be some sort of fiscal equalisation for local government and that there should be factors built in that made allowances for States that were not in the position of the more populous States-those States affected by distance and all those other things that work against them. But the Government did not take that matter up and went for the per capita basis of distribution because, as it says in this report, it is simple and predictable. Now we have moved a bit further down the track and it has now asked that this inquiry be held. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of future procedures, the Commission mentions that the Commonwealth Treasury and the Commonwealth Office of Local Government agree in principle to fiscal equalisation and that cost-effectiveness should be considered. As Senator Parer has pointed out, we look like having a long, protracted further inquiry into the appropriateness of fiscal equalisation. I am sure my own State of Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland, will be looking to fiscal equalisation. Perhaps up to 10 years will be involved in looking at this. So whilst local government can take some heart from this particular paper, it will have to wait a bit longer. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the Senate to one small element of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Additional funding of $209,000 is being sought for the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA). The reason I raise this is that the explanatory notes say that the need for funds is urgent to enable the Australian Sports Drug Agency to perform its statutory functions. An estimated $209,000 is required by the ASDA to cover running costs for the first eight weeks of operation. We are also told that as legislation for the creation of the Australian Sports Drug Agency was proclaimed in January 1991, the requirement was unforeseen at the time of the Budget. That is the part that I find quite intriguing. We had a lot of rhetoric from the Government about how vital it was to have this legislation. We had the Minister who had been responsible for it trying to suggest at one stage during the appropriation debate last year that one of the reasons this organisation had not come into being was that the Opposition was dilly-dallying around with the legislation. That was total bunkum. In fact, the legislation was not ready. We had to pass a special motion here to get the legislation-at our insistence-brought into this chamber. Now we have found out that the Government had not even planned for it in the Budget. Talk about hypocrisy from the Government on a matter like this!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take Senator Short's point. It is a combination of hypocrisy and incompetence. The fact is that now, fortunately, not only is the Australian Sports Drug Agency up and going as a statutory body-thanks, I might say, to the initiative of the Opposition in forcing this legislation to be brought forward-but also the Government has done the sensible thing and appointed a former Liberal senator as Chairman of that agency, namely, my cousin, former Senator and now Professor Peter Baume. So I am pleased to say that the Sports Drug Agency is, firstly, in good hands and, secondly, it actually has some money to proceed with its activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We want to see a greater recognition of the need for the user pays principle in this area, particularly from the professional sports which are using the services. I think proper recoupment is absolutely vital, as is evident from the fact that the $209,000 will cover only the running costs for the first eight weeks of operation. This is an expensive but, nonetheless, very worthwhile activity. I repeat, the Opposition has every reason to be astounded that the Government did not include the Australian Sports Drug Agency in its Budget preparation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment briefly on the Advance to the Minister for Finance involving additional funds through the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories account for the Antarctic Division. I note with some alarm that the Division is seeking urgent funds for the 1991 financial year amounting to some $700,000. As the total budget for that Division is around $16m, nearly $750,000 is quite significant. At the moment it is asking for $90,000 plus an urgent issue of $394,000, a total of something like $484,000. The only excuse that appears in this document is that it is to meet a substantial increase in the price of bunkering fuel which was unforeseen at the time of the preparation of the Budget. In addition, there were contractual arrangements for the MV Icebird, with a further payment being due there. Obviously, when the Division was doing its budget it did not realise the extra cost of the MV Icebird.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Baume asked earlier, `Why do they need so much money for extra bunkering fuel?' He made the point that if they keep spilling oil they need to buy extra. I remind the Senate that in the past 12 months there have been two major oil spills in the Antarctic. I suppose it is fair to say that some of the extra funding is to replace fuel lost in those two unfortunate accidents. I have mentioned this matter before in this chamber. The first time it happened we were told it would never happen again and that things would be put in place. The second oil spill a few months ago involved quite a few hundred thousand litres and we still have not had any reports or answers to questions about why that happened. I believe the Division has said that it will not happen again. One would hope we do not have any more oil spills in the Antarctic, or we will be back here again next year voting the Division extra funds to meet the increased cost of bunkering fuel because there is a lack of it in Antarctica. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make a few remarks regarding this report. The report itself is most informative. Its format includes an introduction and pretty good explanations of the meaning of dumping and subsidisation, injurious dumping, the anti-dumping and countervailing action that might be taken, and so on. Since it does that, it should be of some assistance to the growing number of people who are concerned about the welfare of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The report itself takes pains to express this in language which is simple and straightforward. Some might call it plain English. I found the report most interesting and easy to read and, because it was, I managed to cover it in the few minutes made available to us to consider it before it was brought on for discussion. Page six of the report has a very good explanation of the path to be taken when somebody wants to make a claim that products had been dumped on the Australian market. It occurred to me, in following that path, that it was long and tortuous. Although it was explained well, it is a path which takes a long time to resolve. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told on page 6 that Customs must by law reach a prima facie decision within 55 days of the receipt of an application to consider whether dumping has taken place. If, after that prima facie decision, it finds that dumping seems to be taking place, Customs will undertake an investigation which must be concluded within 120 days. After that decision has been made the Authority allows 40 days for submissions to be made to it, and then later a report, by law, must be sent to the Minister within 120 days after the receipt of reference from Customs. During that entire process it is possible that provisional anti-dumping measures may be put in place. However, a lot of the responsibility to make representations to the Authority still lies on industry and it is the industry which would find that process long, involved and, most of all, costly. </PARA>
<PARA> The report refers to one of the infamous cases of a dumping claim. It was report No. 16, dated January 1990, which followed the trail of cement clinker from Saudi Arabia. On page 14 of this report the story begins in September 1988 but it is not until a report in January 1990 that there is a conclusion which, by the way, suggested that the clinker from Saudi Arabia had not caused and was not threatening any material injury to the Australian industry. It is that very material injury and the definition of the same words which create a problem for many people who wish to make a claim about dumping. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 3 of the introduction the report highlights the fact that these words need definition and, in fact, in appendix 1 a definition is given. It is that definition which is difficult for people to understand. I think that is one of the reasons, for example, why Senator Boswell moved to have the anti-dumping measures available referred to a committee. I hope that the committee will be able to expound upon the problems we have with dumping because many Australian industries really do not need the extra problems associated with competing with overseas industries that might have an unfair advantage over them. I hope that committee takes note of the sort of information provided by this annual report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the report be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the eleventh report of the Committee concerning a matter raised by a person under Privilege Resolution 5 of 25 February 1988. On 11 December 1990, the President, Senator the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, referred to the Committee a letter from Sir William Keys, relating to remarks made by Senator Newman on 5 December 1990 in the Senate during debate on a motion to take note of an earlier report of the Committee recommending that a response by Sir William be incorporated in Hansard under Privilege Resolution 5. The Committee, having considered the letter and other correspondence, recommends that a further response agreed to by Sir William and the Committee be incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA> The response read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>RESPONSE BY SIR WILLIAM KEYS AGREED TO BY SIR WILLIAM KEYS AND THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5 (7) (B) OF THE SENATE OF 25 FEBRUARY 1988</PARA>
<PARA>In the Senate on 5 December Senator Newman further discussed matters relating to me, and I again ask that I make a response under Resolution 5. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me first deal with the visit to defence establishments in Northern Queensland in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>For many years the RSL had complained to successive governments about Australia's weak northern defences, so when I received an invitation from Minister for Defence, Kim Beazley, to visit some of these new and improved facilities, I accepted, realising the time spent with the Minister would also give me the opportunity to canvass thoroughly matters affecting conditions of service in the case the League had put to the Government. We visited installations at and near Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently, I flew with the Minister and senior Air Force personnel to Weipa to visit the site of the new airbase. All in all, a very helpful programme which would allow the RSL to make more informed and helpful comments about Defence arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Newman was in Townsville at the same time, where she was promoting the concept that funds should be transferred from the Defence re-equipment programme to Defence conditions of service. The media asked me to comment. I said that many conditions of service were in need of upgrading, expressly emphasising the need for coverage for Defence personnel under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, Turbulence Allowance, Housing and entitlements to the Defence Service Homes Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>However, I went on to say that to transfer funds from equipment to personnel would not be wise, especially having regard to the long lead-time required to purchase the sophisticated and high-technology equipment we were acquiring. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say that in my view what was required was a consumption tax of one kind or another to fund an adequate Defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal was quickly rejected by the Prime Minister. It is interesting to note that Senator Newman's party has now adopted a very similar proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me now go on to Senator Newman's suggestion that I had not, over the years, effectively served well the interests of veterans and dependants in my negotiations with successive governments. </PARA>
<PARA>The record of my work over 45 years provides an effective response to this. Because I believe it is essential to successful representation, I made a point of developing good working relations with all Prime Ministers and Ministers for Repatriation and Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>I have received supportive testimony from Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Liberal Minister for Repatriation in the Fraser Government, Tony Messner. If needed, I am certain I can obtain similar support from Prime Ministers and Ministers for Repatriation and Veterans' Affairs who were in office over the years, from both sides of Parliament. Indeed, I obtained benefits from Senator Newman's husband when he was briefly Minister for Repatriation. Also added to that can be the testimony of Sir Arthur Lee and Sir William Hall who were the National Presidents during my 17 years as National Secretary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on this new response by Sir William Keys as tabled in the report of the Committee of Privileges. In the brief moment I have had to read Sir William's response, I notice there is a critical matter of fact which is missing from it. I would like to make sure it is in the record so it can be read in conjunction with his response. Sir William says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For many years the RSL had complained to successive governments about Australia's weak northern defences, so when I received an invitation from Minister for Defence, Kim Beazley, to visit some of these new and improved facilities, I accepted, realising the time spent with the Minister would also give me the opportunity to canvass thoroughly matters affecting conditions of service in the case the League had put to the Government. We visited installations at and near Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, I flew with the Minister and senior Air Force personnel to Weipa to visit the site of the new airbase. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman was in Townsville at the same time, where she was promoting the concept that funds should be transferred from the Defence reequipment programme to Defence conditions of service. </PARA>
<PARA>That, in fact, is not correct. I believe that the Opposition's policy was misrepresented-maybe innocently; I do not know-by Sir William. He claimed that the Opposition was planning to welsh on contracts for the capital equipment program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition was saying that the moneys expended on recruiting and training Defence personnel were being wasted because many of them were leaving in a very short time and that it was possible to make considerable savings in the Defence budget, to be applied to improving the conditions of service of Defence personnel so that they could be retained in the Service. That was the basis of our argument; that was certainly the basis of my argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir William has not said in his response that when he was travelling in the jet of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-I am not sure whether it was the jet of the Prime Minister or the jet of the then Minister for Defence; it does not seem to matter much for the sake of my response now-travel was being undertaken during the middle of an election campaign. In fact, I heard Sir William's interviews on Townsville radio when I was also in Townsville assisting local candidates. During my visit I visited Defence personnel and their families who were living in very poor housing and suffering very poor conditions of service, such that some of them were eligible for welfare benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir William was travelling with the then Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister during the middle of an election campaign. So the statements which Sir William made supporting the Government's defence policy and pouring scorn, as I saw it, on the Opposition's defence policy had to be taken in the context that this was the national President of the Returned Services League (RSL) travelling during the election campaign with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence and making party partisan statements in relation to defence policies. It was in that context that I wrote my subsequent letters to him. I am sad that this situation has arisen. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, I draw the attention of honourable senators to a report which I have been able to locate at short notice in the Australian Financial Review dated 25 June 1987. I will quote briefly from that report. The first two paragraphs read:</PARA>
<PARA> Sir William Keys, the leader of one of the most conservative groups in Australia, yesterday gave tacit support to Labor's defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA> And at the same time, the RSL chief expressed reservations about aspects of the Liberals' defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA>In subsequent paragraphs, Louise Dodson reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Sir William came along in the VIP plane with Mr Hawke and the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, to underline Labor's commitment to defence. </PARA>
<PARA> From Sir William's point of view, it was an opportunity for some handy lobbying on defence issues. </PARA>
<PARA>I pointed out to Sir William in my subsequent correspondence with him that, as the head of a national body such as the RSL, it was inappropriate to be seen to be party politicking in the middle of an election campaign. That was the basis on which my regrets and concerns about his involvement in this whole question were based. </PARA>

<PARA>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend section 50, the mergers and acquisitions provision of the Trade Practices Act, to overcome an omission which has become apparent in the coverage of the provision, and to make several other improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 50 prohibits acquisitions of shares or assets which result in a corporation either obtaining, or substantially strengthening, a position of dominance in a substantial market in Australia. In determining whether a position of dominance or strengthened dominance would result, the section permits the aggregation of market shares of companies that are related to or associated with the acquiring corporation. The section defines an associated body corporate in terms of one body corporate being in a position to exert a substantial degree of influence over another. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission Professor Baxt expressed concerns that an aspect of the judgment in Trade Practices Commission v Australian Iron and Steel and Ors-the New Zealand Steel case-disclosed a deficiency in the merger provision. The case itself was settled, but in the course of a judgment on some aspects of the case, the Court expressed its views on the meaning of the words ``directly or indirectly'' in s.50 (1). This sub-section prohibits a corporation from directly or indirectly acquiring shares or assets in a body corporate if a position of dominance would result. </PARA>
<PARA> The Court interpreted the word `indirectly' as applying only to a situation where an acquisition was made by another entity as agent for the corporation. In other words it would not be an indirect acquisition by the corporation where a subsidiary or associated company acquired assets or shares in a target company in circumstances where it could not be said it was acting as agent for its controlling company. Accepting this interpretation, the question then is what action, if any, could be taken under s.50 to prevent an acquisition which might be structured through a subsidiary or an associated company. Where the subsidiary or associated acquiring company is itself a trading, financial or foreign corporation, action can be taken directly against it, with the market positions of all associated and related companies, including the holding or controlling company, taken into account in determining dominance. However where the acquisition is by a body corporate that is not a corporation action cannot be taken against it using the aggregation provisions. The insertion of the new s.50 (1aa) will plug this gap. There have been comments that the practical significance of the new provision would be very limited. The Government's attitude is that while the gap remains it could be taken advantage of, and that it has an obligation to ensure that this cannot happen.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is taking the opportunity to put forward some other amendments to the section to improve its internal consistency. An infringement takes place where as a result of an acquisition the relevant acquirer would be or would be likely to be in a position of dominance or strengthened dominance. However the concept of likely effect is not consistently applied in the section and the amendments will remedy this. Also the section is not consistent in its reference to associated companies and again the Bill addresses this. In particular the proposed amendment to the aggregation provisions of subsection 50 (2) is designed to ensure that, in determining whether an acquisition is likely to result in a position of dominance, account can be taken of the aggregated market shares of the acquirer and its related and associated bodies corporate. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some comments that these other amendments are unnecessary and could cause confusion. The Government notes that there is room for argument whether some of the amendments are strictly necessary, but it has acted following advice that it was desirable to clarify the meaning of certain expressions. It has taken the view that the better course is to avoid the possibility of any future dispute as to meaning. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Government believes these amendments will ensure that Australian competition law as embodied in the Trade Practices Act continues to be effective, and that any window of opportunity available to exploit any weakness in the Act is firmly closed. The Bill is expressed to come into operation from 21 December 1990, the date of its introduction into the House of Representatives. It is considered appropriate that some retrospective effect be given to the measure, to ensure that advantage is not taken of the gap I have mentioned before the Bill becomes law. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other things, that Act provides for the Higher Education Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training to report to Parliament on the operation of educational profiles and the impact of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. Educational profiles are a mechanism designed to balance the freedom of institutions to manage their own affairs with the need for public accountability. They represent agreements negotiated annually between the Commonwealth and higher education institutions, defining an institution's broad mission together with its teaching and research responsibilities, and establishing its particular areas of activity and specified goals as the basis on which institutions receive Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Higher Education Contribution Scheme, which came into operation in 1989, requires students and graduates to make a contribution towards some of the costs of the provision of their studies. At the time of the Scheme's inception, a provision was inserted in the Employment, Education and Training Act requiring the Higher Education Council, in February and August of each year, to report to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, and thence to the Minister and Parliament, on the operation of the Scheme and its effects on access to higher education, and the level and quality of post-graduate research. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends that provision by requiring the Council to report only once each year, in March. The need for this amendment is straightforward. Late in 1990, the Board reported that the Council has experienced practical difficulties in reporting in a substantive way in August. At that time of the year, no firm data relating to higher education student enrolments in the current year is available, and the educational profiles discussions with institutions are not undertaken until later in the calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Board proposed that the Council need only report once in each year, both on profiles processes and the impact of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. March was recommended as the most appropriate month. By that time, final student enrolment data can be comprehensively analysed and the Council is in a position to comment substantively on the recently concluded profiles negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Employment, Education and Training Act also provides for the Minister to appoint acting members of the Board and its constituent Councils for a period of up to twelve months in the event of a temporary vacancy. The intent of the Act was to provide for the circumstance where it is necessary for the Minister to appoint an acting member of a constituent Council who is also a member of the Board. Under the legislation as it currently stands, this option is not available to the Minister in all circumstances. The amendments are designed to remedy this deficiency and have no substantive policy or other implications. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

The major amendments relate to borrowings of the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory governments-and Senator Parer will deal with that shortly-to the control of the National Library land and buildings and to moneys payable to the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service from leases, licences, permits and other authorities, among other matters affecting the Australian Sports Commission Act, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act and the National Library Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition will not be opposing these amendments, but we should point out at the beginning that this, in effect, will be the start of a whole host of Bills which, in one way or another, will correct the mountain of legislative mistakes that emerged last year as a result of the Government ramming legislation through the House of Representatives which, of course, as every honourable senator knows, had a record low number of sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation was rammed through the House of Representatives without proper consideration. Then, having been starved of legislation for the first part of the Budget sittings, the Senate was inundated with a mountain of legislation. That means, of course, that we stayed here until 21 December, trying to correct the mistakes that this Government's incompetence had generated in that mountain of legislation. We are going to see now a whole host of Bills correcting mistakes. Included in this omnibus Bill is such a mistake correction exercise. Fear not; we will have plenty more to come. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal first of all with the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. The amendment here will allow any money collected by the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service from leases, licence permits and other authorities to be used by the Service in its conservation role. The Opposition is quite happy with that proposal. Mr Dobie said in another place:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . since 1985, when the government parties set up the Australian Wildlife Fund, a non-profit company, it has helped to raise funds for the service to assist koala research and support research into endangered species. It is hoped on this side of the House that the Australian Wildlife Fund will continue its work in providing funds for research projects . . . this amendment may also provide further funding for similar research by the ANPWS. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dobie pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . no mention has been made of who will be appointed to the board of governors and whether they will be appointed without financial reward, as is the case with the Australian Wildlife Fund Ltd. This is a remarkable omission by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), as Mr Dobie said, has had a lead from the annual report of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the previous year, which, under the heading `Australian Wildlife Fund Limited', states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Wildlife Fund Limited . . . is a non-profit company set up in 1985 to raise funds for research projects of the ANPWS. The AWF has a board of Governors who are prominent in business, community service or broadcasting and contribute their time to the Fund without financial reward. </PARA>
<PARA>In winding up the second reading debate, the Minister in the other place said that these remarks would be noted. We are still waiting for them to be conveyed to us up here, and I think some action should be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I would like to raise about the National Parks and Wildlife Service amendment is one raised by Mr Webster in the other place. He pointed out that in many instances a shortage of funding has been the excuse for governmental bodies, not only Federal but also State, failing to take appropriate hazard limitation work-in other words, burning off-in appropriate times of the season in government wildlife areas to prevent bushfire disasters. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some people who are very concerned about this. I remember an article in the Sydney Daily Telegraph a few years ago which was headed `Politicians and ``greenies'' mean more Ash Wednesdays'. The concern clearly is that, unless there is effective work to get rid of the fire hazard in the national parks-and that does involve some burning off at appropriate times of rubbish that is collected-there will always be the prospect of disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> I do hope that some of the funds raised as a result of this amendment will go towards both research into this problem and, as a result of that, appropriate methods of convincing some extreme greenies-I think all of us are greenies to an extent-that there is benefit to the ecology of these areas in preventive work being done to ensure that we do not suffer devastating bushfires. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to move to the Australian Sports Commission amendment, whereby paragraph 48 of the Act is to be amended by the insertion of a subparagraph which will bring reports on the financial transactions of the Australian Sports Foundation under the reporting requirements of the Audit Act 1901. The Sports Commission had previously provided this information voluntarily in its annual report. The inclusion of this subsection follows a request from the National Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I expressed some concern about the delay that the Government is allowing, or in fact imposing, on the presentation of the Australian Sports Commission annual report to this Parliament. One of the requirements of good reporting is not simply that a report should be made, but that it should be made in a timely fashion. As I noted at that time, the Auditor-General had concluded his audit investigation by, I think, December of last year and had signed the audit certificate on 18 December 1990. We did not get it here until this month, March. As I noted at the time, Mr Harris, the Chairman of the Australian Sports Commission, had not put a date on his covering letter to the Hon. Ros Kelly, the Minister, so we do not know whether the delay was in the Minister's office or in the Australian Sports Commission. Wherever it was, they could smarten up their act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Sports Drug Agency Act is being amended with minor alterations to correct drafting errors in the original Bill, but the meaning and application of the Act are not being altered. As I said, this is going to be one of the many correcting pieces of legislation, fixing up Bills which were rushed through this place and which have now become Acts with errors. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be, of course, that the Government had not expected the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act to come in a timely way before the Senate, particularly when it was accusing the Opposition of having delayed it, which of course we did not. As a result, the Government had not prepared itself properly, and we saw a few minutes ago in the Advance to the Minister for Finance that no provision had been made for funding for the Australian Sports Drug Agency, and we have had to provide $280,000 to enable it to proceed. We have no objection whatsoever to this Act being corrected; we only wish the Government could get it right first time. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Library Act has a series of alterations which are of a minor technical nature, but there are some other sections that are being amended to bring the Act up to date. Section 7a, for example, will allow the Library to purchase and dispose of assets and to enter into contracts to a value of $250,000 without the need to obtain the approval of the Minister. This increases it from the previous value of $50,000, which had remained unchanged for 18 years. Under Labor governments inflation does seem to get out of control, and I presume that there is no alternative but to change such limits as existed in this Act to cope with Labor governments' incompetence in the area of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Sections 15 and 17e are being amended and a new section 15a is being added to remove the requirement that the Governor-General notify in the Gazette the vacation of office and resignation of members of the Council and of the Director-General of the Library. This is not a practice with other statutory authorities. In this context, I should say that we would have liked to move amendments to this Act and to the other Acts mentioned, removing the ageist bias that this Government continues to impose on council bodies like these. </PARA>
<PARA> We have on the Notice Paper a Bill that I have introduced in the Senate to get rid of the age limitation of 65 years that affects those serving on the councils of such bodies. At the moment the Government has a requirement that people over 65 cannot be members of such councils. The Bill that I have before the Senate relates specifically to the Australian National Maritime Museum. When the Maritime Museum Bill was before the Senate we failed in our attempts to get the Australian Democrats to support us to get rid of the age limitation, which in the case of the Maritime Museum is farcical. Some of the best people one would want on that council would be, for example, retired mariners, who may well to be over 65. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard from the Government consistently that it is looking into the matter. One could call this a mirror image Government; it prefers to look into matters rather than do anything about them. I am very disappointed that the Australian Democrats are prepared to take the Government at face value and not to keep getting rid of this ageist limitation every time it comes up. The Government's defence on this matter is that it relates to Comcare, and that Comcare is not capable of dealing with people who are over the age of 65 if they break a leg or suffer some other injury in their employment as a member of such a commission or council. Of course, that is total bunkum because the Audit Act provides for act of grace payments for exactly this sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all well aware of the fact that there are some bodies-and I recall that the National Museum is one of them-which have serving on them people who are over the age of 65. Certainly the Australian National Gallery has the capacity to have among its members people over 65. For example, until very recently Gough Whitlam was Chairman of the Australian National Gallery, even though he was well over the age of 65. I did not see the Government turning blue or the walls falling in or any other disaster taking place, except that Mr Whitlam kept attacking the Government for its incompetent handling of the National Gallery. That may have been the reason why the Government has taken the view that perhaps people over 65 should not be allowed on these boards because they may be inclined to speak their minds and attack the Government. In any event it is in our view improper that people over 65 should be excluded from membership of such bodies, particularly when there is plenty that they could contribute from their detailed experience in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 21 will make provision for parts of the Audit Act to apply to the National Library to allow the Library to invest money which is held other than in trust and which is not immediately required to be invested with an approved bank, in Commonwealth securities or in any other manner approved in writing by the Treasurer. A further provision also allows regulations to be made for the supply of liquor on Library premises and will allow the Library to operate its catering facilities on a more commercial basis. Similar provisions apply in the National Gallery Act, the National Museum Act and the Australian National Maritime Museum Act. We strongly support the attempts by these bodies to raise what money they can from acting in a commercial and sensible way. I just hope that those bodies that manage to keep getting revenue are not penalised by the Government for their initiative, as is so often the case, and the amount raised in such activities taken off the amount of core funding that they should be getting. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 27b extends regulatory powers to control the movement of persons on Library land and buildings and will allow regulations to be made to prevent trespass to restricted areas. This also brings it into line with the other organisations of which I have just spoken. The final amendment to the National Library Act is to increase the maximum penalty for offences against the regulations from $100 to $500 and remove the reference to a prison sentence of up to three months. This also is in line with the others. </PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service amendments, there is real concern in the populace at large about the extent to which the forests which are within the Service's responsibilities in declared heritage areas are somehow excluded from any other use. There seems to be a total misconception in the public mind, I think generated largely by the heated nature of debate on this subject. The recent report of the Australian Forestry Council, which I mentioned earlier today, noted:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the misconception generally held within the community, that the Commonwealth National Estate listings are equivalent to a land tenure status . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It noted:</PARA>
<PARA>the desirability for formal procedures for consultation with State Governments regarding implications of listing areas on the National Estate Register, and . . . the need for a rational and scientifically based approach to listing National Estate areas including clearly defined criteria; and</PARA>
<PARA>the need for guaranteed resource access either through formal Commonwealth/State arrangements or legislative provisions to facilitate major resource based project developments. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the standard and status of the National Parks and Wildlife Service control and care of these areas have always been very high within the financial limitations imposed and the concerns that many people have about adequate bushfire control and firefighting. There seems to be a real need across this whole area for a much clearer understanding of the implications of Government actions. I guess that it will take more than amendments to this legislation to do it. It will need a committed and dedicated approach by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would say that the Opposition has no objections to these amendments and it wishes them well, but we point out that when one legislates in haste, as this Government has done, corrections at great length will follow. This Bill encompasses some of those corrections, of which we shall see many more later this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill. This is an omnibus Bill which amends six Acts and repeals one. The aspects of the Bill that relate to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) are those which I will address in this debate. As a consequence of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 a number of housekeeping pieces of amending legislation have been introduced as the Territory moves to fuller autonomy. In this instance there are two aspects which affect the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, section 73 of the self-government Act provides for the remuneration of members to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal or enactment of the Legislative Assembly. There is currently a Tribunal determination in force and I understand there is conflicting legal advice as to whether the enactment could be made. Section 14 provides that a member vacates his or her office if the member:</PARA>
<PARA>takes, or agrees to take, directly or indirectly, any remuneration, allowance, honorarium or reward for services rendered in the Assembly otherwise than under section 73. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the conflicting legal advice in relation to those two sections, as well as the risk to members who may receive what could be un authorised benefits, the Opposition supports this amendment. The amendment to section 14 of the Act will entitle members of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly to legislate to establish a superannuation scheme for its members and their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in so far as the legislation affects the Australian Capital Territory, repeal of the various borrowing provisions in the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 is a result of last year's Loan Council decision that the States and Territories will gradually assume full responsibility for raising and servicing their own debt. The repeal will not affect the Commonwealth's power under other legislation, current or future, to guarantee Territory borrowings-either the ACT or the Northern Territory-for special reasons, nor limit the borrowing powers of the Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will remove standing provisions in the self-government Act which require the ACT Government and its statutory authorities to obtain the Commonwealth Treasurer's approval for borrowings which will also no longer be guaranteed. The definition of `borrowing' in sections 3, 61, 62 and 63 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act will be repealed with effect from 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the amendments as they affect the Northern Territory. This amendment, as indicated by the Northern Territory Government, will produce a financial disadvantage to that Territory in that it will increase the borrowing cost to the Territory through the withdrawal of the Commonwealth guarantee. While the amendment will no longer require the Territory to seek the Federal Treasurer's approval for its borrowings, it reduces the attractiveness of Territory bonds due to the loss of that guarantee. To date, the Territory has found it easier to market its bonds due to the Commonwealth guarantee as most investors are willing to pay a premium for such a guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA> The cost to the Territory will be quite significant, and an example can be seen through Telecom bonds. In February, Telecom non-guaranteed bonds were being issued at some 70 to 75 basic points, or 0.7 per cent, above the Telecom guaranteed stock. Such an increase in the Territory's cost of borrowing would add some $15m to $18m in total over the next five years. On the other hand, there is absolutely no cost to the Commonwealth in providing this guarantee. The Commonwealth's argument in withdrawing the guarantee is that it wishes to treat the Territory on a State-like basis. The Territory has advised that it would agree to this approach if other areas currently under the Commonwealth powers would also be transferred to the Territory as a matter of consistency; for example, uranium royalties, land rights and so on. As indicated earlier in this debate, the coalition will not oppose these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senators Baume and Parer for their contributions to this debate to which I will respond briefly. The Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill is probably most easily described as a modernisation Bill or a Bill to bring up to date various pieces of legislation under the auspices of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. This omnibus legislation will tidy up a lot of those pieces of legislation and will bring some up to date and, in fact, will repeal an out of date Act. Of course, I am particularly interested, wearing my constituency hat, in its implications for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), but they are, of themselves, not new. As Senator Parer said, they are the implementation of previous Loan Council decisions and their application to the ACT and the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the sports area and the National Library of Australia and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service: broadly described, the Bill is just bringing these organisations into line with modern public sector financial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the support for the Bill and it would be a waste of the Parliament's time to reiterate those matters in which we are in agreement. But there are two matters which Senator Baume raised to which I feel the need briefly to respond. </PARA>
<PARA> He referred to the omission from the explanatory memorandum of material about a company called Australian Wildlife Fund Ltd. I know very little about that particular company, but I am advised that this company is not referred to in the explanatory memorandum, for the simple reason that this Bill does not deal with that body. It deals with the finances of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and money will be paid into a fund called the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Fund. But we need to distinguish that from a separate company entitled the Australian Wildlife Fund Ltd. The two are distinct and this Bill does not relate to the affairs of the Australian Wildlife Fund Ltd, as I am advised. Therefore, appropriately, it is not covered in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard that part of Senator Baume's contribution. I did not hear his reference to the question of age discrimination as it relates to the National Library, but I have heard Senator Baume speak on this before in other similar matters. We had a debate on a similar issue concerning the National Maritime Museum. The Government is, as he knows and as the Senate has been informed, examining this whole issue of age discrimination. It is very important. We do not wish to do it on an ad hoc basis; we are approaching it in as comprehensive manner as we can. Just to make it clear, there is-as I am advised-no age limit applying to members of the Council of the National Library. The age limit applies only to the Director-General and he is, of course, a full time salaried executive. The same arrangements apply to him as to other Commonwealth officers, and any change which takes place to age limits would be part of a comprehensive Commonwealth approach to change all such arrangements. So with those few remarks, I thank the senators for their support for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Immigration (Education) Amendment Bill 1991 is only four pages long and comes with an equally small explanatory memorandum and a one-page second reading speech by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). It is to this Bill that the Senate now gives its attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The explanatory memorandum that I referred to does not enlighten us in any detail as to the policy decisions that have generated the Bill. In fact, we are not much enlightened by the Minister's speech. We are certainly not enlightened by the background mess that the Government has placed the Chinese student program in, out of which this matter arises. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, there is no admission so far by the Australian Government of the shambles that it has got Australia into in terms of our education institutions and the up to 20,000 Chinese citizens who are currently residing in this country. In the past two years some 5,000 of them-that is, a quarter of the number that was here in June 1989 when the Beijing massacre occurred, to which we had a Government response in this country-have, in fact, returned so there are about 15,000 remaining under the provisions of the decisions made at the time. In the original decision in July 1989 that extended the ability for these students to stay in this country, and in subsequent decisions, the Australian Government-the Australian Labor Party-has really created one shamble after another. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Opposition does not oppose this Bill on account of that dreadful track record by the Australian Government in managing this matter. We believe that it is reasonable and acceptable to extend benefits to this group, to whom the right of extended residence in this country has been given at least until June 1993. It would be unfair and unreasonable to deny the benefits of access to the English language adult program that this Bill now gives to these Chinese students and other Chinese citizens in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we remain highly critical of the Australian Government's conduct throughout the past two years, we think it is fair and reasonable, given that these 15,000 people are here with extended permanent residence in this country, that they have access to a program which will give them education in English and skills which they will need to take up the work opportunities that have now been extended to them. Let me make the Opposition's position clear: we do not accept the Government's policy decisions; we are critical of the Government's conduct of this matter; but we do accept this Bill as a benefit to the Chinese citizens who are residing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate needs to focus on the mistakes of judgment by this Government, particularly by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I single out the Prime Minister not because he is the leading member of the Government-in fact, I have not singled out the Prime Minister for many months now-but because I believe that in the pattern of decisions that were made, particularly in July 1989, the Prime Minister himself ambushed his Government and over-promised what ought to be done. Much of the shambles that I referred to really lies at the Prime Minister's own feet. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the establishment of this category of people as having extended residence until 30 June 1993, it is reasonable that they have access to the English language and citizenship programs provided under the Immigration (Education) Act 1971. Thus, it is this Act that we are now seeking to amend by this Government Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the history of this matter. There has been a series of ad hoc and unthought-out decisions concerning the People's Republic of China nationals in this country. On 6 June 1989 the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, announced the extension of temporary entry permits for Chinese nationals until the end of the next month-obviously a very temporary initial measure. This was followed by a 16 June announcement-10 days later-that the visas would be extended until 31 July 1990. That is an extension of about 13 months. Here in this chamber on 6 June, Senator Ray, the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, said-and these are his exact words:</PARA>
<PARA>Applications will not be determined on the basis of a class of people, but on individual merits. They will be considered on the basis of individual claims. </PARA>
<PARA>Those were the words in the undertaking given initially by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> However, whilst the Opposition supported those words that were initially given-and that remains our policy in this matter-the Government itself departed dramatically from those words in the few days that followed and that departure was, I believe, mostly the responsibility of the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. It is a pity that the Government did not stick to the approach that Senator Ray had initially outlined. I believe that the Prime Minister would have been well advised to adhere to it but, instead, he announced in 1990 the creation of this special category for People's Republic of China nationals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has never been renowned for good judgment when it comes to matters of policy detail and, in this instance, he hijacked the policy processes of his own Government. I just speculate-and I am sure Senator Olsen, as a person who has taken a close interest in immigration matters, would speculate-what the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Ray, would have felt when he had given such an announcement and then the Prime Minister, over his head, announced a sweeping, en masse decision that, I suspect, did not have the support of that Minister. I say advisedly that the Prime Minister hijacked the Government's decisions. We all recall the way in which he left Ministers out of the decision making and let them scramble to catch up after he had made his announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision that was eventually announced gave the 19,400 Chinese nationals in Australia before 20 June 1989 permits for temporary residence until 30 June 1993. This approach has been criticised by the Opposition ever since. We do not support the distortion of Australia's immigration program that the creation of this special category causes. Our policy is that each application should be considered on a case by case basis. We believe that there should be individual applications, or family applications where appropriate, and that those applications should go through due process and be considered on their merits case by case. It is not the Opposition's policy to force back any citizen of any country to an intolerable persecution in his home country. We share that with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not seek to let any individuals currently residing in Australia-whether students from China or any other country-go back to a situation where they do not have protection. In fact, we want international standards in human rights established in every country. That would be the surest guarantee that there would not be any unfair or intolerable persecution of individuals. But that general case still has to be demonstrated. I am sure that is what was in the Government's mind when it set the four-year period, mostly to be outworked through the effluxion of time. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that it was even the Prime Minister's consideration that by June 1993 there would be such a settling down of the great trauma arising from the massacre in Beijing in June 1989 that a great proportion of these 19,400 citizens of China would voluntarily and with an open conscience return to their own country. But that is not actually the policy that the Government has announced. It has not announced a case by case approach. It has announced an en masse extension of four years for a particular group from a particular country. To do that it needed to override immigration law and immigration regulations in this country. That overriding damages the integrity of the immigration program. It damages the public's perception of the integrity of that program. </PARA>
<PARA> When there are one million applications per year for permanent residence in this country, of course we have a filtering system, a selection process. Only 120,000 are eventually invited to take up permanent residence in this country. That is the immigration process. It is based on immigration law and immigration regulations. We want to give signals to the rest of the world, especially to those one million each year who apply to us, and all their families and sponsors and all those associated with them in this country, that we have a fair, objective, open, reliable immigration process. Then they see 19,400 people jump to the head of the queue and given an en masse promise to expect something very close to permanent residence-on the decision of our Prime Minister, overriding the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, who was very sensible. I say `sensible' because he had demonstrated a track record for being sensible and because the task that he had, being the seventh immigration Minister in the Hawke Government, was to bring back some public confidence to immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> It was following the FitzGerald inquiry that it became transparent, if not in various tumults about Australia, that there was a need for public confidence in immigration. The surest way of gaining it was to demonstrate a reliable, fair, open, objective immigration process. When there is an upset to that reliability by this kind of decision, the integrity of the program is thrown to the four winds. That situation still is the case today. There has not been any recovery. There is still that damage done to public confidence in immigration. It is not sufficient for the Government to say that it can do all this and make all these exceptions purely on the basis of the human rights situation in China. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not time in this debate to give an account of the measures that have transpired in China over the last 18 months. I am not wishing to say-neither is the Opposition-that there are international standards in human rights in China. I have never professed that. Even last month, when I was advocating in the Senate that there be normalisation of relations between China and Australia, I suggested that we would be all the more able, I believe, to achieve a situation nearly approaching international standards in human rights by direct dialogue with China and direct representation of our views to representatives of China rather than by staying in silence in isolation from each other. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept exaggerated stories of all students overseas being at risk from intolerable persecution should they return to China. Clearly, nobody has been putting that view here in the Senate. There are some out in public who maybe have put that view. By and large, the public and all of us in the Senate need to look at the bona fides of that view and decide whether it is not in itself an exaggeration to make it easy for some of the Chinese nationals who just want to stay in this country as every one of the one million applicants do. We do not deny those good motives. They are to improve their life, to make a contribution to Australia and to enjoy the affluence of a modern, developed country. Anyone who visits China can see that it is a developing country with a much lower level of affluence than we enjoy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Many applicants from Italy, Greece, the Philippines and even from the Netherlands or the United Kingdom are wanting to improve their life outcome, be a part of a developed country and make a contribution to this country by bringing their own freshness and vigour to it. Good luck to them for all those reasons, but let there be objectivity in the selection process. </PARA>
<PARA> Because these matters are complex and because the actual individual situation of any applicant would need to be considered, the Opposition remains supportive of the view that this matter should be approached on a case by case basis. When I say that, obviously there would need to be guidelines in practice that would give officers of the Department, and even the applicants themselves, some ability to discern their chances of having what was required to differentiate their application as one that would be in the minority accepted or in the majority not accepted. There would need to be guidelines, but we believe that applications should still be decided on the basis of a case by case approach. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been other matters relating to China and immigration that the Parliament has had to be concerned with. We recall the problems that have arisen through inadequate Government policy governing the English language intensive courses for overseas students. Recruitment of students from China for such courses in Australia was halted by the Government in October 1989, a few months after the June events to which I have referred. That program was halted not for one month but for four months. There were no applicants at all, when there had been a pattern of more than 10,000 a year coming from China for English language study in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In that process thousands of Chinese citizens had made the necessary preliminary payments to gain admission to courses in this country. Because their applications were no longer successful, millions of dollars had to be repaid to those students. Because of currency changes, the value of money now compared to the value of money then and the students being from all 26 provinces of China, the Government made an enormous problem for itself by its mismanagement through 1989 of the English language enrolments from China. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention China so much because the majority of the students coming for the English language courses were overwhelmingly from China. In fact, there were more students from China in these courses than from all the other countries put together. When applications were eventually reopened, the criteria had been changed to be more stringent. However, the damage, the confusion and the loss of reputation that this Government had caused had already happened. It was substantial on all three fronts. There were disturbances outside our Consulate in Shanghai when the students gathered as an angry crowd to demonstrate and express their sense of grievance. Some suffered financial penalties in having paid their fees in advance to institutions in Australia which were not in a position to refund the money readily. Indeed, Parliament had to pass legislation late last year-the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill-to remedy that situation and provide taxpayers' money to ensure that repayments were made to those entitled to them. Many of the deposits were made to private institutions and there was no mechanism in place which required those private institutions to refund the money. We passed that Bill which gave taxpayers' money back in proportion to that which was owed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take this opportunity to note that most of the administration of those refunds to thousands of students, amounting to more than $5m in regard to one group of students alone, has been handled by our serving Australian staff overseas. I wish to commend the administrative skill that has been shown by those serving Australians overseas, particularly in Shanghai. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the Government has also announced legislation, the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill, to try to clean up the private educational institutions to which I have referred. It was supposed to be very urgent legislation when we first saw it last year; that is how it was announced by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins. In fact, it has not yet passed through the Parliament. It has not even come up for debate in the Senate. It was originally put up without much consultation and it was wrong. It would not have achieved what the Government had determined. After more consultation and after many comments from the Opposition, it was redrafted and we may see it very soon. In fact, it will first be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. It will then come for consideration by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of that Bill is symptomatic of the ad hoc, erratic decision making and the totally unsatisfactory way that the Government has gone about these overlapping areas of education and immigration as they affect China. On top of those two patch-up Bills already, we now have this third one. It is clear that the Bill before us is a necessity because of the earlier bungles, the shambles, that I spoke of. </PARA>
<PARA> Providing for people such as the Chinese nationals who are here on four-year temporary permits will itself put extra pressure on the English language and citizenship courses offered under the adult migrant English program (AMEP). The Government makes clear in the explanatory memorandum to this Bill that no extra money is required by the Bill and no extra money is provided by this Bill for the AMEP. </PARA>
<PARA> The access to the adult migrant English program that has been given by this Bill to 11,000 Chinese nationals is at the expense of other permanent residents of Australia who, ordinarily, have access to adult migrant English programs. Let us note that the program will not be expanded. There will be no extra places; there will be no extra money in the scheme. This, of course, can only mean that some of those presently eligible will be denied the opportunity to take part in AMEP courses. There are Government estimates that the number of temporary residents to become eligible under the AMEP could be as high as 11,000. That means that, to the extent that the 11,000 do participate, they will be denying that opportunity to the equivalent number of others. It is perhaps unfair in the respect that those being extended this access by this Bill will not necessarily remain in Australia, but those who will be denied access by their enrolment will certainly be permanent residents of Australia. I trust that those who administer the AMEP scheme will carefully take into account the priority of enrolments so that they are acting without discrimination and in the best interests of all applicants under the AMEP. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the adult migrant English program is under pressure anyway. I remind the Senate of what was revealed in the report of the working party on post-secondary English language training published last December-only three months ago. That report refers to the estimate of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs that there is a backlog of 50,000 to 60,000 people seeking placement in adult English as a second language programs. This Bill will make that backlog 11,000 more. But, given the resources that are available and the size of the program, there will be a shortfall and many will be denied access to the English language learning that they are seeking. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is clearly not giving sufficient priority to funding this program. People are missing out at the moment, not to mention those who will miss out in the coming months as a result of this Bill. There is a sense of replacing some in the queue with others in the queue. </PARA>
<PARA> While this is not a general debate about the benefits of AMEP because our focus is on this particular Bill, I should at least refer to the fact that many of us in the Senate have taken a careful interest in the role of AMEP, and I would like to commend it. I believe that the program is a good one. It has a commendable history that goes back to the late 1940s. Honourable senators may know of my interest in initiating some eight or 10 years ago a Senate inquiry on a national language policy. The recommendations of that major Senate report are still being implemented by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context, I note the importance of teaching English to children and adults, especially migrant Australians, so that they can have the full participation in the Australian community to which they aspire. It is good for harmony and for ensuring that we have an equal access society in this country. I commend the achievements of AMEP throughout its existence and I look forward to a positive outcome from the Government's consideration of the working party report to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one particular matter on which I seek information from the Minister handling the Bill. That is with regard to clause 10-the very last few lines of the Bill-which refers to non-government organisations. What is the Government's intention by this particular clause? It is not clear to me; it was not referred to in the explanatory memorandum, or in the second reading speech of the Minister. Will extra levels of expenditure be required? Will there be some revenue raising aspect? Which particular non-government institutions are involved? I leave this matter with those final questions. For the reasons that I outlined at the beginning, the Opposition supports this legislation, although we do not support the series of bungled policy decisions of this Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Immigration (Education) Amendment Bill, which, as has already been indicated, is a small Bill in size, amends the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 to provide the Minister with power to broaden the categories of persons who can avail themselves of English language and citizenship courses. There are also a number of other minor technical amendments. The Act is being amended to enable the Minister to arrange for courses to be provided to persons who hold temporary entry permits of a class specified by the Minister by notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present, the adult migrant English program is open to permanent residents only. As I say, this alteration will allow temporary residents-that is, those who claim refugee status, those who are here on special temporary visas and humanitarian type visas-to enter the program. Some of these people, of course, will be eventually granted permanent status, but this amendment to the Act gives them access, while they are in the temporary status, to the adult migrant English program. </PARA>
<PARA> This program includes two aspects: English courses and citizenship courses. There is some effective overlap between those two types of courses because of the use of citizenship aspects in the teaching of English under the English course. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill there is also a very sensible and logical change which extends the lower age limit down to 18 years; it is 21 years under the Act as it now stands. Other minor amendments include welcome rephrasing of an Act which had its genesis in 1971 to better reflect the multicultural nature of Australian society and to avoid former assimilationist connotations. For example, `way of living of Australian people' becomes `ways of life in Australia'. The amending Bill also acknowledges self-government in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> There is expansion of the itemisation of costs which the Commonwealth may meet to include the cost of student support services, for example, child-care and counselling. As has just been pointed out by the previous speaker, clause 10 of the Bill gives permission for the Minister to enter into arrangements with non-government organisations to provide adult migrant English services to or for those organisations. The Australian Democrats, too, have some questions about clause 10. It is very unclear what that actually means. I would like some clarification from the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) as to the organisations that are being referred to there and, specifically, whether this involves funding being removed from the technical and further education sector, where a good deal of funding is going, into private schools. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point we note that there is, in fact, no increase in funds attached to this amending Bill. That is somewhat disturbing, particularly in the context of clause 10, but also in the context of what is an extension of the reach of the adult migrant English program. Although on paper it is an extension, it is difficult to see, with the lack of increased funding, how that can be an extension to any further numbers of migrant people. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems with this Bill, a Bill which the Democrats do support, but I want to make sure that we put on the record the problems as we see them. One of the problems surrounding this area is the way in which the whole matter of extended eligibility has been handled and, as I have already mentioned, the fact that there has been no additional appropriation to cover the costs. In the Minister's second reading speech, we are told that, in addition to asylum seekers from presumably a number of countries, extended eligibility applies particularly to People's Republic of China nationals who happened to be in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square incident on 4 and 5 June 1989; that is, specifically those who now have a special four-year temporary entry permit and whose spouses have been able to join them here. The Government estimates that figure at about 11,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole situation with these People's Republic of China nationals has been handled in a knee-jerk reaction, in an ad hoc manner, so that many of them do not know, and have not known for a very long time, where they really stand. I shall just briefly go over that history. On 6 June 1989, Senator Robert Ray, then the responsible Minister, announced the extension of temporary entry permits until the end of July 1989 for Chinese nationals legally or illegally in Australia as at 4 June. Senator Ray clearly stated that the applications for permanent status from these People's Republic of China nationals would be considered on individual merits. On 16 June, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced that the Government would extend the visas for another 12 months, until 31 July 1990. In June 1990 the Prime Minister announced a special category for the 19,000-plus Chinese nationals who were in Australia before 20 June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, they could apply for permits for temporary residence until 30 June 1993. Chinese nationals arriving after 20 June 1989 were entitled to apply for refugee status under existing criteria. Thus, two classes of people were created: those with temporary automatic protection, whether or not they needed it or wanted it; and the others, such as Burmese, Iranians, Lebanese, Sri Lankans, Fijians, and Chinese nationals arriving after 20 June 1989. The flaw really was that the first group-those Chinese nationals who arrived before 20 June 1989-had to withdraw their claims for permanent residency in order to be entitled to benefits provided under the terms of the special four-year temporary entry permits. Those benefits included special benefits, family allowance, family allowance supplement, Medicare and English language training. In other words, it was an attempt to persuade these Chinese nationals to go for special temporary permits rather than seek permanent residence. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, albeit belatedly, the Government has moved to redress this situation in this legislation by extending eligibility to English language courses. All cases for refugee or humanitarian status should be considered on their merits. We must also remember the cruel and arrogant statement by the Prime Minister when he announced that the Khmer, the Cambodian, boat people were not political refugees and, therefore, could not have their cases for refugee status considered individually. Thankfully, the Prime Minister did later reconsider this position and the Determination of Refugee Status Committee is now able to make that assessment on that essential individual basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of a refugee is an internationally agreed one. A refugee is a person who is persecuted for the reasons of race, religion, nationality, and membership of a particular social group or political opinion and who is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail herself or himself of the protection of that country.</PARA>
<PARA> On 26 February this year Senator Gareth Evans announced that the Government had decided to remove the remaining economic and political restrictions on Australia's relations with China following the tragic events in Tiananmen Square on 4 and 5 June 1989, as there have been-and I quote him- `discernible improvements in the human rights situation in China'. So says Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA> With particular regard to the people I have spoken of in relation to this legislation, the concern is whether this change of Government policy will make it more difficult for those on special temporary entry permits, who have been encouraged to move to that status, to now achieve refugee status on the basis of the definition which I have already given. That is a matter of considerable concern to the Australian Democrats in the context of the change of Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats support this Bill, which extends the eligibility of access to English language and citizenship courses. We especially applaud the fact that it leaves the Chinese nationals with special four-year temporary permits less in limbo than they have been. However, we are concerned, as I have said, that there will be no additional funding by the Commonwealth to pay for, on its own estimation, an additional 11,000 people who may be seeking places. A recent report of the working party on post-secondary education training, to which Senator Teague has already alluded, identified deficiencies in resources and outcomes in English language programs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a backlog of some 60,000 long time permanent residents of migrant background who have language difficulties and who do not have access to English language programs, and we have to ask whether this amendment is going to make any difference to that problem. This report again estimates that about 365,000 do not speak English well, or even at all, and that some 170,000 of these are in the work force now. In the matter of occupational health and safety alone, I would have thought that that had to be a major concern. It would be untenable for permanent residents to be ousted from class places by temporary residents. So obviously the question of funding is a critical one, and obviously funding must be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Senate and people interested in this policy area to the alternative Budget put forward by the Australian Democrats at Budget time last year in which programs, including this particular program, were allocated a 30 per cent real increase-this in the context of a Budget which clearly demonstrated where the money was coming from, and even more clearly demonstrated where the priorities of the Democrats would be. It is the range of basic language programs under the national policy on languages that has high priority. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, we are particularly concerned with clause 10, and I look forward to comments from the Minister on that. It would be extraordinarily regrettable if our public sector education should be deprived even further than it already is in this area. We definitely need some answers from the Government on a clause which is extraordinarily open-ended and non-explanatory. The fact that there is no reference at all in the explanatory memorandum to this clause must be addressed in the debate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats support this Bill. We have expressed our reservations about the ability of this amendment actually to provide greater access to more people. Although obviously increasing the categories of eligibility is a step in the right direction, we are concerned about the lack of allocation of additional finance. We will therefore be closely monitoring the operations, as we always have, of the adult migrant English program and will bring problems very clearly back to the Senate should they occur as a result of deficiencies we have already outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I spoke on the industry, technology and commerce legislation and tonight we are debating the Immigration (Education) Amendment Bill 1990. At first sight there would seem to be no similarity, but in fact both these Bills have been introduced to fight a rearguard action against the mess created by earlier Government decisions. It is becoming an extremely repetitive happening in this chamber that we are dealing with legislation which would never have needed to be introduced had the Government done its job properly-got its decisions right in the first place. Tonight's ill-considered Bill we owe to the tearful largess and political insecurity of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who, determined to show Australia generally and his Cabinet in particular who was in charge of the shop, made a spur of the moment decision-perhaps staring into the blue eyes of Jana Wendt. He announced, completely at odds with his previous Minister for Immigration, Senator Robert Ray, that four-year temporary entry permits would be granted to all People's Republic of China (PRC) nationals in Australia before the Tiananmen Square massacre-all 19,400 of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Out the window went Senator Ray's statement after Tiananmen Square that PRC nationals should be treated like any other applicant for refugee status. Senator Ray got it right when he said that applicants for refugee status should be determined not on the basis of class of people but on individual merit; that they would be considered on the basis of individual claims. Clearly, the Prime Minister had other ideas. The legislation we have before us tonight, while using all means it can in its terminology to disguise the fact, is to give the PRC nationals on the special entry permits access to adult migrant English courses and citizenship courses. The said courses are paid for by the taxpayers of Australia, and it is estimated that some 11,000 people may use the opportunity of the free education. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not opposing the legislation. In fact, it would be quite churlish to refuse access to education programs which could allow the PRC nationals to make a better contribution to our society while they are here. However, there are problems which I believe ought to be explored in this debate tonight in relation to English language courses, PRC nationals, and the Prime Minister's spur of the moment decision that they could simply block book a four-year position here because they were in Australia before Tiananmen. We would do well to remember that many of the students now happily making use of the Prime Minister's temporary permits, which gained them a legitimate extra four years in Australia, were already illegals. It needs to be said that they were illegals not because they were frightened of politics or reprisals back home but because they had made a deliberate decision to stay here illegally well before Tiananmen Square. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Prime Minister did was to create chaos by making legal some 4,000 Chinese illegals. Indeed, it is most ironic, given the subject of this legislation, how those students came to be illegal in the first place. Yes, we allowed them into Australia to study, and of all subjects, English. Many of them came to be illegal by falsely declaring they were in Australia to learn English, with absolutely no intention of returning home after paying for, but in some instances-many instances-never attending, a short term language course under the English language intensive courses for overseas students (ELICOS) program. Others attended a few lectures in a small amount to look legitimate. The figures are quite staggering. From the start of the ELICOS program in 1986 until Tiananmen Square in 1989, only 10 per cent of the 16,517 Chinese students who entered Australia to learn English ever went home. Thousands of students, the majority of whom were Chinese, were literally buying their way into Australia posing as English language students. </PARA>
<PARA> There are reports of English language schools deliberately overenrolling because they knew that many Chinese students would not be attending lectures. Senator Ray, while Minister for Immigration, was reported in the media as calling the ELICOS scheme the English language intending change of status scheme. He was right. But in the end it was not ELICOS but the Prime Minister who did it for us. Despite all the evidence that each case for refugee status should be treated individually, despite evidence that many nationals would be in no danger in returning to China, they were all given the four years grace. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, courtesy of tonight's legislation, some 11,000 PRC nationals will be able-at Australian taxpayers' expense-to have English language lessons, the very subject many of them used and abused as a cover to enter Australia illegally in the first place. I hope that the irony of that is not lost on anyone listening to this debate. They are to take up places funded, we are told, out of current appropriations; previous speakers tonight have referred to that. </PARA>
<PARA> With our Budget appropriations this year, we have a disappearing surplus-the $8 billion surplus is evaporating day by day. It is fairly clear that next year Australia will have a substantial deficit. Yet, with this legislation opening up and guaranteeing these places with no appropriation of funds to account or provide for them, how are they going to be paid for? The surplus is evaporating. We will obviously be in deficit next year and yet we are putting in place a program that will have additional costs. Who will bear those costs and how? The Government's silence is deafening. Senator Powell and Senator Teague referred to that aspect and it is certainly incumbent upon the Government to identify to the chamber how the program will be paid for. Surely in today's economic climate, that is a legitimate and responsible question. The responsibility rests with the Government to reassure the chamber as to how the funds will be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be mentioned that while many of the PRC nationals on temporary permits are now getting a second, but this time free, opportunity to learn English, the under-resourced program is struggling to cope with a backlog of some 50,000 to 60,000 longer term residents with language difficulties who have requested some help. The adult migrant English program is quite clearly unable to cope with its present workload. As well, there are an estimated 170,000 overseas born permanent residents without English language at present in the labour force. </PARA>
<PARA> In its list of priorities the Government, as usual, is on the wrong track. I would have thought that at a time of economic crisis and faced with an under-resourced program, we have far more responsibility to our permanent residents than to those visitors on one-off temporary permits to study here for four years. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: the Opposition does not oppose this Bill but I call into question the Government's decisions from the day the Prime Minister, with knee-jerk emotion and without good sense, let some 19,000 Chinese nationals, many of whom had already overstayed their welcome, remain in Australia without individual assessment. That made a mockery of our immigration regulations as this legislation makes a mockery of our immigration education priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to consider and ought not to forget that we have thousands upon thousands of people who are prepared to apply to become migrants to Australia and who are prepared to abide by the rules and regulations. They do not want to jump queues or squeeze in in front of other legitimate cases. Yet here we have the Prime Minister and the Government acting in a way that gives credence to those who jumped the queue; many of whom did so when coming to Australia with illegal intent in the first place. The Government's priorities are clearly wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all honourable senators for their contribution to this debate. One of the major points raised tonight by all honourable senators who participated in this debate is the question of how longer term settlers in Australia may be disadvantaged by allowing People's Republic of China (PRC) nationals with four-year temporary permits to access the adult migration English program (AMEP). The Government has in fact recognised the problem of the under-resourcing of the AMEP and also notes that this continues to be an issue for recently arrived migrants with English language difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The working party on post-secondary English language training also recognised there was a backlog of English language training needed for longer term residents as well. The issue is being addressed in the context of the development of a White Paper on Australian language and literacy policy. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is participating in the development of this policy and has developed this paper so that the Government can receive the fullest possible input from both recent and longer term residents in Australia as to their English language needs. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been mentioned tonight, not all PRC nationals with four-year temporary entry permits will be eligible for the AMEP course. The majority who have studied at English language intensive courses for overseas students (ELICOS) institutions are not entitled to access to these courses. Those who are eligible for the AMEP access will not be accorded any priority over other clients, whether long or short term. The focus of the AMEP is on client need because of the recognition of the importance of English for people to function effectively in our society for their period of residence. </PARA>

<PARA> I have been provided with the following advice for Senator Teague in reference to clause 10 of the Bill: this clause, which provides for the Minister arranging services to or for a non-government organisation, is for the purpose of giving program flexibility in responding to gaps in service delivery which cannot be met by current Australian migrant English program (AMEP) teaching centre networks-for example, in isolated areas and also in areas of high migrant settlement, and potentially to organisations offering preembarkation courses. </PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that Senator Powell also raised the issue of clause 10 and expressed concern about the Government not diminishing the public sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Employment, Education and Training Amendment Act 1988 is to be amended to achieve two new minor amendments: firstly, to give flexibility in making certain appointments to the board and councils; and, secondly, to bring together a pattern of twice yearly reports with regard to the board and its councils rather than an annual report, more particularly with regard to profiles and the higher education contribution scheme, commonly known as HECS. I will come to both those matters of substance in this brief Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As this is one of the rare opportunities for us to evaluate the Commonwealth Government's handling of higher education in this country, on behalf of the Opposition I will move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, which I will read out in a few minutes. Very sadly, it indicates the Opposition's view that this Government has a deplorable record in the handling of higher education in this country, particularly during the 3 1/2 years of tenure of the current Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins. Despite my high hopes and my respect for Mr Baldwin, it has not been much assisted since Mr Baldwin's appointment last year as the Minister directly involved in decisions in the higher education area. </PARA>
<PARA> We have before us a relatively small amending Bill, which is just another step along the path for the Labor Government in the period in which Mr Dawkins has been the Minister. The last 3 1/2 years have been a time of substantial change for the higher education sector. I describe it as change, not reform. I do not believe that we have advanced during this time. If I am pressed, I would say that we have seen some additional resources, but there has not been an increase in real terms of allocated public moneys per enrolment; there has been a decline every year of the Hawke Labor Government despite some of the propaganda that it tried to put about, particularly in the earlier part of its period in office. The change that has been brought about, summarised in Mr Dawkins's program by the White Paper that this Government has published, has been greeted with apprehension, discomfort, criticism and opposition by staff and students in higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite the imposition of profiles and the forced amalgamations of institutions, the arbitrary benchmarks that were set out in the White Paper, which have guided, like some robot, the policy decisions of this Government. I look at the failing resources in higher education and the mess, the disrepair and the shabbiness of our universities compared with 10 and 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> There is need for reform in higher education in this country. The Opposition calls for reform. We have published alternative approaches for higher education that will free it up and bring choice, diversity and excellence and, above all, that will bring back genuine autonomy to our education institutions. It is with real sadness that in yet another education Bill before us, the Opposition must refer to the deplorable record, to the missed chances and to the damage that has been done in these past 3 1/2 years. I sometimes despair. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that is very much in the interests of all senators-especially Senator Reid, my colleague sitting near me in the Senate who represents the Australian Capital Territory-is that yet another forced amalgamation, a forced rearrangement of structure has been thrust by this Government upon the Australian National University (ANU) for consideration and by the Chairman of the Higher Education Council who was appointed by this Government. Professor Chubb seems to have been completely absent from public debate and even from his colleagues on the staff of universities in the last two years. He has dared to put forward proposals which would dismember our proud national universities. </PARA>
<PARA> I have in front of me the ANU Reporter, the regular newspaper of the Australian National University, dated 27 February 1991-less than two weeks ago. It has the following headline `Chubb proposals would dismember ANU'. The article refers to Professor Chubb, the Chairman of the Higher Education Council, appointed by this Labor Government. According to the Council, the staff, the students and the residents in this city and those who care about the great tradition that has been established in the Australian National University, his proposals would dismember and restructure the ANU. This puts into practice what this Government Minister wants and not what I believe any genuine evaluation of the needs of the university would show. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that Senator Michael Baume is right in his statement. I think that unless we, in the time available to us two or three times a year, protest and protest clearly this kind of nonsense, we will see it repeated more and more. We have a record now of 3 1/2 years of this sort of damage. I see only two Government senators in the chamber. I want honourable senators who are in their rooms watching the television version of this debate and the Australian community to know with great clarity that the Opposition deplores the record of this Labor Government with regard to higher education and, in particular, deplores the policies of the Minister, Mr Dawkins, and I am afraid his very quiet and non-dissenting ally, the new Minister, Mr Baldwin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We make the plea `Keep your hands off higher education. Let them get on with their own decisions'. After all, not only have the decisions outlined in the White Paper, the centralist approach of an interfering Canberra, been deplored all around the country for two or more years, but also before that we have had 15 years of what I would call rationalisation, even during the time when my Party was in government-during the Fraser Government period. What was common to that 15 years was the chairmanship of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission of Professor Karmel. </PARA>
<PARA> I actually call these 15 years the Karmel years. I greatly respect Professor Peter Karmel because of his leadership in higher education. By his contribution, he has had more impact for good in this country than any other individual, including all of us in this Chamber. The Karmel years had a tendency to rationalise. There were some amalgamations, there was some clarification of which curriculum was best undertaken by which institution, and there were guidelines that were established that did bring about a very sensible approach to our higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> We had an end to the anomalous situation where colleges of advanced education were not allowed to be involved in research or in some post-graduate degrees-I believe unfairly when they had the expertise in some departments to do so. That situation has now been made more sensible by providing all higher education institutions with the ability and the access to make bids for research moneys and higher education enrolments. </PARA>
<PARA> Even with all the Karmel years-these 15 years of rationalisation-surely the time has come when we can allow individual institutions their autonomy to make their own decisions. After all, they are the ones that are serving their own particular communities, they have community representatives on their faculty boards or on the university councils, and they also are very aware of what competing institutions are offering not only in their own States but across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we will get the kind of creativity and the kind of new initiative required in this country if we give the universities of Australia their autonomy so that they can take their own initiatives. I do not believe we will have such a free-for-all that there will be massive duplication or waste. In fact, by the very nature of competitive enrolment, limits will be placed on duplication to the extent that that is harmful. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that instead of going down this track of damage in the Dawkins period, we should have been going entirely in the other direction. After the Karmel years, after that consolidation, we should allow for new creativity. There is a time to gather together and there is a time to allow opportunity for new activities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a refrain which the Opposition has put now each session of Parliament and I do so again with the same vigour, with the same concern. I know that all through our universities we have increasing numbers of staff and students who are waiting for the day when the Opposition can be in government and we can see some of the policies that we have announced actually start to bring the remedies that we are looking for. The remedies are not going to be dreamt up here in Canberra. The remedies and the new initiatives will come from the staff and the students, the communities of those universities themselves, and our policy is to just open the doors to allow that to happen. We refer to the failures of the Labor Government in our amendment which I now formally move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion add: ``, but the Senate deplores the Government's continued mismanagement of higher education, and in particular, it deplores the Government's:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) increasing interference in higher education through the intrusive educational profiles process;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) failure to provide a proper framework for accountability with respect to the exercise of Ministerial discretion;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) failure to provide adequately for independent policy advice;</PARA>
<PARA>(d) policy of forced amalgamations, the disruption it is presently causing in Victoria and the ACT and the damaging pressures it has created towards institutional uniformity;</PARA>
<PARA>(e) failure to provide institutions with the freedom and flexibility needed to address the impending shortage of academic staff;</PARA>
<PARA>(f) unsatisfactory imposition of the Higher Education Contribution charge on full fee postgraduate courses; and</PARA>
<PARA>(g) failure to make inroads into the level of unmet demand''. </PARA>
<PARA>There are nine specific charges that the Opposition puts to the Government of the day, and we call upon all senators to consider these charges. I have only a few minutes to give an indication of examples that lead us to these charges, that lead us to make this sad assessment of the deplorable way in which the Government has managed higher education in this country, and I look to all senators to give their consideration and support to this motion. By supporting it, we will bring very clearly to the Australian Government the need for redress of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> As I outlined, the Bill contains two particular provisions. The two changes are quite acceptable to the Opposition and it is for that reason that, whilst we have this quite significant second reading amendment, we will allow the Bill a second reading and will support the committee stages of the Bill with two related committee stage amendments that I will be moving on behalf of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will remember that three years ago the Opposition amended the Bill, against the then Government's wishes, to have twice a year reporting on two matters, that is, on what was happening with education profiles. Every educational institution and university was required to submit to this centralist Labor Government an outline of its objectives, its profile, and it would get its funding from this Government to the extent that that profile, those objectives, and that plan were acceptable to this centralist Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the profile system was a means of dialogue for Canberra to push around those education institutions. We have been thoroughly dissatisfied, as have academics throughout the whole country, with the way in which this has interfered with and intruded upon their own decision-making. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister, Senator Collins, is objecting. Let me make it quite clear to him and to every other Government senator that we do not believe that all wisdom resides in two Ministers in Canberra or in one group of even well intentioned public servants. We believe that the education decisions in this country should be built upon the knowledge, the experience and the initiatives of thousands of people involved in higher education in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Moreover, when there is discussion about funding and about what the objectives should be, it should be done openly and not behind closed doors, not where there is some ability for a Minister or his department to nobble the institutions, to get them to set out the kind of plan and the kind of objectives that happen to be acceptable to that tiny minority of persons, either Ministers or others close to the Minister in this Government. That is why this profile process has led to such disagreement and led to such dissatisfaction in the Senate. We required the Government, through the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) to report twice a year on the profile process. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, because of the great dissatisfaction and criticism of the higher education contribution scheme-commonly known as HECS-we wanted twice a year reports on how HECS was going. We wanted the National Board, through the Higher Education Council, to examine twice a year how HECS was going and to bring a report to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that three years have gone by, it is appropriate for those twice a year reports to be amalgamated and for us to receive them in one annual statement in March each year rather than in February and August. As I am the one who originally moved for the February and August reporting I, with the support of the Opposition, concur that we have come to a time when we can accept an annual report on these matters in March. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee amendment that the Opposition seeks to move will require the Minister to table that report within five sitting days of his receiving it from NBEET. Over the past three years we have found in practice-and Senator Collins, as a former Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, will be interested in this-that the average time for the tabling in the Parliament has been two months after August and after February of each year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the facts before me, Minister. It is true that some were as little as six weeks, some are nine weeks-some are more than two months. This situation is intolerable. We are not requiring the Minister to give a response to the NBEET report or to put down some gloss as to what he thinks should be his own statement alongside that report from the expert body. We want the expert body's report tabled in this Parliament in good time, without delay. For that reason we will be seeking to amend the present requirement of 15 sitting days after the Minister has received the report to five sitting days. We are convinced that this is entirely practicable and that it will be to the greater benefit not only of this Parliament but of the public to be informed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me refer to the track record of Minister Dawkins with regard, for example, to Estimates committees. Often we get answers to last year's left over unanswered questions the day before Estimates committees are to meet six months later, or there is some outstanding correspondence that will obviously come up in an Estimates committee and it is answered by the Minister on the day the Estimates committees meet. In fact, in regard to the reports in February and August, it has often been the case that we have not had those reports when the Senate Estimates committees actually meet, whether in May or November of each year. Sometimes we have had them tabled in the Parliament on the day that the Estimates committees begin. I just do not trust the Minister, when he is given 15 days to table a report to which he does not have to add a word, to table it promptly for the benefit of public knowledge and this Parliament-to get the report to us in very good time. Therefore, I look forward to the support of the Committee of the Whole for this new requirement that the report be tabled within five sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA> I have little to say about the new flexibility that the Bill before us will give for the appointment, particularly dual appointments or temporary appointments, of persons to be members of the councils and the Board. The new flexibility is entirely sensible and we support that aspect of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the Opposition's second reading amendment, let me say on the third item-I have already covered the first two, perhaps too painfully for the two Government senators who are in the chamber-that it refers to the failure of the present Government to provide adequately for independent policy advice. I have considerable respect for the individuals who serve on the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and indeed for those who serve on the four councils-higher education, schools, training, and research-which serve under the Board. The experience of the members of the councils and Board is very considerable and those members have a lot to bring to the tasks covered by those bodies. But the Board and the councils are structured by the government of the day and are appointed to a pattern that serves the purposes of the government of the day and they do not have an independent secretariat sufficient to meet the secretarial needs in order that the councils and Board may flourish. They so much rely on the Department itself, which is totally answerable to and directed by the Minister, that they have yet to demonstrate that they are an independent source of policy advice to the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> During the period in which the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission (CTEC) and the Commonwealth Schools Commission existed, both under the Fraser Government and the early part of the Hawke Government, this was not a frequent criticism. Most of us had confidence that the Tertiary Education Commission and the Schools Commission, for example, were not only made up of council members who were appropriately appointed experts, but were given terms of reference, powers and resources to be able to fulfil their role with independence. When they brought their reports to the Minister and, through the Minister, very quickly to this Parliament we saw those as independent council reports not only to the Minister but to the Parliament, to the public and to the education institutions themselves. In fact, the education institutions or universities could in a sense own the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. If that Commission were not summarising what those individual universities believed was in the best interests of this country, they could in their twice a year dialogues with CTEC get this independent body to be more persuaded of their view. That view would be tabled as the report of that more independent council. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the government of the day has the ultimate say as to what the policy will be, but often in the past 20 years a comparison has been made, even on a yearly basis, between what CTEC found, advised and recommended, on the one hand, and what the Government was able to do, on the other hand. Often it was a question of saying, `We do not have the kinds of resources available to do all that CTEC has recommended'. But in this case NBEET and the councils are hand in glove with the Minister and this Government. I am not saying anything that is a secret to members of NBEET. I have met them in the rooms that house the National Board and the councils and I have made this point to them face to face. I am not free to say what those individuals had to say in response to me, but it does not take too many minutes for any senator in this chamber to see which is the more dignified, the more self-respecting approach for anyone who is on a board or a council to give national advice on education. They will want to have the resources, their own secretariat, to be able to carry out their researches with independence and to bring independent advice to the Australian public as much as to the Government, with the knowledge, the realism, that not every aspect of their advice will be followed by the government of the day. I believe that we are long overdue a review of NBEET and the councils that will achieve that kind of independence. </PARA>
<PARA> I see Senator Bell, the Australian Democrat spokesman on education, in the chamber. I say this openly because we expect to be in government in less than two years time, and hasten the day: the only thing that is going to save higher education is a change of government. That is the only thing left now. I am saying, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, not only to Senator Bell but to all honourable senators in the chamber: let us see, in the new era for higher education that will come after the next election, a genuinely independent council that will give advice on higher education, on the Commonwealth's involvement in schools, on training and on research and a council that will not easily be typified as being in the pocket of the Minister or confined and restricted from giving the kind of advice that this country needs. Education is the greatest investment that we can make into the future of this country. We are not looking just at the length of this Parliament, we are looking 25 and 50 years ahead, and we must make sure that from these debates we get the best possible education provisions in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard rather a lot of Senator Teague in the latter part of the day and I must say I was a little disappointed earlier. I thought he was going to break into song, telling us there was a time for everything. One of the things Senator Teague mentioned in an earlier speech today was the ad hoc, erratic decision-making process, as he described it, which has been undertaken by this Government in relation to the overlapping areas of overseas student immigration and education. My suggestion is that a similar adhockery applies to the overlapping areas of education, youth, employment, training and assets testing for benefits which are paid. This whole area is fraught with inconsistencies, unintended consequences, poverty traps, and plain outright injustices. They have been caused by schemes and bureaucracies which do not, honestly, satisfactorily coalesce. I agree with the observation by Senator Teague about the earlier Bill, but in this particular instance we can see a tendency for adhockery to apply again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not spend a lot of time describing what this Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill proposes to do in changing the reporting requirements of the Higher Education Council from twice to once a year, in March, or about its other provisions. In fact, the Australian Democrats will not be opposing the Bill. But there are many concerns about the Government's approach to higher education in Australia. I will take this opportunity to outline some of the worst case scenarios that have resulted from this Government's misdirection in this area. For example, one of the subjects of this regular reporting by the Higher Education Council is the effect of the operation of the higher education contribution scheme (HECS). </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats will continue to oppose the imposition of tertiary fees. It is our belief that students already forgo income and generally end up paying higher taxes. But the benefits of education accrue to the whole of society. It is the whole of society which has the responsibility for educating its citizens with equity and equal access. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, some of the evidence we have about the application of the higher education contribution scheme is anecdotal. It really is a hard task, in evaluating the effect of the application of HECS, to actually ask a group of people-those who are not here-to put their hands up. But that is, in fact, one of the things one would be required to do to find out who was discouraged from tertiary education participation by HECS. According to the information available to the Australian Democrats, it is patently obvious that the imposition of tertiary fees excludes many people from higher education, regardless of their ability and aptitude. It is purely according to their financial means. </PARA>
<PARA> Students who manage to pursue their studies but cannot afford to pay up front must pay a penalty of 15 per cent. The poorest students are further penalised by the Budget changes which were recently introduced and which increased the rates of payments of the deferred higher education contribution scheme. These accelerated payments are regressive. In other words, people falling within the lowest income bracket now pay at a rate 100 per cent greater, and those in the highest bracket only pay at a rate 25 per cent greater. So much for equity and access in education. Despite all this rhetoric we so often hear about building a clever country, Commonwealth funding for higher education is still less than one per cent of our gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> Another new measure which is unacceptable is the Government's ruling that fee-paying, postgraduate students who are trying to upgrade their skills must pay at least twice the amount of HECS at the up-front rate. This burden makes a mockery of this Government's so-called commitment to further education as the key to Australia's future. The students participating there not only forgo earnings but generally pay their own fees rather than have their fees in postgraduate studies paid by parents, employers or somebody else or through some other award. In that situation, we are talking about postgraduate students who are often mature students. Apart from the course and living expenses, including consequential child-care costs, many of these people are part timers who do not receive Austudy, so it really is a double bind. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to Austudy. The Government's Austudy scheme is totally inadequate. There are a number of concerns regarding Austudy. Among the major problems are the changes to the spouse income test. The age of independence is 25 years. That is the governing age according to the regulations on independence. Another concern is the continuing disparity between Austudy and unemployment benefit for people over 21. The stringent tests on income and assets mean that Austudy is only available to the very poor. For instance, just to define that phrase `very poor', the threshold under the spouse income test has been reduced from over $18,000 a year, which was not generous in anybody's language, to $12,150 a year. That is what the spouse can earn to allow the student to be eligible for any Austudy payments whatsoever. That amount is actually less than the current poverty line for couples with one person in the work force. Including housing costs at the moment, that is $13,015 a year. So one has to be defined as very poor to even be eligible for Austudy and then has to trot off and do one's best to enhance one's qualifications. It is much less than half the average gross income of over $29,000 as at August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The spouse income test effectively excludes thousands of people, especially married women, from further study. For those who continue, many more couples will be forced into poverty during their student years. So really, the amount of Austudy, even after qualification, is totally inadequate. Under Democrat policy, we would see that reviewed immediately. According to our policies, student allowances should be set at 120 per cent of the poverty line and indexed to the consumer price index, as a very minimum. For some people over 21, it is still better to receive unemployment benefit than to try to study, with the lower payments of Austudy. Of course, that is very difficult to organise and almost impossible to continue to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> On paper the figures suggest that a student who attempted to do that would be better off-to be defined as unemployed and receive that benefit rather than to be defined as being engaged in full time study and receive the Austudy benefit. Of course, that discrepancy continues to discourage people from studying. For instance, a single adult aged 18 years or over receives $60 a week more on unemployment benefit than a student between 18 and 25 years of age who still lives at home. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of insufficient Austudy is compounded-I spoke earlier of the double bind-by the recession and the lack of part time work which is traditionally necessary for students to pay for those expenses which are difficult to quantify but which are obvious and necessary, such as living expenses, the present exorbitant textbook prices and the increased student union dues, which this year have gone up by about 15 per cent. Even if students were able to supplement their meagre Austudy income, which they are allowed to do only to a very tiny degree, the recession has meant that the opportunities for part time work have dissolved along with many other things. At the moment, those who are trying to survive on Austudy are finding it very difficult to meet the sorts of expenses necessitated by being a student. </PARA>
<PARA> The next problem in this area is the unmet demand for tertiary places. With the picture I have just painted, one would wonder why anybody would want to attempt to be a student. Nevertheless, with very poor job prospects more students are completing year 12, having been encouraged to do so by this Government-and rightly so-and qualifying for tertiary admission. However, the Government has failed dismally to provide enough places for those students. </PARA>
<PARA> Initial estimates from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee show that the level of unmet demand this year is roughly five per cent higher than last year, with worse figures for Queensland. Nationally, this means that up to 21,000 students have missed out on tertiary places. So far, the figures show that in Victoria, for instance, a record number of students have missed out, with applications exceeding enrolments by almost 9,000. In Queensland, a State with one of the highest levels of unmet demand, the excess of applications over enrolments is 26,000. In South Australia, over 11,000 applicants-more than one-third of the total-received no offer of a tertiary place at all. The pattern is repeated throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, these are only initial figures; of course, there will be multiple applications; and, of course, some students will change their minds. But it is inexcusable for this Government to encourage young people to stay on at school, to pretend to value higher education and then to dump thousands of qualified school leavers throughout the country in this way. I am tempted to throw in the meaningless phrase `clever country' again, but I am starting to feel dizzy every time I hear it because it is a nonsense phrase now, and demonstrably so, and this legislation will do nothing to add to the process of our becoming a clever country. What is needed is that this unmet demand be met. Until some sort of effort is made in that regard nobody has any right to utter that phrase again in this place, and I will resist the temptation. </PARA>

What we should be careful about is denying that any wisdom resides in universities. To deny that, not to allow our young people to participate in gathering some of the wisdom that resides in universities, is ignorant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The academic shortage which helps to deny young people that opportunity also concerns us. It seems that the stage has been reached where this Government can no longer ignore the increasing shortage of academic staff. Predictions being made of an acute shortfall of up to 25,000 in potential academic staff by the end of this decade are horrifying. The report by Dr Blandy and the National Institute for Labour Studies on the academic labour market suggested a national shortage of up to 19,000 academic staff by the end of the decade, and other studies contain worse predictions. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee predicts a shortfall of up to 25,000 academics by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a case of the Government needing to act quickly to encourage more students to pursue post-graduate studies and to recruit and train academic staff. At the very least, the Government must extend HECS exemption scholarships to cover everybody doing a masters and PhD course-including part time students who are involved in those studies-and certainly look towards including many more honours degree and graduate diploma students. That is the very least position for HECS exemption. The Democrats' policy is to continue to push for the abolition of HECS. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of post-graduate research awards should also be further increased. The Democrats believe that the number and value of course work awards should also be increased, with academics coming up through this track as well as through the traditional research route. But that would not be enough on its own. This amalgamation business must be addressed. Although Senator Teague went into detail about the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and what is proposed there, I do not intend to address that in detail tonight. I will say in passing that the Federal Government has clearly disregarded the previously promised voluntary nature of higher education amalgamations. The evidence so far has suggested that this amalgamation process has been costly in educational and financial terms, and that it would be more satisfactory to have a client driven approach to restructuring higher education. That would be much better than what we see at the moment, which seems to be a mania for amalgamation for its own sake. The amalgamation mania, without justification, has led us to what is a ludicrous situation in the ACT, where the justification for pursuing such a course has not been made on educational grounds but simply because it seems to be a good idea. The bureaucratic and financial drivers are at odds with the institutional justification, and certainly this does not seem to fall into the category of being a voluntary amalgamation between campuses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that individual campuses must be encouraged to develop their own strengths and diversities, and that access to suitable housing is the way to approach this from the grassroots level. So often there is criticism of individual institutions for either the area that they service or the hinterland that their students come from. It seems to have escaped the Government that student mobility and access to institutions is directly a function of the available housing in the area. There is a crisis in student housing, and it needs to be addressed. Higher education in Australia continues to suffer from this lack of mobility. It is our belief that access to reasonably cheap good standard accommodation is entirely the key to student mobility. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity to stay at residential colleges seems to be something which is not part of the Government's policy in this area at all. This is what I referred to earlier. There is an adhockery about the Government's approach to benefits, to accommodation and to the youth policy of the nation as a whole. Education seems to be a separate little box. Well, it is not. It is part of the fundamental question of accommodation, sufficient funding, sufficient previous education and sufficient motivation to participate in tertiary education. The situation now is that there is a shortage of places in residential colleges. Many students have to pay high private rents or even forgo tertiary studies-this is especially a problem for students from country areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to repeat the call that I have made previously: for the Federal Government to establish single, multiple and family dwellings both on and off campus which can be used by students and which would be available at either low interest loans or under commercial arrangements; and to provide low cost housing on and off campus as well. By providing such affordable accommodation at all tertiary institutions, at least the Government could then look towards the students following through and studying at institutions which best serve both their needs and the country's needs. There would not be the situation that is so often criticised at the moment where duplication of courses occurs in nearby campuses. `Nearby' might be only a matter of a couple of hundred kilometres but, without the provision of suitable accommodation, students will not be mobile. </PARA>
<PARA> We might get somewhere if we have some appreciation of the need for consistent, interrelated, relevant policies which cover not just one sector of those matters concerning young people but all of the areas-so that when a person turns 18, 23 or 25 a poverty trap is not created and a decision-making process, which brings about a disadvantage to that person, through no fault of his own but through the fault of inconsistent and illogical government policies, can be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I have wandered off the path a little from this Bill, it provides a justification for following what I thought was quite a reasonable observation from Senator Teague-that there was erratic conjoining of so many policies. I had hoped to emphasise that by giving a couple of examples. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The investment which we make in the education of our nation is the biggest investment which we can make in the future of this country. This is a comment which I have made on a number of occasions and which I make again because it underlines this Government's contempt for the importance of higher education; it underlines this Government's contempt for many people in areas of remote and rural Queensland who will not get a fair go at higher education because of this Government's unwillingness or inability to meet the problem of unmet demand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This afternoon in Question Time I asked Senator Bolkus, representing the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), a number of questions about the problems involved with the possibility of starting a Cairns campus. I referred him to the fact that only 12 out of every 1,000 students in northern Queensland get the chance to go on to higher education; yet amongst their cousins in Canberra or Melbourne the figure is 29 per 1,000. I asked the Minister why it is that this Government allows a situation to exist in which 75 per cent of the senior students at a far north Queensland youth congress said that the lack of a Cairns campus may preclude them from going on to university education. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus answered with a comment which in retrospect is quite simply absurd. He said that Queensland had, in fact, the highest participation rate in higher education of all States in the Commonwealth. That was a very interesting comment because Senator Bolkus, in his intellectual schizophrenia, but two minutes later admitted the fact that Queensland did not in fact have the highest participation rate in Australia; that it was about one per cent below the average. </PARA>
<PARA> This was a point that I was making to Senator Bolkus, because his own Labor Party State Premier, Mr Goss, has already criticised Mr Dawkins for failing to adequately fund higher education in Queensland. Mr Goss himself said that, in terms of participation rate, Queensland is about one per cent below that of the national average and, therefore, Queensland is entitled to at least an additional 1,000 places. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Mr Goss did not stop there, because in the course of his broadside attack against the Minister last week, he made a number of other points. One of those was that Queensland's share of the relevant age groups-that is, the people in the 17- to 19-year age bracket-entitled it to some 2,200 places more than it was currently receiving. Yet the Minister persisted in saying that the Government had made a commitment to ensure that students throughout the country do have equal access to education, especially on a tertiary level. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, there seems to be some problem here because Senator Bolkus was telling us that everybody had an equal access to higher education. If that is the case, why is it that only 12 out of every 1,000 students in north Queensland get a higher education and 29 out of every 1,000 students in Canberra or Melbourne get a higher education? Does that seem like fair and equal access to tertiary education? Of course it is not. The reason it is not fair or equitable access to higher education is that the Federal Labor Government has persistently refused to listen to the claims of students, of community and of business that demand a separate university campus in the Cairns area. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus claimed in his answer to my question today that he had found a direct rebuttal to the essential point that I had made. This was the direct rebuttal that Senator Bolkus claimed that he was able to make. I will read the words exactly as they have come off the Hansard pink:</PARA>
<PARA>The growth allocations provided to Queensland by the Commonwealth are such that Queensland will receive 25 per cent, 1,215 places of all additional intakes in 1991 and 23 per cent over the years 1991 and 1993, well above its population share of 17 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>What Senator Bolkus does not understand-and I wish he did understand-is that when we are talking about allocating additional places upon the basis of population growth, we must talk about population growth. We cannot talk about allocating places on the basis of population growth and then compare it to the percentage of the population. I intend to do what Senator Bolkus should have done this afternoon which is to look at the growth figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Some interesting statistical growth figures for towns of approximately the same size as Cairns, that have university campuses, are very revealing. For example, Townsville which in 1986 had a population of some 106,000 people had an annual growth rate of 1.9 per cent. If we look at similar towns in other states, for example, Albury-Wodonga, we find an annual growth rate of 1.2 per cent; Launceston had an average annual growth rate of 0.8 per cent; in Orange and Bathurst the figure was 1.2 per cent; in Bendigo it was 1.2 per cent, and so on. In Cairns, the figure was 4.3 per cent. Even if we look at Townsville as an example, there is clearly a very good case on the basis of these figures for Queensland not to get 25 per cent more than one would expect it to get but to get about 50 per cent more than it would entitled to, purely on the basis of population. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus raised the issue of population growth; I did not. I am merely answering the flawed points that Senator Bolkus attempted to make this afternoon. Of course, we do not even come to the question of the 4.3 per cent growth in Cairns. How Senator Bolkus seems to think that we can achieve fair and equitable access to higher education in Cairns with a growth rate of 4.3 per cent and no university campus at all is quite beyond me, as I am sure it is quite beyond every rational member of this Senate. But then we are talking about an unclever Government that boasts about attempting to create a clever country. </PARA>
<PARA> In reality, we see a stark picture of educational desolation for the young people of Queensland. What we see in northern Queensland is particularly disturbing because, in northern Queensland, there is an educational lock-out. In spite of how much students might want to go to university, in spite of how well qualified those students may be, they do not have a university campus that they can attend. For many of those students in far northern Queensland, areas that have been particularly hard hit by the current Labor Government engineered recession, the suggestion that the students should travel down to Brisbane and live in student accommodation there is quite patently ridiculous because they do not have the money and they do not have the opportunity to get the money that they would need to pay for that accommodation as well as the cost of education itself. </PARA>
<PARA> A final fact that I put before the Senate is the general level of participation rates in higher education in northern Queensland compared with other areas of Australia. In northern Queensland, as I have said, the participation rate is 12 per thousand. In central Queensland, in the Fitzroy area, in the central west, and in Mackay, the participation rate is 17 per thousand. Yet, when one looks at areas such as Sydney, the participation rate is 25 per thousand; in Canberra, it is 30 per thousand; in Melbourne, it is 29 per thousand; and in Barwon in Victoria, where Deakin University is situated, the participation rate is 37 per thousand. Quite clearly, on the basis of these figures-these are not figures which I have produced myself, but are derived from the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission and the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates of residential population in June 1989-this Government stands condemned for its ineptitude or, failing that, its unwillingness to address the problem of unmet demand for higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just put a human face on all of those figures. Let us talk about the very talented young Australians in Cairns, on Cape York Peninsula, and in other areas of northern Queensland, who have hopes and aspirations of going on to a better life, to a more prosperous life and to a more fulfilling life, than they are currently offered. For those young Australians, their hopes have been dashed by this Labor Government. Their hopes have been dashed by a government which tries to pretend that merely playing catch-up with years and years of neglect somehow redresses the very real problems of today. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it slightly ironic that at no time in the 23 years of conservative government from 1949 to 1972, at no time during the eight years of the Fraser Government nor at any time during the three years of the Whitlam Government did we see the creation of a private university. In fact, it is only during the years of neglect under this Federal Labor Government, under this Hawke Labor Government, that we have seen the creation of a private university-the Bond University on the Gold Coast. The irony is that that university was not created out of ideological reasons, out of a belief that the educational system should be freed up because, as Senator Teague has so ably said today, that organisation seems more interested in its centralist policies with regard to education than freeing up the education system. </PARA>
<PARA> The only reason that that educational facility at Bond University was established was the neglect of the Labor Government, the unmet demand, the aspirations of so many thousands of talented young Australians whose dreams were being dashed by this Government's neglect. That is why I have a great deal of pleasure and why I am very proud to say that I shall be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Teague. I should also say that it brings me a great deal of sadness that we should have to move this amendment at all. If this Government refuses to wake up, we are forced to open its eyes for it and to show it the real nature of the world outside and the real suffering which its educational neglect has caused. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague has had his crack and he has the committee stage to come so he should keep his peace. I shall just refer to this second reading amendment. There are three particular clauses in that amendment to which I do take some exception. I think it is important that Senator Bell does take notice of these particular clauses which he is considering agreeing to. Paragraph (a) of the second reading amendment says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>increasing interference in higher education through the intrusive educational profiles process. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is calling upon the Senate, through the second reading amendment, to reject that as a proposition. Of course, the Opposition is well placed to do that. If the Opposition were to get its way and if the Opposition were to get elected, we would see an immediate return to the charging of full fees-the situation that existed before a Labor Government was elected in 1972 when that policy was changed. Creating new places in universities will not be a problem after that because the number of applicants who will be able to afford to enter university will be substantially diminished. There is no secret about the fact that that is precisely where the Opposition wants to take us-full fees. </PARA>
<PARA> The educational profiles process that the Opposition finds so objectionable is, of course, a mechanism designed to balance the educational integrity and autonomy of an institution with a proper accountability to the Parliament that provides the lion's share of its funding. In fact, it helps to entrench in place a situation where the taxpayer will continue to fund the majority of the costs of running universities. That is precisely anathema to the Opposition, which wants to go in exactly the opposite direction, returning to the good old days of full fee paying for those who can afford it. It has made no bones about that in numerous public statements that have been made by various front bench members of the Opposition. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I unreservedly withdraw it. I refer to paragraph (c), which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>failure to provide adequately for independent policy advice. </PARA>
<PARA>What a gross insult that is to the members of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. Their charter is to do precisely that, and it always has been. They make a point of stating that in their annual report. I will quote from the last annual report, 1988-89, page one:</PARA>
<PARA>The National Board of Employment, Education and Training is a statutory body created in July 1988 under the Employment, Education and Training Act to provide co-ordinated, independent advice to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training . . .</PARA>
<PARA>None of the members of the Board I know are likely to adopt a position where they would do anything other than fulfil the charter given to them of providing independent advice. This second reading amendment is a gross insult to the members of the Board. The reason it is a gross insult is that Senator Teague has provided not the slightest substantiation for casting this slur on the members of the Board-not the slightest. He has simply thrown this into his amendment in paragraph (c) and said that they have failed to provide independent advice, while providing absolutely no grounds whatsoever for saying so. The amendment should be rejected on those grounds alone. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to my concern about paragraph (a), knowing that the underlying reason for this to be introduced is the desire of the Opposition to return to a situation where students will pay full fees. Once again, to indicate how absurd paragraph (a) is, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, after what everyone concedes to be initial misgivings about it, has repeatedly stated publicly that the profiles process has settled down and that it now endorses the profiles process that Senator Teague wants to remove by paragraph (a) of his second reading amendment. So I urge the Senate to reject it. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now briefly to the unique im- position of a five-day tabling requirement on the reports that have to come to this Parliament. The reason the requirement is 15 days is that that is the standard time required for tabling annual reports of departments and statutory bodies. Indeed, the organisations that are required to table annual reports under this Act have never failed to comply with this requirement. There are good reasons that can be advanced for why perhaps it should be more than-not fewer than-15 sitting days. I am not proposing that because the reports in question are long and detailed and, in the case of the Higher Education Council (HEC) reports, full of tables and other statistical data which take time to absorb. It is totally unreasonable, in the true sense of the word, to expect Ministers to absorb such material and prepare considered responses to the Parliament in this time frame. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, if the February report were received by Minister Dawkins on 6 March-and it is required by the Act to be received in March-it would have to be tabled in the Senate by 14 March, five sitting days and eight calendar days later. In reference to some of the things that have been said to me tonight, to my total astonishment, I would like to hear the Democrats-because they are supporting this amendment in the committee stage-give me a good reason why these organisations should be singled out for this unique attention. It is an absurd requirement. It is one that the organisations concerned will simply have to accommodate themselves to-as they will-in what I consider to be a particularly unsatisfactory way, because otherwise they will be continually in breach of the legislation if the time by which they are required to have these reports tabled or transmitted to the Minister coincides with sittings of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out the statistics again: the average calendar time in which these reports are tabled is 42 days, which, I might add, compares very favourably indeed with any other organisation required to report to this Parliament. These organisations have never failed yet to comply with the existing statutory requirement for 15 sitting days. Why is 15 sitting days required? It was standard in the Parliament in which I spent 10 years prior to coming here. I have never heard of such an absurd reporting requirement introduced in a parliament in my life, particularly when one considers the complexity of these reports. If one likes to pick up the HEC report and look through it and see the massive amount of statistical data and the complexity of it, one sees that it is a totally unreasonable requirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Sunday I had the great pleasure to convene the first session of far north Queensland's first youth congress at Lake Tinaroo. The Far North Queensland Youth Congress is my attempt to redress some of the educational difficulties suffered by young people in far north Queensland. It basically entails four students selected from each high school in far north Queensland coming to Cairns and its surrounding area on one day each month over a period of three months to meet together to discuss the problems confronting contemporary young Australians and to offer their solutions to these problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was with great satisfaction that I noted that we had an excellent turnout at the first youth congress. In fact, we had some 80 students from all over the far north, and as far as I am concerned their participation was absolutely fabulous. They had a long open forum session in which the calibre of debate was superb. In fact I think it at times exceeded the calibre of debate we have heard in the Senate during various portions of the preceding year. The students also decided to prepare a number of discussion papers on topics of their choosing, to be produced over a period of 2 1/2 months and presented before the public and the media at the final Far North Queensland Youth Congress session in May. </PARA>
<PARA> The four topics that they chose to talk about were population growth, planning and the environment; community communications; drinking and drugs; and the difficulties associated with industry and Australian productivity. In many respects they honed in on some of the key issues facing young people in the 1990s. They were concerned, as I am sure many young Australians are concerned, about the prospect that they may leave school to go to a workplace that has no place for them. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the problems which they echoed throughout the session and which they attempted to address in the best fashion they could. Some of the things they asked were: why is it that we have to import goods from overseas; why is it that Australian workers are as unproductive as they are; and why is it that Australia's raw materials go overseas only to be imported again in a finished state? These are questions which we often debate in the Senate and I very much look forward to the contribution which these young Australians have to make to the level of debate in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the very pleasing things about the youth congress is the fact that the young people involved will have their say free from any influence or bias. I very much look forward to what they have to say and I will encourage them to talk with as many people as they possibly can in forming their views. In fact, one of the things they asked me-and I was very pleased they asked it-was whether I thought it was a good idea for them to contact unions to ask them their opinions on questions about Australian productivity. I said, yes, it would be a good idea and I encouraged them to do so, because young people need to have a balanced view and a balanced debate. For my part, I am very pleased that I can in some small way contribute to this balanced debate and to what these young people have to say about the future of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with some satisfaction that during my recent private trip to Hungary I met with the leaders of a party called Fijdesz, which is the only existing youth party in the world. The members of Fijdesz in the Hungarian Parliament all have to be below the age of 35. For many of the young people attending the youth congress, 35 may seem an enormously advanced age but, in the context of politics both in Australia and elsewhere around the world, 35 is a very youthful age. The young people in Fijdesz currently enjoy the highest popularity rating of any political party in Hungary. They enjoy that popularity rating because of the youthful vigour with which they attack the problems faced by their nation. I only hope-and I am sure that I will see-that the young people of far north Queensland attack Australia's problems and the problems of far north Queensland with a similar, if not better, youthful vigour. I believe that the solutions and suggestions that they will make to solve the problems of the region will indeed be creative and imaginative and a tribute to their skills and to themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few brief remarks about a local event I was proud to be associated with during last weekend, when I was invited to officially open the Nambrok-Denison reunion of 40 years of the soldier settlement scheme in that area of central Gippsland. Nambrok-Denison is in Victoria and I, of course, am a senator from South Australia. Honourable senators may therefore well ask why I was invited to open such a reunion. I admit proudly that I grew up on one of the farms in that area during the 1950s and early 1960s. The farmers invited me back there as one of the school kids who went through the education system at the Nambrok State School and on to Sale High School, who ultimately became a member of parliament. They were a bit bemused that I became a member of parliament for the Australian Labor Party and not the National Party of Australia, because that area is noted for giving very strong support to the National Party. The local Federal member for the area, Mr Peter McGauran, was also present, and I thank him for helping to arrange my invitation back to the area because it has been many years since I had direct connections there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I congratulate the organising committee on organising a splendid array of events over Saturday and Sunday, with a lot of historic memorabilia about the development of that area of central Gippsland in the 1950s and 1960s in particular under one of the soldier settlement programs for returned servicemen from the Second World War. My father was one of those returned servicemen and was lucky enough to be allocated a dairy farm in the settlement. Looking back on it from our perspective of the development of world agriculture, it is clear that no State or Federal government would again commit itself to the funds to develop such a program. However, in the 1950s we all believed, quite rightly, that the world was our oyster as far as agricultural production was concerned. Even the First World was short of food, so whatever we produced in the agricultural area had a reasonable market, and dairy produce was no exception. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of nearly 200 farms in that area went ahead with the commitment of the State and Federal governments to provide the funds. It was a fully irrigated district and, interestingly, the whole program went ahead with no en- vironmental impact statement. In those days that sort of thing was not considered necessary or had even been heard of. I imagine that if any similar program were put forward today there would be an extensive environmental debate about the pros and cons of irrigation for such a project. Above all else, I do not think any government of any political persuasion would now, with the state of world agricultural prices, be willing to commit the funds needed to develop a project similar to the Nambrok-Denison soldier settlement area. In some senses one can become rather sad about that, because in the 1950s we had a new community develop. People came together from a very wide range of backgrounds and from around Australia and created, literally from the ground up, a new community of families which were successful in developing a very efficient dairy industry which still today is efficient not only by Australian standards but by world standards. </PARA>
<PARA> If we travel through the area we note that it is still a prosperous area. It has its problems-no-one denies that-but it was successful. In some ways it is sad that governments will not be able to make similar commitments for such closer settlement programs in the future because of the changing nature of world agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the people of Nambrok-Denison can be very proud of what they have achieved over 40 years. As I say, they all started from scratch with very little personal support and built a community that has thrived to this day-a community that has developed a whole range of social and sporting clubs, provided education for the kids and opportunities for the children who chose not to continue as dairy farmers-and I was one of them-but to go on and make their mark elsewhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The fortieth reunion of the Nambrok-Denison settlement program was a very sentimental occasion for me. I was very honoured that I was asked to do the official opening but, above all else, I was very pleased to be able to pay tribute to the hard work of the soldier settlers of the 1950s who established a unique community that still thrives today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been encouraged to take just a couple of minutes of the Senate's time on the adjournment debate to mention the matter of Ravenshoe again. Senator Richardson is on duty in the chamber and he may be able to assist me in something I simply cannot follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Richardson might recall that on 14 November in the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), I raised the question of whether the door had finally shut on the application for some money from the Government to assist those business people in Ravenshoe who had extended credit to the Ravenshoe mill on the understanding that the Government would be funding the mill for a 10-year period. With a reasonable understanding of those businesses, and with the knowledge that the Government had committed itself to a 10-year funding period, they extended the 90-day credit and when the mill went into receivership, of course, they lost moneys. A number of businesses have lost moneys ranging from a couple of thousand dollars up to $80,000. This has ruined some businesses and the lives of the people who ran those businesses previously. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson gave me some encouragement when he said that the door was not shut, it was slightly ajar, and that the matter was still under consideration. Subsequently, on 14 December 1990, I received a reply from the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, to a letter I had written on 18 July 1990. The dates are somewhat instructive-it took several months to get a reply. In that reply, Mrs Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA> Your letter notes that local businesses in Ravenshoe are owed $270,000 in unsecured debts as a result of the company going into receivership. These debts occurred because of the commercial failure by the company and are not due to the World Heritage Listing. They are a matter for resolution between the unsecured creditors and the Receivers. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say that because of that it was not the Government's fault. She took no responsibility and said that in normal commercial terms the unsecured creditors have to sort it out with the receivers. I am not sure whether that letter was dictated before or after Senator Richardson made his comments one month before. I had not given up hope, and still have not, that something might eventually be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I have chosen to speak tonight because Mrs Kelly, in answering a question from Mr Chaney today in the House of Representatives, said-and I quote part of her answer:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I give a commitment to this House that, first of all, every effort has been made and is continuing to be made to keep that mill open as an ongoing process. There are still some discussions going on between my Department and another potential purchaser. I do not know if that will come to anything at this stage, but I can guarantee that there will be full discussions about that. </PARA>
<PARA> On the second issue of the workers, and they are obviously a group about whom I am very concerned, we have already had some discussions with the union. I give my personal commitment that every effort will be made to protect the workers, hopefully to give them jobs and, if not, to give them a package that they feel would be justified, particularly those who were employed at the time of the World Heritage decision. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly; that is my point. We have tried for seven or eight months to get a commitment from the Minister-in many cases these people have lost everything because of their situation-and we have not been able to get that commitment. In one fell swoop today the Minister has said that she is going to look after the workers-the unionists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have always agreed-Senator Richardson will acknowledge this-that the Government has no legal compulsion to help those businessmen who gave credit to that mill; I have always acknowledged that. I have said that the Government has a moral obligation to look after them. It is a special one off case. It would not be taken as a precedent because those businesses, with all the hullabaloo, the publicity and everything that happened at Ravenshoe, understood-as did the rest of Australia-that the Government would be supervising the funds given, would be supervising the mill, and would continue with its commitment to fund the mill for 10 years. Although I acknowledge that the Government had no legal compulsion to look after those debts, it certainly had a moral obligation. But today the Government has no legal obligation whatsoever to provide redundancy packages, or any other sorts of packages, for the workers at Ravenshoe. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that Mrs Kelly has given a commitment to look after the workers because, on the same basis, the Government has no legal compulsion to look after those workers, but it does have a moral obligation. I congratulate Mrs Kelly for doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask-possibly Senator Richardson could answer this for me-what is the difference? Why is it that the unionists can be compensated and given redundancy packages-if honourable senators have followed what has happened at the Cairns port, they will know that there were redundancy packages of $100,000 and more-yet the businessmen who gave credit ranging from $2,000 to $80,000 cannot get relief? What is the difference? I hope that Senator Richardson might be able to answer that for me. If he cannot answer tonight-I accept and appreciate that he is not the relevant Minister-I hope that he will be able to get an answer for me. I will certainly continue pursuing that matter in all avenues available to me until an answer is received. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can answer briefly from memory, given that I am resorting to what is a fallible quantity in terms of my memory, let alone quality. I will have to check the details tomorrow. From memory, a structural adjustment package was announced at the time of World Heritage some years ago. As part of that package, I would think-as I said, I will have to check it with Mrs Kelly in the morning-that at least those workers who were employed at the mill at the time of World Heritage, and who are still there now, would probably have some claim because I think they would come within the ambit of the original structural adjustment package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will try to get a response in writing on that tomorrow. That would be where there would be a difference. </PARA>
<PARA> Under that package, from memory there is nothing like $100,000 available to workers. There was a limit set, which was far lower than that. In fact, I am sure it was less than $50,000 and perhaps even less than $40,000. I will get those details for the honourable senator and try to provide it to him in writing tomorrow. Also, of course, I will have to ascertain whether or not a final decision has been taken on assistance to those businesses as well. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) Under Section 620 E(E) (the Pressler Amendment) to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1971, U.S. aid to Pakistan can only continue if the President certifies to Congress each year, that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device and that a continuation of U.S. aid will reduce the risk that Pakistan will obtain such a device.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) The U.S. Government has not elaborated on the reasons for its inability to issue a certification in 1990. It has confirmed that it has complied with the law and suspended all military assistance and new economic aid to Pakistan due to the absence of certification at the beginning of the new U.S. fiscal year. It has stated that the matter remains under discussion between the U.S. and Pakistan.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) The particular issue of the operation of U.S. legislation is a bilateral matter between the U.S. and Pakistan.</PARA>
<PARA>The question of nuclear proliferation is, however, a major concern to the Government. The Government has long given strong and active support to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards system, and is working hard with other governments to ensure that the nuclear nonproliferation regime remains effective in the 1990s. Nuclear proliferation in South Asia is not in the interest of either India or Pakistan, nor in the interest of regional or international security.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has made clear its concern to the Governments of Pakistan and India. It has consistently urged both countries to demonstrate conclusively that they are not pursuing a nuclear weapons option by joining the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons or at the very least by placing all their nuclear facilities under fullscope safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) Given that the Government regards suspension of U.S. aid as a bilateral matter between Pakistan and the United States, the conduct of our trade relationship with Pakistan will not be affected. As Pakistan is not a member of the NPT, it is not an approved destination for Australian uranium.</PARA>
<PARA>Nuclear and other sensitive exports to any destination are subject to stringent control under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The illegal fishing issue is complex and no single solution has been identified. Although a range of measures to redress the problem can be employed, the main option for deterring illegal fishing activity is the maintenance of a high level of surveillance and enforcement in the north and north western areas of the Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ). The issue is an important matter on the Australian-Indonesian bilateral agenda and the Indonesian Government is cooperating fully in attempts to resolve the problem. Australia provides the Indonesian Government with intelligence (eg on financiers) obtained from Indonesian fishermen who are apprehended for poaching.</PARA>
<PARA> The strong financial incentive to seek trochus and shark fin continues, even though the risks of apprehension are high. The surveillance program for the northwest and the procedures for processing and sentencing Indonesian fishermen are being reviewed to ensure that the maximum deterrent effect, consistent with our international obligations, is achieved in a cost effective way. Longer term solutions may include the development of alternative income generating opportunities for the relevant Indonesian communities in eastern Indonesia, eg trochus and seaweed culture. A significant proportion of the Australian aid vote to Indonesia is already directed to the eastern provinces.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) When a boat is taken into custody by fisheries authorities, both the boat and crew are first inspected by Quarantine Officers for quarantine problems. The boat is then taken to a holding area where it is held until Court proceedings have concluded. If the boats are forfeited as a result of those Court proceedings, the boats are disposed of in accordance with procedures set down by the Department of Administrative Services and the Australian Fisheries Service.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) When a boat has been apprehended a small quantity of shell is retained as evidence in Court proceedings that follow, the remainder of the shell is returned to the reef.</PARA>
