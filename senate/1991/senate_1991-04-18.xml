<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio. That our Parliament immediately end this association between healthy sports and the deaths of 18,300 people in Australia each year from tobacco-related diseases.</PARA>

<PARA>The Hon John Kerin MP</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Primary Industries and Energy</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Regulations, Statutory Rules 1991 No. 4, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 7 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Regulation 11 provides a penalty for a person who fails to make certain records and prepare accounts. Other provisions in the Regulations require the payment of levies and charges (r.3), require a person to give the Secretary information (r.7, 8, 9) and require a statement to be given to the processor (r.10). The penalty in r.11 does not appear to attach to these provisions. Your advice would be appreciated as to whether there is intended to be a penalty for breach of these provisions. In particular, could you advise whether there is a penalty for failure to pay the levies or charges, which is revenue owing to the Commonwealth or to its instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee appreciates that penalties may exist for these offences elsewhere, such as in the parent Act or some other Act. In such cases the Committee believes that penalties should be clearly set out in the Explanatory Statement. It is, however, preferable if all penalties could be set out in the instrument itself. In any event, it would appear to be a breach of personal liberties if penalty provisions are included in delegated legislation with no indication to those affected of what those penalties are. </PARA>
<PARA>Your advice would be appreciated. </PARA>

<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for your letter of 11 March 1991 concerning the penalties applying to breaches of the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Regulations (Statutory Rules 1991 No 4). </PARA>
<PARA>The penalties relating to breaches of Regulations 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are set out in the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Act 1990 (the Act). </PARA>
<PARA>The penalty for non-payment of levies and charges, a breach of Regulation 3, is set out in section 8 of the Act. The penalty is a compounding rate of 2% per month of the total of outstanding levy and charge payments and any penalty that has accrued previously. Penalty ceases to accrue when only penalty remains outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA>The penalty for breaches of Regulations 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are set out in section 17 of the Act. The penalty for failing, without reasonable excuse, to provide a return or information is $6,000. The penalty for providing a false or misleading return or information is imprisonment for 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA>Regulation 10 details the information that must be given to a processor if a person wishes to claim an exemption from levy under paragraph 5 (2) (d) of the Cattle Transaction Levy Act 1990. If a statement is not provided, the person is charged a levy. Although section 17 of the Act also applies to this Regulation, it would in practice only be applied in the case of a person providing a false or misleading statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The majority of the penalties were set out in the Act because there is a limit to the amount of penalty that may be imposed by Regulations, and heavier penalties must be imposed by the enabling Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I appreciate your concerns that the apparent absence of penalties could be seen as misleading. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that it is reluctant to adopt the practice of putting a note in Regulations drawing attention to the relevant provisions of an Act except in a special case as it is always necessary to read Regulations in the context of the enabling Act. In this instance, however, the Department does see the insertion of a note as a possibility. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe it would be worthwhile amending these particular Regulations given that they will soon be superseded by Regulations under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. This Act incorporates the provisions of the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Act 1990 and several other levy and charge collection Acts falling within the administration of my portfolio. The new Act and its associated Regulations are expected to take effect from 1 July 1991. Your concerns will be taken into consideration when these Regulations are being drafted. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours fraternally</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to continuing reports concerning the poor state of bilateral relations with Malaysia. I further refer to the Minister's answer to a question in November relating to the cancellation of high level talks with Malaysia, in which he dismissed any suggestion that relations with Malaysia gave cause for concern with, `I do not deign to comment'. Will the Minister now deign to comment? Will the Minister explain to the Senate why the Government took so long to acknowledge the seriousness of the problem and to take steps to restore relations with an important regional neighbour?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2683" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I did not deign to comment about in November was a remarkably fatuous addition to the substance of the question that was originally asked of me by Senator Hill-not unusual from him. I did make it clear in the substance of my answer, however-and I refer to it-on 8 November, that there was some negative reaction at senior government level in Malaysia to what had been perceived as offensive elements in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation series. I did acknowledge further down in that answer that there were misunderstandings which obviously existed between the two countries. I expressed the hope that those misunderstandings would shortly be resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On other occasions I have made it perfectly clear in public comment that there is something of a problem in terms of our relationship. It is not a problem that I would wish then or now to exaggerate. It is a problem that we are living with and seeking quietly and patiently to work our way through. There are a number of conflicting and competing signals, which make it a difficult situation to read. There have been a number of negative comments, publicly made, and a number of actions taken, which have not been helpful in terms of maintaining the full flourish of our traditionally very warm bilateral relationship.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, there have been a number of contrary indications that this is a problem whose magnitude, I say again, should not be exaggerated. Senator Robert Ray is shortly to visit Malaysia for a full bilateral visit. Prime Minister Mahathir has indicated as recently as yesterday that he is very willing to sit down and talk about the issues with Prime Minister Hawke in the middle of this year. Yesterday the High Commissioner, Frank Murray, was invited to and did attend an open house reception at the Prime Minister's residence. There has as yet been no indication that such difficulties as there are have, in fact, produced any serious problems in terms of our commercial, trade and investment relationship.</PARA>
<PARA> There are obviously issues which do require discussion between the two countries and we will address that. But the problem is not helped by jumping up and down and trying to make more of it than is in fact the case. I would hope that Senator Hill could on this, as on other matters, pay a little less attention to what he regards as his partisan obligations and a little more attention to his obligations as a Senate leader and spokesperson to act in a way that is beneficial to the interests of this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. What action has the Australian Government taken in response to the continuing violence and human rights breaches in Sri Lanka?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2684" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have indicated on a number of occasions, the Australian Government continues to be deeply disturbed by events in Sri Lanka and by the consequent tragic loss of life, particularly in the north of the country. Over the past month there have been major clashes between Government security forces and Tamil Tigers in the Northern Mannar district. The aerial bombardment by the Sri Lankan Air Force in the area has eased. However, we do continue to receive reports of massacres of civilians by Government security forces and of Singhalese and Moslems by the Tamil Tigers, particularly in the east. For example, it was reported on 28 March that five Singhalese were killed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to the west of Amparai. On 31 March, 12 Tamil civilians were killed by the Batticaloa police. On 3 April the LTTE killed at least 11 and perhaps as many as 40 Singhalese and Moslem fishermen fishing in the Trincomalee Bay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Through bilateral contacts, as well as in multilateral forums, the Australian Government has urged both the Sri Lankan Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam to end the fighting and to return to the negotiating table. We have repeatedly emphasised to the Sri Lankan Government the need to curb abuses committed by its security forces, although we do realise that the abuses which are occurring are not the sole responsibility of any one party to the conflict.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian statement to the forty-seventh session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in February this year underlined our ongoing concerns. We have also responded in other ways by contributing, for example, a total of $450,000 in emergency assistance to help alleviate the suffering of Sri Lankan civilians caught up in the hostilities. This assistance has been channelled through Australian and international organisations such as Australian Catholic Relief, Save the Children Fund and Community Aid Abroad.</PARA>
<PARA> This chamber has considered the Sri Lankan issue on a number of occasions, most recently on 7 March when we made clear our continuing support for an initiative involving the Commonwealth and hoped that President Premadasa and his Government would find it possible to respond positively to it. We will continue to make those representations to the Sri Lankan Government.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to conclude by saying that while there is a role for governments such as Australia in seeking to encourage a peaceful solution to the tragic situation in Sri Lanka, there is also a very real and constructive role to be played by members of the Tamil and Singhalese communities in Australia and elsewhere.

I refer the Minister to his extensive press briefing yesterday about major changes to force structure and civilianisation of service jobs which he will announce in the Senate on 6 June. In view of the Minister's statements to the Senate Estimates Committee on the Defence estimates less than 24 hours prior to this briefing that he would not permit public discussion on these proposals before the statement, would he now revise this attitude? In light of speculation that one of the proposals he is considering is to cut the Regular Army's combat strength from six to four battalions, will the Minister give a commitment not to cut the existing capability of our combat forces?</PARA></TALK.START>

The figure of $4.387 billion is for April 1989, and the figure given by Mr Bilney for April 1990 is correct.

Until that first step is taken by the Tasmanian police authorities, none of the consequential seeking of displacing Australia's primary jurisdiction gets under way.

At the end of the answer to this question, I will table the correspondence from myself to Mr Hartcher. In my correspondence to Mr Hartcher, I made a number of points. I drew his attention to the FARB fairness code for broadcasters and specifically to article 1 of the code, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That to the best of our ability we will ensure the presentation of news and information with due accuracy and impartiality.</PARA>
<PARA>FARB claim that the code is a self-regulating code, and that it is best observed. I quote article 5 of the code:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the successful operation of this Code depends on the spirit in which it is observed, and the exercise of reasonable judgment and good faith by broadcasters themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>I drew Mr Hartcher's attention to the fact that, in a number of advertisements organised and authorised by FARB, assertions were made which are totally inaccurate and that, as a consequence, that inaccuracy has led to a breach of that self-regulatory code that FARB has imposed on broadcasters. For instance, in one advertisement there is an assertion that:</PARA>
<PARA>This could be the last time you hear a radio announcement criticising an elected Government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is patently untrue. It may be something that the Opposition is trying to assert in the debate, but we have made it very clear that what we are tackling by our attempt to contain the costs of political advertising is advertisements. We are not in any way stifling or impinging upon news, current affairs or any other commentary or documentary on radio or television.

<PARA> The advertisement is littered with inaccuracies. It goes on to say that the Government will be free to advertise to `push their own . . . policies'.

<PARA> Apparently, FARB is going to write back to me to tell me that my correspondence to it will be circulated to its member broadcasters. If that is the case, if that is the response that comes through, it is just not good enough. We have here an industry which asserts to the public that it has a fairness code which it observes. We do not intend to, and would not, come in from the outside. But we say to this industry that if it presents to the Australian public a fairness in broadcasting code; if it presents itself as an industry which can regulate itself responsibly and be fair broadcasters in-quoting article 5 of its code-`the spirit in which it is observed' in a self-regulatory way; if FARB claims for itself the right, the responsibility and the authority to implement this code, it is therefore up to the FARB executive to ask that this advertisement, which it has produced itself and authorised, be rectified to the extent of its inaccuracies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, while I am disappointed at the Premier's change of heart as to the need for the full disclosure legislation, it really does not come as any surprise. When looking at the immediate history of this particular issue, we see that in May last year Commissioner Roden's report from the Independent Commission Against Corruption on north coast development in New South Wales was quite clear in the recommendations it made to the Government and to the parliamentary process in New South Wales. The report identified glaring loopholes in current laws for disclosure in New South Wales and it very clearly and directly called on all parties to support improved disclosure laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Greiner's response to that was quite equivocal. He set up a committee of the Parliament. I believed then, and we see now, that that committee was, obviously, just a pretence to buy time. Instead of acting immediately to draft legislation-which could now be law in New South Wales-Mr Greiner established a parliamentary committee. It is interesting to note that at the time, in May last year, Mr Greiner was quoted in a newspaper article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>This is not an exercise to put it off until the 1996 election or anything like that . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Should an election be held now, the effect of the committee process is to ensure that the matter is put off until 1995. There is a bit of deja vu about all this, especially when one listens to Dr Hewson these days. In the same newspaper article Mr Greiner also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our intention is to bring forward effective legislation on these matters prior to the next election.</PARA>
<PARA>It is definitely not the intention of the Government to put off the issue beyond the next election.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Greiner's response is in stark contrast to that of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Carr, who then made a very clear commitment to support full disclosure, as recommended by Mr Roden at the time the report was released.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Carr's commitment was quite different from that of the National Party of Australia. The National Party believed that disclosure was not in the best public interest. This was because the Roden report was scathingly critical of the activities of the National Party in New South Wales and its abuse of the disclosure laws in that State.</PARA>
<PARA> I go on to the second part of Senator Aulich's question in relation to Mr Greiner's comments regarding national legislation. I understand that Mr Greiner said that it made `significant sense' for there to be a national approach to this problem. The Government agrees that there needs to be a coordinated disclosure legislation approach throughout the Commonwealth. We will raise this with the States once our legislation goes through Parliament. At that stage, the coalition parties throughout the country will be put on the spot as to their commitment to the people of Australia. Those people will be able to test their bona fides in relation to their stated support for disclosure legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said, in New South Wales Mr Carr has already made Labor's position clear. On 6 December 1990, he called for uniform Federal election funding laws. Given the National Party's response in New South Wales, we ask ourselves: what chance is there for a bipartisan response from that Parliament? It is not only New South Wales: even in Western Australia the Liberal Party has taken a similarly equivocal position to its Federal colleagues on disclosure. The National Party leader, Mr Cowan, is far less equivocal.</PARA>
<PARA> The time is coming for the Opposition. It has made statements in this Parliament in recent days saying that it supports disclosure-although quite limited and quite qualified and nowhere near the extent that is necessary to gain any confidence in its stated policy. I am sure that, as time evolves, those statements will be put to the test, not only in this Parliament but also in State parliaments. The Opposition's bona fides will be tested. I think we will find that its support for disclosure will develop into one that will be as reluctant as Mr Greiner's. It will try to find any way possible, any mechanism possible and any fallacious argument possible, as in the past, to oppose and try to defeat legislation which will make this parliamentary process transparent and open to the Australian public.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. Basically, from the question and the point of order, it is quite clear to those people in this Parliament, and I am sure it will be quite clear to the people who may be listening to or watching this Question Time, that the Liberal Party does not acknowledge or understand the point of the concern out in the community. The concern out there is twofold: the cost of running campaigns in our society, and the need to ensure an open and transparent system so that the political parties and the process are open to public scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise two very basic and simple principles, and all I get is abuse and interjections from the troglodytes on the other side. The basic point is that over the last three election campaigns the cost of electronic advertising has increased from $6 1/2m in 1984 to close to $19m, if not $20m, at the last election. In Australia we are spending something like $2.20 per elector on campaigning. In the United States (US) for a presidential election campaign the two major candidates are given $50m, which comes out to something like 20c per elector. That is not the total cost of campaigning in the US, but per head we probably exceed the US in the amount of money that we in this country spend on campaigning.</PARA>
<PARA> There is an acknowledgment by this side of the Parliament and people out in the community that the cost of campaigning must be contained. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters targeted, as legitimate areas to address, not only electronic broadcasting or electronic advertising, but also the cost of campaigning. I will close on this point: advertising is not freedom of speech; advertising is bought speech and it is very expensively bought speech. It costs $13,000 per minute to exercise. It is available only to people in the electorate on the basis of the level of their bank accounts. It is an inherently undemocratic medium.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a result of Senator Kernot having taken up this question in the Senate previously, I spoke to the Minister for Transport and Communications about it and he has provided me with the following response. The original radio program has achieved some success, but has also met serious delays. Ten new commercial radio services are now on air, following the announcement of the program. Three more licences have been granted and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has five inquiries into further licences under way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that the current program has not been effective in achieving the Government's objectives to introduce FM radio services into regional areas quickly and, where possible, as competing services. The reasons include changes in the economy and the broadcasting industry and also some deficiencies in the strategy. In addition, the present scheme unduly limits the access of existing broadcasters to the FM spectrum by placing too great an emphasis on supplementary licences and severely restricting the circumstances in which the conversion will be approved. The Minister would prefer to see such choices determined on a more commercial basis and intends that conversion should be an option in both sole and multi-station markets.</PARA>
<PARA> In reviewing the program, the Minister has found no reason to suggest that the Government abandoned the objectives of the program. However, he acknowledges that conditions in regional radio markets may not be as favourable to the introduction of new competitive services as was previously the case now that commercial radio revenue is declining.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport and Communications is developing an approach which will give maximum opportunity for all means of introducing FM services, and interested parties are now being consulted. A number of industry groups, representing both established radio operators and aspiring licensees, have already responded. The Minister intends to seek any necessary Cabinet agreement after these consultations are completed with the aim of seeing a substantial number of regional FM services initiated in the second half of this year.</PARA>

I had hoped the Nationals would do it on the basis of two motivations: that they could offer to give expert evidence in helping us draft the legislation, or that they would dob in some of their mates.

It really does not fit the reality.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator O'Chee raises the question of audit provisions. Senator O'Chee should know that we have audit provisions in the Federal electoral Act, which have been there since about 1983-84. They provide for spot audits. In 1984, after the Federal election, the Australian Electoral Commission decided that it would conduct spot audits into the major parties. The Australian Labor Party indicated that it was prepared to have an audit of its accounts. Contrary to the spirit of an agreement that had been reached before the election, the Liberal Party of Australia responded with legal advice saying, `You cannot do it; you have to have reasonable suspicion of certain events having taken place to trigger off the audit'. The Liberal Party produced this advice and as a consequence of that instance in 1984-Liberal Party frustration of the auditing process-the audit provisions in the legislation have essentially been inoperable since then. Those provisions were rendered inoperable by a deliberate act of the Liberal Party.</PARA>

<PARA> I am further informed, and I believe, that in Queensland the Industrial Relations Act does require a registered auditor to audit union books. Those frameworks are already in legislation. It comes back to enforcement thereof. In that instance, one has to enforce the provisions. In our instance, we are talking about the first step, and that is a step of getting the legislation in place so it can then be enforced.

<PARA> Nissan Australia was awarded the overall prize for its outstanding equal opportunity program and, specifically, for its strategy to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace, its consultation on child-care and its video on equal opportunity and award restructuring. Nissan produced a video on equal opportunity, award restructuring and a team concept which was made available to its work force in both English and, because of the high migrant content of its work force, Vietnamese as well. Workers from Nissan participated in the making of the video, which was funded in part by my Department to the tune of $30,000 as a grant to promote this type of development in the workplace.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Social Security. I ask: has the Minister seen a report in yesterday's Melbourne Age that claims departmental documents contradict his statement to the Senate on 18 February regarding advertising in an Australian Council of Trade Unions-sponsored Cleo supplement in March? Is the article accurate and does the Minister still believe that it was an excellent use of the Department's money?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article in the Age newspaper by Margo Kingston. I have no doubt that Margo Kingston would have got this from Senator Alston. As most honourable senators would be aware, that would be a pretty shaky source. Like me, Senator Crowley was in attendance at the Senate Estimates committee meeting, and I can recall Senator Walters and Senator Patterson being there. I am sure that they would not have been the source because they are much more accurate. I would have to say that this article was inaccurate in every respect and was no more than a disgraceful beat-up. The article makes it appear that in some way an internal document from the Department of Social Security was obtained from Senator Alston and that it was a secret document that has somehow embarrassingly fallen off the back of a truck. It was handed over quite willingly by the Department during the Estimates committee hearing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point to make is that the document concerned was an internal departmental document. At least the Age did manage to get that part right, and it was the only part. The point about that internal document is that it was one that I had never seen. As the officers made clear at the Estimates committee meeting the other evening, not only had I not seen it but also it had not been discussed with me. It was simply from that unit which deals with our public relations. When that unit first had a look at the idea about Cleo, it decided that it did not like it much. Once the unit got into it and further examined it, that section of the Department changed its mind and referred it to the Secretary of the Department who supported the recommendations to go ahead with it. The idea that in some way this means that what I said in the Senate was contradicted is nonsense. In fact, it backed up everything that I had said in the statement that I made in the Senate some time ago.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the article suggests that the Department got only one page for its money. That was also corrected, directly and specifically, at the meeting the other evening. Far from getting one page for its money, the Department got one full page black and white advertisement, three pages of advertorial content with colour photographs and a further distribution of 500,000 copies of the supplement to female union members. That means that there is a potential readership of the supplement of 1 1/2 million. At $45,000, that makes the cost about 3c a head. I would suggest that was an excellent use of the Department's money. I do not blame Senator Alston. Everyone here has seen how much of a problem he has in coming to grips with the portfolio. At least honourable senators would think that those who are in Michelle Gratton's charge would get it a bit right.</PARA>

I said that I would look at whether any issues arose for my attention as a result. I have now had an opportunity to read the relevant extract from the transcript. There appears to be nothing more in Mr Connell's evidence to the commission than appeared in the original newspaper story. If anything, there is rather less.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A contact between Mr Burke and Mr Connell in May 1988 was described, but no specific allegation of impropriety is made. The matter is not taken further by counsel or the commission, and the whole exchange occupies no more than a few lines of transcript. Furthermore, the contact in question took place at a time when Mr Burke, although ambassador-designate in the sense that his appointment had been announced, was not yet on the Commonwealth payroll and not engaged in pre-posting consultations. Rather, he was in Perth clearing up his personal affairs prior to taking up the job.</PARA>
<PARA> It remains the case, as the Prime Minister clearly stated yesterday, and as I have said on numerous earlier occasions, that this Government will not consider taking any action in relation to Mr Burke's occupancy of his post merely on the basis of allegations of improper behaviour. In this instance, quite apart from anything else, it is not even clear that an allegation has been made. In all the circumstances, I do not propose to take this matter any further.</PARA>

<PARA>SUBJECT: Supplementary Question from Senator Coulter</PARA>
<PARA> HANSARD 17 APRIL 1991-Arsenic in Seaweed</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Community Services and Health has supplied the following reply to the Hon. Senator's supplementary question.</PARA>
<PARA> ``I understand that the Food Science and Technology Subcommittee (FST) at its 81st meeting in February 1991 considered the question of the public health implications of arsenic in imported seaweed and determined that on the limited toxicological data available to it, it was not possible to recommend a change to the food and arsenic level combinations specified by the Food Standards Code (FSC). The subcommittee did not consider the significance of cadmium in seaweed.</PARA>
<PARA> At its March 1991 meeting, the Public Health Committee reviewed an independent toxicological report assessing the public health implications of both inorganic and organic arsenic and cadmium in seaweed. The report assessed all available scientific data on inorganic and organic arsenic in seaweed, including recent data not available to FST, as well as the implications for health of the levels of cadmium detected. The report concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA> consumption of inorganic arsenic at the levels found in six out of seven seaweed samples assessed by Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS), would be well below the internationally accepted intake level set by the Joint Who Health Organisation/Food and Agricultural Organisation Expert Committee on Food Additives;</PARA>
<PARA> the majority of organic arsenic in seaweed is in the form of arsenosugars (ribofuranosides) which are rapidly excreted in the urine and therefore pose no toxicological hazard to human health;</PARA>
<PARA> overall, there was no evidence to suggest that the current levels of organic arsenic compounds found in seaweed constitute a risk to human health;</PARA>
<PARA> The permissible levels of cadmium in seaweeds need to be set in line with other potential dietary sources of cadmium.</PARA>
<PARA>The report indicated the need for:</PARA>
<PARA> further research on the nature and properties of organic arsenic in seaweed;</PARA>
<PARA> AQIS to undertake a comprehensive monitoring program of cadmium, organic and inorganic arsenic levels in imported seaweed over the next two years;</PARA>
<PARA> AQIS to be asked to provide detailed data on the different types of seaweeds entering Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I am advised that the Public Health Committee supported the thrust of these conclusions and agreed to recommend an interim standard pending the provision of more comprehensive data. The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service is being asked to establish a comprehensive monitoring program. The NHMRC will maintain a continuing review of the recommended standard.''</PARA>

Inc. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's standing cannot be put at risk by the need to protect mates. In the case of Ireland and the Holy See Australia's representation is in the hands of Mr Brian Burke. Senators might be interested to know what the terms of his appointment are. What are the letters of credence? While the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade apparently does not have a copy specifically in relation to Mr Burke, it is able to give the form. It is in the form of a letter from Mr Bill Hayden, the Governor-General of Australia, to the President of the Republic of Ireland and His Holiness the Pope, in the case of the Holy See. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Your Excellency,</PARA>
<PARA> Being desirous to maintain and promote without interruption the relations of amity and concord which so happily exist between-</PARA>
<PARA>Ireland, the Holy See-</PARA>
<PARA>and Australia, I have appointed-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Brian Burke--</PARA>
<PARA>to reside near You in the character of Ambassador-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Burke's-</PARA>
<PARA>high character, ability and commitment to duty assure me that he will discharge the duties of his Mission in such a manner as to merit Your approval and esteem. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore request that Your Excellency receive him favourably and give full credence to all that he may communicate to You in the name of Australia, and especially when he renews to You the assurance of my continuing interest in and good wishes for-</PARA>
<PARA>Ireland and the Holy See. Here is Mr Burke, in the name of Australia under the name of Bill Hayden, the Governor-General of Australia, put to Ireland and the Holy See as a man of high character, ability and commitment to duty with the responsibility of speaking for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, Mr Burke is the highest representative of Australia in Ireland and the Holy See. If there is a question mark over Mr Burke, there is a question mark over Australia. No Australian government, meeting its national responsibility, can allow that to happen. No foreign Minister, in particular, meeting his responsibility of protecting Australia's standing internationally, can permit such a situation to continue. No ambassador with any real interest in Australia's international reputation could not stand down in the circumstances in which Mr Burke finds himself today. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference here is that Mr Burke operates at a different level from other ambassadors. He is a Labor hero; he is a Labor mate. Labor mates look after each other. In this instance, Mr Burke has mates at the highest level who put loyalty to their mate ahead of their duty. We understand that Mr Hawke, Mr Keating, Senator Richardson and Mr Beazley are Mr Burke's mates. They are his security blanket; they are his protectors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), who must know that his failure to act is in dereliction of his duty, regrettably has not the strength to stand up to the Beazleys, Hawkes, Keatings and Richardsons. I regret to say that that will forever be a mark against the record of Senator Evans who, we are prepared to acknowledge, has worked hard for Australia's interests in other ways. In this instance, Senator Evans has sold Australia short and, in doing so, he has sold himself short. We understand that Senator Evans owes the Party and apparently is prepared to accept the tarnishing of his reputation out of this failure to act, out of this abdication of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> If it had been any other diplomat, any professional diplomat, not one of Labor's political mates, he would have been pulled back a long time ago. Senator Evans, with anguish on his face, would have said in this place that it is something he regretted having to do but something that had to be done in Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious allegations have been made against Mr Burke-allegations of gross impropriety for the way he conducted the business of government when he was Premier of Western Australia. Mr Deputy President, you will know that now the allegations go even beyond the time when he was Premier of Western Australia; there is now evidence before the Royal Commission that Mr Burke involved himself in a Western Australia Inc. deal after he had quit politics and whilst he was ambassador-designate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to stress that we have not said that Mr Burke is guilty of any offence. We acknowledge that he has not been charged with any offence, let alone been found guilty of any offence. That is not the point. The point is: what is the proper conduct in these circumstances where he is faced with these allegations, particularly now when there is a royal commission investigating these allegations? The proper course of action is for Mr Burke to stand down while these allegations are being tested. </PARA>
<PARA> In some ways, that might seem harsh. It might seem harsh on the individual to have to stand down in such circumstances. But when in public office, it is part of the cost of that office, because protection of the office must come first. That is why the precedent is well established: Phillip Lynch in 1977; Mick Young in 1984; Neville Wran in 1986. To stand down is not to be judged guilty; it is to do the right thing to protect the office. In this case, because Mr Burke is an ambassador of Australia, to stand down is to protect the national interest. If Mr Burke cannot see that, the Minister should act. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Burke has not acted and that is why we have said and say again today that the Minister should act. For months, Senator Evans, faced with this issue, has refused to act. We can go back to 6 November last year when we raised the issue of the relationship of Mr Burke to the convicted phone tapper, Smith. Mr Burke now admits that he was paying for a dirt search on a Liberal politician.</PARA>
<PARA> What was Senator Evans's response? He said on that day:</PARA>
<PARA>I have no knowledge of the article -</PARA>
<PARA>he referred to an article in the press-</PARA>
<PARA>or report to which he-</PARA>
<PARA>that was Senator Crichton-Browne-</PARA>
<PARA>refers. I will dig it up-</PARA>
<PARA>which seems to be an apt choice of words in the circumstances-</PARA>
<PARA>and see what action may be appropriate in all the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>A week later, on reflection, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think there is any foundation for any suggestion of improper behaviour on the part of the former Premier . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So he tells us that these circumstances, where Mr Burke has now subsequently acknowledged that on his last return to Australia he did engage this now convicted phone tapper Smith to gather material on Liberal politicians, are not a matter of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the chamber believe that that is a demonstration of an appalling standard. It demonstrates to us that Mr Burke, on those circumstances alone, is not a fit and proper person to have been appointed to the office that he now holds. That is not to suggest illegality. That is to say that, in our opinion, he clearly behaved in a grossly improper way, a way which is not in accordance with the standard of all decent Australians. But he was, as I said, absolved by Senator Evans. Of course, he was absolved because he is a Labor mate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the ensuing months, Senator Evans constantly changed his position. He ducked and weaved. Sometimes he said he would not look at the evidence; sometimes he said that he would not act on the evidence. When he was presented with examples, particularly by Senator Campbell, of conflicting evidence by Mr Burke to other inquiries and commissions in Western Australia, what did he say? Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA>If and when some evidence emerges through the courts or a Royal Commission of something which would make it inappropriate for the ambassadorial position to be maintained I will act, but not sooner.</PARA>
<PARA>On 17 December he said, `That may well be in the context. Something might develop in the context of a commission. That could be the type of evidentiary status that I am talking about'. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, on 21 February, as we continued to pursue this question, urging Senator Evans to meet his responsibility, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>If and when some hard evidence emerges through the courts or a Royal Commission of something which would make it inappropriate for his ambassadorial posting to be maintained I will act, but not sooner. </PARA>
<PARA>`If some evidence emerges through the courts or a Royal Commission'. On other occasions, as I said, Senator Evans simply refused to look at the material. I remind the Senate of a long list of documents that were brought to his attention by Senator Campbell on 21 December. Senator Evans's answer as to whether he would examine that material to see whether the Ambassador was acting in a proper way was, simply, `No'. </PARA>
<PARA> Then when evidence started appearing through the Royal Commission, Senator Evans changed his position again. In that instance he said that he would await the outcome of the Commission. So we went through a sequence: first that he would look at the evidence that was put before a royal commission; when evidence started to appear, he said that he would await determination by the Royal Commission. In that instance, on 13 March, he said that he would `await the outcome of those Royal Commission proceedings'. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, now he has gone one step further in that he made what could be described as the final reversal the other day when, on 10 April, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>If such an allegation were made otherwise than in the context of the currently proceeding Royal Commission, of course I would investigate it . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So now the allegations are being made in the Commission and evidence is being put before the Commission, Senator Evans is in trouble because of the previous undertakings he gave. So he takes a step in another direction and says, `If it had occurred other than in a royal commission, I would look at it'. But, yet, he refused to look at Senator Campbell's evidence that had been put before him. </PARA>
<PARA> We have this pattern of stone-walling, changing positions, a failure to look at the evidence and a failure to act. That, we argue, is failing to face up to the responsibility of being Minister. But in addition to that there is the embarrassment of Mr Burke degrading his office even further when he returned to Australia last month and embarked on a media circus-even doing a talk-back program under the title `Ask the Ambassador'. This was Mr Burke in full political swing. What did Senator Evans say in answer to another question on 5 March? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is something of a convention that ambassadors do not comment on political or related matters. </PARA>
<PARA>But did this test apply to Mr Burke? Of course not, because Mr Burke is a special case. It would apply to any other ambassador, but not to Mr Burke. He is a Labor hero; he channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to Labor's Federal campaigns. He has to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, of course, Mr Burke is back in Australia again on special leave and special pay-a discretion exercised by Senator Evans; a special privilege arising out of a special relationship. It does not apply to other ambassadors. He did not tell the Minister that he was returning to Australia in this instance. He did not tell the Minister that he was returning to Australia in the previous instance. He has not told the Minister on how many other occasions he will have to return to Australia in order to deal with the 12-odd major matters that are still before the Commission which could take the next 12 months to two years to complete. </PARA>
<PARA> What happens to his responsibilities in Ireland? Of course, for Mr Burke they are put aside and, apparently, that is satisfactory to the Minister-special circumstances for a special ambassador. This is an ambassador who is not doing his job; he is now back in Australia answering allegations before a royal commission. Who is thinking of the interests of Australia in this matter? Certainly not Mr Burke and certainly not Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a clear case of failure by Senator Evans to act in the way that he should. The purpose of this motion, as Mr Burke returns to Australia, is for the Senate to communicate that view to Senator Evans. Senator Evans knows what he should do. He knows how he should be acting in this matter. He knows that he should not be protecting Labor's mates and putting them above the national interest. Senator Knowles will remind Senator Evans of the allegations and the evidence before Mr Burke. Senator Campbell in this debate will remind Senator Evans of the views of independent commentators and the overseas reaction to this appalling situation. Hopefully, Senator Evans will now finally exercise his responsibility-the responsibility that he should have exercised a long time ago. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am of course extremely conscious of the need to protect Australia's interests abroad; I spend my working life doing just that with the help, I might say, of a very distinguished and competent Australian diplomatic service. But I am also conscious of the need to do a few other things. I am conscious of the need to respect the basic principles of justice and fairness to individuals-the Australian tradition of respect for which is of course an important part of the respect with which we, in turn, as a country continue to be held overseas. I am conscious also of the need to act consistently and in accordance with clearly enunciated principles. I am conscious also of the need to resist what are, essentially, squalid partisan politically-inspired attacks dressed up in terms of high principle, but which, in reality, are nothing of the kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The starting point in my response to this whole matter must of course be the principle of presumption of innocence-that no-one should be judged guilty of criminality by a criminal court, or judged guilty of impropriety by a royal commission before that person is the subject of sworn evidence which is tested and replied to, and is the subject of a concluded decision by the appropriate properly-constituted tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Allegations are always cheap, and allegations made before royal commissions, with their wide-ranging investigatory briefs and their rather looser rules of evidence, are traditionally very cheap indeed. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and I and other members of the Government have made clear on innumerable occasions that we do not regard mere allegations-albeit allegations in a royal commission in a sworn evidentiary context-wherever they come from, as being the basis for standing down anyone. That is not only a principled position, but also it is one that is manifestly in accordance with practical commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative would be to accept the principle that anyone in public life in an important position of responsibility should be required to stand down, either voluntarily or involuntarily, when a serious allegation was made against him or her. But one has only to state that proposition for its manifest absurdity to become apparent. It would only be a matter of the Leader of the Opposition or someone giving evidence in some context or other making an allegation against the Prime Minister, for the Prime Minister to be required to stand down. It would only be a matter of such an allegation being made against a Minister-particularly, let us say, a Minister exercising important judicial-type responsibilities, like an Attorney-General-for that person to have to stand down. I recall that similar claims were made against me during my tenure of that particular job. It would only require similar sorts of allegations to be made against a member of a judicial tribunal or, indeed, a court for that particular public office-holder to be required to stand down. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the reality of the robust character of political debate in this country, with allegation and counter-allegation being very much a part of the stock-in-trade, and given the way in which royal commissions have become so much a part of the tapestry of everyday life in this country, with all of the allegations and counter-allegations that flow from them, we would face the prospect-if the principle that a mere allegation required an obligation to stand down were to be accepted at face value-of the ministerial benches and judicial benches of this country being progressively denuded. This whole question of course is one that the Prime Minister has put on a number of occasions squarely and directly to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Over and again the Leader of the Opposition has been asked and has steadfastly refused to answer whether it is his position that the mere making of an allegation requires the person in question to stand down or be stood down. </PARA>
<PARA> I now ask the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) the same question. Is that what he is saying-that the mere making of an allegation is something that should require a public officer-holder, in a responsible position, against which that allegation is made to stand down or be stood down? Does anyone in the Opposition hold that position in the full robust terms that were so clearly implied by the nature of what Senator Hill and Dr Hewson have been saying in recent days? If Opposition senators do hold that position, in all its rigour and in all its absoluteness, they are committed to a position of manifest absurdity. If they do not hold that position, then they are convicted of manifest hypocrisy and humbug. That is the nub of the response that we make to the Opposition on that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that the principle of presumption of innocence, as I have described it, while being the starting point of our consideration of, and reaction to, this matter and while it should remain the central guiding principle that continues throughout the duration of this matter, is not necessarily the finishing point. I acknowledge that there are some additional considerations that I, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, do have to take into account when a situation of the kind that presently confronts us arises. </PARA>
<PARA> Those considerations that I have to take into account go basically to the question of the effectiveness with which Australian interests are represented abroad. As I said in this place on 10 April, it is the case that a situation such as a royal commission inquiry can impose very considerable pressures of time and the like on a person caught up in it. </PARA>
<PARA> From the outset, as I also said on 10 April, Ambassador Burke has made very clear to me and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that he is very conscious of his responsibilities to continue to discharge his ambassadorial duties effectively, and he will keep that very much in mind in terms of judging his own position as the matter develops. On the same day the Prime Minister said in the other place:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . if a situation arose where the actual discharge of his duties was in question-his capacity to discharge his duties-I would expect that Mr Burke would make that judgment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>All I can say is that on the evidence available to me at this point I have no evidence that the Ambassador is not able to discharge his duties.</PARA>
<PARA>I have made the same judgment up to this point of time. It will be a matter for continuing judgment, based on the circumstances, as to whether that conclusion should continue to be reached. I readily acknowledge that a judgment about this matter, while it is one for Mr Burke in the first instance, is ultimately one for me. I make the point, however, that, in all the circumstances as they are known to me in terms of Mr Burke's capacity to effectively discharge his duties and in terms of the pressures of time and like put upon him, at this point of time there is no basis on which any judgment should be made other than the one that has been made. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the point will be made-it has been implied already in what Senator Hill said-that it is not just a matter of physical pressures and effectiveness to do the job in that sense; it is also a matter, it is said, of Australia's reputation and standing when allegations of impropriety are being made about someone of the stature and position of an Australian ambassador abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point I make about that is this: it should not be assumed that any adverse consequences of this kind do flow automatically so far as other governments are concerned. Other governments are perfectly capable of distinguishing wild and woolly allegations from concluded, royal commission findings. Other governments are perfectly capable of understanding the political context in which allegations made in a royal commission context can achieve a degree of prominence and notoriety. I believe that the Irish Government, with its own robust political tradition, which we perhaps inherited in this country, is more capable than most governments around the world of understanding the political realities of situations like this. </PARA>
<PARA> I go on to make a second point: these situations do nonetheless have to be carefully monitored, and there may conceivably be circumstances that arise where an issue becomes so prominent in the overseas media and so much a matter of comment or articulated concern by host governments that it is desirable for the position of an ambassador to be reconsidered. My Department and I, together with Ambassador Burke and his missions in Dublin and the Holy See, are obviously continuing to monitor the situation very carefully in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, all that I can say is that up to this point-and I say this on the basis of communications received as recently as this morning-I have made the judgment that, in terms of the attention this matter is generating in the countries in question and in terms of the reaction that it is generating in the host governments in question, there is no basis at the moment for this kind of reconsideration being given. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to say anything more than that. I believe that I have said enough to make it clear that, notwithstanding the temptation to respond in kind to the essentially partisan character of the Opposition's posturing on this urgency motion, I make the point that I and the Government understand perfectly well the principles that are applicable to this whole matter, and we are applying those principles in a measured and principled way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats recognise this debate today for what it is. It comes to the Senate as a matter of urgency because for the Opposition it is urgent. According to all reports, the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See is returning as soon as he can get here to answer the allegations referred to in the motion. It is therefore an opportunistic political exercise by the Opposition that it has to undertake today because, with a two-week break coming up, such a move will be well and truly out of date when we come back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not to say that the Democrats are not, like the community at large, appalled at what lies at the base of the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in relation to WA Inc. and the allegations against Mr Burke and others-the smell of political corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that, with all the hoo-ha surrounding WA Inc., the role of the Ambassador and the pressure that the Opposition has chosen to put on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans)-apart from the obvious embarrassment for both of the big parties, with colleagues of the mover of this motion, both in the other place and even in this place, having the heat put on them-the real import of what is coming out of WA Inc. is probably twofold: firstly, the huge amounts of money that must be raised by political parties to pay for election campaigns and, secondly, the inadequacy of the current law in that respect. The revelations concerning WA Inc. may be distasteful, even immoral, but they are not illegal, and they should be. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's debate, as I have said, is an exercise in political opportunism and of no substance with regard to the point that I have just made. Worse, it comes in a slightly unusual manner on a day when public servants have readied themselves for Estimate committee hearings which were scheduled to begin before this time. They will have to wait, they will be here later today than they otherwise would have been and they will not get on with their further work. Not only is this a waste of time but it also has the potential to waste public money. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence, the Democrats will, with the exception of this short explanation that I am giving now, participate no further in this debate. It is an exercise of political head kicking between the two big parties in which we do not want to participate; nor will we participate in the vote. We will, with extreme pleasure, participate in the substantive debate that will come before this place to address the underlying issues of the remaining legality of immoral practices in the political process which, fortunately, will now come before us as a result of the WA Inc. royal commission and the Government's initiative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) talked about justice, fairness, consistency and politically inspired attacks. It is a shame that he has viewed this debate in such a shallow manner. The Australian Democrats, of course, have simply talked about opportunistic political exercises and about Estimates, which I do not think have any relevance to this debate today at all. It just goes to show how little the Democrats really understand the problems at the core of this matter. Put simply, it is not in the interests of Australia for one of its diplomats to remain in his post when he faces prolonged appearances before a royal commission and when he has been the subject of repeated evidence as to a lack of propriety in his previous career.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has spoken today about allegations-mere allegations. I keep repeating: these are not just mere allegations; these are statements that are made on oath. In previous months the Minister saw a royal commission as being serious enough to give a commitment to act upon but now he views the evidence given on oath provided at that royal commission as insufficiently important. This is why the coalition asks the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to have regard for the standing of Australian diplomatic representation and to recall, or at least suspend, Mr Brian Burke as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government has consistently put the demands of the political mateship culture ahead of propriety in the handling of this matter, ever since serious evidence was raised in Federal Parliament nearly six months ago and concerns about Mr Burke's propriety to hold the job were raised as far back as March 1988. So this is not some new revelation purely and simply as a consequence of the Royal Commission. It goes back to March 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his colleagues have hidden behind the fiction that the coalition has accused Mr Burke of criminal activity, which he again accused us of today, so that the principle of innocent until proven guilty in a court of law can be invoked. I have not resiled one inch from my position and statement of 19 December 1990 that the issues we are raising here deal with propriety, not criminality. It is not a crime to seek political donations, to operate bank accounts, or to hire private detectives to investigate and spy on opponents. These activities can, however, be conducted in a fashion that debases politics in a manner that is self-evident. </PARA>
<PARA> It is deplorable that Senator Evans should abandon his duty to uphold the standing of our diplomatic representation by declaring in answers to questions that he will take no action unless:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . evidence emerges through the courts or elsewhere of something which would make it inappropriate for the Ambassadorial position to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>He stated that on 27 November. I am sorry, but Senator Evans cannot have it both ways: he cannot say that he is going to act in that manner then and do the reverse now. Prior to the Royal Commission he said he would wait for the Royal Commission. Now he says he will await evidence from elsewhere. Where else are we going to get evidence from? We will eventually get evidence in the courts. In taking this stand Senator Evans has chosen to ignore evidence that has emerged in the investigation of Government surveillance by a select committee of the Legislative Council of Western Australia and the royal commission. It is worth noting that Senator Evans is now leaving the chamber during this debate, that he does not consider this debate an important one which goes to the core of Australia's representation overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> It is admitted by Mr Burke's former personal assistant, Mr Shervington, that the Premier instructed convicted phone tapper Robert Smith to `get something' on Liberal members of State Parliament. It is admitted by Mr Burke's former media adviser that he acted as a go-between in arranging payment for private work done by Smith for the Premier. These are not wild allegations by Mr Burke's political enemies; they are statements made before a proper investigative body by people with no interest in maligning Mr Burke. Yet the Minister dismissed them as a political attack and chose to ignore the serious questions of propriety that are raised in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Burke has also been linked with his brother to the bribery of Stirling City Council councillors to vote to allow a development to be built on the Scarborough beach front. Senator Beahan may also like to tell the Senate what he knows about this matter. Then, of course, there are the incredible and extensive allegations about Brian Burke's role in the warehousing of the Fremantle Gas and Coke Co. Additionally, there are very serious questions about his fundraising methods-funds for favours. Most recently, it has been alleged that Mr Burke while being ambassador-designate had approached a businessman to be guarantor for a WA Inc. deal concerning the carve-up of the Bell Group. </PARA>
<PARA> The appointment in Western Australia of the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters has actually been used by this Minister and his Government as an excuse for inaction, until the outcome of the Commission. How very convenient! Prior to the Royal Commission it was used as the excuse for potential action. The Royal Commission may not deliver its findings until well into 1992, during which time Mr Burke is presumably welcome, according to this Government, to remain as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See, as our representative. </PARA>
<PARA> During this month the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have taken to covering themselves by reference to Mr Burke's own judgment as to whether he can fulfil the requirements of his office. The Prime Minister evades the question, claiming that the Opposition in effect demands that every public official subject to any allegation be stood aside. Yet I repeat: the matters that question Mr Burke's propriety are not allegations, but evidence presented to proper inquiries and under oath. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an insult to the Western Australian royal commissioners to imply that they allow wild allegations to be made before the Commission. Is this Government suggesting that the commissioners allow people to wander in day after day and lie? If it is not suggesting that, then Senator Evans should act, and act now. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government pretends that the normal rules have been applied in granting Mr Burke special leave rather than standing him aside. How can there be any such thing as normal rules in a situation that is unprecedented as far as diplomatic representation is concerned? It is fiction that Mr Burke is in the same position as a career diplomat forced to return to Australia because of some personal matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We may ask why it was necessary for Mr Young to stand aside as a Minister in 1983 during investigation of the Combe-Ivanov affair, yet Mr Burke is allowed to remain in his position. No doubt it is useless to cite the precedents where Ministers in the last coalition Government were required to stand down until their names were cleared because different rules apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The nonsense of the claim that Mr Burke is not receiving special treatment is refuted by the former head of the Foreign Affairs Department, Mr Alan Renouf, in stating that a career diplomat would not receive the same degree of latitude. He was interviewed on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio in Perth on 12 April last week. As a former career diplomat, he said that the same rules would not apply. It is a sad state of affairs for Mr Renouf to confirm that such a situation has not previously involved an Australian ambassador. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not in Australia's interest that a person remain representing us overseas when questions are to be answered about the purpose of massive cash donations passed to a private secretary to Mr Burke as Premier, when she is not quite sure what she did with one $100,000 cash sum. It is not in the national interest for Mr Burke to remain as a serving ambassador when questions need to be answered as to the leader's accounts that he kept under close personal control, and when there is a serious question of propriety as to the nature of the hard-sell fundraising adopted by him as Premier. It is not in the national interest when questions remain unanswered about a $55,000 cheque that came from the Perth mint in exchange for gold and went straight into the leader's account. It is not in the national interest for someone to remain as ambassador when it is reported that a respected Western Australian business identity, Ralph Sarich, has suffered in his dealings with State governments headed by Mr Burke and his successors because he refused to make political donations. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives is prepared to state that, if a Premier is seen to be involved in authorising surveillance, he should stand down. It is, after all, Mr Ronald Edwards who cited the example of Watergate. Lawyers may argue whether Nixon broke the law, but few will dispute that he acted improperly and debased his office. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious evidence of impropriety is squarely before this Labor Government. The Minister should stop protecting his Leader's mates and uphold the national interest by requiring Mr Burke to follow relevant precedent and stand down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Senate is debating a matter of urgency which was put to the Senate by Senator Hill. Essentially, the matter of urgency which Senator Hill wants the Senate to determine is whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, should recall the Ambassador to Ireland, Brian Burke, because of some allegations that have been made against Brian Burke in the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters, which is currently being heard in Perth.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yet the Opposition is determined to rush to judgment, as my colleague Senator Cook said, and is determined to destroy the career path of this great Australian, great Western Australian. The Opposition is determined to do that. An accusation of Senator Hill is that Brian Burke may be guilty of being a Labor hero. That certainly was the case in February 1983 when Brian Burke, as the leader of the party in that State, took us into government after quite a period of time in the wilderness. Certainly, because of his actions as leader of the Western Australian Government on behalf of the people of Western Australia, he will remain a hero for many days to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has also been indicated that he is a Labor mate, whatever that term means. I would be more than happy to claim Brian Burke as a Labor mate, although in years gone by Brian Burke, because of his particular persuasions within the Labor Party, would certainly not have claimed me as a Labor mate. But, internal differences aside, Brian Burke has made an enormous contribution to the Labor Party, to Western Australia and, indeed, to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We should not abuse that privilege, and I am certainly not accusing Senator Campbell of abusing the privilege. But at the same time we do have to set some standards. I suggest that the Opposition should look to accepting and replying to the challenge put to them by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the other place on 16 April. The challenge is: how does one gauge the principles? I quote the Prime Minister:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . if an allegation is made against an official, then that allegation of itself is sufficient to require the Government to stand down the person against whom the allegation is made.</PARA>
<PARA>Is that going to be the standard? The Opposition, both in the other place and here-and the challenge has been put out again by Senator Evans-has not yet responded to it. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition responds to that challenge in the affirmative, I suggest that all of us will be on very shaky ground indeed. We must face the fact that accusations and allegations can be and, indeed, are made on a continual basis-and not only against us as politicians. What happens if allegations are made against a member of the judiciary? If it is merely an accusation or allegation, would that member of the judiciary be immediately expected to stand aside? If the allegations continued once the pattern of events was accepted out there in the community, we would quite soon end up in a state of anarchy. Honourable senators on the other side of the chamber must address the standards and principles that it is going to bring to bear to this debate surrounding the Ambassador to Ireland, Mr Brian Burke. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill mentioned people who had perhaps set standards by stepping aside from their office when allegations and assertions had been made. The people that were mentioned were Phillip Lynch, Neville Wran and Mick Young. Phillip Lynch, Neville Wran and Mick Young are only a tiny proportion of the number of political figures in this country against whom allegations have been made in the past. We do not have to go too far back into history to pick up others. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not abuse the privileges of this place by naming names, but let me just refer to the Independent Commission Against Corruption being held at the moment in New South Wales. A certain political figure from that State has been mentioned time and again during that hearing. Although that individual happens to come from the other side of politics, none of us on this side of politics immediately jumped up and demanded that that individual should stand aside. For our own cheap political reasons, we could have done that, but we held to principles. </PARA>
<PARA> If we move north to Queensland, we are hearing not only about a royal commission in Queensland but also about trials which have resulted in politicians from that State being incarcerated in prison for deeds that were committed. Yet the allegations were made prior to and during royal commissions. Should all of those people have been stood aside? The mere fact that some of the allegations against some politicians have stuck and people have been imprisoned does not and should not mean that every time an allegation or assumption is made about a person in public life that individual should stand aside. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us face it: our constituents on a weekly or daily basis make accusations against us and we, in turn, make allegations against each other across the chamber. We play with politics. We are also playing-and sometimes we forget this-with the lives and the careers of human beings. But the people who are sometimes forgotten in this whole series of allegations, assumptions and charges are the families of the individuals who are there in the spotlight. We do have to be aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding, I repeat the challenge that the Prime Minister issued on 16 April, and which was repeated earlier by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to the Opposition about principles in matters such as those being debated here: it is up to the Opposition to state publicly its principles and the principles by which it will be guided in matters such as this. </PARA>

We saw this sort of practice as fairly normal, I guess, or as part of the game, in the United States during the McCarthyist era and in those sorts of places. But it is certainly unheard of in Australian politics, and definitely in Western Australian politics prior to 1983 when Burke and his mates took over control of Western Australia. He took over control of more than just the Government of Western Australia. Burke, as Senator Hill said earlier, has admitted publicly-I think on the Hinch program-that he investigated Ross Lightfoot, a former member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly and a member of the Liberal Party of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes he did, but one of the things that happened to Ross was that he was investigated. Some of Mr Burke's former Cabinet colleagues, in particular, Julian Grill, said that it was quite appropriate to send someone to the corporate affairs office and to check on Ross Lightfoot's companies and so forth. But that was a cover-up. They did not just go to the corporate affairs office to look at some of the public records; they had a private investigator go into Ross Lightfoot's personal details. On the Four Corners program the other night, in a very sombre manner, Mr Lightfoot described Brian Burke's investigation. In the transcript of that program, Ross stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . there were intimate details of my life going back to when I was a late teenager, to when I was in my twenties, to my business activities, from companies I had formed, from the time that I'd spent in the mounted police in South Australia, even the time that I had spent in the army, to things like my pilot's licence had run out and so on. All these things were there, and they weren't just cursory points that Smith was making. They were, in fact, quite some detail about my life. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of investigation that this Ambassador, this former Premier, undertook of his political opponents in Western Australia. That is the sort of propriety we are looking at. As my colleagues the two previous speakers on this motion have stated, we are not talking about guilt or innocence. This is not a partisan call. It is becoming increasingly partisan because the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) refuse to act. They refuse to face their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the Opposition's wish to make this a partisan call. These calls have been made since March 1988 when my predecessor, Senator Chaney, started raising questions in this place about the appropriateness of the appointment. These allegations, these public disclosures of information, these documents, which I listed in the Senate before Christmas, are freely available and many of them are not just mere allegations. They are serious matters of impropriety which go to the very heart of the appropriateness of Brian Burke to be appointed in the first place, and, clearly, the appropriateness of Brian Burke to remain in his position as Ambassador to Ireland. I put it to the Senate that this matter of the appointment, this matter of whether Burke should be recalled, which has been focused upon by every major daily newspaper around this nation, has become an issue because the Minister and the Prime Minister refuse to act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the last thing that we in the Opposition want to occur. We do not want this to be partisan. We do not need this to be an issue. As a Western Australian, I feel-as would Senator Knowles, Senator Durack and other senators in the chamber today, I am sure-that if this issue could go away, it would be better for our home State. We are proud and loyal Western Australians and to have this focus on affairs in our home State is a matter of some concern and embarrassment. Irrespective of whether Burke was a Labor Premier, he was a former Premier of Western Australia. To have this focus on our home State does us no good. In fact, at the moment it is an embarrassment to come from Western Australia. And Burke made that take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my first point about responsibility by saying that it is the Minister's and the Prime Minister's responsibility to act. They have tried to buck pass the problem by asking the Ambassador to make a decision himself. That is not good enough. The Minister should have acted. It has become an international and a national issue because of their failure to act. </PARA>
<PARA> The partisanship question is not really a matter of partisanship between the Opposition and the Government. The partisanship question is the struggle between the factions of the Australian Labor Party. It is a struggle between Burke's mates and those on the Government side who are not his mates. Senator Walsh would have been very happy for Burke to have been stood aside back in December or November. The honourable member for Perth, Dr Charlesworth, would have been very happy. The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, would have been very pleased for Burke to have been stood aside or recalled. They are all in favour of propriety in Australia's international interests and they have no friendship with this Burke character who remains the Ambassador. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, on the other side we have the Ambassador's mates: the Prime Minister, Senator Richardson and other figures of the New South Wales Right, and also Senator McKiernan, who I note has left the chamber. There is a struggle between standing by one's mate versus Australia's national and international interests. That is the real struggle. I believe that Senator Hill was quite right in saying that, if this pressure were not on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, he would have acted a long time ago. He would have acted before Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Knowles has gone through the matters that should have been investigated. They are not allegations. Most of the matters that I have raised in the Senate since October last year are matters on the public record. They are documents, they are statements of fact, many admitted by Burke, and they do impinge upon and raise questions about his propriety in these events. They should have been investigated by the Minister. They were not. As I said last year, the more he refuses to act, the more he refuses to investigate these matters, the more he fails to do his job and to uphold his responsibility, the more he implicates himself. He is saying, `Let's let Burke act; let's let Burke take the action'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his contribution to the debate today, referred to international press coverage. He referred to the fact that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be monitoring this. I have been monitoring this with my limited resources. Already there have been a number of articles in newspapers, such as The Times, The Independent, the Irish Times and the Sunday Telegraph, talking about Brian Burke's involvement and the cloud that hangs over him and the appropriateness of leaving him as an ambassador. </PARA>
<PARA> In the major Australian daily newspapers, virtually without exception, there have also been calls by the editorials for Brian Burke to be recalled. This is not a partisan issue. This is a matter where the non-partisan editors of all of the major newspapers in Australia have made their calls-the Sydney Morning Herald, the West Australian, the Australian Financial Review, the Telegraph Mirror just to name a few. The Sydney Morning Herald, one of Australia's major newspapers, has made the call as the lead on its editorial on both 6 December and 12 April-two editorials in less than six months-for Burke to be stood down. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an international issue. It is affecting our reputation overseas. It is not a matter for Brian Burke to make a decision on at a time when it suits him. It is a matter for the Minister and the Prime Minister to act on. This is an urgency motion. It is not-as Senator Powell called it-an opportunistic political activity. The fact is that Mr Burke has touched down in Australia today or will be touching down tomorrow and it is an appropriate time, albeit very late, for the Minister to take action. We believe that Burke will probably make his own decision and take his own action by Monday. This would totally reinforce our point that the Minister has failed to act. We call on him to act. </PARA>

It is not acceptable to assume, as Senator Knowles indicated, that some of the evidence that has been appearing is damaging to Ambassador Brian Burke. At one point in her speech, Senator Knowles said that these statements were made under oath.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For example, Senator Campbell, like any other loyal patriot from the west, says he is only interested in protecting the good name of Western Australia. That is fine and that may be his genuine view. But does that mean that Ambassador Brian Burke has to accept that the weight of evidence given by Mr Laurie Connell before a royal commission is sufficient to force or make it incumbent on Ambassador Brian Burke to stand down?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More particularly, we all know that, if the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) were to force Ambassador Burke to stand down, or if the Minister were to stand down Ambassador Burke, technically that is no indication of the guilt or innocence of Ambassador Burke. But we are also not babes in the woods. We know that the standing down of Brian Burke by his Minister would imply in the minds of the public, and especially in the minds of the media, a degree of guilt which would encumber Ambassador Burke before any court in this land if any charges were to be laid. It would also encumber him as he appeared before a royal commission. He would not be Ambassador Burke when he went into that royal commission to give evidence and presumably to refute the evidence already given by people like Laurie Connell; he would be Brian Burke, the man who was sufficiently worrisome in the legal process to justify being stood down by his Minister. Ambassador Burke has every entitlement to go into that royal commission as Ambassador Burke. There is no charge against him. Therefore, he has a right to be judged as a person who is innocent of any charges. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many occasions in this Senate when Senator Durack, the then Attorney-General, and Senator Gareth Evans, speaking on behalf of the Attorney-General, have indicated that they will not interfere in matters that are sub judice before royal commissions, the High Court of Australia or any other court in this land. I am pleading the case today that neither this Senate nor the Minister should encumber a person with even a smidgin of guilt before he or she goes into either a royal commission or a court of law in this land. </PARA>
<PARA> Brian Burke as yet has had no opportunity to tell his story before the royal commission. He has had no opportunity to put his case on oath. Is the Opposition today telling us that a man who as yet has had no opportunity to put his case before a royal commission should be stood down on the presumption, based upon evidence given by Laurie Connell and others, that there is something smelly about his background? Is that sufficient for us to recall an ambassador? Does that mean that, if charges or allegations are made against a senator in a royal commission, that senator should stand down? I deny that that principle should underlie the way in which this Parliament or our foreign service should operate. If people knew that all they had to do to make a senator stand down or an ambassador return from his post was make an allegation in this place or before a royal commission, when would it end?</PARA>
<PARA> People will notice that I, for example, and many others on this side of the chamber have never called for the standing down of some of the Ministers in New South Wales who have been appearing before the Independent Commission Against Corruption with allegations made against them. I believe that those Ministers have a right to retain their posts until charges have been laid or the evidence is overwhelming. We have certainly never asked for those Ministers to stand down when they have not even been given their chance to reply under oath in a royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make my last point about the media. Someone from the Opposition mentioned that media editors have been almost unanimous in calling for Brian Burke to stand down. Someone else mentioned what Derryn Hinch did. Heaven forbid that Derryn Hinch becomes the judge and jury of our foreign service and of people in this place! Are we going to let Derryn Hinch be the judge and jury of guilt and innocence in this place and of our foreign service? The answer is resoundingly no. I am sure it is in the heart of hearts of everyone on the other side. When do newspaper editors become the determinants of a person's guilt or innocence in this country? They try. Some of them would love to. But the answer is that while people like the members of this Government sit in this place-and my guess is many members of the Opposition-newspaper editors will not become the judge and jury in this country. Part of our role in this place is to ensure that civil liberties are protected. No matter whether one is a politician, priest or pauper, one is entitled to the same processes of justice as anyone else in this country. Because one is an ambassador does not mean that one is treated any worse than anyone else in this country. I oppose the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be extremely brief. The first question inherent in the urgency motion before us is whether a person holding public office should be stood down when allegations of impropriety are made before a royal commission. The second question is whether the integrity of our relations with other countries is such that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) should stand down an ambassador when allegations of possible impropriety are made about that ambassador before a royal commission. The third question underlying the urgency motion is whether the situation is of such a nature that it is detrimental to our democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the first question-that is to say, whether a person holding public office should be stood down when allegations of possible impropriety are made before a royal commission-if that were so, quite a lot of people may well be faced with that possibility, not only with the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters but also with another royal commission that is coming forward. I do not think that that is really appropriate. I am not sure whether that is underlying the urgency motion. More probably, what is underlying the urgency motion and what has emerged from the speeches from the Opposition side is the question of the integrity of our relations with another country, namely, Ireland, and the Holy See, to which Brian Burke is the Ambassador representing Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not concerned about that, in so far as it relates to Ireland and the Holy See. There may be a point, if he were ambassador to some country which has not got a long history of understanding of the civilised process and the diplomatic process, but the Holy See, of all places, has probably got the longest of such understandings. I do not suppose it would be terribly fazed-not so much as to what the allegations are, but about the fact that allegations have been made to the Royal Commission in Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I am not so sure that the Irish would be terribly fazed. The Irish have a long history of understanding of what international affairs are about. I do concede that it may be a different question if he were an ambassador to some other less sophisticated country. That is just my opinion, for what it is worth. </PARA>
<PARA> The third question is whether this whole thing is of such a nature as to question the democracy in our country. If the Senate wants my view, I would say this: on a scale of one to 10, even if the allegations were true-and, as has been indicated, that has not been established and it is certainly premature and, in my view, unfair for us to come to a conclusion before the other side is put and the report is made-I would put that as a threat to democracy at about four. I would put the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) at about eight, and a few other organisations which are making decisions determining major issues which are not properly considered before this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I have stood up here time and time again to indicate to the chamber that the $450,000 that the NHMRC gave to the Singer outfit to develop a philosophy, if you like to call it that, for experimentation on early human beings was given without proper examination by the people or the Parliament. Eventually, the sort of thing that is happening in Western Australia will come out into the open because somebody will trip up somebody else or tread on some toes, and the other people will blow the whistle. It always comes out into the open. I believe that, taken to its extreme, it is a certain threat to democracy, but there are other more major threats to democracy, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, what I have said relates to the motion which asks for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to stand down Ambassador Burke. My comments have been directed to the question of whether Ambassador Burke should be stood down. Of course, they have not gone to the question of whether Ambassador Burke should stand down himself. In my view, that is entirely a matter for him. The question before us is whether this person holding a public office should be stood down and, in my view, that is not a motion which I would agree with. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill proposes amendments to several Acts within the Industrial Relations portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>The most significant amendments relate to the structure of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission under the Industrial Relations Act 1988 and that of the Trade Union Training Authority and its management under the Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975. Amendments are also proposed to the Defence Act 1903 and the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Industrial Relations Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Industrial Relations Act are proposed in Part 3 of the Schedule to the Bill. They result from the Government's acceptance of a report presented by a Committee of Review into the structure of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the remuneration of its members. </PARA>
<PARA>The review, which was announced in May 1990 when the legislative salary nexus between Presidential Members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and Judges of the Federal Court of Australia was repealed, commenced its work later in the year. </PARA>
<PARA>It was conducted by a Committee chaired by Mr Gerry Gleeson, former Head of the NSW Premier's Department, with the assistance of the Honourable Justice Trevor Olsson, a Judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia, and Professor Alan Fels, Chairman of the Prices Surveillance Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was required to inquire into the categories of membership of the Commission and the structural arrangements that should apply; appropriate internal and external salary relativities; and the total remuneration package for the proposed categories of members. The Committee invited submissions from all interested parties, including the Commission, the major employer bodies, the ACTU and the State Governments, and undertook appropriate consultations. It presented its report to the Government on 1 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has accepted all of the Committee's recommendations as they provide a sound basis on which to strengthen the Commission's structure and to put it in a better position to address its increasing range of responsibilities and the wider scope of its jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>These reforms will complement the initiatives which the Government took in framing the Industrial Relations Act to enable the Commission to exercise a broader jurisdiction. It will also facilitate the increasing co-operation between the Commission and its State counterparts, including through members of each being commissioned to hold office on both the federal and State tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to the detail of the proposals which are included in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In line with the recommendations of the Gleeson report, it is proposed to introduce a revised structure for the Commission which will include two new levels, in addition to those of President, Deputy President and Commissioner. These new offices of Vice President and Senior Deputy President are expected to have the responsibilities described in the report and to which I will refer later. Appointees to the new positions will be required to have at least the same professional qualifications as presently apply to Deputy Presidents. The Governor-General must be satisfied, however, that, by reason of skills and experience in the field of industrial relations, a person is suitable for appointment to the office concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>The Vice President will, among other responsibilities, assist the President in the administration of the operations of the Commission, and is expected to have the oversight of major issues within the Commission's jurisdiction. This will assist the President who has a heavy workload under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Vice President's administrative role will necessarily involve assisting the President with the more important matters relating to the Commission's operation, such as the establishment of Full Benches, assignments to the Commission's industry panels and the overall co-ordination of relations between the Commission and State industrial tribunals. The President's statutory ability to delegate powers will be amended to facilitate this, but the President will also be able to delegate powers to other Presidential Members where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>The working arrangements between the President and Vice President will, of course, be a matter for those office holders to settle themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senior Deputy Presidents will have a vital role in the Commission's work. They may be expected to deal with the most difficult and responsible work of the Commission as well as having a leading role in the operation of the arrangements under which there is co-operation and co-ordination between the federal and State industrial tribunals. The report refers to the possibility of Senior Deputy Presidents holding concurrent appointments to judicial offices. At this stage, the Government has not reached any conclusions on such an initiative. Even so, that does not affect the strong justification for the new positions. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation also provides for a more flexible approach to the composition of Full Benches, in line with the Committee's recommendation. It is proposed that a Full Bench be able to be established which includes one Presidential Member, rather than two as at present. It will remain the responsibility of the President to determine how a Full Bench should be constituted, having regard to the nature of the matter with which it is to deal. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee raised a number of other matters. It made a detailed examination of the remuneration of members of the Commission in the light of the relevant wage fixing principles. The Committee's recommendations have formed the basis of the Government's submission to the Remuneration Tribunal which will continue to be responsible for determining remuneration for members of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also recommends certain changes to the other entitlements of members. The necessary administrative action is under way to implement these recommendations. I have also referred some administrative matters mentioned in the Gleeson report relating to the functions of panels and office accommodation to the President of the Commission for his consideration. The Government strongly supports the Commission's independence and welcomes the recommendations of the Gleeson Committee which reinforce its autonomy. The legislative action now proposed will strengthen the Commission, while respecting its continued independence. </PARA>
<PARA>Defence Act 1903</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Defence Act are proposed in Part 1 of the Schedule to the Bill. They will streamline the procedures of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, enabling it to deal with matters more speedily and allow more efficient use of its resources. </PARA>
<PARA>The current quorum for the Tribunal is two members, although, in practice, it would be rare for any matter to be dealt with by other than all three members. The amendments will allow the Chairman of the Tribunal to direct that a single member conduct its business in relation to a matter specified in the direction. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments will also provide for the procedures of the Tribunal where such a direction is given. These are akin to the procedures to be followed when the Tribunal is constituted other than by a single member. </PARA>
<PARA>Provision will be made for review of action by a single member. The Minister, Secretary or Chief of the Defence Force will be able to seek such a review. As soon as practicable after receipt of a written notice specifying the grounds of review, the Tribunal is to reconsider the action of the single member and affirm, vary or replace it. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Defence Act will also supplement the existing rights of audience before the Tribunal. At present, the Commonwealth and the Defence Force Advocate have such rights. The Tribunal will be able, where appropriate, to permit some other person or body to be present during the hearing of a matter and to make submissions. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the amendments will allow the Tribunal to give effect to agreements between the Minister, on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Chief of the Defence Force, acting on behalf of the members of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA>Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act are proposed in Part 2 of the Schedule to the Bill. They are of a minor drafting and technical nature, and have no policy implications. </PARA>
<PARA>Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975</PARA>
<PARA>Part 4 of the Schedule to the Bill contains the amendments proposed to the Trade Union Training Authority Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the past two years, significant structural and administrative changes to the Trade Union Training Authority (or TUTA) have been undertaken. These have included the appointment of National Industry Training Officers, who are responsible for development and implementation of training for particular industry groups, as well as measures to increase productivity and redirect resources to expand the national training effort without further call on the budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Legislative changes are also required. The amendments will:</PARA>
<PARA>- replace the 16 member National Council of Trade Union Training with an 11 member Executive Council of TUTA;</PARA>
<PARA>- abolish the Regional Councils for the States and Territories, but empower the Executive Council to establish Regional Advisory Councils, as required; and</PARA>
<PARA>- replace the positions of National Director and Director of Studies with a single position of Executive Officer. </PARA>
<PARA>These changes will result in the better use of TUTA's resources. They will contribute significantly to the development of the national focus in trade union training. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, it is important to note that representation of relevant interests will be enhanced. The membership of the Executive Council of TUTA, although smaller than that of the present Australian Council, will continue to represent the interests of unions, employers, the Government, and the staff of TUTA. It will now also include a community representative. </PARA>
<PARA>The Confederation of Australian Industry, which has traditionally represented employers on the Australian Council of TUTA, will specifically be consulted about employer representation on the Executive Council. </PARA>
<PARA>The abolition of the Regional Councils for the States and Territories is consistent with the national focus proposed for TUTA. But the capacity to establish Regional Advisory Councils, where this is required, will enable TUTA to deal effectively with issues which arise in particular geographical areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA>The financial impact of the amendments to the IR Act resulting from the Gleeson Report is not yet quantifiable, as remuneration for the new offices is yet to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. Moreover, it has not yet been determined when and how many appointments to the new offices will be made. The Bill will not have any other significant financial implications. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA> The purposes of the Bill are to remove from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 the exemption for superannuation and replace it with more limited exemptions, to insert in the Sex Discrimination Act a number of exemptions for certain Commonwealth and Territory legislation which is presently exempted by Regulations, and to amend the Marriage Act 1961 and the War Gratuity Act 1945 so as to remove inconsistencies with the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The process which led to the first set of amendments in the Bill, dealing with superannuation, dates back to the report by the then Human Rights Commission titled ``Superannuation and Insurance and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 Part 1-Superannuation''. That report was prepared in response to a request by the then Attorney-General, Senator the Hon Gareth Evans, and was tabled in Parliament on 25 November 1986. The report was considered by the Government and it was decided that the exemption be removed and certain more limited exemptions for particular practices in superannuation be inserted into the Act. Following the Government's decision, consultations on the proposed exemptions were held with the superannuation industry, employer groups, State and Territory Governments and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, as indicated in its National Agenda for Women, is committed to the objective of removing discrimination in superannuation on the grounds of sex, marital status and pregnancy. The major effect of this Bill is to remove most forms of direct discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status in superannuation practices for new schemes. Where funds are unable to comply with the new obligations under the legislation, the reasonable expectations of the members will be maintained and the discriminatory fund will be allowed to continue. However, such funds will not be entitled to admit new members. Further, members of such discriminatory schemes will generally have to be given an option to obtain non-discriminatory superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed continuing exemptions, shortly stated, deal with the following areas:</PARA>
<PARA>- the inclusion in fund conditions of a provision which is based upon actuarial data upon which it is reasonable to rely;</PARA>
<PARA>- the current practices whereby lesser death and disability benefits are provided to members who are single, that is members who do not have a spouse or a de facto spouse, or to members who do not have a child;</PARA>
<PARA>- the possibly discriminatory effect of current vesting, preservation and portability arrangements in funds' conditions;</PARA>
<PARA>- the protection of the existing expectations of members of discriminatory schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the Bill was initially delayed pending the reappraisal by the Government of a proposed exemption which would have allowed funds to confine the provision of superannuation benefits to permanent and full-time employees. In January 1989 the Government decided not to proceed with this exemption. Following that decision a further round of consultations on the issue was held with the superannuation industry, peak employer bodies, State Governments and the National Women's Consultative Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill was first introduced on 11 May 1989 but lapsed when elections were called. It was then amended by the deletion of proposed section 41c, which would have permitted the remaining superannuation exemptions (i.e. sections 41a and 41b) to be repealed by regulation. This provision, which was opposed by the Opposition, was not considered essential to the Bill. The Bill was re-introduced on 12 September 1990 but was withdrawn in order to make several minor technical and drafting amendments. As the Regulations providing exemptions for inconsistent Commonwealth, State and Territory laws were being reviewed at the time, the Government decided to incorporate the amendments to the superannuation exemption into a more comprehensive Bill which further limits the scope of existing exemptions under the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a brief description of the proposed limited exemptions to be inserted in the Act. The first I wish to outline are those relating to superannuation. Because, statistically, women live longer than men, the actuarial exemption covers the resulting difference in costs of providing a pension for women. Schemes will be able to continue to offer optional conversions between lump sums and pensions which differ by sex, so long as the difference is reasonably based on reliable actuarial data. As many superannuation benefits are provided via insurance this exemption is interlinked with the insurance exemption in the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has released a Report on the exemption of insurance from the Sex Discrimination Act. This Report is now being considered by the Government. The need for the actuarial exemption for superannuation may need to be reviewed in light of the Government's response to the Commission's recommendations concerning the insurance exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption for certain superannuation benefits is designed to allow schemes to continue current practices, whereby upon a member's death or disability no benefits to or in respect of dependants are payable for a member who does not have a legal or de facto spouse or children. In the absence of this kind of exemption it may have been possible for a member who was single to succeed in a complaint of marital status discrimination. There are a number of reasons for maintaining this exemption. As the former Human Rights Commission noted in its Report, the exemption reflects the community's attitude that it is appropriate to make special provision for persons who have a spouse or who have children in the event of the death, or physical or mental incapacity of members of superannuation funds. As was noted by the Commission, to provide benefits to all dependants of members on proof of financial dependency would create difficulties both in administration and in finding a suitable objective test of ``dependency''. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the exemptions dealing with vesting, preservation and portability, the issue of discrimination arises because there is evidence that women statistically do not remain in continuous employment for the same length of time as men. Matters such as vesting, preservation and portability fall within the area of the operating standards for superannuation funds administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Regulations made under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 impose a number of operating standards with which superannuation funds must comply in order to be eligible for taxation concessions. These standards require all member-financed benefits and all employer-financed benefits arising from contributions made in accordance with an industrial agreement or award to vest in full in the member. They also require certain benefits, including award superannuation and personal superannuation benefits to be preserved, generally until retirement at or after age 55. The Government announced in the 1989 Budget that the introduction of vesting and preservation standards covering all employer-financed benefits will be phased in with effect from 1 July 1995. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission is engaged in the process of consulting with the superannuation industry, employers and unions for the purposes of the detailed implementation of these improved vesting and preservation standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides in clause 6 that section 14 of the Sex Discrimination Act is to be amended to make it unlawful for a person who exercises a discretion in relation to the payment of a superannuation benefit, in respect of a member of a superannuation fund to whom the provisions of new section 41a apply, to discriminate on the grounds of sex or marital status. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that trustees, when deciding who should receive such benefits, consider the circumstances of all the potential beneficiaries rather than making their decision purely on the basis of a person's marital status. For example, it will be unlawful not to pay a death benefit to a current de facto spouse purely because of a fund policy to always pay such benefits to the current legal spouse. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the provisions of the Bill which are designed to protect the existing expectations of members in superannuation schemes. New section 41b will enable schemes which cannot or do not wish to comply with the requirements of new section 41a to continue to provide benefits for existing members, provided current members of these funds have the option to obtain non-discriminatory superannuation benefits. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission may, pursuant to section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act, grant an exemption from the requirement to provide an option to current members. This will enable trustees or employers to apply for an exemption where it is clear that it would not be beneficial for current members to join a new scheme or to obtain non-discriminatory benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments concerning superannuation contained in this Bill should not have an impact upon Government expenditure. However, it is anticipated that all Commonwealth superannuation schemes will be amended in separate legislation to comply with the Sex Discrimination Act by the time the proposed provisions of this Bill come into effect. These further changes may affect Commonwealth expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation is a very technical area of the law and the issues of discrimination which may arise may vary from case to case and industry to industry. The former Attorney-General wrote to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner requesting that guidelines be published to clarify the application of the Bill to particular situations. In addition, where trustees or employers feel that they should be exempted from the requirements proposed in this Bill, they can apply to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for an exemption under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the amendments outlined above represent a significant reform. While I am informed that most schemes will be able to comply with the amendments with only minor adaptations to their existing conditions, the amendments will require schemes which have not yet modified their benefits to do so over the next two years, or to close off their membership. Further the amendments are likely to increase the opportunity for part-time employees to gain access to superannuation. This will significantly improve the opportunities for women to build up a worthwhile superannuation entitlement over their working lives. A large majority of part-time employees are women and it is clear that women tend to return from child rearing to part-time employment. Where part-time employees are performing the same duties as their full-time counterparts and the fulltime counterparts receive superannuation, it is likely that a Court would find a failure to provide access to superannuation to such part-time employees unlawfully discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments should therefore be viewed in light of the Government's commitment to increasing superannuation coverage for the Australian work force. Arbitrated superannuation awards are providing increasing superannuation coverage. These amendments will not only encourage this development and help Australia make appropriate provision for its ageing population, but the benefits which will be offered will be fairer and more equitable and in line with the Government's commitments under the National Agenda for Women. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the amendments to be effected by this Bill concern the exemptions for inconsistent Commonwealth, State and Territory laws. The original purpose of the exemptions was to allow a period of two years from the date of commencement of the Sex Discrimination Act for the relevant governments to amend their legislation so as to remove inconsistencies with the Act. The original exemptions were due to expire on 31 July 1986 and, although the number of exemptions has decreased each year, exemptions have been continued for some legislation since then. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has expressed strong concerns about the possibility of any further renewals of the exemptions by Regulation. Following consultations with the State and Territory governments and the relevant Commonwealth Departments, the Government has decided that it is inappropriate for the practice of exemption by Regulation to continue. Consequently, it is proposed that the existing provisions of the Act concerning the power to extend exemptions by regulations i.e. section 40, subsections (2), (3) and (4), be repealed by this Bill. The current Regulations expire on 31 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA> After consulting the relevant Commonwealth Departments, the Government has decided to grant indefinite exemptions under subsection 40 (2) of the Act to a number of Commonwealth Acts. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> Sections 4 (1) and 84 (1) of the National Health Act 1953;</PARA>
<PARA> the Social Services Act 1980 (Norfolk Island);</PARA>
<PARA> the Gift Duty Assessment Act 1941;</PARA>
<PARA> the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936;</PARA>
<PARA> the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953;</PARA>
<PARA> the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935; and</PARA>
<PARA> the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax Assessment) Act 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The relevant sections of the National Health Act and the Social Services Act (Norfolk Island) are discriminatory on the grounds of sex in that they mirror the discriminatory provisions that apply different ages for pension eligibility for men and women under the federal Social Security scheme. The provision of an indefinite exemption for these Acts is consistent with the existing indefinite exemption provided for the Social Security Act 1947. </PARA>
<PARA> The Income Tax Assessment Act uses a number of terms such as ``relative``, ``associate'' and ``dependant'' which are discriminatory on the grounds of marital status. These terms, as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act, are used in the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act and the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax Assessment) Act. As these provisions are aimed at preventing tax avoidance and the abuse of tax concessions, the desirability of indefinitely exempting this legislation is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gift Duty Assessment Act only applies to gifts made before 1 July 1979. As most assessments have already been made, amendment of this Act is considered inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act uses the terms ``relation'' and ``dependant'' which are defined so as to be discriminatory on the grounds of marital status. The Act exempts from duty certain goods sent to or imported for the personal use of members of the Armed Forces of the United States and of Papua New Guinea or their descendants. These provisions permit Australia to comply with bilateral Agreements entered into with those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing exemptions under section 40 (2) are to be reinserted into the Act by new subsection 40 (2). </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations under the Gift Duty Assessment Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Sales Tax `Exemptions and Classifications) Act are also to be given an indefinite exemption as provided for in new subsection 40 (3). </PARA>
<PARA> An exemption under new subsection 40 (4) is to be given to Student Assistance Schemes provided for in the Student Assistance Act 1973. The criteria for means tests and rates of payment for these student assistance schemes are discriminatory on the basis of marital status. The Government has decided to undertake a review of the discriminatory provisions of these schemes over the next three years and has limited the period of the exemption accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs are currently conducting reviews of the Defence Act and the Defence Services Homes Act respectively with a view to amending the provisions of these Acts which are inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act. Consequently, an indefinite exemption is not required for these Acts. If these Acts are not amended before the expiration of the current Regulations, an administrative exemption under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act may be sought from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the inconsistent State and Territory laws covered by the Regulations have either been amended to remove inconsistencies with the Sex Discrimination Act or no longer have any application. Of the inconsistent legislation which remains, the necessary exemptions may be continued, on application of the relevant government to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, by the grant of an administrative exemption under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act. In regard to the State legislation prohibiting women being employed in lead processing, it is open to employers to apply to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for an administrative exemption. Consequently, no action is required by Parliament in respect of relevant State and Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Marriage Act to be effected by this Bill remove the long-standing discrimination on the grounds of sex relating to minimum marriageable age. The Bill also proposes to make gender-neutral two provisions of the Marriage Act concerning marriages solemnised overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing provisions of the Marriage Act, the marriageable age for females is 16 and the marriageable age for males is 18. The minimum age at which females and males below marriageable age can obtain court authorisation to marry a person of marriageable age is 14 and 16, respectively. The Bill provides for a common marriageable age of 18 with provision for reduction to 16 in exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of a common marriageable age for females and males is a world-wide tendency. There are now at least 38 countries which prescribe a common marriageable age, with 24 of these prescribing a marriageable age of 18 years. The attached table shows these countries. </PARA>

<PARA> The Australian Law Reform Commission recently released Discussion Paper 46 on Multiculturalism: Family Law.

The focus of the Discussion Paper is whether there should be court authorisation for marriages where a person is below 18 years and, if so, in what circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> A survey of marriage counsellors, marriage educators, court counsellors and national marriage counselling representatives was conducted by my Department in 1988. 47% of 1010 persons polled responded, of whom 65% were of the view that 18 is an appropriate minimum marriageable age for males and 63% that 18 is an appropriate minimum age for females. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General's Department has also consulted with all other Commonwealth Departments and is satisfied that there is no Commonwealth legislation other than the Marriage Act 1961 and the Family Law Act 1975 that refers to marriageable age, that there is no other Commonwealth legislation that would be affected by the proposed amendments to marriageable age, that there are no administrative arrangements that would be adversely affected and that there are no likely difficulties that might be caused in relation to any arrangements with State or Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains transitional provisions relating to marriageable age which preserves the position of females between the ages of 14 and 18 who had commenced proceedings or given notice of intention to marry in accordance with the present law. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a consequential provision relating to the recognition of foreign marriages by minors where neither party is domiciled in Australia. At present the Marriage Act provides that such a marriage, that would otherwise be recognised in Australia, shall not be recognised as valid while the female party is under the age of 14 years or the male party is under the age of 16 years. Those ages are, of course, the minimum ages at which parties may presently marry with court authorisation. As the Bill raises the minimum age at which a female may marry in Australia with court authorisation to 16 years, it is consistent to apply this age to the recognition of these foreign marriages. Accordingly, the Bill provides that such a marriage shall not be recognised while either party is under 16 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill further deals with discriminatory provisions relating to the solemnisation overseas of certain marriages under our Marriage Act. These provisions are very rarely used. Section 77 imposes an additional requirement on a female non-Australian; section 78 imposes an additional requirement on a male non-Australian. The Bill renders both provisions gender-neutral, but does not affect their substance. </PARA>
<PARA> The other Act which is currently exempted by the Regulations and to which I have not yet referred is the War Gratuity Act. The War Gratuity Act provides for the payment of a gratuity to members of the Armed Forces who served in World War II and their dependants. The Act is discriminatory on the grounds of sex and marital status in that it does not recognise de facto spouses and provides differing benefits to widows and widowers. As the financial impact if the offending provisions were to be amended is minimal, the Government has decided to amend the Act to remove the discrimination. The amendments will in no way affect existing payments and entitlements but they will extend the ambit of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act is also to be amended so as to be expressed in gender neutral language. Section 5 of the Act is racially discriminatory but has been impliedly repealed by section 10 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. It was therefore in keeping with the policy of amending the War Gratuity Act to be non-discriminatory to delete section 5 from the Act. These amendments are contained in Part 4 of the Bill and its attached schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to six current Bounty Acts as a consequence of the Decisions announced by the Government in its Industry Statement of 12 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed changes fall into four general categories, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>i) amendments to the 3 Textile, Clothing and Footwear Bounties to accelerate the phasing down in bounty rates up to the end of each bounty on 30 June 1995;</PARA>
<PARA>ii) amendments to the Metal Working Machine Tools and Robots Bounty to extend the bounty for a further six years, broaden its coverage to include machine tools for working advanced metals, and introduce various new eligibility criteria;</PARA>
<PARA>iii) amendments to the Computer Bounty to widen its coverage to include printed circuit boards, which will be offset by a slight reduction in bounty rates over the life of the Bounty; and</PARA>
<PARA>iv) amendments to 5 bounties to introduce minimum annual production threshold levels before bounty may be claimed, and amendment to 1 bounty to increase the minimum claim level. </PARA>
<PARA>i) Amendments to the three Textile, Clothing and Footwear Bounties</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Bounty (Bed Sheeting) Act 1977, Bounty (Printed Fabrics) Act 1981 and Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 introduce complimentary changes to assistance for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries which, when taken in concert with the amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987, will extend to the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>The bounty changes incorporated in this Bill are designed to encourage the development of a more internationally competitive Textile, Clothing and Footwear (TCF) sector which will be viable with lower levels of community support. Australian consumers stand to benefit from better products at cheaper prices. Economy wide effects will accrue from the more efficient allocation of resources. </PARA>
<PARA>In line with these objectives;</PARA>
<PARA> The Textile Yarn Bounty will be phased from 30 percent value-added on 1 July 1992 to zero by 1 July 1995 and replaced with a 5 percent tariff. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bed Sheeting Bounty will be extended to 30 June 1995 without review but will phase down from 16 cents per square metre on 1 July 1992 to zero by 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bounty on Textile Printing will phase down to zero by 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>In line with the recommendations of the TCF Development Authority's review of Textile Yarn bounty administration the Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 is also proposed to be amended beyond the previously mentioned phasing rate changes. The major additional change is an amendment to exclude from eligibility for bounty the beaming, warping and sizing processes which are preparatory to fabric production together with any repeat winding resulting from those processes. These activities are not genuinely involved in yarn production and their exclusion will lead to an estimated reduction in outlays of around $4 million per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>ii) Amendments to the Metal-Working Machine Tools and Robots Bounty</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Bounty (Metal Working Machines and Robots) Act 1985 provide for the continuation of bounty assistance for local production of certain machine tools and robots from 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1997. </PARA>
<PARA>The current metal working machines and robots bounty commenced in 1985 and is due to expire on 30 June 1991. In its recent review on this Bounty the Bureau of Industry Economics found that the present scheme had been largely effective in meeting its objectives of helping to maintain a viable machine tool industry and encouraging industry restructuring towards high technology areas and new metal cutting technologies, including the production of robots. </PARA>
<PARA>The provision of assistance to the local industry by way of bounty has also enabled user industries to have access to modern equipment at world prices, as imports can enter duty free. </PARA>
<PARA>The availability of competitively priced, locally built equipment will make a significant contribution to improving the competitive position of our manufacturing industries. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the proposed extension of the Machine Tools Bounty, several other amendments to this scheme are proposed. </PARA>
<PARA>It is intended to extend the Bounty's coverage to cater for current and prospective advances in the area of processing technology for new materials (such as ceramics, polymers, and composite materials). While there is little local production at present in machine tools for the working of such advance materials, this measure should encourage tooling in such areas. Equipment of this kind designated eligible for bounty will also be duty free when imported, to benefit end-users. </PARA>
<PARA>To avoid distortions in production, the Bill also proposes to make eligible for bounty all equipment produced in the bountiable categories, whether sold in the domestic market or overseas. This is in line with recommendations made by the BIE to remove the current bounty restriction in the Act on some export production. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also introduces a minimum annual production threshold level before bounty may be claimed, which I will outline briefly in my general remarks under the 4th general category of amendments to bounty legislation proposed by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>iii) Amendments to the Computers Bounty</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 provide for the widening of the computer bounty to include local manufacture of printed circuit boards from 1 July 1991. At the same time, the tariff on imported printed circuit boards is being made `Free'. </PARA>
<PARA>Printed circuit boards are a strategically important component used in the manufacture of a wide range of electronic microprocessor based equipment utilised by industry sectors which include telecommunications, computer, aerospace, automotive, scientific and medical, and consumer electronics. </PARA>
<PARA>The tariff on printed circuit boards acts as a cost imposed on local electronic equipment manufacturers and value-added assemblers, which in turn impacts on their pricing and international competitiveness. The computer bounty is a preferable form of assistance which will help reduce the costs of locally produced and imported boards while encouraging increasing levels of international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>iv) Amendments relating to minimum annual thresholds</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments which introduce minimum annual threshold levels into the bounty schemes for Machine Tools and Robots, Textile Yarns, Computers, Printed Fabrics and Bed Sheeting are intended to ensure equity across the various bounty schemes which currently do not have provisions that ensure marginal producers are ineligible for bounty payments. </PARA>
<PARA>The primary objective of the threshold is to encourage efficient manufacturing in those sectors by eliminating from the schemes peripheral production by firms not significantly committed to bountiable production in the respective industries. </PARA>
<PARA>Actual savings will be minimal but the thresholds are designed to exclude small one-off claims where administrative costs can exceed payment. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA>The potential savings for the period 1992-95 as a result of the accelerated phase down in bounty rates for the 3 Textile Yarn Bounties is $56 million, at current prices. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments extending the Machine Tools and Robots Bounty beyond this financial year are expected to result in an overall cost to 1 July 1997 of $38.6 million (at current prices). The bounty is estimated to cost $15 million in 1991/92 (at current prices), but will phase down to around $2 million per year by financial year 1996/97. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Computers Bounty to widen its coverage to include printed circuit boards as from 1 July 1992 will be accommodated as far as possible within the current budget forecasts by reducing the scheduled bounty rates by one percentage point as from the 1992/93 financial year. Total bounty outlays are therefore forecast to remain at $50.1 million in 1991/92, $49.5 million in 1992/93 and $48.7 million in 1993/94. </PARA>
<PARA>The threshold amendments have no financial implications, as they are directed at creating efficiencies within various industries rather than being aimed at specific cost savings. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the accompanying Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Knowles) adjourned. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator Collins) agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That these Bills be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to the Harrison inquiry into meat industry reform in regard to processing and slaughtering. I want to begin my comments by quoting from an editorial in the Herald-Sun of 11 April. The editorial states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Certainly if it can be established beyond doubt that the Government bowed to union pressure to make amendments favourable to the union, it is a very serious matter indeed.</PARA>
<PARA>I am talking about an industry which provides some $3 billion of export dollars to Australia. It is an industry which has slaughtering and processing costs some two to three times higher than our international competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly wish to address what has occurred in Victoria; how the Victorian Government's decision has been compromised by the unholy alliance between the Victorian Government and the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU); and in particular, the alliance between Premier Kirner and Wally Curran. </PARA>
<PARA> One might ask why a Western Australian senator is interested in a Victorian submission. The answer is simple. It is because the Harrison inquiry will have an effect on the whole of the Australian meat industry, including the industry in my State of Western Australia. If the recommendations in fact do address our lack of competitiveness, do address the need for labour market reform, do address the problems in management and are adopted, the benefits will flow through to all States, including my own. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government's final submission severely compromised the ability of the Harrison inquiry to do this. I seek leave to table the following documents, which I have shown to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), who is at the table: Submission to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission; Inquiry into the Meat Industry 1990 by the Government of Victoria, dated July 1990; Submission to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission; Inquiry into the Meat Industry 1990/91 by the Government of Victoria, dated January 1991; a memo to the Chief General Manager from Barry Rowe, Minister for Agriculture; a memo to the Minister from the Chief General Manager on the subject of `Submission to Industrial Relations Inquiry into the Meat Industry'; a memo to Acting PAEL from Michael J. Taylor, General Manager, Rural Policy and Marketing; a letter to the Premier, Hon. J. Kirner, from Barry Rowe, Minister for Agriculture; a handwritten note to Judy from Terry Trusworth; and the Curran critique. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would now like to give a brief summary of some of the events that have occurred in relation to this matter. In particular, I want to refer to events that have occurred in the meat industry. The Victorian State Government, under the leadership of Premier Cain, prepared a submission to the Harrison inquiry in July 1990. That submission, which has been tabled, was endorsed by the responsible Minister and was ready to go to the inquiry. After Premier Cain stepped aside and Mrs Kirner was elected Premier, the submission to the Harrison inquiry was rewritten. This `new' submission was handed over to the Harrison inquiry in January of this year. The dates on the front pages of the two submissions-1 July 1990 and January 1991-are not the only difference. Of course, there are substantial differences or deletions in terms of the second submission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Wally Curran has admitted that he `doctored' the Victorian State Government's submission to the Harrison inquiry, `helping' with the rewriting of the submission. Basically, a total of 11 pages were removed from the submission. Those pages mainly dealt with the effect of prolonged industrial disputes on the industry. As well, the final page of the `new' submission blames the meat industry's woes on employers. This was not the case in the original submission. Wally Curran wrote a critique of the original submission, singling out 17 major issues with which he disagreed. Of the 17 issues with which Mr Curran disagreed, 14 were either changed or deleted in the Government's final submission. </PARA>
<PARA> In October 1990 the AMIEU broke an undertaking to cease industrial action at abattoirs during the Harrison inquiry. It began action over a wage claim contained in the accord mark VI. I emphasise that 12 of 19 export meatworks have closed down in Victoria. There has been a disagreement over whose jurisdiction the dispute comes under. Victorian Premier Kirner says that she will not intervene as it is a Federal matter while Senator Cook has taken the view that it is a matter for the Industrial Relations Commission. The Federal Government will not intervene. </PARA>
<PARA> In the six weeks to 28 November 1990, industrial disputes had caused the loss of 3.2 million man days of work and approximately $83m in export earnings. In mid-December, the Industrial Relations Commission excluded the AMIEU from the national wage case decision as a result of its continuing industrial action. The Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia estimates that industrial action over the past 18 months has resulted in a loss of over $100m in exports. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like now to touch briefly on some aspects of the documents that I have tabled. The fact that a government document has been amended by a union official is of grave concern. It is even more concerning when the document in question is to go to an inquiry into the industry which the union represents. The edited submission has caused deep factional splits within the Victorian Australian Labor Party. It is also believed to be one of the reasons for Barry Rowe losing his agricultural portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Premier Kirner, in answering questions and criticisms surrounding the rewritten work, stated that the original submission was only a draft, which is clearly not correct; that there was no AMIEU involvement, which is clearly not correct; and that a serious oversight had taken place by not involving the department responsible for manufacturing and industry development. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment on some of the documents and highlight a few of the points that have been made in them. The former Minister, Mr Rowe, sent the submission and a covering letter to former Premier Cain asking him, on behalf of the Government, to forward it to the Harrison meat inquiry. On 21 November 1990 he sent a further letter, headed `Victorian Submission to Meat Industry Inquiry', to the current Premier, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> In April 1990 the Australian Industrial Relations Commission initiated a national inquiry into awards and conditions in the meat processing industry. Commissioner Harrison, who is conducting the inquiry, agreed to accept submissions from parties who are not signatories to the award. Consequently the Federal government and the National Farmers Federation have lodged submissions with the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> After consultation with industry groups and following advice from the Department of Labour, my department prepared a submission which was sent to your department as the basis of a Victorian government submission. </PARA>
<PARA> You will be aware that export opportunities, especially in Japan and Korea, will decide the future of this industry which currently contributes some $1,100m to the State's economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, it is important that the government deal with these issues through a range of measures, which create a more productive and cooperative industrial climate. A specific measure is to ensure that the government contribute to the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be pleased if you could ensure that the submission on behalf of the Victorian government is transmitted to the meat industry inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>This letter was backed up by a memo signed by the Chief General Manager, D.E. Hore, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA>In July 1990 you forwarded to the Premier a submission to the IRC inquiry into the meat industry which was prepared by this department with benefit of comment from officers of the Department of Premier and Cabinet and the Department of Labour, the ACTU and the AMIEU. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister wrote a further memo on 15 January 1990 to the Chief General Manager. The subject was the meat industry submission to the Harrison inquiry. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>1. I have discussed the redrafted version with the Premier's Office, and indicated that removal of the time series data on investment would present an incomplete-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the word `incomplete'-</PARA>
<PARA>picture of the industry at present. The observations on employers fall into the same category. </PARA>
<PARA>2. As such the final version departs a great deal from the document submitted by DARA to the Premier's Office, and it is now up to those agencies supporting the final version to ensure its submission to the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister wanted no more to do with the incomplete and biased submission that the Premier's Department had provided to the AMIEU, which interfered with things. </PARA>
<PARA> After the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (DARA) submission was sent to the Government a critique was prepared by the Secretary of the AMIEU, Wally Curran, who proposed 19 recommendations to be included in the Government submission to the Harrison inquiry. After examining that critique, the original submission prepared by the former Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs and DARA was reworked and that reworked submission went to the meat inquiry. I can advise the Senate that 13 of the 19 recommendations were taken on board and included in the Government's submission. </PARA>
<PARA> On 19 March the Leader of the National Party in Victoria asked the Premier who the Government consulted with on the submission. She replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I have made it clear that there was consultation on the meat industry with the Victorian Farmers Federation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Premier said that consultation had occurred with the Federation, but I have with me a letter of 15 March 1991 signed by the President of the Victorian Farmers Federation, Mr Arbuthnot, in which, in part, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have had no consultation and, to my knowledge, neither has anyone else in the Victorian Farmers Federation on the Victorian government's submission to the Harrison inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>That was supported by a letter from the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia (MATFA) under the signature of its Executive Director, Mr Kevin Iles. The first paragraph on the second page of that letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA>MATFA was never given the opportunity of having input into any government submission to the inquiry. MATFA was certainly not consulted on the contents. </PARA>
<PARA>I outline the differences between the submission, which was originally prepared in July 1990, and the final submission that went to the Harrison meat inquiry. The original document contained 36 pages, but the submission presented to the inquiry was a 25-page document. Omitted from the original submission were: references to statistical data on the Victorian industry and comparison with the Queensland and New South Wales industries; the commissioned report of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on the value-adding opportunities for agriculture-specifically cost structures in Victoria's meat processing sector-and references to the Victorian Government offering assistance to the Commission to advance the development of industrial harmony in the meat processing industry. They are significant deletions. Also deleted was the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimate of 45,200 working days lost between May and November due to industrial action in the Victorian meat processing industry. I emphasise that that was in Victoria alone; it does not include the Queensland, Victorian or Western Australian figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I have set out to demonstrate how the inquiry process into the meat industry has been sabotaged by the unholy alliance between Premier Kirner and Wally Curran. It is a very sad occurrence because the meat industry is a very important industry to Australia. The intention in establishing the Harrison inquiry, which did a world tour, was to address the problems which exist in the meat industry. They are not problems which are confined to Victoria; they extend to all States in Australia. The fact is that we have a State government in this country which is not revealing the full picture with regard to the situation which exists in that State. It is, indeed, a very sad day for that industry and I think it is a very sad day for the political process in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, these documents and what has occurred demonstrate quite clearly that we have a subservient Premier and an industrial bandit running the submissions from the Victorian Government into the meat industry inquiry-the Harrison inquiry. That would be fine if it were just a Victorian problem. But it is not just a Victorian problem; it is an Australian problem. It has serious implications for the future of the meat industry. It demonstrates the incredible subservience of the Victorian Government to the AMIEU. It will affect all abattoirs, processors, and of course producers, who are the ones who sit at the bottom end of the line. They have to take what they are given. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a disgraceful episode in the inquiry process in this country and I throw the challenge to the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, to assure this Senate that the statistical data on what has occurred in the meat industry is placed before the Harrison inquiry. As I outlined earlier, the Federal Government was given the right to put evidence before the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry should be told the total story officially and formally. It should be told that the continuing guerilla tactics which have been adopted by the AMIEU have directly cost the meat industry about $150m and, of course, there are other aspects involved in the cost. In conclusion, I once again quote from an article in the Sun-Herald, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, if it can be established beyond doubt that the Government bowed to union pressure to make amendments favourable to the union, it is a very serious matter indeed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Harrison inquiry has been compromised and undermined. It is indeed a serious matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity today to address a few remarks to the Federal Government's policy directions in the area of languages. These remarks have been motivated by my reading of the recent report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled Words at Work: A report on literacy needs in the workplace and also the Government's recently released Green Paper entitled The Language of Australia: Discussion Paper on an Australian Literacy and Language Policy for the 1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, the Australian Democrats welcome the March 1991 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee and we note that key recommendations of that report include the development of an adult literacy strategy and English language and literacy programs for all migrants. The report submits that it is the responsibility of government to ensure that all people leaving school or entering the work force are literate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats support the development of a coordinated long term national literacy strategy. Literacy in English allows citizens to become effective and fulfilled members of society. It has been estimated that between one and two million adults in Australia cannot accomplish everyday reading and writing tasks. Other research shows that one in seven workers has insufficient literacy in English to cope with the basic safety and performance requirements of his or her job. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's Green Paper presents some good ideas and a commitment to improving literacy in English in the Australian community. However, that document is far too limited as a basis for future directions in a national languages and literacy policy. I suggest that it is even limited by its very title, which I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, is Language of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Green Paper tries to separate literacy from language and to restrict literacy to English only. It downplays the importance of language maintenance and ignores the provision of language services, including the needs of the deaf community. It overlooks the value of bilingualism to both individuals and the community-the fact, which is supported by evidence in the Australian context, that languages other than English support the learning of English and that literacy in one language supports literacy in another. </PARA>
<PARA> English literacy has always been a top priority of national languages and literacy policy. English for all, including literacy, is the first principle of the Government's current internationally acclaimed national policy on languages. There are three other basic principles which the Government must continue to support. These are support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island languages; a language other than English for all; and equitable language services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disappointing but not surprising that the thrust of the Government's changing policy in this area is oriented towards the labour market. English literacy is therefore seen as an economic resource in terms of work force participation and productivity. We condemn the statements made by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on 20 March 1991 in an address to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Conference on Education and Cultural and Linguistic Pluralism. Mr Dawkins told the international delegation at that conference that Australia is a monolingual nation and that new training opportunities, including basic health and safety instruction, will be available only in English. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Australian delegates to that OECD conference, Doctor Helen Andreoni, remarked at a follow-up conference on 23 March 1991-which was attended by many of the international delegates who had been at the OECD conference-that she was appalled and ashamed of the Minister's statements. Another of the many critics of the apparent shift in policy in this area, as evidenced by the Green Paper, is senior lecturer at the La Trobe University, Ms Helen Moore. In her January 1991 paper Teaching English to speakers of other languages: an Australian Perspective she states very strongly:</PARA>
<PARA>The Green Paper represents a significant step backwards . . . multiculturalism is a dead duck, not because it is being replaced by anything that builds from what we have learned here, but because the current agenda has no place for deviation from economic assimilation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Green Paper should go down in history in the company of the White Australia Policy. It is narrower in its view of Australian life. Remnants of the latter Policy's fear of difference are present in the Paper. The Green Paper is positively malign. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dawkins has also described the national policy on languages as `a bit of a dog's breakfast'. The expression is obviously not a very literary turn of phrase. The House of Representatives Committee report stated that the cost and impact of low literacy in the workplace included worker safety, such as the inability to heed warning signs or to handle dangerous chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> Workers from non-English speaking backgrounds are overrepresented in some of Australia's most hazardous industries. By refusing to provide communication of even basic health and safety instructions in languages other than English, the Government is contributing to serious industrial accidents. This is a dangerous and discriminatory attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats fully support urgent attention to the English language and literacy needs of all Australians, adults and children. We also support the maintenance and learning of other languages and the equitable and widespread provision of language services. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two essential needs in the area of languages and literacy policy: firstly, programs must be supported on a recurrent funding basis simply for stability and planning to be possible; and, secondly, learner pathways must be developed. For instance, there are currently no pathways for people who leave the adult migrant education program. Having finished that program, which only takes learners to survival level English, there is no further pathway to follow. This Government should provide such a pathway. Overall, the Government must reaffirm its commitment to the principles and spirit of the current national policy on languages and the national agenda for a multicultural Australia. This is not being done by Minister Dawkins. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that the national policy on languages and the May 1990 Report on the National Policy on Languages must be used as a basis for the forthcoming White Paper. In a previous notice of motion I said that Australia should be recognised as a multicultural and multilingual nation, that English is the common and national language and that community languages are an intellectual, cultural, social and economic resource of the people and of the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> We appeal to the Government to reject the Dawkins world view of everything in terms of perceived economic benefit, including, under his portfolio, the overseas students fiasco and his amalgamations mania. Instead, this Government must continue to acknowledge and increasingly support the rich diversity of languages in our society. </PARA>

<TITLE>Ravenshoe Sawmill</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.20)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 October 1990, certain matters relating to the disappearance of $7.6m from the Ravenshoe sawmill were referred to the Attorney-General's Department by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly. This occurred as a result of documents, which I had tabled a short time before that in the Senate chamber, which tended to show that Commonwealth money which had supposedly been made available for the sawmill was in fact directed to other places and for other purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole shameful event at Ravenshoe, however, has led the local member, the honourable member for Kennedy, Mr Hulls, to make a particularly grubby and unfounded attack on me, which I feel I am obliged to answer in this place at this time. Mr Hulls has asserted in a press release today-and I will be interested to find out whether Mr Hulls in fact made the statements in the House of Representatives or outside that place-that my calls for an adequate investigation of the Ravenshoe Sawmill disclosed, of all things, that I failed to understand the separation of powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hulls fails to understand the nature of the situation in Ravenshoe because, in answer to a question I asked Senator Richardson on 10 April, Senator Richardson assured me that the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories had, amongst other things, written not only to the Attorney-General's Department but also to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In other words, according to Senator Richardson, the Minister's Department has infringed upon the very principle that Mr Hulls mistakenly said that I do not understand. </PARA>
<PARA> The separation of powers is not tied to the matter of whether a government Minister is going to act responsibly to ensure the thorough investigation of the disappearance of taxpayers' money. Mr Hulls seems to think it improper for a Minister, the responsible Minister, to refer to reports made by the receivers under law to assist in investigations of this sort. Mr Hulls displays not only his failure to understand the separation of powers but also his failure to understand the obligations placed upon receivers under the corporations law and before that the Companies Code, and he fails to understand the doctrine of ministerial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid that Mr Hulls fails to understand something else-that is, his duty and his responsibility to his electors as a member of this Parliament. If Mr Hulls were concerned, as I am, about the people in Ravenshoe, he would have acted to see what had happened to the Commonwealth money, to see what had happened to the hundreds of thousands of dollars lost by unsecured creditors. Instead, Mr Hulls has indulged in a grubby and unfounded attack which brings no honour upon the House of Representatives or upon Mr Hulls. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that for Mr Hulls's benefit I will provide him with a series of press releases and maybe with a series of Hansard extracts so that he can really understand what is happening in Ravenshoe and so that he can understand the importance of the thorough and proper investigation of the matters surrounding the disappearance of the Commonwealth money. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hulls should also note one other thing. He should not attempt to misquote me, either in the other place or outside this Parliament. Mr Hulls has said that I called for prosecution. I called for the Government to bring charges or to table the relevant reports by the receivers to show why they should not bring charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hulls has again misrepresented the facts and has done himself no honour. I hope that this brief opportunity to set the facts right will deter Mr Hulls from again indulging in the sorts of politics that we should not encourage here, in the other place or in any other forum of representatives of the people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Treasury has not yet received a final acquittal of the grants provided to AFCO; a copy of the final acquittal will be made available when it is received.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Budget estimates for 1990-91 contained provision for grants of $20,100 to the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation (APSF) and $17,100 to AFCO to assist their participation in the NPN. However, as AFCO and APSF have ceased their formal involvement with the NPN, these grants will not now be paid to APSF or AFCO for price watch activities in 1990-91.

<PARA> (3) Treasury is unable to provide a breakdown of the expenditure in 1989-90 until it receives the final acquittal of the grants.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. In the proposed budget for funding the NPN in 1989-90, a management fee of $3,800 was sought. However, the Government advised AFCO and APSF that it considered that it was inappropriate for AFCO to receive a fee to administer the grants.</PARA>
<PARA>ATTACHMENT A</PARA>
<PARA>SUBMISSION FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE NATIONAL PRICES NETWORK</PARA>
<PARA>INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA>The operating costs of the expanding National Prices Network (NPN) are far in excess of allocated funds.</PARA>
<PARA>Without further funds, success in achieving its aims is doubtful.</PARA>
<PARA>Through Price Watch activities, AFCO and the APSF have been encouraged to continue their efforts to provide a community service by groups that most benefit by that service.</PARA>
<PARA>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</PARA>
<PARA>The National Prices Network aims to provide local communities with price information on shopping choices:</PARA>
<PARA> * by forming groups of volunteers to monitor prices regularly;</PARA>
<PARA> * by ranking stores surveyed on basket price for a set list of commonly bought groceries;</PARA>
<PARA> * by making the information gained from this exercise accessible to communities at local level.</PARA>
<PARA>This exercise helps to encourage retail competition at local level.</PARA>
<PARA>The NPN's objective is to expand prices monitoring or action groups in all metropolitan centres, major regional centres and isolated rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA>PRESENT DEVELOPMENTS</PARA>
<PARA>Between 350 and 400 stores are regularly surveyed across Australia, by volunteers of all ages and walks of life. The Network is currently expanding into many regional areas of NSW, Victoria and SA. Volunteers are provided with a ``Basket of goods list'' for survey and results returned to NPN for analysis.</PARA>
<PARA>The BASKET of goods for survey has recently been reviewed and tailored to state availability of grocery items.</PARA>
<PARA>The NPN's computer operations were decentralised a year ago as a result of the volume of data requiring analysis. Installation of the Network's computer facilities in regional offices has been slow and there have been problems with staff training. Communication links between Network ``hierarchy'' and Price Watch volunteers is sometimes poor and erratic.</PARA>
<PARA>In establishing a decentralised NPN, it was anticipated that the analysis of data could be more specific to each state. While a certain degree of flexibility may be achieved, with regard to data analysis, it is at the expense of the efficiency of the operation.</PARA>
<PARA>Staff at state levels as a result, have extra duties and do not have enough time to manage their new roles effectively. Nor do they have sufficient resources to pursue the new functions.</PARA>
<PARA>Volunteers are the basis of the functioning and the success of the NPN. Volunteers can be lost through mishandling. Vital price information can be missed because the line of communication is not followed through nor is the community getting the benefit it was promised in joining the NPN.</PARA>
<PARA>All these outcomes are more likely now, than has been in the past because the funds allocated to the operation of the NPN have not grown at the same rate as the workload.</PARA>
<PARA>PROPOSAL TO UPGRADE THE NATIONAL PRICES NETWORK</PARA>
<PARA>AFCO and the APSF propose this plan to upgrade the National Price Network:</PARA>
<PARA> * changes to Organisation of the NPN;</PARA>
<PARA> * changes to Operations (Profile);</PARA>
<PARA> * changes to Network Resourcing;</PARA>
<PARA>Changes to Organisation of the NPN</PARA>
<PARA>It is proposed that the NPN be established as a separate incorporated body with membership open to any organisation sympathetic to its aims. It is expected that membership would include AFCO, APSF, ACOSS, the National Council of Women, Prices Action Groups themselves and perhaps industry groups such as the Australian Supermarket Institute (ASI).</PARA>
<PARA>The proposal includes changing the role of the present Co-ordinating Committee to one more like a Board of Directors. Membership of the Board would be elected by the NPN membership. The proposal also includes incorporation of the NPN thus funding would be directly to NPN rather than via AFCO and APSF.</PARA>
<PARA>The Board would be responsible for the operation of the NPN with an expanded administrative staff including a full time economist, a full time administrator, and a full time development officer. Part time staff would include at the central office, a supporting clerical officer, and at state level, officers whose responsibilities include ensuring that the agreed functions of the NPN are met; possibly by means of a contractual agreement. All employees would be responsible to the NPN Board.</PARA>
<PARA>Changes to Operations</PARA>
<PARA>AFCO and the APSF see in an expanded NPN, a prices advocacy role. This role would be taken by an economist whose knowledge and training would allow a balanced view of market forces and prices issues. This person would be the principal advocate of the Network. A new advocacy role would involve representation of consumer views before Prices Surveillance Authority inquiries and other inquiries into price issues or price related issues.</PARA>
<PARA>This position would carry the primary media profile for the Network.</PARA>
<PARA>Changes to Network Resourcing</PARA>
<PARA>The proposal including centralising the administration of the National Prices Network; volunteer database files; ensuring that agreed functions are met with regard to the services promised to local communities; and ensuring that all volunteers are serviced properly.</PARA>
<PARA>At present, some of these functions are being met some of the time. AFCO and the APSF are committed to providing this community service at the highest professional level.</PARA>
<PARA>The Network would be administered centrally. The administrator would be responsible for ensuring the major functions (eg sending and collecting of survey forms, processing and sending results in accordance with survey schedules, distributing a monthly newsletter, maintaining volunteer database, management of finances, keeping of accounts) are achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>A development officer would be responsible for expanding Network operations in major regional, rural and metropolitan areas; assisting in problem solving in any locality; travelling to speak to community groups and assisting with media liaison.</PARA>
<PARA>BUDGET PROPOSED TO EXPAND THE</PARA>
<PARA>NATIONAL PRICES NETWORK</PARA>
<PARA>To support these changes, a considerable upgrading of funds is needed. A budget proposal is attached. At present many costs involved in operating the Network are borne by Members of Parliament in their general office expenses, for example postage, stationery and photocopying. Additionally there are the costs of extra computer equipment and part time staff to assist, paid in part by the Department of Administrative Services. This proposal transfers these costs to an independent organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA>Most of the Network objectives are only just being achieved through the dedicated efforts of Members of Parliament, their staff and volunteers.</PARA>
<PARA>For the continued success of the NPN, it is essential that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. more funds are allocated;</PARA>
<PARA>2. more staff be trained, and utilised;</PARA>
<PARA>3. an alternative structure be implemented.</PARA>

A capital work of this magnitude, involving staged processes, will be subject to time sensitivities throughout construction which ever construction method is chosen.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) No. The Second Sydney Airport Site Selection Programme Draft Environmental Impact Statement states ``The results of previous studies by the Department of Aviation and of the Major Airport Needs of Sydney Study, although preliminary, indicate that development of a closely spaced parallel runway is physically possible at Kingsford Smith Airport''.</PARA>
<PARA> Elsewhere the document states ``Previous studies have investigated the possibility of increasing runway capacity at Kingsford Smith Airport by constructing an additional runway parallel to the existing north/south runway. Such a proposal is physically possible, although insufficient work has been undertaken to enable the associated facility requirements and environmental impacts to be established.''</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The document stated that ``Various alternatives are available to the Commonwealth Government to ensure that airport capacity is available to meet future needs. In seeking to reserve a second airport site at this time, the Commonwealth Government has indicated its belief that the major increase in capacity in the long term should be catered for at a second airport''.</PARA>

<PARA> * based upon the Sydney Airport Draft Planning Strategy, it indicates how the associated airport facility requirements could be provided.</PARA>
