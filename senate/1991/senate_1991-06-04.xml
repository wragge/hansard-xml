<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Minister for Social Security and his Department on withstanding the best efforts of Senator Bolkus to wrest this Department from him for recent services rendered. Having regard to the importance of integrity in ministerial office and in the wake of the Prime Minister's admission that he lied to the Australian electorate and/or the Treasurer over his prime ministerial intentions, does the Minister regard integrity as an important quality for the leader of the Government and his appointed Ministers? If so, how does he explain his own conduct over the last few weeks in saying that a leadership challenge would have no hope, that he would second the motion of confidence in the incumbent, that the Hawke-Keating leadership team is the one that ought to be kept and that it is the one which will give Labor the best chance of winning next time, when he was actively undermining his own Prime Minister? Finally, does the Minister agree with Senator Robert Ray that in politics no promise is absolute?</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask Senator Ray to make the position perfectly clear: is the Government saying that this Parliament has no business concerning itself with the integrity of Ministers? On that basis, when we know the Government can refuse to answer any question that it likes, does it choose not to pursue a matter which has been pursued exhaustively in this place and the other place on previous occasions?</PARA></TALK.START>

What we are taking about is Question Time and portfolio responsibility at Question Time. The broader questions on matters concerning the Prime Minister and other matters are generally handled in the Senate by the Minister representing the Prime Minister. But this is not a portfolio matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Opposition's motion for the suspension of Standing Orders had been successful yesterday, all these things would have been canvassed, but the Opposition was not successful.

Our forces have been serving with those from other nations, particularly the United Kingdom, to provide security and emergency relief for the displaced Kurdish population returning from Turkey. They were initially deployed for 30 days with the possibility of an extension of up to three months if required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that in our area of operations the task is almost complete, with 90 per cent of humanitarian relief now being handled by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other non-government organisations. Australia has joined the other major coalition commanders in developing a withdrawal plan to take effect shortly. It is anticipated that the Australian contingent will return home shortly after its withdrawal from Iraq. I am sure that all honourable senators will join me in thanking the Australian force for a job well done. Like all the other Australians who served in the Gulf, the forces who served in Operation Habitat have done us proud.</PARA>

Obviously on the two days when one is arriving and departing nothing very much occurs. I was there over the New Year holiday, so I did not find too many Ministers in the Irish Government prepared to interview me at the time. As soon as the New Year holiday was over, the talks occurred with the Irish Government. The talks occurred on two days and took place on the west coast of Ireland at the suggestion of the Irish Government. That is about all there is to say. In terms of what I told the Senate before, I included Ireland in the list of countries with which we were negotiating. I would have hoped to have signed the agreement with Portugal much earlier than I did; I signed it only on the last trip.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Last month the Minister told the Senate that a memorandum of understanding had been signed with Boeing International Corporation relieving Boeing of offsets obligations in return for allowing Australian aerospace companies fair access to Boeing contracts. Have any agreements been reached with other airlines and, if so, what are the benefits to local industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Beahan for reminding me of this matter. In fact, last week I announced a 10-year agreement which clears the way for Australian companies to bid for work with the European aircraft manufacturing consortium, Airbus Industrie. This agreement removes Airbus from current and future civil offsets obligations and provides for existing work programs to be extended with competitive Australian firms and it secures long term opportunities for Australian companies to bid for and participate in new multimillion dollar projects on a competitive basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first of the new programs under the agreement is a follow-on order for A320 wing ribs to be supplied by Hawker de Havilland Ltd. In addition, Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd is to design and supply optional fuel tanks for the A310-300 series of aircraft. The agreement provides Australian industry with the opportunity to share in the success of Airbus and to work at the forefront of aerospace technology.</PARA>
<PARA> The relationship with Airbus on the advanced A330 aircraft has already put Australian industry at the forefront of materials technology. This can be seen in areas such as the use of lithium aluminium alloys by Hawker de Havilland and the design and manufacture of complex composite structures by Aerospace Technologies of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The 10-year agreement represents an important step in the Government's growth strategy for the aerospace industry announced in the 12 March statement. This statement was based on the formation of commercial strategic partnerships with the world's major aerospace companies. Officers from my Department are currently overseas negotiating agreements with other major aerospace companies and I am confident that other agreements will be signed by the end of the year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. The question is about the new model photocopiers which are designed to make double-sided copies on recycled paper. The Minister would be aware that some of these copiers have been installed in some honourable senators' offices, and I must say that that is a welcome replacement for some of the second-hand copiers that have been salvaged from other offices. I ask: given the Government's commitment to the environment, will the Minister now undertake, firstly, to encourage and enable all members of parliament to install similar machines without delay and, secondly, to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that all copiers in Parliament House are upgraded to a similar environmentally friendly standard?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4200" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Bell knows, my Department is making continual efforts to update and improve the equipment provided to senators, and as part of that I recently put in place a trial of a range of photocopiers, in anticipation of requests for upgrades in the next financial year. Any changes in photocopiers in members' offices would be part of the normal upgrade which will take place in 1991-92 and thereafter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The photocopiers that have been put in place have additional features, including the device that Senator Bell referred to, the automatic duplexing device, which allows the easy production of double-sided photocopies. The benefits of that are obvious. The consumption of paper is reduced and also those photocopiers have the capacity to use recycled paper. Some eight members will be involved in the trial, and already we have had a response from one of them saying, not surprisingly, that he felt that the duplex device was essential and not just a fancy option.</PARA>
<PARA> This is part of an overall commitment to recycling and, in that respect, the Department of Administrative Services has introduced a number of initiatives in recent days to encourage the use and reuse of paper. These include the publication of a guide for the use of recycled paper, seminars on recycling, some of which have been conducted in Parliament House and, of course, assessing and supplying technology to encourage proper use of recycled material.</PARA>
<PARA> Also, as part of the overall approach we are taking in this area, the Environmental Futures Group, which has been set up in the Department of Administrative Services to advise me on a range of environmental issues, has taken, as a priority, the issue of investigating the reuse of a number of consumables in offices, ranging from paper and paper products to things such as typewriter ribbons. Obviously we are encouraging members in other parts of the Federal Government system to use recycled material. With respect to the part of the honourable senator's question concerning Parliament House, that probably would be better directed to the President.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. In the light of the Minister's answer and also having regard to the fact that tomorrow is to be observed as World Environment Day, will the Minister make some tangible and direct commitment towards expediting as soon as possible the introduction of machines similar to those that have been successfully trialled so far? Also, will he provide some degree of explanation to those who are continually hamstrung by the idea that this would be an additional expense rather than actually saving money and increasing productivity?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two points there. We are at the start of the trial and, as Senator Bell would realise, the question of the availability of recyclable photocopier paper has been an issue for some time. It has been one that has been difficult to grapple with, but we are very close now to having recycled paper that can be used in photocopiers, and this trial will be extremely important in assessing whether that can be done successfully. In terms of giving greater priority to this issue, I think the mere fact that we have brought on the trial and have made a commitment to try to get the results before the 1991-92 expenditure program is commenced underlines the priority we have given the matter already.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the part of the question concerning savings, I think that is one of those hidden issues when addressing environmental matters, namely, the question of costs. It is always presumed that it is more costly to do things in an environmentally friendly way, whereas quite often the reverse is the case. That is obviously one consideration that we will be taking into account when looking at photocopiers using recycled paper.</PARA>

I for one want to go on record and say that Senator Bolkus is worthy of promotion. I want to say that very early.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to answer this question on the Great Barrier Reef. It was asked by Senator Colston who, of course, has had a continuing interest in the problems of the reef. Water quality would probably have to be the critical management issue that we face on the reef because the damage that degraded water can do is pretty obvious. The only trouble is that often the damage is not obvious at the time that it is being done; it is only obvious later on. That makes it, perhaps, the most difficult to undo. Therefore, we have to attempt to analyse the causes and change the practices which bring about the damage.</PARA>
<PARA> The main concerns are the potential effects of nutrients on corals, enhanced levels of phosphorous and their association with the weakening of the coral skeleton. The nutrients I refer to, of course, include nitrogen. Increased nitrogen stimulates the growth of algae and that competes with the coral. We have had an enormous problem in recent years right along the Queensland coast.</PARA>

<PARA> However, developments are occurring to try to address the problem. The first has been the establishment by the Ministry for Primary Industries of Queensland of a broadly based advisory committee on the effects of agricultural practice. Most people tend to think that that particular problem is the greatest one. There is a workshop on land use patterns and nutrient loadings of the Great Barrier Reef region, which will pool the results of research into agricultural fertiliser use, land use practices and the effect of nutrients. There is the adoption of a new and more stringent policy by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on the control of wastes.</PARA>
<PARA> Approximately $110,000 per annum-which is 25 per cent of the Authority's basic research budget-is currently directed at water quality issues.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am able to inform Senator Childs and other interested senators about the housing strategy to be pursued most vigorously by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Brian Howe, who has taken responsibility for the whole of the housing sector in so far as the Federal Government can influence its development. He understands very well, Mr President, as I know you would, that the housing stock throughout Australia does not match the needs of Australian households in the way it used to because the types of households in which Australians live have changed quite dramatically over the past several years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Howe is therefore taking charge of the national housing strategy. Its primary objective is to enable the development of housing which will be affordable and appropriate for all Australians. He is also most concerned that that housing should be linked to the services which people need. This comes particularly from his experience in the inner city of Melbourne, where he has his electorate, and also flows from his understanding of the needs of the outer suburbs of our vast capital cities, so widespread as they are in the provision of housing on single house blocks. He is also concerned about provincial centres.</PARA>
<PARA> Basically, Mr Howe's emphasis will be on the provision of affordable and appropriate housing for Australians living in families and other combinations, and as single people, in housing units which at the moment are inappropriate for those different households.</PARA>
<PARA> As for affordable housing, it is clear that Mr Howe will be pursuing the need to encourage higher density housing in established suburbs in our cities. For that he will need to have the cooperation of State and local governments because of the major responsibilities which those levels of government have for regulations covering appropriate density of housing, for example, and for service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Howe has also taken a consultative approach, talking to all the main players in the national housing strategy consultations. He will certainly be hosting the Australian Housing Research Council meeting in early July, which will be attended by State housing Ministers and representatives of the housing industry, finance industry bodies, local government, community organisations and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I believe that this consultative process will be a hallmark of Mr Howe's concerns in this area. It will lead to a situation where, as the strategy is developed and implemented, there will be better-in the sense of more affordable and more appropriate-housing available for all Australians in the decades to come.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Giles raises an extremely important issue. In doing so, I think she recognises full well that an objective of the Government and of the National Agenda for Women is the achievement of equal representation of both men and women on boards of the Commonwealth by the year 2000. To this effect, we are taking a number of steps. In fact, three are most important in our pursuit of this goal. Firstly, as the Senate may know, the Government maintains a register of women database, which contains information on women with expertise in particular areas. Of course, we encourage its use by government departments and authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to who set the system up, the point is that the system is currently being updated. I take this opportunity to make it known that the Office of the Status of Women would welcome further nominations from suitable women for registration on the database. As well as that, a monitoring system has been set up to track all Cabinet appointments. As a consequence of the information obtained from that system, it is seen that the total number of women on statutory boards as at February 1991 was 18 per cent. Though this is nowhere near good enough, it does compare favourably with the 12 per cent which was the estimate as at June 1988. So there has been an increase over the last three years in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, a new system called `Appoint' has been put in place. It was launched in March and is currently being installed in Commonwealth departments. The aim of the system is to allow accurate measurement of all appointments to Commonwealth bodies. It will enable the tracking and monitoring of the rate of appointment to Commonwealth bodies of not just women but all equal employment opportunity target groups. The system will provide quarterly monitoring reports, and they will be made available both to interested Ministers and to central monitoring points which have an interest in the appointment of the particular groups involved. The central monitoring points will be the Office of the Status of Women, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the Office of Multicultural Affairs and the Office of Disability in the Department of Community Services and Health. The first quarterly reports from Appoint will be due in September this year.</PARA>
<PARA> It should also be mentioned that from next year-that is, the 1991-92 financial year-departmental annual report guidelines are expected to ask for portfolio appointment rates to be included as well. This will assist the Government to measure progress in fulfilling our objectives in this area as part of our commitment to social justice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very complex question and one which has bedevilled the Australian political process for a long time. Certainly at times of previous governments there has been a much greater focus on job creation, decentralisation and the building up of regional centres in Australia. At other times that has happened as an organic thing in some particular areas where there have been natural resources or particular skills, and growth has occurred for those reasons. This is often considered by governments in relation to the migration program. Whether one can take steps to encourage migration to particular areas of the country, the answer seems to be no in terms of providing an effective inducement to people to move to and remain in regional areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Reynolds's question was probably directed more to future policy and how we might approach some of these issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I were successful, the honourable senator would as well, but obviously I am not. There are some suggestions in the press that the Department of Employment, Education and Training may have mishandled the whole industry and so on. The Minister's position is that we will go ahead with the legislation. The Industry Commission report is a draft report and it will form the basis for further consultation and hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am informed that the proposed recommendations are not supported. The Minister is of the view that it would not be credible in international education markets, nor among education institutions and authorities in Australia, to so support them. He is concerned that the international education community is particularly sensitive about quality assurance matters and would reject Australia as a study destination were we to appear less than interested in accreditation and other educational quality issues. Accreditation is a critical factor in the United States of America, which has 30 per cent of the world's foreign students.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister further informs me that the Government is fully committed to maintaining the high quality of Australia's education system. Existing accreditation arrangements are a crucial part of systems to assure quality. He is of the opinion that the Industry Commission appears to ignore the very important historical and constitutional roles played by the States and Territories, not only in educational provision but also in accreditation and quality assurance generally. I suppose that is one fault that the Industry Commission has from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA> International students are important to us in many ways. They enrich our educational systems with cultural diversity and intelligence. They assist our research efforts and strengthen our educational institutions. In summary, the Government does not accept the proposed recommendations and is proceeding with the legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate in that capacity and probably also in his capacity of Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Given that this country is still lacking in good private sector managers, especially in financial areas, and given that the second round of applications for collaborative research centres is currently being developed, does the Minister think it would be a good idea for one of those research institutes to focus on research into management and finance? Will he consider writing to large financial houses and relevant university departments to suggest that they develop such an application?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assumption in the question is that there is a lack of good private sector managers. That is a view which I largely share, certainly in relation to management innovation, research and development and so on.

<PARA> As far as collaborative research centres are concerned, applications are called for and the projects are then selected by a committee. I have no ministerial input into that committee. We have an extraordinary number of management schools and management courses in Australia, but whether we are getting quantity or quality is an issue about which I am not quite sure. I would certainly embrace the idea which is inherent in Senator Crowley's question and encourage business to consider approaches for a collaborative research centre grant, but it is not something on which I would have any direct influence.</PARA>

I refer the Minister to the case of a South Australian woman, Mrs Ellie Herbert, who has recently returned to Australia after a trip to the United States to recover her two children following their abduction by her former husband. I ask the Minister: what steps did the Federal Government take to assist Mrs Herbert to recover her children? In what ways can the Australian Government assist people, such as Mrs Herbert, in the future?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Foreman for his question. As a senator from South Australia he would, of course, be particularly concerned about Mrs Herbert's story which is indeed a shocking one where, no doubt with a very profound sense of horror and in a very traumatic experience, she found that her husband, while enjoying access to his two children pursuant to an order of the Family Court of Australia, unlawfully removed them from this country and took them to the United States. Such abductions are not uncommon. Fortunately, however, the Federal Government is in a position to help in these sorts of situations. We were able to come to Mrs Herbert's assistance and to bring the case to a happy end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to pay particular tribute to the honourable member for Adelaide, Dr Bob Catley, who has championed Mrs Herbert's cause. His office got in contact with my office and arrangements were quickly set in place to process Mrs Herbert's application for financial assistance under the overseas custody child removal scheme which I administer. The result was that at short notice we were able to provide $10,000 to Mrs Herbert to enable her and a companion to travel to the United States to commence legal proceedings for the recovery of her children. Her lawyer was successful in the Californian court which ruled that her children should be returned to her custody in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I have granted some financial assistance to about 13 cases in the past 12 months relating to abduction of children from Australia to overseas destinations by one of the parents exercising rights in relation to access or custody. It is gratifying that in these cases, as in Mrs Herbert's, we have been able to minimise the trauma caused to the parent with the lawful custody of those children and, of course, the children themselves are then brought into the relationship which the Family Court has decided ought to be theirs with the custodial parent. I believe that money spent in this particular assistance scheme is money very well spent on behalf of these Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The agreement related to the provision of financial assistance to re-equip the company's mill at Ravenshoe, Queensland, so that it could continue to operate for at least 10 years using plantation timber supplies from outside the nominated World Heritage area. That agreement was for strictly limited purposes, including retooling the Ravenshoe mill so that it continued to operate following the World Heritage listing. It provided for an interest free loan of $4.5m, repayable over 10 years, an annual subsidy, totalling $2.125m per year, payable on 1 July in years 1989 to 1992. An amount of $7.6m was allocated through that agreement to the Ravenshoe mill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has now become obvious that this agreement has been breached in many respects and that a huge sum of money has never been used for the proper purposes as specified in the agreement, to retool the mill and provide an iron lung for Ravenshoe. Instead, large sums have been siphoned off from Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd to an associated company, National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd and its plywood mill in Kyogle-not the mill in Ravenshoe. They are two completely different companies. Not only was the money misdirected but this occurred while Senator Richardson was the responsible Minister or, should I say, the irresponsible Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister must explain to the satisfaction of this Senate how the final payment of the $968,841 was paid earlier than the agreement stated and why it was paid to Timbertech Group, not a party to the agreement with the Commonwealth. The Minister should have understood that, because he signed the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> On 15 May, Senator Richardson, in answer to my question, told the Senate that a payment of $968,841 had been made to Timbertech, the trade name of Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd, and that the payment in question was authorised by the agreement that was signed on behalf of the Commonwealth by himself on 29 June 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also told that the third payment was an advance agreed departmentally. I have a copy of the agreement between Plywood and Plastic and the Commonwealth which clearly states that the payments were to be made on 1 July in the years 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992. Last week I tabled a business and consumer affairs search that conclusively proved that Timbertech was not the trade name of Plywood and Plastic but of National Associated Plywood. </PARA>
<PARA> In his answer on 29 May, Senator Richardson said that his Department had given him a briefing on the payment and he had concurred, on the basis of that information, that a payment should be made. Ten minutes later, at the end of Question Time, he said that the Department had just advised him that he had not been informed that the payment was being made or to whom, yet on 16 May Senator Richardson told the Senate that he recalled simply authorising a payment but, off the top of his head, could not remember to whom. I think, at that stage, he said that he simply ticked the appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA> On Thursday, Senator Richardson informed the Senate of a meeting held the week before with his former Department to discuss the payment being made to the wrong company. I would have thought that at the meeting with his former Department Senator Richardson would have been informed by the head of that Department that he had not been a party to knowing who actually had made the payment, instead of being allowed to continue to tell the Senate, as late as last week, that he had given his authority to the payment. </PARA>
<PARA> This is in complete contradiction to the agreement made with the Minister that payments would be made on 1 July. Surely an advance payment six months earlier, in January, would need the Minister's approval as he had originally signed the agreement for the Government and was Minister at the time. Surely an agreement cannot be altered by someone ringing up and simply saying, `We are running out of money. We have a cash flow problem. Send us a cheque for another million dollars' then sending a letter saying, `Pay it to Plywood and Plastic', and the Department paying it to the name on the letterhead-Timbertech-a company with no responsibility to the mill at Ravenshoe. That is what Senator Richardson is asking the Senate to believe. </PARA>
<PARA> There are mistakes and there are mistakes, but this is a million-dollar mistake and it has hit not only the Senate, which has to accept it, but also the people of Ravenshoe who were supposed to receive the $968,841 to help them out. Senator Richardson cannot just get up in the Senate and say that he was not informed and absolve himself of all responsibility. That is against the Westminster--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not interested in what Peter Durack did. This was another contradiction, because we were told on 16 October 1990 that until the company went into receivership on 20 April it was trading profitably. Companies do not trade profitably and then just go broke on a given day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are too many contradictions and Senator Richardson has not explained them. He was responsible for the Department when it breached the agreement by paying an early advance to the wrong company-a company that went into receivership three months after the Department paid it. The Department that Senator Richardson was responsible for did not get a set of audited accounts or a deed of release from the correct company, as advised by Price Waterhouse-advice which the Government had paid for and had sought. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already told the Senate that the only audited accounts ever received by the Commonwealth related to the 1987-88 financial year. Senator Richardson, in his answer on 16 October, advised that audited accounts had been requested in December 1989 and early 1990. The Senate learned last Thursday in the Estimates debate that Timbertech, in its letter to the Department requesting early payment, said that audited accounts would be completed on 15 December 1989 and would be forwarded to the Department forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did the Department not pursue the company so it could check on the company's financial position before the payment? The audited accounts were available. In the letters tabled by the Minister last week, a letter from Timbertech read, `The audited accounts will be available'. Instead, the Minister told us that he sought accounting, not legal, advice on whether the early payment could be made by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the accounting advice was that the Commonwealth should obtain a deed of release from the company for the amount of the early payment. That was the advice the Minister paid for. Why did he not take any notice of it? The Government did not do this. The Department should also have investigated whether it could rightly make a payment six months before the clause in the contract said it was to be made and, to make matters worse, the Department then sent the cheque to the wrong company. </PARA>
<PARA> If this deed of release had been obtained as advised, this would never have happened. The Minister has revealed that the early payment was requested because of the short term cash flow problems with the mill. As we learned last week, Price Waterhouse advised the Department that before any payment was made the company should supply its most recent management accounts and projections to support its cash flow need. Again, this was never done. Why was it not done? Senator Richardson was the Minister responsible at the time and he never checked on his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not done, contrary to the advice given by Price Waterhouse. Considering the cash flow problems, the Department should have been particularly vigilant to obtain the audited accounts, which we know were available, before making payment, and to follow the accounting advice it paid for and get a deed of release from the correct company for the early payment and the cheque so that it could legally make advance payments. </PARA>
<PARA> However, by this payment being made to the wrong company and not to the Ravenshoe mill, the tradespeople of Ravenshoe who were owed money by the company were not able to be paid, despite this being the reason for the request for the questionable advance payment. Certainly the Ravenshoe company was not being helped with its cash flow problems by the Government sending the money to Kyogle when it should have been sending it to Ravenshoe. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson was further negligent in that his Department did not keep sufficient checks to monitor the agreement, and that is where I hold Senator Richardson responsible. He just cannot hand out $7.6m of government money, slap everyone on the back and say, `I've done my job' and walk away from it. </PARA>
<PARA> He was not aware of machinery and equipment being sold out the back door. In a question on 17 October 1990, I asked Senator Richardson whether it was true that a boiler purchased with Commonwealth loan money was sold and leased back by the company. I also asked whether the sale of a veneer mill was a breach of the terms of the loan agreement, which stated that the company was not to dispose of the assets of the company without the Commonwealth's permission. Senator Richardson did not even understand or know about it at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> On 18 October 1990, the Minister admitted that a wood fired boiler worth approximately $412,000 and purchased by Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd with Commonwealth assistance had been sold to AGC Ltd and leased back to the company. At the same time, he also admitted to the Senate that a $425,000 veneer hardwood timber plant was sold without his permission. Another $837,000 of taxpayers' money gone in breach of the agreement!</PARA>
<PARA> He told us the Government did not know anything about it, and he did not know anything about it. Why did he not know anything about it? In an answer to a question on 16 October 1990, the Minister said-and this has to be the greatest laugh of all time- `Like any good business manager the Commonwealth did not let its loans go unwatched'. That is one that will haunt Senator Richardson for the rest of his life. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone in Ravenshoe knew that the veneer mill had been flogged out the back door. It was the talk of the town. Yet the Minister admits that he only became aware of the disappearance of the veneer mill when he was advised by a letter on 19 September 1990 from the receiver-manager. It is a clear indication, if any further indication is needed, that Senator Richardson and his Department, which he was supposed to administer, was not monitoring the agreement that Senator Richardson signed. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told by the Minister that officers of the Department regularly telephoned the manager of the mill; that the mill was visited by representatives on several occasions; and that the Department's financial advisers on this issue, Price Waterhouse, also monitored the operation of the mill. They probably did but Senator Richardson took no notice of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, cannot be blamed for the Ravenshoe fiasco, but Senator Richardson has to take full responsibility for the huge amounts of money that were misdirected in breach of the agreement and for the missing machinery that was sold out the back door. I visited the mill on about 13 occasions. The plywood mill that disappeared took up about half of an 8,000 square foot shed. It would have been impossible to miss it, had there been a proper inspection by Commonwealth officers to monitor the Government grants. It was not something one could put in one's lunch box and walk out the door with. </PARA>
<PARA> On 16 October, in answer to questions from Senator O'Chee, Senator Macdonald and me, Senator Richardson provided a very long answer to the overall position in Ravenshoe. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The assistance package was to benefit not only the sawmill but the Ravenshoe community and all North Queenslanders. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson also made the statement that no-one would be worse off under World Heritage listing. That was a brave statement, but the truth is that very little of the money stayed in Ravenshoe. If the agreement had been supervised properly by Senator Richardson and the money had gone to retool the Ravenshoe mill and had not been paid to the wrong company thousands of miles away, the devastation that has been caused in Ravenshoe would never have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in Ravenshoe is desperate. The mill is bankrupt and is being sold off. It may even be sold off in pieces. The town is bankrupt because many of the tradespeople believed that the money allocated by the Government would actually be spent on retooling. All the timber workers who had jobs in the mill or in the field either are on the dole or have been forced to move away from Ravenshoe and to seek work elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> This once proud little town has become a social security town, a dole town-and that need never had happened if Senator Richardson had administered his Department instead of running around here, counting numbers and doing other things to protect his back in the Party. Senator Richardson cannot do a Pontius Pilate and wash his hands of the whole issue. It just will not wear any more. He had the responsibility of providing the people of the north Queensland timber industry with a job. It was his Government's decision to list the wet tropics in the World Heritage listing. I disagreed with that at the time, but I did not have the numbers. But that is not the issue that we are debating at the moment. The matter is clearly where the $7.6m of grants and subsidies, of taxpayers' funds, was put and why they were not put to their proper use. Senator Richardson's 16 October statement says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the core debt to unsecured creditors . . . is in fact somewhere between $122,000 to $150,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator O'Chee tabled in the Senate an inter-office memo from a senior officer in Ravenshoe desperately calling for the head office to make available funds of $192,000 to local contractors just for the April purchases. This document demonstrates that, as far back as 7 June 1989, the company was in financial difficulty. Signals were going out all over north Queensland about the company not paying its debts and its credit being stopped by the business community. It appears that everyone in north Queensland knew it, except the Minister and his Department in Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did the Department not tell the Minister? It was up in Cairns. He had a branch of the Department up there to administer the World Heritage area. There were a number of people up there. He has told us that they visited the mill three times. What were they doing? Senator Richardson, in answer to a question by me on 15 October 1990, said that the conditions placed by the Commonwealth on the company had been met up until the company had gone into receivership. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell Senator Richardson that that is wrong. The conditions of the contract were never met. Money was not going to the mill at Ravenshoe. Machinery and stock were being flogged out the back door. Senator Richardson and his Department must have been the only people involved in Ravenshoe, or even in north Queensland, who believed that everything was above board. </PARA>
<PARA> As early as 17 May, and again on 18 May, I warned Senator Richardson and Senator Collins that there could have been misappropriation of at least $4.6m. Senator Richardson went into his normal huffing and puffing and bullying tactics that we are so used to in the Senate. He said, `On what basis do you make that statement? Back it up. Do not just criticise people. Back it up. Give me one shred of evidence. Come on, one. You don't have to give me two'. I am giving him $7.6m worth today. In the same Estimates Committee Senator Macdonald suggested that the funding for the Ravenshoe mill was not terribly well supervised. That was an understatement. Senator Richardson's reply was:</PARA>
<PARA>Every time either you or Senator Boswell suggests that I am going to reject it. </PARA>
<PARA>He did reject it. In the Estimates Committee on 18 September Senator Richardson stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there are a whole lot of questions we can get answered, a whole lot of questions, that you asked earlier on-we can have answered when we get the receivers report. Not only can we answer them, Senator Boswell, we should. </PARA>
<PARA>To this date none of these questions have ever been answered. We were told later that the receiver's reports had reached Mrs Kelly on 19 September and 25 September 1990. Despite this, on 11 October-nearly one month later-Senator Richardson said that he was unaware of the receiver's reports. It was only after I questioned Senator Richardson on 15 October 1990, and after Senator O'Chee tabled annual reports for Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd showing misappropriation had taken place, that Senator Richardson finally admitted that Commonwealth assistance had not yet been satisfactorily accounted for and that the matter had been referred to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) for investigation. That was an admission on the Minister's part that the assistance agreement for which he was responsible was not honoured and that the conditions may not have been met. Five minutes earlier he had told the Senate that the conditions placed upon the Commonwealth had been met. After he heard that statement, he did a turn around. This is another indication that the Minister did not have a clue about what was happening in his Department. He was not running it: it was running him. No-one was running anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now seven months later and the Senate still does not have answers, despite continued demands from Senator O'Chee, Senator Macdonald and myself. Every question is dead-batted away. The Minister says that he cannot table the receiver's documents or any other documents because charges may be laid. I suggest that is a cop-out. The Government must explain where the $7.6m went and why it did not reach its destination to help the disadvantaged people of Ravenshoe to help sustain the town's economy. If the Minister cannot explain, he must either table the documents or tell us that there are going to be charges laid and when they are going to be laid. This is a massive scandal and that is why the censure motion has been brought forward today. It has not been done lightly. It is the highest reprimand that a member of parliament can receive. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of this, we are told that the last payment of $968,841 was paid to the wrong company six months earlier than the agreement stated and that the payment was not based on properly validated financial statements. By the recklessness and negligent actions of the Minister in disregarding the use of public moneys appropriated in support of the Ravenshoe sawmill, the people of Ravenshoe now find themselves without a sawmill, without jobs and without payments for their services. Despite the promises of the Government that World Heritage listing would cost the people of north Queensland nothing, it has cost the people of Ravenshoe everything. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Normally with censure motions a government spokesman precedes the one at whom the censure motion is aimed so that that person has the opportunity of hearing two or three speakers before he or she responds, rather than not being able to reply to other speakers. Senator Boswell said that this motion was the highest possible reprimand available to this chamber. I think that historically that was right, but there is no doubt that the offhand use of censure motions and the way they have been put together without any relationship to ministerial responsibility has made them a very devalued commodity in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is a matter for regret, because when this Senate carries a censure motion for either trivial or serious reasons, we cannot sort out which is which in terms of its having any effect at all. As a couple of trivial censure motions have been carried over the past few years, it means that Ministers do not take them as seriously as they should. So when the Senate carries a motion in a chamber in which the Government does not have a majority, the reaction tends to be, `So what?'. I still take it seriously. </PARA>

<PARA> But the difficulty with this issue, if I may say so to honourable senators here as I look around the chamber, is that probably only the aficionados who have followed this matter from the start to the finish will master the detail of this debate today-and I am not one of them. I doubt that more than five or six people in this room have followed the debate in detail as this company went broke or this company did this and so on. I am not saying, by the way, that Senator Boswell, Senator O'Chee and Senator Macdonald have not followed the debate, because I have heard them ask questions and I take them at their word that they have followed it through. But it is a very difficult debate to come to grips with in terms of the sequence of events. So when they come into this chamber most people will vote along tribal lines without having listened to the debate. Again, regrettably-through no fault of Senator Boswell-it devalues any censure motion when the majority of voters in this chamber will not follow it in any detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go to the question of ministerial responsibility-which is the main reason why I am on my feet-I do take up Senator Boswell on the point when he said, `Well, if Senator Richardson wasn't running around counting the numbers he would have supervised this particular matter'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the things I was taught when I was a child was not to interrupt everyone every five seconds. I was trying to make a serious point. Once we establish whether in fact the actions were correct or incorrect, we then move to the next stage: should the Minister take responsibility for that and is he responsible for those correct or incorrect actions? A fair bit has been written about this and I will not bore the Senate for too long. Fairly early on in an article by Geoffrey Marshall in 1986 about ministerial responsibility and individual responsibility, it is said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> `The concept that because somebody whom the minister has never heard of has made a mistake means that the minister should resign-</PARA>
<PARA>I think we can substitute `be censured' for that because it is the same principle-</PARA>
<PARA>is out of date and rightly so.'</PARA>
<PARA>More specifically, I will read from page 64 which says:</PARA>
<PARA>The other category is that in which the chain of command or accountability is extended either geographically or administratively, and mistakes have been made by someone of whom the Minister either has not heard or over whom he could not be expected to exert control or surveillance.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to another paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>From these cases of non-resignation the current rules of individual ministerial responsibility can be summarised. Sir Thomas Dugdale's resignation over the mishandling of his Department's policy towards the disposal of land revealed in the 1954 Crichel Down case, though it was accompanied by subordinate errors, was an assumption of personal responsibility by the Minister who had himself been involved in the particular misjudgment and who was held by his colleagues to have failed to organize his Department efficiently. He was not, as many alleged at the time, a Minister sacrificed in accordance with the hard doctrine that a ministerial head must roll for civil service error. No post-war case has involved such an assumption and it can be said with confidence that the convention of ministerial responsibility contains no requirement of any such vicarious accountability.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>But the conclusions of Sir David Maxwell Fyfe in the Crichel Down debate in 1954 and the similar conclusions of the then Opposition spokesman Mr Herbert Morrison may still be taken to state the present position. When action is taken of which a Minister disapproves and of which he has no prior knowledge, there is no obligation on his part to endorse it, to defend the errors of his officers, or to resign. </PARA>
<PARA>In summary, what we are saying about ministerial responsibility is that the second leg has to be established. It has to be established, firstly, that the actions of the Department in the circumstances were wrong-and then debate that out-and, secondly, whether it was the Minister's duty to have been directly supervising that action. What were the stages involved? Was it a case of the Minister approving overall policy requirements and global money and the Department then following that through case by case and step by step? If that is the case, no Minister is responsible to that level. </PARA>
<PARA> In his 1988 Garran Oration, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) put several points. These are not thoughts made up afterwards; they are thoughts laid down to guide Senator Richardson, myself and other Ministers throughout Australia:</PARA>
<PARA>The true measure of ministerial accountability, here and in Britain, has never been the tally of ministerial resignations.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we can again fairly substitute `censures by the chambers'. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Even in the slower and simpler formative period of our system of Government, the strict theory that Ministers were fully accountable for every act or omission of their departmental officers was, simply, far-fetched. In today's environment the traditional hypothesis just cannot be reconciled with political and administrative realities. The relationship between ministers and officials is far more complex than the hypothesis, with its all-too-neat dichotomy between policy and administration, permits. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, ministers must, of course, continue to be answerable to the Parliament and to take any necessary corrective action. But the truth is that there is no requirement for them to resign-</PARA>
<PARA>for example, or be censored-</PARA>
<PARA>except where a significant act or omission was theirs, or taken at their personal direction, or was a matter about which they obviously should have known, and done something. </PARA>
<PARA>When we listen to what Senator Boswell has said today, we find that the only leg he has to stand on is that last point I made:</PARA>
<PARA>or was a matter about which they obviously should have known, and done something.</PARA>
<PARA>When this Senate debates the censure motion, it has to establish whether Senator Richardson knew of that detailed administrative task. Senator Boswell nods his head and says yes. Why does not Senator Boswell come over to my office one day and, on the basis of confidentiality, sit with me for a day and administer a budget of $9 billion with 69,000 full time servicemen, 24,000 civilians, representatives right throughout the world, and two massive industries like Australian Defence Industries Ltd and Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd, with the complexity of all that decision making throughout the breadth of Australia and tell me that I am supposed to know of every administrative detail and be responsible--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Richardson" NAMEID="4E4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For every error or payment that my Department makes. That is a good theory, but no-one realistically expects that that situation still exists. A Minister is expected to correct mistakes when they are discovered-if there are mistakes, and I do not see any in this case-and to establish a sort of administrative authority so that every section of his Department knows that he will be tough on things such as fraud, inefficiency and misadvice-all of which Ministers get lumbered with at some stage-and will eradicate them. That is the essentiality of this debate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two issues have to be established: were the actions right or wrong and is the Minister properly responsible for those actions? If Opposition senators are not convinced on the second issue, they should not devalue the censure motion by nodding it through on some tribal reaction. To do so would devalue censure motions. The question of ministerial responsibility will hinge on the detail of the debate. Should Minister Richardson at the time have been signing cheques or supervising that level, or was the decision making such that the broad guidelines had been given and public servants were supposed to carry out the details properly? That is what has to be established. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that I do not know all the details of this case, but I do know the philosophy behind the censure motion and ministerial responsibility. Those issues have to be seriously addressed, and not just in a partisan way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the censure motion and, I must say at the outset, with some regret because in many respects we have found Senator Richardson a very good Minister in the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories portfolio. In this instance, and with respect to these activities, we find the evidence is that, firstly, mistakes were made and, secondly, that he should have been aware of them and acted differently. In our view, both the criteria just outlined by Senator Robert Ray have indeed been established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are approaching this matter from a somewhat different position. I take it up, first of all, by pointing out that there have been two Opposition motions in recent days for the suspension of Standing Orders, neither of which we supported. I point out that the difference between the former two matters and this one lies in the belief of the Democrats that, on the two previous occasions, a debate would have occupied a great deal of time and would not have resulted in any significant change. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case, as I hope to establish through the course of the debate on this censure motion, we would like to draw attention to the very serious longer term consequences of the defects which have been exposed here, and have them corrected. Although this Minister is not the present Minister, we are moving forward into other situations which bear very considerable similarities to the declaration of the wet tropics and the undertaking to support the Ravenshoe mill. </PARA>
<PARA> I will pick up another remark of Senator Robert Ray when he accused Senator Boswell of perhaps having a hidden agenda and being opposed to the declaration of the wet tropics area. That may or may not be true in the case of Senator Boswell, but I do not think that the same claim could be made against the Democrats. We strongly supported the declaration of that wet tropics area for World Heritage purposes. That is the very point on which I rest the whole case that I want to make. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout a number of years there had been a very active campaign by a number of conservation bodies to ensure that the remaining and rapidly decreasing area of tropical rainforest was protected and was protected from further logging. Eventually, the Government agreed to that call by the conservation movement. That was something that we very strongly applauded at the time. We felt that the Government was perhaps tardy over those moves but, nonetheless, when it did move, we strongly supported its action. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall seeing some television footage of Senator Richardson, who was the relevant Minister at the time, going up to Ravenshoe and being quite vigorously jostled by angry workers concerned about the problem of jobs-well they might be. That is the very point on which our support for this censure motion rests. The whole basis of the contractual arrangements which were entered into to support the Ravenshoe mill was precisely to address and defuse that problem; to supply economic support for the people of Ravenshoe so that the mill could continue to employ people and the objections to the declaration of the wet tropics area as a World Heritage area would be defused. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the relevance which it bears right to this day, when the Queensland Government is now looking to establish a hydro-electric scheme in the same area-which includes part of the World Heritage area-by damming the Tully and Millstream rivers. This would damage the World Heritage area and, in the process, provide a few jobs. I can well understand that, with the experience of the failure of the undertakings which were given in relation to the mill and the experience of the proven unreliability of the Government in addressing the problem of jobs in relation to environmental protection, the actions of the former Minister for the environment have made it more difficult for the objection to the construction of the Tully-Millstream hydro-electric scheme to be seriously considered and given effect, and that is therefore less likely. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the economic background to this situation, we find that there was a mill in Ravenshoe at the time. When one looks at the balance sheet for 30 June 1988-and this was the mill which the Minister was looking at-under the heading `Profit and loss account for the year ended 30th June 1988' we find that:</PARA>
<PARA>The company did not trade during the period. There were no items of income or expense, or transfers to or from reserves and provisions required to be disclosed in accordance with the Seventh Schedule of the Companies Regulations, as in force on 30th September, 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government knew at the time that it was dealing with a mill which potentially could have provided employment, which could have addressed those very real and serious concerns by workers in the Ravenshoe area over the declaration of the World Heritage area, and which required a considerable amount of support to ensure that it became viable and would provide the necessary employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government proceeded to enter into an undertaking with the company Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd. In the agreement drawn up between the Government and Plywood and Plastic, again dated June 1988-at the same time as the relevant balance sheet which I have just mentioned-the Government undertook to provide:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) an interest free loan of $4.5 million on or before 30 June 1988; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) a subsidy for each of the years 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992, payable by advance on the first day of July of each such year, of an amount which bears the same proportion to $2,125,000 as the number of days on which the mill is operating, or would but for the effects of a cyclone be operating, in the relevant year bears to the total number of the working days in the relevant year. </PARA>
<PARA>The agreement goes on to state that the working days shall not exceed 120 days. What all that means is that in the event that the mill worked 120 days-and note the past tense-the company would be paid $2,125,000. If it worked less than that, for reasons other than cyclones or various other conditions mentioned elsewhere, the company would get a proportion of that amount which related to the number of days worked. Clearly, the year had to be completed and the number of days known so that the subsidy, either the whole or part of that $2,125,000, could be calculated. The agreement which the company entered into set out a number of conditions:</PARA>
<PARA>The company shall until at least 30 June 1988 use the amount of the loan and the amounts of the subsidy to . . . </PARA>
<PARA>do various things. As we heard from Senator Boswell, there is considerable evidence now that the company misapplied the grants which were made to it and did not carry out its undertakings. The undertakings were, among other things, to:</PARA>
<PARA>(b) maintain a work force of at least 40 persons-</PARA>
<PARA>we know that did not happen-and:</PARA>
<PARA>(c) carry out its operations at the mill in accordance with good mill practice-</PARA>
<PARA>we know that did not happen-and:</PARA>
<PARA>(d) carry out its timber extraction operations so as to minimise environmental impacts. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems that the company did not do a great deal of work and so it probably would not have had a very great environmental impact one way or the other. The next one is a rather amusing one which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>(e) make good operating losses; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I guess that the emphasis should be on the words `make good'. If one places the emphasis in the first sense, it certainly made good operating losses; there is no doubt about that at all. The agreement goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>(f) equip the mill to enable it to operate with respect to timber, other than timber obtained from within the region; and</PARA>
<PARA>(g) pay any stamp duty . . . </PARA>
<PARA>et cetera. Those were the conditions in the agreement, as far as I can see, which the Government entered into with the company. It was precisely the sort of agreement which, looking at it at the time, I am sure the Democrats would have had no complaint about and therefore would have strongly supported. The whole point I want to keep stressing is that, because of the sensitivity of the issue of declaration of this area as a world heritage area, this was an agreement which should have been incredibly closely supervised. The failure to supervise this particular agreement jeopardises every other like agreement with respect to protecting the environment and any measures which the Government may make to offset any concerns which those people directly affected by the decision are likely to express. </PARA>
<PARA> We move on then to the director's report, which was dated 1 September 1989. This report deals, of course, with a year later than the report I mentioned a moment ago, the annual report to the end of June 1988. In this report, Plywood and Plastic reports:</PARA>
<PARA>The year under review is one of rapid growth and significant development for the joint venture. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The signing of a long-term timber supply agreement with the New South Wales Forestry Commission led to the approval for capital expenditure of $5 million for the establishment of a veneer mill at Kyogle.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the first mention that this company was interested in a mill elsewhere in northern New South Wales. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This mill-</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the Kyogle mill-</PARA>
<PARA>will be amongst the most modern in the world and certainly more advanced than any in Australia. The projected commissioning date is July, 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>That should have alerted anybody who was looking at that report that something was a little amiss, with the company Plywood and Plastic referring to building a mill elsewhere and drawing timber supplies from elsewhere and mentioning a commissioning date which is so near into the future. It talks about excellent growth having been experienced in the divisions and so on. Then, incredibly facetiously in retrospect, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>None of this could have been achieved without the loyalty and commitment of our employees. Our people are our strength and our most important resource. The Directors gratefully acknowledge the contribution made by all employees. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a particularly cynical statement coming at that time, as we know what was already developing in relation to the employment of people in that mill and the way in which these directors were evidently misappropriating the grants from government to the Kyogle mill to which they have actually referred in that report. </PARA>
<PARA> We then move on to a report from the Managing Director, Mr Fergus Macdonald, to the Assistant Secretary of the National Heritage Branch of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and to a letter dated 13 December 1989, just before the date on which the cheque to which Senator Boswell has referred was paid. That was paid in January 1990. This report from the Managing Director refers to a number of actions which were going on in the mill at the time. It refers to retooling, audit accounts and capital expenditure overruns. That is where we pick up slightly over $1m of capital expenditure overrun and a request for early payment. </PARA>
<PARA> We then find that an amount equivalent to half of the $2.125m per year, less interest which would be payable on that amount, was paid six months early and was paid not to the company to which it should have been paid but rather to another company, and that money was simply lost. That is the story. We then find that the company was in receivership. As Senator Boswell has pointed out, there was little left for the workers, for the people of Ravenshoe, in terms of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the matter that I really do wish to stress. We supported very strongly the declaration of this World Heritage area. We recognise that when decisions such as this are made, some of them are very sensitive in terms of their impact on the local people. It is absolutely appropriate that under those circumstances the Government should not be expecting the local people to pick up the tab for the welfare of all the people of Australia; indeed, in this case for the people of the whole world because it is a World Heritage area. Everybody should contribute to the welfare of those who are directly and adversely affected by the decision to declare the area a World Heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was correct in its decision. It contracted a very reasonable arrangement with the mill; but from that point onwards the Minister failed to properly supervise that agreement, knowing how sensitive it was and how there would surely be similar situations-we are faced with one right now in relation to the Tully-Millstream decision-in which the failure of this undertaking would jeopardise later undertakings with respect to the protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason we believe that the second leg of Minister Ray's assertion has been established-that the Minister must accept responsibility. This was not an ordinary contractual arrangement. The responsibility goes far beyond the actual amount of money; it goes to the whole question of the proper supervision of environmentally sensitive decisions by this Government, both now and in the future. We believe that the Minister has not handled the situation competently. The Minister has handled it quite inadequately. For that reason, unfortunately, because in other respects the Minister was a good Minister, on this occasion we believe we have no choice but to support, and support quite strongly, this censure motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 October 1990, Senator Richardson told the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The main point made in the answer is that what has happened with those creditors is not as a result of World Heritage listing, but of what has occurred at the mill since. There is a big difference. </PARA>
<PARA>How true that statement was, and how relevant it was, in fact, to the points made earlier by Senator Ray on the Government side in seeking to defend Senator Richardson's negligence and failure to properly supervise the operations of his then Department-the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories-and his failure to ensure that the Commonwealth assistance agreement intended for the sawmill and the people of Ravenshoe was applied to that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray attempted to state that Senate Boswell had misrepresented his position on this whole matter. Nothing could be further from the truth. But this is not about whether one supports World Heritage listing or otherwise; this is about ministerial conduct and ministerial responsibility. Therefore, I feel it is important that I address the matters raised by Senator Ray in defence of Senator Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray quoted an article by Dr Geoffrey Marshall in 1986 which said that it was absurd for someone, whom the Minister has never heard of but who has made a mistake, to see the Minister censured. Indeed, I would agree with that statement. Unfortunately, from the evidence that Senator Richardson was forced to provide to the Committee of the Whole on 30 May this year, the man responsible, in fact, sat next to Senator Richardson during the Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the Westminster principle of ministerial responsibility, we see there is a grave difference between the practice of this Parliament and the practice of Westminster. In this Parliament, we have a process of Estimates committees. At that time, Senator Richardson was not only the Minister who attended the Estimates committees but also he was the Minister responsible for the portfolio. There is no doubt that on any reasonable test Senator Richardson should not only have known about what went on with regard to these payments but also, as the responsible Minister, he had to know. </PARA>
<PARA> It is Senator Richardson's irresponsibility, Senator Richardson's failure to properly manage his Department, which causes this censure motion to be brought before us today. As Senator Ray has said, `Censure motions have often been debased, more so at the other end of the building than here'. This is not a debased censure motion; this is a motion that goes right to the heart of Senator Richardson's conduct as a Minister. This is why Senator Richardson deserves to be censured. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two legs of responsibility that Senator Ray said had to be established: the first was that something had to have been done wrongly-we will get on to that later-and the second leg, he said, was that the Minister had to be directly responsible. We have already seen that in all probability the officer who approved this payment outside the terms of the Commonwealth's agreement sat in Estimates with Senator Richardson. But even if that is not the case, as Senator Coulter has so ably pointed out, this was a very special agreement. This was not just an ordinary departmental act. Senator Richardson, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia, signed an assistance agreement with Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd, the company which operated the Ravenshoe mill. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson made the people of Ravenshoe a very particular promise; it was that no-one would be disadvantaged by a World Heritage listing of the area. For that reason, Senator Richardson as Minister also carried with him a very particular responsibility, one that arose from his promise and from the agreement which he as a Minister signed and which he as a Minister failed to oversee. </PARA>
<PARA> On 30 May this year, what we heard from Senator Richardson was that an agreement that he had signed as Minister had been varied by a departmental officer, he told us, without any advice to him. Of course, the problem with this is very simple, that the company that received the payment was not the company which was entitled to receive the money under the terms of the Commonwealth's agreement. So, in effect, the Commonwealth has failed to keep its obligations under the agreement, by paying the money to the wrong company. Of course, this is an area of grave responsibility. It is absurd for Senator Richardson to come before this place and say that he can delegate-or rather, that he can allow a departmental officer to vary the terms of an agreement that he has made on behalf of the Commonwealth. That is extraordinary, to say the least, but that is what Senator Richardson is trying to tell this Senate he has allowed. By allowing that to occur, by failing to exercise a proper managerial role in respect of his Department, Senator Richardson makes himself culpable and makes himself subject to the censure that is being moved here today. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the first area of concern that we have. The money did not go to Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd, the company with whom the Commonwealth made the deal, but instead it went to National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd, a company in Kyogle. As a result, this payment may well have been unlawful. It was advanced, by both myself and Senator Spindler on 30 May, that the officer who approved the payment had no authority to approve it. A contract signed by a Minister clearly needs a Minister's signature if the terms of that contract are to be varied. Moreover, it is very doubtful that this payment could have been lawful. There is no way in which this payment could have been authorised by the agreement if in fact it was not paid to the company with which the Commonwealth had the agreement. It is just preposterous for Senator Richardson to try to maintain anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> Further along in this four-year saga involving Senator Richardson, his Department and their incompetence, we see the failure to adequately supervise what was happening at the mill, manifested in particular by a failure to obtain proper financial accounts for the company at the time at which the payment was made. This is very interesting. Here are the documents that Senator Richardson tabled in the Senate on 30 May. The letter that was written to his Department said, at point 9:</PARA>
<PARA> Audited accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> These will be completed on Friday, 15 December 1989 and forwarded to you forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA>This is what the Department was told on 13 December 1989. Furthermore, the Minister's Department had correspondence with Price Waterhouse. What did Price Waterhouse tell the Government? What did it say was a reasonable thing for the Minister and his Department to do? Price Waterhouse said, at point 3 of its letter of 21 December 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>Also you should obtain from the company a deed of release stating that the net amount received is for full discharge of the amount contractually agreed upon, i.e. $1,062,500. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say, at point 4:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we believe the company should supply their most recent management accounts and projections to support their cash flow need before any payment is made. </PARA>
<PARA>This is, of course, 21 December. A further letter was written on 28 December and, as a result of that, the Government or the Department approved-or somebody approved-late in December 1989 the payment of those moneys. But at no time has the Minister been able to show the Senate that either he or his departmental officers even sighted the appropriate financial accounts to which Price Waterhouse had referred. At no time has he been able to show that either he or his Department exercised the usual degree of prudence and caution which a normal commercial party would exercise. In other words, there was a manifest failure to supervise what was going on at Ravenshoe mill. There was a total neglect of the recommendations received by the Commonwealth's financial advisers in respect of this payment, and that neglect falls fairly and squarely at the doorstep of the Minister who was responsible. Senator Richardson told the Senate, in one of his frequent discourses, in October 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>I accept that as a matter of course in this business one has to cop flak. </PARA>
<PARA>We have been very, very careful in the case that we have brought forward. We have waited some seven months. We have amassed the evidence. We have looked in detail and with care and consideration to the matters of which Senator Richardson should have been apprised. We have moved this censure motion only as a matter of last resort, because we feel without a doubt that Senator Richardson really does deserve to cop the flak. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a third area in which Senator Richardson has been negligent, in which Senator Richardson has failed in his responsibility as a Minister, namely, that the payment was allowed to be paid before the due date and at variance with the terms of the agreement. In doing so, no legal advice was obtained at the time and the deed of release, to which I have previously referred, was not obtained from the company, even though this was recommended by Price Waterhouse. The essential thing to note here is that the payment due on 1 July 1990 was a payment in advance for the 1990-91 financial year. So, not only was the payment made in the wrong financial year-and there is an argument that it may have been made without an appropriation, but I do not wish to canvass that issue here-but, importantly, it was clearly not in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In making the payment early, neither Senator Richardson nor his Department bothered to demean themselves so much as to obtain legal advice. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the reason that Senator Richardson gave to the Senate on 30 May was, roughly, that the Department thought that the payment was within the ambit of the agreement and therefore it did not need to obtain legal advice. Therefore, Senator Richardson and his departmental officers get very close to putting themselves above the constraints of the law, above the constraints that reasonably prudent people would follow and above the normal course of care and consideration that we would expect of a Minister. This attitude was allowed to flourish in the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories under Senator Richardson's management. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we come to what would be, if it were not so tragic, the hilarious case of $837,000 worth of machinery being sold from the mill. It appears that neither Senator Richardson nor his Department knew about this until Senator Boswell raised the matter in October 1990. As Senator Boswell said, it is not as though $837,000 of machinery is something that one can pack up in one's lunch bag. It involved a veneer mill and a boiler. One of those items of plant and equipment was half the size of an 8,000-square foot shed. Yet, Senator Richardson and his Department did not seem to know about it, which is really quite extraordinary, because Senator Richardson told the Senate on 16 October-and I love this quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Like any good business manager the Commonwealth did not let its loan go unwatched. Officers of the Department regularly telephoned the manager of the mill to seek information on progress with the retooling.</PARA>
<PARA>Maybe if they had shown a little more care and consideration they might have known that all the machinery was going out the back door but, of course, they did not. As Senator Boswell has said, Senator Richardson failed to adequately supervise it, his Department failed to adequately supervise it and in so doing, they became culpable for the failure of the Ravenshoe mill. </PARA>
<PARA> Now there is the matter of the payment of the cheque to the wrong company. We have already canvassed this issue before, but there is a special significance to this. I want to quote again from an answer that Senator Richardson gave to the Senate on 16 October 1990-we are not damning him by our words, we are damning his by his own words. His statement, which is a great one, was:</PARA>
<PARA>The assistance package was to benefit not only the sawmill but the Ravenshoe community and all North Queenslanders. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the company to which this $968,000 cheque was paid-it is almost a million dollars-was not Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd, the operator of the Ravenshoe mill, but Timbertech which, as Senator Boswell has proved, is the trade name of a company called National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd. What does National Associated Plywood do? Does it run a mill at Ravenshoe? No. Does it have an interest in north Queensland? No. What does National Associated Plywood do? It runs a veneer mill in Kyogle. </PARA>
<PARA> By allowing this money to be paid to the wrong company, Senator Richardson has deprived the people of Ravenshoe and all north Queenslanders of their due. The claim that was made to the Department was on the basis that the mill at Ravenshoe needed the money for cash flow difficulties-and goodness gracious, did it need the money for cash flow difficulties! I have already shown the Senate that as early as 7 June 1989 this company had grave difficulty in paying its unsecured creditors. We saw $230,000 of overdue payments to creditors stacked up at that mill. We saw people cutting off credit to the mill. We saw one poor electrician, who was owed $16,000 in June 1989 ultimately being owed $60,000 when the mill finally collapsed in April 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> If this payment had gone to the right company, the people who were owed money by the company-that is, the people of Ravenshoe and all north Queenslanders, to whom Senator Richardson referred-would have been paid. But the Department paid the money to the wrong company and those people were not paid. This is the extent of the negligence and the irresponsibility that has flourished under Senator Richardson and in his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The money that was intended for these people, as Senator Coulter has said, to give them confidence in what the Commonwealth was doing with regard to the World Heritage listing, never made it to the right place because the Government sent it somewhere else. That is the core of what Senator Richardson has done. It is not just an academic exercise. We are talking about real people and real lives- the lives of a town of 2,200 people in an area which has been devastated and shell shocked by this Government's incompetence, and its failure to honour its promise that nobody in Ravenshoe would be worse off as a result of World Heritage listing. Senator Richardson quite correctly said that it had everything to do with what went on with the mill and nothing at all to do with World Heritage listing. What he did not say on 16 October was that it also had a lot to do with what was going on in his office. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen, basically, is Senator Richardson making a grandiose promise, signing an agreement, taking upon himself a special responsibility towards the people of Ravenshoe and then being especially negligent in the discharge of his responsibility and allowing his Department to do things that it should never have been allowed to do. In short, Senator Richardson presided over a rotten house where sloth and indifference were allowed to substitute for caution, thoroughness and responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> It is Senator Richardson's culpability, Senator Richardson's key role in allowing all of these things to happen, that bring him before the Senate today and cause this censure motion. Senator Richardson has brought it upon himself. From the very start, from the shoddy assistance agreement that Senator Richardson signed, through his failure to adequately monitor what was going on, right up to the payment of $968,000-the almost a million dollars from the million dollar man to the wrong company-is all Senator Richardson's doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson fumbled around time and time again trying to explain what happened. One of the best explanations that I like was given on 29 May-less than a month ago. Senator Richardson first told the Senate that he approved the payment. Then, after Question Time, he told the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories confirmed in my office during Question Time that I was not informed of that payment to the company or that the payment was being made at all before it was made. </PARA>
<PARA>At one point in the day he said, `Yes, I authorised the payment'. Then he said, `Not only did I not authorise the payment, I didn't even know it happened', and he was the Minister. That is the sort of thing that has gone on. The only problem is that it is lives-good, hard working Australian citizens-that have been affected by what Senator Richardson and his Department have failed to do. </PARA>
<PARA> For these manifold reasons and these manifold condemnations of Senator Richardson, this censure motion has been brought before the chamber today. We have done it reluctantly. We waited for seven months, hoping that Senator Richardson might find an explanation for the files in my office-papers over a foot thick of answers, correspondence and documents that we have tabled here, every single one of them forcing Senator Richardson to make yet another admission to the Senate. The admission that he must now make is that his negligence and incompetence caused the suffering at Ravenshoe. That is why this censure motion is being moved against him today. That is why I urge all honourable senators to support this motion and show Senator Richardson that he must exercise proper responsibility as a Minister when he makes promises to people, and that when he signs agreements he has to ensure that they are kept. Senator Richardson did not do so and that is why we seek to censure Senator Richardson today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is actually the second time that I will have been censured-on the assumption that the Australian Democrats support the motion. The first time that I was censured was fairly interesting. I was in this chamber representing the then Minister for Defence. The then Minister for Defence had allowed a number of questions to go past the requisite period of time without being answered, and these questions on the Notice Paper, which were not my responsibility, were the cause of my censure. So I learned fairly early on in my career as a Minister in the Senate that censure motions mean very little, because the idea of censuring me for the failure of another Minister in another place was ridiculous. But the Senate did so and I accepted it. I think I learned to live with it relatively quickly. We all got on with business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not spoken to the Australian Democrats about this. I understand that Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee have. I have not. I am told they are voting for the motion, and that is Senator Coulter's inclination. It is disappointing only in the sense that they have not heard a response and I will endeavour to give them one. I hope they at least keep their minds open enough to listen to it. </PARA>
<PARA> There would appear to be, about this exercise, a couple of points upon which Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee continually rely. The first, it would appear, is that the advance payment was made. Senator O'Chee was at least kind enough not to go on with the notion that, because there is not an appropriation in one financial year, the next payment could not be made, and I am glad he did not, because that it would have been a waste of everyone's time. He knows it and that is why he did not. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at whether the Commonwealth, be that a Minister or officers acting on behalf of the Minister and the Commonwealth, makes advance payments. Under what circumstances can or should they make such payments? As all honourable senators would be aware, I hope, the Commonwealth enters into many financial assistance agreements with private enterprises for all sorts of purposes. It has done so for decades. There is nothing new in this. There are many, many cases where a schedule of payments has been agreed to and, later, that schedule has been varied by either bringing forward or postponing a payment. There is nothing unusual in it. It happens all the time. The Office of Commercial Law in the Attorney-General's Department has confirmed that advice to the Department. It is a frequent occurrence. So officers dealing with these matters, knowing it to be a frequent occurrence, do not need to seek legal opinion on whether it is possible to do it; it is done all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The original agreement in this case is between the Commonwealth and the company. Each has acted through agents in the making of the agreement and each acts through agents in the carrying out of the agreement. I was the Commonwealth's agent in the making of it, obviously, as the person who signed the agreement. Departmental officers were the Commonwealth's agents in agreeing with the company to make an advance payment of part of the money. There is nothing unusual about that situation-nothing. It happens not only in my then Department but also in a whole number of departments right across the whole sphere of government. </PARA>
<PARA> In most cases departmental officers, with appropriate authority, might equally have made an original agreement of the kind that I made. In this case I happened to have made it, but that was because there were no officers in the Department at the time with sufficient delegations to sign an agreement of that kind for the amount of money included in the agreement. So the idea that there is anything unusual in this situation is simply wrong. At the time of the advance payment for assistance in January 1990 there were officers with the right kind of appropriate delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point to make about the administration of these agreements is that, subject to such issues as formal delegated authority, judgments on whether Ministers or their departmental officers act for the Commonwealth in making agreements are policy issues for responsible Ministers. Responsible Ministers take the view that those officers within a department who are dealing with a matter with the right kind of delegation can go forward and do it. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who wants to examine the question of the advance payments made in government, to make sure that we understand that there is nothing unusual, should look at the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories portfolio where payments can be and have sometimes been made in advance, such as grants to voluntary conservation organisations; assistance to the Australian Conservation Foundation for ecologically sustainable development; payments to Greening Australia Pty Ltd, a company to conduct community tree planting programs; funding for the Australian Opera, another company; the Australian Ballet School; the National Institute of Dramatic Art; and funding to the Film Finance Corporation. All of these bodies regularly have advance payments made when a case is established. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes on even more in other portfolios. Programs administered by the Industry Research and Development Board, in Senator Button's portfolio, include grants for industrial research and development; the national procurement and development program; the national teaching company scheme; grants provided by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and payments for the States, Territories and local government for legal aid, hospital funding, health services and government schools. Agreements are made in a whole range of things between government and private companies or between government and other spheres and levels of government where, once a case is made out, the payment can be made in advance or postponed. That happens not only occasionally but regularly. </PARA>
<PARA> So the idea that Senator O'Chee in particular has attempted to push in the last few days that in some way a mistake has been made, that in some way it is unlawful-to use one of the words he used here the other day-that this payment was made in advance, is plain wrong. I know it suits the politics, it makes everyone in the Opposition happy and apparently it has succeeded today in titivating the odd Democrat. But it does not mean anything; that is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The mistake made here-and there is no denying that a mistake was made-is in what name was written on the cheque. It is appropriate for honourable senators to examine what my responsibility was or should have been in respect of the making out that cheque. As I told the Senate the other day, I was not informed at all of the payment-not at all-and I was not informed that that payment was being made in advance or the reasons for it. That is because the Department was administering the agreement and did not believe it was necessary to do so. Certainly there was no requirement on it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the making of the advance, it beggars the imagination that today I can be held responsible and held up to censure for my actions. The first point to make is that the officer who signed the authorisation that went over to the Department of Finance-an officer who is no longer with the Public Service-was someone I had never heard of and never met. The senior officer who authorised that officer was sitting in the chamber the other day and is here. Suppose it is accepted that I should have received a briefing on this from the Department, and I do not, but let us work on the basis that I should have; had I received a briefing and had I approved the payment, there was no way in the world I would have known that the cheque was made out to the wrong company. I could not because such a briefing would never be included for a Minister. It cannot be. I do not think people understand the system. I would, naturally enough, have approved a payment to the right company, as the Department did. But when it went to the person to actually fill out a form to go to the Department of Finance for a cheque to be made out, a more junior officer made an error. I could not possibly have been expected, even if I was being fully briefed at the time, to have ever seen that piece of paper. No Minister does. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that people are titivated by this and think that it is a decent headline and is a good way to give me a kicking. Fair enough. I will learn to live with it. I do not think the letter of resignation will go in this afternoon and we will all go on about our business. However, we ought to understand the principle we are trying to establish. The Opposition parties are trying to set a standard for me that no Minister can ever possibly meet, that Opposition senators would not meet if they were in government and that no-one here can meet now. But I go further. I say that even if I--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That will be in Hansard. It will be a bit hard to deny that one. It will be in Hansard. Senator Boswell will not be able to fix Hansard, either. That will be in it, so he will have to live with that one. I will have some fun with it later on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that Senator Boswell is setting a standard I cannot possibly meet, let us then go to the issue of what would have happened had I been briefed. Had the responsible senior officer in the Department administering the agreement come to my office and briefed me about this matter, had he actually sat there and said, `Here is the letter from the company which requests an advance payment for these reasons. Here is our view on that. Here is what Price Waterhouse has said on that.', I have no doubt at all that I would have said, `Okay, if that is the case, make the advance payment'. I would have done so because any perfunctory calculation of the cost of employing 50-odd employees in an enterprise-even if we average it out at $30,000-works out to a lot of money each month. Obviously, that would have been causing the company some troubles, and it had short term cash flow problems for the reasons that were outlined in the documents that I presented last week. </PARA>
<PARA> Given all that Senator O'Chee said about the reasons why this agreement was signed in the first place, I would have gone to every length possible to advance money to the company to keep it going, because the whole exercise was about keeping the mill open and functioning and maintaining the employment of people in Ravenshoe-not only the direct employment of those who were in the mill, but also, of course, the employment of others in the town who indirectly benefited from it, be they shopkeepers, tradesmen or anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the World Heritage decisions in north Queensland, of which I think I can be justifiably proud, there was obviously a huge problem in the town of Ravenshoe. I understood that. I went there twice. The first time there was a small demonstration as I was blockaded on a forest road. The second time, as everyone knows, there was a very big demonstration in which I received a bit of a buffeting. I did not act on this because of that incident, but it was obvious that the fear and the trepidation of people in Ravenshoe about the effects of World Heritage listing were real. Even if the fears were not based on reality, they were real fears. I believe that the Government had an obligation, in setting up an assistance package for all those in north Queensland affected by rainforest logging cessation, to look particularly at towns such as Ravenshoe. </PARA>
<PARA> So I took the decision that, if the mill could be retooled and could gain access to a secure pine resource, it could go on for decades-I suppose that one hesitates to say `forever', but hopefully it will be forever-and that, even if the employment in the mill was not as great as it was before, it would still be significant and substantial. So, naturally enough, I took the view that we ought to be advancing sufficient money to the company to bring that change about. That is what the Government set about doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The original intention, which was not mentioned in the debate here today, was to make a gift to the company, to simply give it the money and say, `Go for it. You buy the machines and see what you can do'. In fact, the only reason we got any sort of look in for any kind of monitoring, the only reason we got any opportunity to see what was going on over a period of time, was that the company did not want all of the money in gift form. The company, largely for taxation reasons, preferred to receive part of the money in the form of a loan. It is because of the loan that the Commonwealth got a look in at all. I would not claim for a second that the loan was my idea. That came straight from the company. When that occurred, it was up to us to come to a formal agreement. That took some time. I finally signed it. Then we were to make payments as a result of that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee have repeatedly asserted here that money was not spent for the right purpose, that money was diverted and that in some way that is our responsibility. It should be obvious enough to all Australians, and in particular all honourable senators, that one cannot guarantee the commercial honesty and probity of every person with whom one deals. If Senators O'Chee and Boswell are right about where the money might have gone, action must be taken on that score. </PARA>
<PARA> By the way, in accordance with the undertaking I gave the Senate last week, I have a meeting this evening with the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) on this question to try to sort out how far I can go in informing the Senate of the progress of Commonwealth action. I will attempt to report tomorrow if the Attorney-General tells me whether there is anything that I can usefully add in that way. I am at a disadvantage because I cannot comment on those matters, but it is pretty obvious to all concerned that it is not a matter of suggesting even for a second that, if the wrong thing was being done, it occurred suddenly, beginning with the payment of the cheque to Timbertech. If what the honourable senators are alleging is true, it had been going on for a long time before that. It did not suddenly start with the third cheque. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the third cheque is concerned, as honourable senators can see from the documents tabled last week, it was made out to the wrong name. It is not as though a cheque meant for the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd went to the Western Mining Corporation. It went to a business name within a complex web of companies, and it went for the purposes that were outlined in the letter. I believe, and certainly the legal section of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories is of this view, that the Commonwealth's position is not weakened because of it. </PARA>
<PARA> But I do not deny for a second that an error was made in the making out of the cheque. What I have tried to explain to the Senate, however, is that, even if I had been fully briefed on the reasons for an advance payment and had agreed to that payment, I still would not have seen the bit of paper that went across to the Department of Finance from a more junior officer whom I did not know and had not heard of, and I could not have been held responsible for it. The basis of the motion before us today is that I should have got a briefing on something about which I could not have had a briefing anyway, and that I should be censured for not getting it. Is it any wonder that the currency of censure motions is being devalued because of this?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell continually refers to audited statements. The audited statements to which he refers, unfortunately for him, relate to the financial year that ended on 30 June 1989. They were going to bear little relation to a short term cash flow problem that was occurring during the next financial year six months on. I am afraid that, had we received them, that could not have been used as the basis upon which a decision would have been made. Again, I think Senator Boswell would dip out if there were an assumption that I had a further responsibility on that matter. I could not have. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the explanation that I have given about the chain of events within the Department-that is, a senior officer giving an authorisation for a cheque to be drawn and then a junior officer, in making out the form to the Department of Finance, getting the name wrong-and given that I did not know the officer who made that error at the time and had not heard of her, to use phrases that have been quoted from articles today, I find it difficult to believe that I would be censured, but not too difficult, knowing the numbers and knowing that apparently the minds of the Australian Democrats were made up before they heard that. </PARA>
<PARA> But I would like to refer to an authority on the question-that is, Senator Durack, who, before I came here, had to face a motion on the bottom of the harbour schemes and other related schemes. He went through quite some difficulties because in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's office in Perth a number of opinions had been given on a bottom of the harbour tax matter of which he had not been made aware. I want to quote from what Senator Durack said, as recorded on page 632 of Hansard on 7 September 1982. I will not read the whole quote but, in referring to why he did not know about a number of opinions, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The reason is that the officers of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office, although within my Department, deal with a large number of cases. That is the business of the officers; they do not keep telling me what they are doing from day to day or from week to week. This is the most childish conception of ministerial responsibility. How on earth does anybody believe in this day and age, with departments as large as they are and with the enormous activities of government, that Ministers can know or ought to know of all the ramifications of the actions of their departments. I find it utterly incredible that anybody would have such a notion. Yet here we have people who masquerade as an alternative government believing that this is the way modern government operates. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, in the last words of his speech, talking about how a Minister is to be judged, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe as I said before, that the Minister should be judged on the response that is made when there is mismanagement or when bungling occurs in his department, and that he cannot be expected to know, in this day and age about all the matters taking place in his department. He is to be judged by the way in which he acts and the way that the Government acts when such a matter is brought to his attention and I believe the Government's record in response to this matter should find favour with the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I was on leave when the decision was made to make this payment. I was not even on duty: I was on holidays. Apparently, the point is lost on everyone-although I am surprised that it is lost on all the Democrats-that, even if I were supposed to have been briefed, I was on leave and could not have been. I was on holidays in Queensland. I was in Surfers Paradise with my family but, apparently, that is no excuse-I still should have been briefed. Apparently, officers should have jumped on a plane, stuck on a swimsuit and met me at Surfers. At that point, I would have been briefed and all would have been well. </PARA>
<PARA> Today there is before the Senate a motion censuring me, firstly, for a decision taken when I was on leave; secondly, for a cheque being made out in a wrong name that I could not possibly have been briefed on anyway, as it was a mistake that would have occurred after the briefing point; and, thirdly, for being responsible, apparently, for a fabled officer whom I have not met and have not heard of. I would suggest that paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) make this censure motion a joke. </PARA>
<PARA> I take my ministerial responsibilities seriously. I do not believe that when I am on holidays-and I do not get many of them-I ought to be held responsible for decisions that are made then. If the Opposition and the Democrats proceed with this motion and carry it, in the knowledge that I was on leave and could not have known anyway, even if I had been briefed, because the mistake occurred after the authorisation for the payment process-and I have gone through a list, which is only a part list, there being others, to explain to the Senate where advance payments are made and why officers do not need to seek legal opinions to make them-the process will become a joke. We ought not make censure motions a joke. I will be the first Minister ever censured for a decision taken while he was on leave. I will be breaking new ground. I will be No. 1. But, if the Opposition and the Democrats wish to proceed, so be it. I can assure the Senate that I can live with that. It does not worry me or phase me for a second. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, as Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, I carried out my responsibilities fully. When it comes to north Queensland and the saving of rainforests, which is the real reason I am being pursued today, as far as I am concerned I am proud of what I did and would do it all again tomorrow. I hope other Ministers who occupy that portfolio over the years get the opportunity to save areas in the way I did. I hope that, when they do, they do not take a holiday because, as soon as they do, they will come up against what is happening to me today. I am to be censured for going on holidays in January. For going away with my family and for not being there, the Senate, apparently, is going to carry a motion. I ask the Democrats to have a long think about that, as they should. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Senate-and it might be worth while for Senator Richardson to consider this-that the Senate is censuring him for failing to supervise the actions of his former department, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories in a number of ways. That is what the Senate is doing. It is not censuring him because he had a holiday in January, but because he failed to supervise the actions of his Department. He spent all of his time in the Ravenshoe area, and all of his time in the World Heritage listed areas, running around getting publicity for himself and his Government so that it would be re-elected by the greenies. That is what he was concerned about. He was not concerned about running his Department, looking after things as they should be looked after and doing the proper things that had to be done. He was simply concerned about gaining a bit of notoriety for himself and his Party so that it could get the votes of the conservation movement in the hope of forming another government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We did not want any particular exceptional standard from Senator Richardson-a standard that could not be met. All we wanted was a bit of attention and competence from this Minister so that he would look after the things that he created and the hurt that he caused. He gives the direct lie in relation to Senator Boswell's comment that Senator Boswell's motion is vindictive or has something to do with World Heritage listing. Of course it does not. World Heritage listing exists. It is accepted by everybody now, and it will always be accepted. What we are looking at is his mismanagement of a very important government department. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Coulter so rightly pointed out, this was not any ordinary agreement, a normal government function-something that would happen in the normal course of events-it was a particularly important matter that had not only become part of Australian history but also was recognised worldwide. It was a most important occasion. We might have expected that once Senator Richardson had the votes he would have done something to properly administer his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson's rather pitiful defence said nothing really. He was talking about advance payments made, trying to downplay the seriousness of paying money to the wrong person. Both he and Senator Ray have embarked upon a program of belittling this Senate and belittling censure motions. I remind Senator Richardson that censure motions, if they are passed, are passed because a majority of honourable senators, who represent a majority of people in Australia, consider that something very serious has happened-in this case, the administration of a government department. For Senator Richardson and Senator Ray to belittle the motions of the Senate is appalling; that in itself deserves censure. I wonder whether Senator Ray and Senator Richardson are trying to downplay this because they are a bit frightened that, after the events of earlier this week, some of their own colleagues might take the opportunity to come over and vote with us and record their censure against the man who has caused so much disruption to this Government and this nation in the last week. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have a lot to say on Ravenshoe. All of that has been very clearly and concisely put by my colleagues Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee, and also by Senator Coulter, who gave a very clear address and showed a clear understanding of what ministerial responsibility is all about. It is about honesty and integrity in government. It is about looking after things and having a bit of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray went on with some pious nonsense in a very half-hearted defence of Senator Richardson. One might say that if one gets people like Senator Ray to give that sort of half-hearted defence, who needs enemies when one has that sort of person as a backup? One might even think that Senator Ray's contribution was designed to ensure that the maximum number of people voted for the censure motion. Obviously, Senator Ray had not read the motion and he had not listened to Senator Boswell who gave a very clear and concise account of what it was all about. If he had read it, he would not have stood up in the chamber and admitted that he knew nothing about the whole motion. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, the vindictiveness and lack of genuineness that Senator Ray has suggested of the censure motion are obviously not true. This is not a matter that has come up just this week or just recently. It is a matter that Senator Boswell was pursuing long before I came into parliament and it is a matter that both Senator O'Chee and I have been pursuing since we have been here. It had nothing to do with World Heritage listings. It had something to do with the people-ordinary Australians-who have been devastated by Senator Richardson's lack of attention to his portfolio. That is what this matter is all about. That is what Senator Boswell has been trying to bring to light. He has not tried to be vindictive or tried to re-create the debate on World Heritage listing. That has all finished. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell has been trying to look after little Australians, ordinary Australians, who have been devastated because Senator Richardson does not have the time or the inclination to look after his portfolio. Senator Richardson is pretty good at getting the votes when he can go and fool the greenies to get them on side. He is pretty good at trying to get the votes to back up his leadership contenders, although in recent days, that has been shown to be rather a farce. But he has prided himself on that; that is what he has concentrated on. He has had no interest in Ravenshoe. He has had no interest in the people who have been hurt very badly. He was only interested in getting the votes. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that even the conservation movement has now woken up to Senator Richardson. In a newspaper article, Mr Phillip Toyne, the Executive Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation, was quoted as saying that:</PARA>
<PARA> Ravenshoe was an ugly example of where the system has gone wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> We wanted to work out a fair deal through consultation, but it didn't happen.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has to come in with a package to help in those type of circumstances. But things have gone from bad to worse at Ravenshoe with what seems to be misuse of public money and the large cost to Ravenshoe. </PARA>
<PARA>So even the conservation movement is waking up to the fact that no matter how much the Government talks about it, how much it wants to do, it has to get in there and supervise its departments and make things work. Of course, that is what Senator Richardson has not done and that is what he has been censured for not doing. If one reads the censure motion, one will understand that. This was not an ordinary case; it was not just some ordinary administrative thing. It involved a series of actions by Senator Richardson on a very, very important matter, one that had worldwide headlines. Ever since I have been in this place, Senator Richardson has embarked upon a course of untruth, of hiding the proposals, of pushing things away and of giving half answers. Heavens knows that we have given him every opportunity to do the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA> We have asked questions here and we have asked questions in two lots of Estimates committee hearings. We have made speeches. We have spoken to Senator Richardson; we have pleaded with him. We have done everything possible to try to get some justice and to get the problems that he has created sorted out, but he has ignored us. </PARA>
<PARA> For Senator Ray to turn up today and say that the censure motion is a vindictive action about something that happened years and years ago is complete nonsense. The number of people who turned up here to support Senator Richardson in this very serious censure motion is an indication of just what his own colleagues think about his attention to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to highlight briefly the distress that Senator Richardson and his Government have caused the people of Ravenshoe-not just those people in business, not just those who were in unions when they had a job, but also the ordinary people. This motion is all about the money that was supposed to have gone to the mill at Ravenshoe. If it had gone there it would have kept the mill going; it would have provided jobs; and it would have given employment and succour to the people of Ravenshoe. If that had been done, the situation in Ravenshoe would not be as bad as it is now. Because Senator Richardson chose not to properly administer his Department, that money has not gone to Ravenshoe; that money has gone to another company which appears to own a mill in Kyogle, the creditors of which, I assume, are very happy with Senator Richardson because, no doubt, they have been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders whether the creditors in Kyogle-in New South Wales-were perhaps some more of Senator Richardson's infamous mates, because the money certainly went to no-one in Queensland. It went to people in New South Wales, no doubt to creditors in New South Wales. A formal legal agreement-it was not just a whim-said that Senator Richardson should have paid that money to Plywood and Plastics Pty Ltd and that it should have been paid on 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA> What has Senator Richardson done? He has paid the money to a different company which owns a different mill in a different State with different employees and different creditors. He claims that it is not his fault. He claims that it is the fault of some junior clerk. How is that for ministerial responsibility? He cannot even stand up and take it on the chin. He blames some kid who cannot defend himself, who cannot come in here and who will never have the chance to say anything. Senator Richardson gets up and blames this fellow. Senator Richardson is always too preoccupied doing other things; he is the great king-maker. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened to Senator Richardson now? Where is he now? He is in such odium that the only person his Party can get to defend him is now his competitor for leadership of the Right faction. He has not only let down the people of Ravenshoe, but he has also let down his colleagues who blindly followed him and thought they might get something out of the spoils of office. Boy oh boy, don't they now know? All they had to do was ask the people of Ravenshoe, who could have told them not to bother following Senator Richardson who had no idea of what he was talking about. They would have known that. But anyhow, Senator Ray showed today that he is cock-a-hoop with his victory-his coming leadership of the Senate. What we are trying to say to the Senate is that Senator Richardson has not properly pursued this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, in answers to the Senate all the way through this saga, Senator Richardson has pretended that things were done properly. He said in December 1989, `We sought financial reports'. Again, early in 1990, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There was no indication at this time that there was any financial difficulty in the mill or the holding company. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Richardson has had us believe all the way through this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We found out a few weeks ago that, in early January 1990, the company wrote a letter saying that it was in financial difficulties and that it had problems. The letter contained things that should have made the Minister and his senior officers have a closer look at the matter. What has happened on the way through? Senator Richardson has tried to mislead the Senate by suggesting that everything was okay in January 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Had things been okay in January 1990, had the cheque been paid to a company that was solvent, had Senator Richardson and his officers made sure that that money went to the mill and that the mill continued to operate, we would not have the real social problems that we have in Ravenshoe now. Senator Richardson should have some concern for the street kids of Ravenshoe, the unemployed, the disadvantaged, the Aboriginals who are now out of work and suffering more than others. He is not interested in those sorts of things; he is more interested in flitting around the world looking after his mates like Brian Burke. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson lists as some of his interests: welfare and structural adjustment-how appropriate for a man who has so blatantly looked after his own welfare so well over the years instead of the welfare of all of those people around him. It is interesting for him to say that he is interested in structural adjustment because he has misused the structural adjustment package that was allowed for Ravenshoe in order to prop up some business in New South Wales. Is that his interest in structural adjustment?</PARA>
<PARA> Looking at Senator Richardson's lavish indulgences on his overseas trips, it is worth comparing these expenses with the debts owed to the people of Ravenshoe who gave credit to the mill believing that Senator Richardson was doing what he was supposed to be doing and supervising the retooling of the mill. The $4,473 that Senator Richardson spent in car bills over two days while he was in Ireland could have paid back the $4,000 that was owed to Johnsons Transport in Ravenshoe, for example. The $1,348 hire car bill which Senator Richardson clocked up in the Hague in January earlier this year could have paid back the $1,300 owed to R and A Berwick in Ravenshoe. The $1,532 hire car bill which the Minister achieved in Rome could have paid back the $1,300 owed to the Club Hotel Motel, the $142 owed to the Ravenshoe Pharmacy, the $69 owed to Gerrys Upholstery and the $25 owed to Doyles Electrical. The Minister's $894 hire car bill and his sumptuous $1,000 per night accommodation in London could have easily paid back the $800 owed to NZ Hydro. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's now notorious Comcar overtime bill of $30,000 could have covered the $16,000 owed to G and D Williams Builders, the $11,500 owed to K and A Chatfield, the $308 owed to Sheppards Newsagency and the $200 owed to the Koolmoon Motel. And the list goes on and on. In fact, the Minister's three overseas trips in the last eight months alone, amounting to $130,048, could have paid easily the $80,000 owing to Condon Contractors of Ravenshoe, the $20,000 owing to Kidner Logging and the $28,000 owing to P.K. Engineering. </PARA>
<PARA> The total of $220,000 owed to Ravenshoe businesses could have been paid easily from this Minister's $11m budget to publicise the worth of the Department of Social Security. This Minister is proud of the fact-and he said it with some glee during Question Time some months ago-that he spent $11m on balloons and other things in order to publicise the Department of Social Security. I would not have thought the Department of Social Security needed publicising-it has the most business it has ever had because of the recession that Senator Ray's lot thought we had to have. Those opposite made us have the recession and because of that they have given the Department of Social Security all of the business it will ever need. The Minister does not need to spend $11m publicising it and getting new clients.</PARA>
<PARA> Just a small fraction of that $11m would have done something for the people who are suffering in Ravenshoe. Senator Ray would not understand that, but I challenge him to go there some day and see what it is all about. See if his heart cannot be wrenched by the real social and family problems of the people in that area, and all because Senator Ray's former colleague Senator Richardson could not be bothered to put in the time making sure that cheques were paid to the right place and he could not be bothered to put in the time making sure that a proper and comprehensive legal agreement made between him and a company called Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd and signed by him was, in fact, honoured. That is why these people in Ravenshoe are facing these problems-because Senator Richardson has shown a complete disregard for his responsibilities as a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that it was not until two weeks ago-as the Minister said last Thursday-that he first saw the letter which indicated that Ravenshoe was in trouble. Are we to believe what the Minister said: that this was the first time he knew the mill had had financial problems prior to receivership? I say we cannot believe Senator Richardson when he says that. Can he not understand that his lack of care and his acts of gross negligence are the root cause of the social, family and economic problems that are now facing Ravenshoe? If Senator Richardson had abided by that agreement, if he had paid the cheque at the right time and to the correct company, then the problems which are now facing Ravenshoe would not be there. </PARA>
<PARA> The acts of treachery which are so evident this week in Senator Richardson's actions against his own colleagues are nothing compared with what the people of Ravenshoe think of him. The people of Ravenshoe were initially lulled into a false sense of security by Senator Richardson's promise that they would be looked after and that no-one would suffer as a result of his actions in relation to World Heritage listings. Of course, they blindly followed him. They believed blindly what he said he would do. Of course, he has not done it and he has been involved in the greatest mismanagement, lack of attention and irresponsibility that any Minister could ever perpetrate in a matter which was not just an ordinary-day matter, but one of great importance to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I had hoped that, as an act of contrition to the people of Ravenshoe, Senator Richardson would have the courage to resign because of his gross mismanagement and the real hurt that he has caused all of those people. If he does not have the courage to do that and if he is not prepared to make that act of contrition he should be sacked by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-not for the things that have happened this week, but for the fact that all the way through this Ravenshoe saga Senator Richardson has not been interested and has not administered his portfolio properly. This has caused the mill to fail, businesses have been lost, livelihoods have been shattered, houses have been taken by mortgagees, kids have been forced to leave school, unemployment and crime have increased dramatically, there have been suicides related to this matter, and the social and family problems are enormous. All of these things result from this Minister's inability to administer his Department properly. For that, the Senate should censure Senator Richardson and he should then take that censure as an indication of what the people of Australia want him to do: to get out; to resign. If he is not prepared to do that, the Prime Minister should sack him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have come to have some regard for the Senate while I have been a member of this place. I hold many of its processes to be very good and there is much good debate. We have before us today a censure motion which I think everybody has said is a very serious step indeed-or it should be a very serious step. I think in years to come people will read about the proceedings that have surrounded this censure motion and they will make a judgment as to how we, as a Senate, acted. They will say that this censure motion is in the nature of a judicial hearing because this Senate will impose a very significant penalty on a Minister and it will say, `We censure this man'. The people will say, `Did the Senate come to its conclusions on the basis of calm reflection? Did it apply a test that would meet the dictates of natural justice? Did it give a hearing to both sides? Did it come to a conclusion with an unbiased mind?'.

<PARA> I listened to the speech by the former Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. At least from the parts that I heard, he gave a defence of his administration. He said that not only his Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories but all departments work in a particular way, one which would have made it impossible for him to see what cheque was sent out and what happened on this occasion. He said, `Look, everybody who is knowledgeable would know that what I say is true'. He quoted Senator Durack, a very eminent and honourable senator of this place, in support of what he said. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought I would come in here and hear an answer to what Senator Richardson said. In light of that, I will read what he has been charged with. The motion states:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate censures Senator Richardson as the former Minister for the Environment for failing to properly supervise actions of his department. </PARA>
<PARA>It then gives five matters that have resulted from that action. In the speech we have just heard-unfortunately I did not hear earlier ones-there was no proper consideration of those issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comments of Senator Alston, who knows what natural justice is, show what this debate really concerns. I mentioned the alleged excessive expenditure by Senator Richardson overseas. That was mentioned in the context of this motion. Senator Alston asked what I meant by `alleged'. By that question he infers that, in considering this motion, we should take into account what Senator Richardson has done overseas; what he has done with the factional activities that go on in the Australian Labor Party; what he has done when he was visiting Ravenshoe; what he has done `flitting around the world looking after his mates'; and what he has done with his `lavish bills'. Those are the issues that we have been asked by Senator Macdonald and Senator Alston to consider in light of this censure motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matters that they put forward are matters of emotion, which invite us to apply lynch law rather than proper judgment. This is one motion that I, with absolute and complete conviction, will be voting against because I do not want to be read in years to come as somebody who has lynched a Minister not on the basis of what he did in respect of the matters raised in the motion that was put forward but on the basis of what he is alleged to have done in all sorts of other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson is accused by Senator Macdonald of getting the vote from the environmentalists. He has been accused of going out and electioneering in a way that did not suit the Opposition. Senator Macdonald is a very eminent lawyer. He represents what the Opposition is saying in this case. The Opposition has said that we should censure Senator Richardson today not in respect of the cheque but in respect of the factional deals he has been doing, his attempt to get the environmentalists' vote on the last occasion, his failure to look after little Australians and his attempt to contest an issue with Senator Robert Ray. Apparently, one reason we have to censure Senator Richardson is that Senator Robert Ray is cock-a-hoop about events that happened yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson's character has been attacked. Apparently, we have to censure him for flitting around the world, committing acts of treachery this week, failing to have the courage to resign, because his Comcare overtime bill is too great and because he spent $4,430 on car bills. They are the sorts of things for which the man has been condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson's defence of his position has not been met. When Hansard comes out, I will defy anybody in this chamber to show that a very careful analysis of what Senator Richardson went through in his defence to the motion that was put forward has been made. Has anybody in this chamber been able to contradict his statement that it is not for the Minister to supervise the actual making out and sending of cheques? Has anybody here met his argument that he was on holidays? If this motion is to be put forward and put forward seriously, why is his case not met? Why is not the case that Senator Richardson put forward in his defence met? Opposition senators in this chamber will today condemn a Minister without meeting his case. They have put forward a series of allegations which, before Senator Richardson spoke, I suppose people could speculate upon. But since he has answered those allegations, why is his answer not met?</PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that it is not hard for those opposite to have checked up with somebody like Senator Durack, who knows how ministries work. I can understand people who have not been in government for eight years not knowing how the process works. But, on the other hand, there are members of the Opposition who have been in government, know how government works and would have been able to give an answer to this question if one were available. Has one former Minister stood up and condemned Senator Richardson? Where is Senator Durack? He is the person who best knows what happens here. Why has he not come forward and joined in the debate?</PARA>
<PARA> Hansard will show that today the Senate condemned a Minister not on the basis of evidence supporting the censure motion as written out but of allegations that go to his character and on allegations that are couched in the wildest and most intemperate of language, that it has condemned the man not in respect of what he is charged with but in respect of all sorts of other things. This will appear in the Hansard for all time. If that is not lynch law, I do not know what is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee says that he has not met any of the charges. Well, I certainly thought he did. These are the charges:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate censures Senator Richardson as the former Minister for the Environment for failing to properly supervise actions of his department. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson made out a defence which said, `Look, within the grand traditions which guide how a Minister should supervise his Department, I have met all the rules. I call in as a precedent and in support of what I have done what Senator Durack has said and what Senator Durack did on a particular occasion'. In saying that, Senator Richardson has met the charges made by the Opposition. What has not been done on the other side is to say that Senator Durack did not do those things; that Senator Durack was wrong when he did those things; that Senator Richardson is wrong when he says, `That is how the Department should work' or `Here is a book that sets out how Ministers should act in these circumstances'. None of that was done; none of those rebuttals was put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> If those opposite are going to make out a case and that case is answered by Senator Richardson, they should then rebut the case that has been put by him. They should not get to the point where he gets up and makes a defence and then introduce material that is obviously terribly prejudicial to his case and has nothing to do with the charge that has been made but everything to do with his trips overseas, his factional dealings, the problems that the Australian Labor Party has been going through in the last couple of days, and his having spent, so it is said, too much on his Comcar. All those things were brought up but at no stage was an answer given to the matters he raised in his defence. </PARA>
<PARA> We are about to vote on this censure motion. I shall certainly vote against it. In years to come, readers of Hansard may well say, `This was a pretty emotional debate; they never seemed to get down to the issues that were involved within the terms of the motion that was put. The opposition'- in the sense of the general opposition to Senator Richardson's position- `never seemed to answered his defence, yet went ahead and condemned him. It seems to be more like the application of lynch law than a proper considered hearing where natural justice was applied'. I at least can say that I did not go ahead on the basis of applying lynch law to this man; that I at least listened to his material and, when no proper evidence was put forward to rebut it, I gave him the benefit that anybody should be entitled to; that is, that one should not go down on a charge unless it has been proved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In summing up, I would just like to run through a few points. I am sorry that the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, is not here, because he accused me of malice. Senator Ray is known as one of the straight shooters around this place, and I believe that remark did not really indicate the true Senator Ray. I have no malice in this place. I come here representing a constituency different from that of the Australian Democrats and different from that of the Australian Labor Party. I said in my contribution today that I opposed the World Heritage listing. I did not come in here with any malice at all. I come to this place to represent my constituency, as do the Democrats, as does the Labor Party and as does the Liberal Party of Australia. But that is not the reason why I moved this censure motion. I moved it because I firmly believe that Senator Richardson did not supervise his Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to put it on the record that I was drawn into answering an interjection regarding Senator Durack. I have the highest possible regard for Senator Durack and his abilities in the Senate. What I meant to say was that what Senator Durack said five years ago is totally irrelevant to what has happened in Ravenshoe. So, if I have offended Senator Durack in any way, I hope that he will accept my apologies. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray then went on to some obscure document about resignation. I never mentioned resignation but, since it was mentioned, it may be appropriate if Senator Richardson feels that he has let the side down. But the real truth is that the Minister has not administered his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter presented his reasons in a very logical way. He believes that the slackness of Senator Richardson will make World Heritage listing more difficult in the future. That is quite a good argument. In getting into the meat of the argument, he also read the agreement signed by Senator Richardson and Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd. He indicated that the amount is paid when the mill operates up to 120 days in any one year. Senator Coulter raised the point that, because the money was paid in advance, we will never know whether the mill had earned the $2.125m. That is a very relevant point. </PARA>
<PARA> Then Senator Richardson was flippant about being censured for not answering a question on notice. I put it to Senator Richardson that this is a very serious censure motion. It relates to an amount of $7.6m that has not hit the target that the Government allocated and appropriated the money for, money which has not gone to Ravenshoe. I am not saying that Senator Richardson is not entitled to a holiday. The problems did not occur on 9 January when the cheque was drawn. These problems have gone on for months and months. In fact, on 7 June 1989, there were already indications and the dogs were barking all over north Queensland that something was wrong in the mill. I heard about it. I could deduce that money was going into the mill but that the people of Ravenshoe were not getting paid, the small business community was not getting paid, the loggers were not getting paid, the carriers were not getting paid and the people in the whole town were seizing up because no money was coming in. It was very obvious to me, months and months before 9 January, that the money which had been allocated was not reaching its mark. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I proceeded to find out what in fact happened. I do not think Senator Richardson can come in here and say, `Exonerate me because I was on holidays the day it happened'. What about the fact that the veneer mill went out the back door and the fact that a boiler was purchased with government assistance and then sold to AGC Finance Co. and leased back? Senator Richardson was the Minister responsible when all this happened. The censure motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate censures the former Minister for the Environment for failing to supervise the actions of his department . . .</PARA>
<PARA>A lot of money-at least $4.5m-went to the wrong company. A plywood mill was sold without government permission or without Senator Richardson's knowledge. A veneer mill was sold. A lot of stock was also sold and the money never went back to the company. The Minister was responsible for all those things. Then we face the problem of the Minister, or his Department, allowing a cheque for $968,841 to go to the wrong company. </PARA>
<PARA> Already that company, as has been proved by Senator O'Chee, has had money that was determined by the Government to go to Ravenshoe. Already money has been syphoned off Ravenshoe and put into National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd. It is a company that has no responsibility for Ravenshoe. It is a company that has responsibility for a mill in Kyogle. That is why I say to Senator Cooney and all honourable senators opposite that the date of 9 January is fairly irrelevant. All these things were happening before that date. Senator Richardson cannot walk in today and say that $968,841 disappeared because he went on holidays on 9 January. It disappeared because Senator Richardson never administered his Department. That is what it is about. In my original address today I said that passing a censure motion is the highest reprimand that the Senate can place on a Minister. I believe that the Minister deserves it because he was the one who went to Ravenshoe and said to the people, `You won't be affected; I make that commitment to you on behalf of my Government'. He made such a statement. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Macdonald and Senator O'Chee have rightly pointed out, the residents of Ravenshoe say that the town is bankrupt-I believe that-the mill is bankrupt, and everyone has been hurt. That has occurred because Senator Richardson did not administer his Department. Had he administered his Department and the money that was allocated to the mill had ended up retooling the mill, there would have been 40 jobs, the mill would have been sustained, and the town would have lived off the mill as it had for the past 50 or 60 years. The censure motion stands on its own. All this occurred because Senator Richardson did not administer his Department. That is perfectly obvious to the Senate. I therefore commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy.

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>POLITICAL BROADCASTS AND POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>There is no greater duty upon the representatives of the people in a democratic society than the duty to ensure that they serve all members of that society equally. </PARA>
<PARA>This duty requires government which is free of corruption and undue influence. It requires standards of integrity and honesty from its representatives. And it requires that the system itself does not engender a diminution of those standards. </PARA>
<PARA>The integrity of the electoral process is central to the maintenance of these standards and the honouring of this duty. In our own society the pursuit of government office at all levels is far more complicated today than it was when the first elections were held for this Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The development of modern election campaigning and communication techniques have impacted greatly upon the electoral process. This has been no more so evident than in the area of campaign financing. The vast sums required to fund modern political campaigns have added substantially to the pressures upon the electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA>With these changes in mind the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters as part of its inquiry into the 1987 Federal Election produced a report titled ``Who pays the piper calls the tune-minimising the risks of funding political campaigns''. This Parliament is indebted to the Committee for its report. </PARA>
<PARA>The concerns raised in the Committee's report have been the subject of separate State corruption inquiries. Both Queensland Commissioner Fitzgerald and Assistant Commissioner Roden of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption dealt with the problems of political campaign finances in their reports. Related concerns are now the subject of inquiries in Western Australia and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>The ``risk'' to which the title of the Joint Standing Committee's report refers is a real and dangerous one. </PARA>
<PARA>As Commissioner Roden said in his report on his investigation into north coast development, ``with the mounting cost of campaign advertising, parties must be increasingly vulnerable to attempts by substantial donors to exert influence. It appears that the parties are themselves aware of this, and various proposals for increased public funding, limits on allowable spending, free television time, and bans on television advertising, have all been mooted''. </PARA>
<PARA>This risk applies throughout Australia. No political party or government is quarantined from that risk. Steps must be taken to protect the integrity of our systems of government. The Bill before the House today will take such steps. It will contain measures designed to repel the threat of corruption to public order in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will not wait until the problem becomes unmanageable. Action must be taken now to sanitise the electoral system. Nor will the Government take action which only partially addresses the problem. The Joint Standing Committee identified the need to expose the system of electoral funding by enhanced disclosure provisions but equally identified the need to control the burgeoning cost of political campaigning. </PARA>
<PARA>As Commissioner Roden has stated:</PARA>
<PARA>`` . . . as increasingly vast sums of money become necessary for successful political campaigns, the problem will grow. It must be faced and dealt with firmly and openly . . . ''</PARA>
<PARA>The majority report of the Joint Standing Committee considered a number of options for addressing the risks of funding political campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee reviewed the present disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. These provisions and those of similar effect in the New South Wales Act are the only laws requiring disclosure of political donations throughout Australia. The lack of a national uniform legislative scheme which comprehensively covers all political donations in respect of all levels of government is lamentable. The Government will propose to the State and Territory governments that the lack of such a system be remedied as quickly as possible. In doing so, the Government will put forward the comprehensive disclosure laws proposed in this Bill as the basis for uniform legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government welcomes the commitment to such laws already made by the West Australian and Victorian governments and sees this as a positive start to this process. </PARA>
<PARA>The need for full disclosure laws is universally accepted. Disclosure will remove the taint of suspicion from legitimate campaign donations which are at present not required to be disclosed. As Commissioner Roden said in his report:</PARA>
<PARA>``to allow large secret donations to political parties or candidates, is but one step removed from allowing large secret deals with political parties or candidates''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considered a number of options for dealing with the problem of potential corruption stemming from campaign costs. The Committee recommended that a system of freetime for party political broadcasts be offered to registered parties and candidates by broadcasters who would provide airtime free of charge. The proposal was strongly criticised at the time they were released. Many of the criticisms had more to do with the protection of self interest than a fair assessment of the proposal. The Government has rejected the proposal because it believes that the allocation of time to parties would be inequitable and administratively impracticable. Freetime would unfairly advantage the major political and incumbent parties. Furthermore freetime alone would not reduce the need for political parties to expend vast sums upon advertising. Political parties and candidates could be expected to continue to advertise in addition to using the freetime made available. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also rejected the proposal for a limitation on advertising expenditure by political parties. Experience both overseas, particularly in the United States with so-called political action committees and domestically, through such notorious examples as the community polling organisation in New South Wales, has shown how easy it is for political parties to conduct campaigns through front organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's preferred course for dealing with the problems associated with campaign costs is to prohibit the broadcasting of political advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has not taken this step lightly. The competing claims of the various options were considered. The Government opted for a ban on political advertising because it is the fairest and most effective means of addressing the problem of burgeoning campaign costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed ban is aimed directly at the single greatest factor in campaign costs. The exorbitant cost of broadcast advertising precludes the majority of the community and all but the major political parties and large corporate interests from paid access to the airwaves. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government carefully considered the implications of the proposals on the right to freedom of speech, both as it is generally accepted and specifically under international law. In respect of the latter, article 19 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Australia is a party requires parties to guarantee the right of freedom of expression. This right is not absolute. Article 19 (3) of the covenant provides that the right may be limited in the interests of public order. The prohibition of the broadcasting of political advertising is directed squarely at preventing potential corruption and undue influence of the political process. The Government is satisfied that the proposals are a necessary and proportionate response to this threat and do not constitute a breach of our international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course the ban will not affect the expression of opinion or information through broadcasting of material other than advertising. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I turn now to the text of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill inserts a new part IIId into the Broadcasting Act 1942. The part contains a framework for the proposed ban on the broadcasting of political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA>Part IIId is structured in a way which makes it clear that the several provisions of the amendments are to operate to the extent that the Constitution allows. </PARA>
<PARA>The Greiner Government of New South Wales has indicated that it will challenge the proposed ban to the extent of its application to State governments and elections. The Bill has been drafted with the possibility of such a challenge in mind. It also reflects the different nature of election and non election periods. During the former, when the heightened attention given to political issues creates more intense pressure on broadcasters to give access to politicians, and parties, the Bill prohibits certain government advertising and does not provide for the same exemptions from the ban as those which operate in non election periods. </PARA>
<PARA>The ban will prohibit broadcasters from carrying paid or unpaid advertising which includes political matter. It will extend to such advertisements whether run by broadcasters on their own behalf or on behalf of others. The latter step is designed to ensure broadcasters do not flout the ban. To exclude advertisements on the basis that no consideration is paid would be tantamount to creating a privileged class to whom the airwaves would be open for political advertising. Provided you could afford to own a broadcasting service and licence you would be exempted from the prohibition. Similarly, the potential for influence buying and corruption would continue. </PARA>
<PARA>The ban extends to elections for all levels of government, including by-elections and Commonwealth referendums to alter the constitution. Were the ban to apply only to Federal elections, the problems created by the need for political parties to raise huge sums necessary to advertise during an election campaign would only be partially addressed. As the Joint Standing Committee report concluded, parties would merely transfer funds to ``exempt campaigns''.</PARA>
<PARA>In the Bill, political advertising means advertising containing political matter. This definition of political matter is used throughout the Bill and is based upon that of ``electoral matter'' in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The provision has been modified slightly to fit the context of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Fundamentally, political matter is defined to include matter which is likely or intended to affect voting at an election or matter which includes an implied or explicit reference to an issue in an election. It would not include, for example, the ordinary fundraising activities of a charity. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has however received representations from legitimate charitable organisations concerning the effect that they perceive the ban may have upon the promotion of their operations. Whilst the Government remains committed to ensuring the need for integrity of the operation of the ban to prevent avoidance, the Government accepts the concerns of bona fide charities that they should be able to continue to advertise, to the extent that they actually use the medium, in a way which they consider effective for bringing the public's attention to the cause which they espouse. </PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence the Government will be introducing amendments to ensure that broadcast advertisements on behalf of charitable organisations which promote the charitable purpose of that organisation will be exempted from the operation of the ban at all times. </PARA>
<PARA>Under S. 95a of the Bill the ban is to operate at all times and includes the prohibition of advertisements containing matter likely to affect voters at or matter before voters in any election whensoever held. </PARA>
<PARA>Sections 95b, 95c and 95d operate during specific Commonwealth, Territory, State and local government elections. Under these sections, the ban prohibits the broadcasting of advertisements containing political matter in respect of the relevant election period. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has been particularly vigilant to ensure that under the Bill, incumbent governments do not enjoy an advantage over their opponents through the use of government advertising. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, government advertising which falls within the general prohibition on political advertising will be banned. Secondly, during a Commonwealth election period, the broadcast of all Commonwealth Government departmental or authority advertising other than that containing exempt matter will be prohibited. A similar ban upon Territory Government advertising will be imposed during territory elections. </PARA>
<PARA>The extended ban is designed to ensure that government advertisements which arguably may marginally fall outside the definition of political matter cannot be screened during election periods. Whilst it is currently Commonwealth Government practice to administratively apply such a ban, the Bill will ensure that the ban has the force of law in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The ban is confined to political advertisements as commonly understood. </PARA>
<PARA>The broadcast of bona fide news reports, current affairs programs and documentaries which contain references to political issues will not be affected by the legislation. Broadcasters and members of the public will continue to be free to use these forums and others, such as talkback radio, to express views on political issues. Editorial comment by broadcasters will not be impeded by the ban on advertising. The delivery of information to the public including the print handicapped by such means will be unimpeded. </PARA>
<PARA>Those in the community who are visually disabled or functionally illiterate will continue to have access to political information and comment by such means. Additionally the Government will re-examine the impact of the proposed ban upon the reading of newspaper advertisements upon publicly supported radio services for the print handicapped and if necessary exempt, in this strictly limited way, such services from the operation of the ban. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the airwaves of Australia belong to all Australians. Currently, access to those airwaves by means of paid advertising through commercially licensed operators is restricted to those few in the community who can afford to pay the prohibitively high cost. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of the broadcast of political advertisements, the chief users of the airwaves are the major political parties who, at the 1990 Federal election expended over $15 million on broadcasting advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA>During the same election period, all other non political party expenditure on such ads amounted to $1.7 million. Of that figure, over $1.1 million was expended by the logging industry while the Australian Conservation Foundation spent just over $25,000 on broadcast advertising. </PARA>
<PARA>These figures illustrate the inherent inequity in the presentation of political debate through electronic advertising. The reality is that only the rich can get their message across by such means. </PARA>
<PARA>As one political commentator has described the current situation, ``a system which money decides who is and who isn't heard renders meaningless the right of free speech''. </PARA>
<PARA>The ban will thus remove the privileged status of those few in the community who can afford to pay the high costs of broadcast advertising to express their political views, at the exclusion of the vast majority who cannot afford to do so. It will place all in the community on an equal footing so far as the use of the public's airwaves is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>It must also be remembered that television advertising leads to packaging of important political debates and information into 30 second, even 15 second messages, widely criticised for their trivialising of content, and concentration on image making. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, whilst the bulk of expenditure by political parties on advertising occurs during elections, the proposed ban will operate at all times. If the ban were restricted to election periods, parties and others who buy political advertising would run campaigns outside the ban period. The problems associated with the need to raise the huge sums necessary to fund campaigns would remain, but apply to mid term and pre-election period campaigns which could be expected to take on the importance presently attached to election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, since the Government announced its intention to proceed with the proposed ban it has been suggested in some quarters that it is contrary to the direction of practice in similar overseas democracies. </PARA>
<PARA>This is despite the broad degree of regulation of political advertising that exists in the so-called western democracies. For example France, Denmark and Austria prohibit paid political advertising at election times. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands prohibit such advertising at all times and Norway and Sweden prohibit all advertisements including political ads. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore rather than a trend towards deregulation of political advertising, tangible evidence exists of a trend in some cases towards further regulation. In the United Kingdom the parliament reaffirmed its support for the longstanding prohibition on political advertising in the 1990 Broadcasting Act. </PARA>
<PARA>In the United States, five Bills are currently before the Senate which further regulate broadcasts of political matter and advertising. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for certain matter to be exempted from the effect of the ban. This is primarily non-contentious matter and includes announcements concerning civil or military disorder; information relating to the conduct of and promoting participation in an election or referendum; the promotion of services and programs of the ABC and SBS; certain non-contentious government administrative announcements and advertisements for goods and services which do not contain any political matter which are run on behalf of government departments or authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>A further exemption which applies in all but election periods is made for advertisements which concern matters of public health. This would include aids prevention and anti drug abuse advertisements but not advertisements which refer to public health systems. </PARA>
<PARA>The voluntary broadcast of party policy launches during election periods will not be prevented by the ban. Such launches will be restricted to no more than half an hour in length and may only be broadcast on one occasion. The provisions of the Act requiring equal treatment of political parties will continue to apply to the broadcast of launches. </PARA>
<PARA>The use by politicians of ``free broadcast time'' for party political broadcasts will be prevented by the ban. This will ensure that politicians do not enjoy access to the airwaves which is not available to other members of the community. This will include the provision of ``free time'' by the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill ensures that all broadcasters, whether public or private, are treated in the same way. Apart from applying the ban to the ABC, the Bill will not affect the ABC's power to determine to what extent and in what manner it shall broadcast political or controversial matter. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will be able to receive complaints regarding alleged breaches of the ban provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>In recognition of the urgent nature of complaints of alleged breaches of the ban, for example during election periods, the tribunal will be required to deal with complaints or information about alleged breaches forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA>Both the Tribunal and any individual with legal standing will be empowered to seek an order from the Federal Court to enforce or prevent a likely breach of the provisions of the new part. </PARA>
<PARA>The ban is expected in practice to operate chiefly as a deterrent. It will be an offence under the broadcasting Act for a broadcaster to broadcast an advertisement contrary to the ban. Compliance with the ban will also be a condition of every licence granted under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of the part will also be conditions of licences and permits issued under the Radio Communications Act 1983 thus extending the ban to video and audio entertainment and information services, such as skychannel. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to the amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I have already referred to the inadequacies of the current disclosure requirements in the electoral Act. These were perhaps best summarised metaphorically by the former Commonwealth Electoral Commissioner, Dr Colin Hughes, in his evidence before the Joint Standing Committee:</PARA>
<PARA>``what happens under the present arrangements would be that the recipients of donations stand to one side of the table with three walnut shells, only one of which is transparent if it is labelled `a donation to the next federal election'. There are two other walnut shells which are completely opaque and it is up to us to guess which walnut shell the pea is under. If it is not under the transparent one, they merely say, `wrong', and that is the end of the matter . . . ''</PARA>
<PARA>The majority report of the Joint Standing Committee accepted that the matter referred to by Dr Hughes should not end there and made sweeping recommendations to overcome the deficiencies in the present law. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees with the committee that these changes must be made and electoral financing in Australia should be open and transparent. </PARA>
<PARA>The reforms proposed in the amendments to the funding and disclosure provisions of the electoral Act will bring that transparency to the electoral process. It will enable the Electoral Commission to investigate and expose any avoidance of the disclosure obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>The public is entitled to be assured that the parties and candidates which make up the Government or Opposition of the day are free of undue or improper outside influence. The present system of disclosure cannot and does not engender complete confidence. The Government will restore confidence to the system by exposing who pays the piper. </PARA>
<PARA>The electoral Act will be amended to require political parties to fully disclose all income, expenditure and debts. Parties will be required to lodge annual returns with the Australian Electoral Commission within eight weeks of the end of each financial year in addition to the existing requirement for the lodging of returns in respect of electoral expenditure following elections. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill requires that all amounts received paid or owed by a political party must be disclosed. Whilst the total sums of all such amounts will be required to be disclosed the Australian Electoral Commission will determine the approved form in which disclosure shall take place. It is envisaged that the Commission will not require details of every individual transaction (beyond total amounts) but will require generic disclosure of categories of expenditure, income and debts. </PARA>
<PARA>The identity of individuals who pay to, receive or are owed amounts by political parties will be disclosable only in circumstances prescribed by regulations made under the Act. Parliament will thus be able to approve or disallow the regulations which are intended to provide a flexible and workable scheme which does not require disclosure of the identity of those involved in insignificant transactions. This will avoid a needless administrative burden being placed on the Electoral Commission and political parties and guarantee the appropriate protection of privacy. Examples of the type of disclosure which would not be required by the regulations include the publication of ordinary membership lists and details of identity and outlays of employees and salaries. </PARA>
<PARA>Tougher disclosure requirements will also be placed upon third parties who participate in the political process. </PARA>
<PARA>Third parties include persons or organisations other than registered political parties or candidates who incur electoral expenditure, including the making of a gift to a political party or candidate. </PARA>
<PARA>Currently third parties are required to disclose such expenditure but need not do so where the expenditure relates to an election which does not occur during the specific reporting period. This has enabled third parties to avoid the reporting requirements. The Joint Standing Committee identified this problem and recommended that the loophole be removed. The Bill removes this loophole by requiring disclosure of electoral expenditure in respect of any election. </PARA>
<PARA>Third parties will also be required to disclose any gift made to a political party or part thereof, regardless of whether the gift is for electoral or other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission will also be required to publish a list of all third parties in its reports on the operation of the funding and disclosure sections of the Act. This will ensure that the identity of those participating in the political process will be publicly available in keeping with the commitment to full disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is determined that the Electoral Commission should be armed with the powers necessary to enforce the disclosure requirements of the Act. The Commission has for some time had the power to conduct investigations where it has reasonable grounds to believe that an offence relating to the disclosure provisions of the Act has been committed. The provisions amount to the ability to conduct a spot audit of a political party or a candidate's financial affairs to ensure the Act has not been breached. </PARA>
<PARA>While the Commission retains confidence in the efficacy of such compliance audits as an enforcement tool, the current provisions require the Commission to have reasonable grounds to believe that a breach of the Act may have occurred in order to activate an audit. This has prevented the Commission from conducting random audits. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's amendments will remove the deficiencies in the Act and provide the Electoral Commission with the power to subject political and third parties to random audits to ensure compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Act. The Commission will be able to do so at any time and will not be required to have a reasonable ground to suspect an offence under the Act has been committed. Political and third parties will be subject to a random audit at any time. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, the Commission will be required to publish a record of all spot audits in the reports on the funding and disclosure provision of the Act which it is currently required to publish following each election. The Commission will also be empowered to issue such supplementary reports as it considers necessary to comply with its obligation to report all spot audits. </PARA>
<PARA>As some third parties are not established solely for political purposes and their financial affairs may only relate in a marginal way to their involvement in the political process, the Commission will be prevented from publishing any details obtained during a third party spot audit other than details of an offence under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has moved, through the Bill, to recognise and protect the rights of donors. The Bill will make it an offence under S.327 to interfere or hinder with the free exercise by a person of his or her right to make a gift to a political party. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill amends the Act to provide that registered political parties and candidates are entitled to the same level of public funding per Senate vote as is provided for a vote for the House of Representatives. Under the public funding provisions inserted in the Act in 1984 a Senate vote is currently valued at one half or two-thirds of a vote for the House of Representatives depending upon the type of Senate election held. These provisions discriminate against smaller parties who concentrate upon Senate campaigns and fail to sufficiently acknowledge the costs of such campaigns. The Bill will place all votes on the same footing. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments are also made to the Electoral Act and the Referendum Machinery Provisions Act to ensure that the result of an election or referendum cannot be overturned by the Court of Disputed Returns by reason only of a breach of the Broadcasting Act or the Radio Communications Act. Mr President, the Bill represents a comprehensive response to the threat of corruption and undue influence which hangs over the political process. In the terms of the Joint Standing Committee report these proposals minimise the risks created by the need to fund political campaigns. The importance of sanitising our electoral process and of restoring public confidence in it has never been more paramount. The potential risk in not doing so will not diminish in the future. I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian National University Bill 1991 provides for the amalgamation of the Australian National University and the Canberra Institute of the Arts from 1 January 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>In July of 1989, the Australian National University and the Canberra Institute of the Arts finalised an affiliation agreement with a view to amalgamating by 1 January 1991. In July 1990, the University and the Institute of the Arts agreed to amalgamate. </PARA>
<PARA>Legislation to give effect to this amalgamation was to be introduced into Parliament last year but was deferred because of the possibility that the Report of the Committee to Review the Institute of Advanced Studies of the Australian National University (the Stephen Report) would have legislative implications. This has proved not to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Senators will be aware that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, made a statement earlier this year on arrangements for higher education in the Australian Capital Territory, on the basis of advice contained within the Stephen Report and the advice from Professor Chubb. In that statement he endorsed new administrative arrangements which will encourage the Australian National University and the University of Canberra to co-ordinate their efforts and cooperate more closely in order to provide the best possible educational opportunities for the region. He also endorsed new funding arrangements for the Institute of Advanced Studies of the Australian National University, which will enhance the Institute's role as a national resource and result in an appropriate performance evaluation and peer-review process to guarantee the best use of research funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Senators could not have failed to notice the reports in the media about these decisions. There has been persistent misrepresentation of the Government's intentions towards the Institute of Advanced Studies. On Friday 10 May, Mr Baldwin met with the ANU Council to discuss points of difference in relation to the Government's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>This provided the Minister with an opportunity to clarify a number of key points with Council members. He stressed that key issues such as the performance criteria to be applied every five years and the composition of the review panels evaluating each School and Centre within the Institute would be matters on which the ARC would need to consult, and seek agreement with, the ANU. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Government continues to believe that it is legitimate and appropriate for it to be able to receive expert advice from the ARC, the only body with broad based knowledge of research activity throughout the higher education system, except the National Health and Medical Research Council for medical research, as to the overall distribution of research funds between the Institute of Advanced Studies and the rest of the higher education research system. In arriving at such advice, the ARC would draw on the reviews of each component of the Institute and would notionally apportion a level of funding to each. It is not the Government's intention, however, to require that the ANU's internal resource allocation decisions would correspond to its own notional apportionment. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no implication in any of this that the Institute's funding should be cut-in fact the new review arrangements could mean more funds. Like Stephen, the Government acknowledges the high quality of much of the Institute's research, and sees value in retaining a concentration of research resources and personnel. However, funding at the level provided to the Institute must be a demonstrably effective use of scarce research funds, and the Government, quite properly, will demand advice on the opportunity cost involved in funding the Institute at a given level compared with other research activities in the higher education research system. </PARA>
<PARA>The present Bill, however, is entirely separate from these new arrangements for higher education in the ACT. Its purpose is to put into effect a longstanding agreement to amalgamate between the Australian National University and the Canberra Institute of the Arts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill abolishes the Institute of the Arts as a separate institution and adds to the functions of the University the requirement that it provide facilities for courses at higher education and other levels in the visual and performing arts and, in doing so, to promote the highest standards in those fields. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also provides for the students and staff of the Institute of the Arts to be transferred to the University on terms and conditions no less favourable than they enjoy at present. </PARA>
<PARA>The amalgamation can be expected to enhance the national and international roles of the University through the addition of the visual and performing arts to its range of disciplines while at the same time allowing the Institute of the Arts to become a member of the unified national system. With its small student load, the Institute of the Arts would be unable to enter the unified national system of higher education in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA>The amalgamation will permit students from both institutions to benefit from a wider range of course options. The development of higher degree courses at the Institute of the Arts will benefit from the University's greater experience in graduate education. In addition, the consolidation of adjacent campuses under one administration will lead to cost efficiencies and the rationalisation of shared services and amenities. The local community can expect to enjoy greater benefits from an expansion of university extension programs with the addition of more musical, art and gallery activities. </PARA>
<PARA>One substantive amendment to the Bill was passed in the House of Representatives. A major portion of the Bill provides for the transition to the consolidated Australian National University (incorporating the Canberra Institute of the Arts). The amendment will enable the Pro-Chancellor of the Australian National University to continue in office after commencement of the new Act on 1 January 1992. This is consistent with provisions already in the Bill for other senior officers. Like them, the Pro-Chancellor will continue in office for the remainder of the term of his or her original appointment and under the terms and conditions of that appointment. This amendment was sought by the University to make for a smooth transition to the consolidated University. </PARA>
<PARA>Other amendments to the Bill, also passed in the House, were in connection with minor technical drafting matters. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>UNIVERSITY OF CANBERRA AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the University of Canberra Amendment Bill 1991 is to amend the University of Canberra Act, 1989 which provides for the operation and management of the University of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for four substantive changes to the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The manner in which representatives of the Australian Capital Territory are appointed to the University's governing Council has been streamlined to enable the Chief Minister of the ACT Legislative Assembly to appoint the ACT members directly to Council. Previously representatives of the ACT were appointed by the Governor-General on the nomination of the ACT Minister responsible for education. </PARA>
<PARA>Changes have been made to the University's audit requirements to make them more appropriate to the non-commercial nature of the institution and to bring the University of Canberra into line with other comparable Commonwealth higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also provides for the membership of the University's Council to be increased from 17 to 22 members, and for the University to be able to appoint its Chancellor either from outside or from inside the membership of Council, as is the case for other higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments have the support of the University of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Both Labor and coalition governments have in the past supported the protection and wise use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and I hope that this bipartisan support will continue. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been 16 years since the passage of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and the creation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Over that time practical experience gained from managing the Marine Park has highlighted areas where protection of the Reef could be improved. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has noted with concern the effects of spillages of oil and other toxic substances on the marine environment around the world and is of the view that such risks to the Great Barrier Reef should be minimised as much as possible. The affects of an incident like that of the Exxon Valdez would be quite disastrous to the Great Barrier Reef environment, and even smaller spills of toxic material would be very damaging. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to improve the protection of the Great Barrier Reef against possible spillages of oil and other toxic substances by introducing compulsory pilotage through the northern inner shipping routes of the Reef. </PARA>
<PARA>These routes offer relatively calm waters, but are shallow and intricate in places. Approximately ten percent of the 2,000 large ships or ships carrying potentially hazardous cargo using the passage every year are not adhering to the current voluntary system of pilotage. Extensive diplomatic representations have not brought a higher level of compliance with the voluntary scheme. The Government does acknowledge the 90 per cent of ships which do adhere to the present system of voluntary pilotage. The responsibility of their masters and owners is appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA>The current voluntary pilotage system covers ships of 100 metres in length and over, as well as ships carrying potentially hazardous cargo. A lower limit of 70 metres has been set in the new system because of the number of groundings of ships in the 70 to 100 metre range occurring in recent years. There has been at least one per year. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia is committed to the uniform application and development of international law and international cooperation, rather than unilateral action, in protecting our marine environment. Hence we sought recognition by the international maritime organisation (IMO) for the special status of the Great Barrier Reef and endorsement of the compulsory pilotage scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia was successful in having the IMO pass two important resolutions in November 1990. The first was to identify the Great Barrier Reef region as a ``particularly sensitive area'' the first such listed area in the world. The second was its recommendation that all governments recognise the need for effective protection of the Great Barrier Reef region and to inform ships flying their flag to act in accordance with Australia's system of pilotage. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the first time that the international community has endorsed such a system. It marks a new development in international law, recognising the dynamic balance which exists between protection of the marine environment and freedom of navigation. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act will give effect to these IMO resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Vessels meeting criteria recognised in the IMO resolutions will be required to use the services of a person holding a Queensland and Torres Strait pilot's licence while navigating the inner route or Hydrographer's Passage. </PARA>
<PARA>At present pilots hold licences as coastal pilots issued by the Marine Board of Queensland. These licences will be recognised in the regulations. The regulations will also enable additional licences to be introduced. It is intended that there be extensive consultation with interested parties and organisations before any other forms of licensing are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>Three offences have been created to enforce the compulsory pilotage system. In the first, the master and owner of any vessel over 70 metres and any loaded oil tanker, chemical carrier or liquefied gas carrier, irrespective of size, will be liable to prosecution if that vessel navigates without the assistance of a pilot in the area between the northern boundary of the Marine Park and latitude 16 degrees 40 minutes south, and also in Hydrographers Passage, which is just off Mackay. The maximum penalty imposed following conviction would be $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA>The other two offences are linked to the subsequent entry into an Australian port of a vessel which has navigated in the designated areas without a pilot. </PARA>
<PARA>In the first of these two, both the owner and the master will be liable to prosecution if the ship enters an Australian port under the command of the master who navigated in the compulsory pilotage areas without a pilot. In the second, if a ship navigates in the compulsory pilotage area without a pilot and later enters an Australian port under the command of a different master, then only the owner will be liable. Again, the maximum penalty imposed would be $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA>These port entry related offences have been included to take advantage of the clear authority which Australia has under international law to control the entry of vessels into its ports. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government intends that inspectors appointed with respect to compulsory pilotage will normally be officers of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). AMSA officers are more likely than Great Barrier Reef Marine Park officers to be in a position to exercise the power to seek evidence concerning pilotage as they frequently board vessels to carry out inspections under the Navigation Act 1912. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act has been chosen to implement the compulsory pilotage system is to indicate Australia's commitment to greater protection for the Great Barrier Reef environment. It clearly demonstrates to the international community that the measures are aimed at reducing navigational hazards in this particularly sensitive area, for its enhanced protection. </PARA>
<PARA>After these measures are introduced and enforced, the rate of compliance, already 90 per cent under the voluntary pilotage scheme, is expected to be total. A particularly vulnerable part of the Reef will thus be more effectively protected from the possibility of an environmental disaster caused by a shipping mishap. </PARA>
<PARA>In deciding on this course of action, the Government considered other options including the suggestion by some conservation groups that tankers should be prohibited from the region. This was rejected as impractical for a number of reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Much of the tanker traffic operating inside the Reef is servicing the population centres of far north Queensland. Without access to such shipping these communities and the industries on which they are dependent, such as tourism, agriculture and mining, would not be able to satisfy their energy and other needs;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The waters of alternative routes in the Coral Sea are less sheltered and less well served with navigation aids. Ships transiting via these routes therefore constitute an equal or greater risk to the environment than those inside the Reef; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Ships navigating in the inner route of the Great Barrier Reef are exercising the right of innocent passage under international law. It would not be open to Australia to completely restrict this right. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, this Bill represents the Government's resolve to improve the protection of one of the world's greatest natural assets, the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF PROCESS AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>In August last year the Attorney-General announced that the Government had decided to repeal and replace the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901, following consideration of the Law Reform Commission's report on Service and Execution of Process. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations mentioned in the announcement was an extension of the Act to proceedings before tribunals. At present the Act only applies to proceedings before courts. </PARA>
<PARA>This extension would apply with respect to tribunals that resolve disputes and to tribunals that conduct inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA>As honourable senators are aware, there are a number of important inquiries being conducted in Australia at present. I refer particularly to the Royal Commissions in Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Service and Execution of Process Act to enable Royal Commissions and other investigative tribunals to serve subpoenas on persons interstate, and to provide for interstate enforcement of subpoenas to give evidence to investigative tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA>The new provisions are based on the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. The Act already provides for interstate service and interstate enforcement of subpoenas issued by courts. </PARA>
<PARA>As well as enabling investigative tribunal subpoenas to be served interstate the Bill provides appropriate safeguards to protect the interests of persons served with an interstate subpoena. </PARA>
<PARA>At present State or Territory Royal Commissions and other inquiries can only effectively subpoena witnesses within the State or Territory concerned. This can be a serious restriction on the effectiveness of the inquiry and can inhibit its capacity to uncover all relevant information. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes investigative tribunals, including the Royal Commissions I have mentioned, should be given the power now to summons witnesses from interstate. These tribunals must be able to conduct full and thorough inquiries so that the greatest possible public benefit can ensue. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is bringing forward this reform as a separate Bill, rather than in the Bill to replace the Service and Execution of Process Act, so that it will be available for current inquiries. The Chairman of one Royal Commission has informed the Government he considers that, without the powers being conferred by this Bill, the Commission's work may be restricted in some important respects. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of the Government's heavy legislative program the replacement Bill will not be ready for introduction until the next sittings. As it is a substantial law reform bill we would then wish there to be adequate time for examination of the Bill by honourable members, the legal profession and the public, before it is passed. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will insert a new Part 3A into the Service and Execution of Process Act. </PARA>
<PARA>That Part will apply to investigative tribunals which, for the purposes of the Part, will be persons appointed by a State Governor (such as Royal Commissions of Inquiry) or under a State or Territory law, and bodies established under a State or Territory law, for the purposes of inquiring into and reporting on matters, where those persons or bodies have the power to take evidence on oath or affirmation. </PARA>
<PARA>A subpoena requiring evidence to be produced to such a tribunal will be able to be served out of the State or Territory of issue, by leave of that State or Territory's Supreme Court. Leave may only be granted where the court is satisfied that the evidence sought is relevant to the tribunal's functions and cannot reasonably be obtained from a person within the State or Territory. The Supreme Court will specify the date by which the subpoena must be served. A notice will be attached to the subpoena setting out the rights and obligations of the person to whom it is addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>Reasonable expenses of complying with the subpoena will have to be paid to the person subpoenaed. That obligation will be placed upon the State or Territory in which the tribunal is established. A person subpoenaed only to produce documents or things will be able to comply with the subpoena by delivering them to the secretary of the tribunal not less than 24 hours before the date for compliance. </PARA>
<PARA>Where a subpoena is addressed to a person in prison, the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the subpoena was issued will be able to order that the prisoner be taken interstate to give evidence. The State or Territory in which that order was made will be required to pay the expenses reasonably incurred in connection with compliance with the order. </PARA>
<PARA>I appreciate that there is a question whether the Commonwealth has power to legislate to provide for the service and execution of process of State tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has been advised that it has power to do so under section 51(xxiv) of the Constitution, which confers power with respect to ``the service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and the judgments of the courts of the States.''</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is expected to have no impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>I table the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator Tate) agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill and the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Bill be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day. </PARA>

<PARA> Referendum Options Description Sheet</PARA>
<PARA> The following brief descriptions of a model single member electorates system and a model proportional representation (Hare-Clark) system have been prepared to assist ACT electors to determine their preferred electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> MODEL SINGLE MEMBER ELECTORATES SYSTEM</PARA>
<PARA>* The ACT will be divided into 17 separate electorates. Each electorate will elect one member to the Legislative Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA>* No candidate will be allowed to stand in more than one electorate at a general election. </PARA>
<PARA>* The ballot paper used will look like this:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>[THE DIAGRAM IS OMITTED FROM THE DATABASE; SEE HARDCOPY PAGE 4260]</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>* Voting will take place in each electorate in accordance with the system of voting used to elect members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> - Instructions on the ballot paper will require voters to show preferences (1, 2 and so on) for all of the candidates standing in the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> - Candidates to be elected will have to receive a majority (ie 50% plus 1) of the formal votes in the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> - If no candidate has obtained a majority of votes after first preference votes have been counted, the candidate with the fewest votes will be excluded and his or her votes will be transferred to the remaining candidates who stood next highest in the relevant voters' preferences. </PARA>
<PARA> - This process of excluding candidates with the fewest votes will continue until one candidate has obtained a majority of the votes still in the count. </PARA>
<PARA>* If a member dies, or resigns, or otherwise vacates his or her seat, the vacancy will be filled by a by-election in his or her electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>* The boundaries of electorates will be drawn by bodies independent of the Commonwealth and ACT governments. The criteria which govern the drawing of the boundaries of House of Representatives divisions will apply as nearly as practicable to the drawing of the boundaries of Legislative Assembly electorates. </PARA>
<PARA>* A redrawing of boundaries should take place in the first 12 months after each general election of members of the Legislative Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA>MODEL PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION (HARE-CLARK) SYSTEM</PARA>
<PARA>* The ACT will be divided into 3 separate electorates, of which two will elect 5 members each, and one will elect 7 members, to the Legislative Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA>* No candidate will be allowed to stand in more than one electorate at a general election. </PARA>
<PARA>* The ballot paper used will look like this:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>[THE DIAGRAM IS OMITTED FROM THE DATABASE; SEE HARDCOPY PAGE 4261]</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>* The names of candidates within party groups will not be printed in the same position within the group on every ballot paper. Instead, a particular candidate's name will be printed at the top of the group on some ballot papers, in the second position within the group on other ballot papers and so on, so as to share out the positions. </PARA>
<PARA>* The same principle will apply to the printing of independent candidates' names in the column for independents on the ballot paper. </PARA>
<PARA>* Instructions on the ballot paper will require voters to show preferences (1, 2 and so on) for as many candidates as there are vacancies to be filled in the electorate concerned. Voters will have the option of showing as many further preferences as they wish. Seats will then be allocated to the candidates using the Hare-Clark system of proportional representation, as used at elections for the Tasmanian House of Assembly:</PARA>
<PARA> - Candidates will have to achieve a quota of votes in order to be elected. The quota will be determined by dividing the number of formal votes by 1 more than the number of vacancies to be filled, and adding 1 to the number so obtained (disregarding any remainder). </PARA>
<PARA> - If an elected candidate obtains surplus votes (ie votes in excess of the quota), the votes will be transferred to other candidates in the count. </PARA>
<PARA> - If vacancies remain to be filled after surplus votes have been transferred, the candidates standing lowest on the count will be excluded and their votes transferred to the remaining candidates who stood next highest in the relevant voters' preferences. </PARA>
<PARA> - This process of distributing the surplus votes of elected candidates and of excluding candidates will continue until all the vacancies have been filled. </PARA>
<PARA>* If a member dies, resigns, or otherwise vacates his or her seat, the vacancy will be filled by a fresh examination of the ballot papers bearing the votes which elected him or her, to determine which of the available candidates who failed to be elected was most preferred by the voters who chose the former member. </PARA>
<PARA>* The boundaries of electorate(s) will be drawn by bodies independent of the Commonwealth and ACT governments. The criteria which govern the drawing of the boundaries of House of Representatives divisions will apply as nearly as practicable to the drawing of the boundaries of Legislative Assembly electorates. </PARA>
<PARA>* A redrawing of boundaries should take place in the first 12 months after each general election of members of the Legislative Assembly. </PARA>

<PARA> At end of motion add ``, with the following amendment of the amendments recommended by the committee:</PARA>
<PARA> Government amendment no. 7, proposed subclause 31(3), omit ``on the same day as polling day for the next general election to be held'', substitute, ``as soon as practicable''. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts which was intended to resolve problems associated with the framing of amended legislation to bring about a new system of election under which the next Australian Capital Territory (ACT) election could be held. </PARA>
<PARA> In the opinion of the Australian Democrats the Committee was unable to resolve the problems that are associated with this legislation. Therefore, as far as we are concerned, it is not possible to endorse the Committee's report. Quite simply, that is because the legislation perpetuates the d'Hondt system. It is that d'Hondt system which demonstrated the shortcomings of the first ACT election. It is that d'Hondt system which has been discredited by the ACT electorate, political commentators and any number of political scientists and experts on the mechanics of electoral systems. Because of this unity of opposition to the d'Hondt system I am amazed to see that the Committee report offers little better than some cosmetic adjustments to that system. The fundamental flaws are not dealt with. The fundamental faults remain. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned during the second reading debate, the passing of this legislation would result in the costly creation of an interim system. It would also result in the conduct of a referendum which, it is now apparent, will not be binding upon the Government elected at that time. In other words, we could be designing an interim system which could be retained for subsequent elections. This is unlikely, but it is possible. Because of the concern that that is possible, I wrote to the Australian Electoral Commission as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Electoral Commissioner,</PARA>
<PARA>West Block,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Committee on Environment Recreation and the Arts tabled its report on the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has not proposed any fundamental changes to the existing ACT electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> I would appreciate your opinion regarding the desirability of conducting the next ACT election under the (essentially) d'Hondt system. By ``desirability'', I refer to the tallying convenience, the accuracy in reflecting voter intention and general efficiency of election processes which would occur in an election conducted under the proposed altered, modified d'Hondt system. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not seek your opinion regarding the perceived electoral advantage or disadvantage which might come to particular parties contesting the election. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also appreciate your advice regarding the suitability of any other electoral systems which may be available and appropriate to use in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope to be able to use your advice on these matters when the ACT (Electoral) Amendment Bill is discussed in the Senate in the very near future.</PARA>
<PARA>I received a reply which I would like to quote from extensively because I think it is pertinent to this Committee's consideration of the report. I received the reply on 30 May from the Electoral Commission with regard to my letter on 29 May. It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Bell</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 29 May 1991 in which you sought the Commission's ``opinion regarding the desirability of conducting the next ACT election under the (essentially) d'Hondt system'', and also asked for ``advice regarding the suitability of any other electoral systems which may be available and appropriate to use in the ACT''. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall first address the question of the suitability of the modified d'Hondt system for further use. While the proposal to hold a referendum on the appropriate voting system for the ACT should settle the issue in the long run, it is a matter of concern to us that as things stand at the moment, at least one and possibly more than one further election will be held under the ``modified d'Hondt'' system. The Commission has consistently taken the view that the modified d'Hondt system has been demonstrated both by theoretical analysis and practical experience to be fatally flawed, and that it should not be used again. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill currently before the Senate, the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill 1991, flows from the Government's consideration of Report Number 5 of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (``Inquiry into the ACT Election and Electoral System''), which was issued in November 1989. That Committee's inquiry was undertaken as a result of the very high level of dissatisfaction which had been expressed regarding the modified d'Hondt system. The defects of that system, which were documented in detail in our Submission to the Joint Standing Committee, include the following:</PARA>
<PARA> It accepts certain votes as formal even when the markings placed on the ballot paper by the voter are ambiguous or contradictory. </PARA>
<PARA> It distorts preferences expressed by the voters, attributes to voters preferences which they did not in fact express, and enhances the relative influence of some electors' votes for no good reason. </PARA>
<PARA> It arbitrarily excludes from the count candidates who and parties which receive less than 5.55 per cent of the vote. The rationale for this exclusion process has never been clear. At the 1989 election, it caused the exclusion at the outset of the scrutiny of the candidate who polled the second highest number of first preference votes given for individual candidates rather than parties, and had a major influence on the current composition of the Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA>* It offers electors an inducement to vote `strategically', indicating preferences other than those they truly hold. </PARA>
<PARA>* It is literally impossible to find out from the public record what purpose is meant to be served by the last 3 stages of the scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>* The system is complex, is not based on any well-defined principles of electoral justice, and consequently is understood by hardly anyone at all. </PARA>
<PARA>* Because of the inordinate complexity of the system, the scrutiny takes an unacceptably long time to complete. </PARA>
<PARA>* The legitimacy of the Assembly has been diminished by the general recognition that its members were chosen using a defective voting system. </PARA>
<PARA>Taking all these factors into account, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters agreed with the Commission's view that the modified d'Hondt system was fundamentally defective and should be replaced. It should be emphasised that the defects of the modified d'Hondt system as set out above will not be corrected by the minor changes to the system contained in the Bill currently before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Concerning possible alternatives to modified d'Hondt: the Commission has consistently argued that one workable and defensible option would be the replacement of the modified d'Hondt system with a slightly altered version of the voting system used at Senate elections. In our Submission on the issue to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, we put forward a number of alterations for consideration. They were proposed in the context of a search for a voting system which could be adopted permanently for ACT elections. In the context of a search for a system which would only have to apply pending the introduction of legislation to give effect to the result of the proposed voting systems referendum, we would see one of those alterations as highly desirable: optional preferential voting ought to be allowed `below the line', so that if there were a large field of candidates, persons who wished to vote for individual candidates would not be required to number from 1 to around 117 (the number of candidates in 1989). The widely adopted approach of requiring voters to show as many preferences as there were vacancies to be filled, ie 17, could be followed. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a system could be expected to produce results very much more quickly than modified d'Hondt, and would do so in a way which would be more likely to be accepted by the voters as producing a legitimate Assembly. The shortening of the scrutiny would not only allow the Assembly to resume its work more quickly after the next election, but would also decrease a burden on ACT taxpayers, since section 27 (1) of the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988 provides that staff employed by the Commission for the purposes of the next election are to be taken to be employed on behalf of the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Taking into account the extent to which the defects of the modified d'Hondt system have been documented by successive inquiries, we are not aware of any worthwhile argument that could be used to dispute the proposition that a Senate-based interim voting system for the ACT would serve the people of the Territory better than modified d'Hondt. It is our considered opinion that the necessary amendments to legislation to provide for such an interim system could be drafted quickly and easily. </PARA>
<PARA>I was horrified when I received that letter because it had been for some time that this whole process had been before committees, committees of inquiries and this chamber and it had been for some time that this whole matter had been discussed in the press, yet we have no evidence that those who first initiated this legislation and those who were attempting to improve this legislation-any of those people, parties or representatives-in any way, shape or form had contacted the Australian Electoral Commission for its opinion on this whole matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I was dismayed to find out that the expert opinions and the guidance of the Electoral Commission had neither been sought nor asked for in any way. Because of that we now have a Committee report which is lacking because it has a vacuum where there should be this wisdom which can be provided by our Electoral Commission. That wisdom is well founded. That wisdom should be taken into account but it will not be by what we have proposed in front of us. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can do, because I have already expressed my dissatisfaction with the Bill and the proposed amendments, is to offer an amendment which has been circulated in my name. It is an amendment which asks that we at least get cracking and introduce the referendum as soon as practicable. Apart from that, I side with the advice that has been given to us by the Electoral Commission and express my disgust that we have not taken any account of it in the proceedings so far. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is that? I would not want to be sinister and suggest that it might be that the proposed system might actually work, that the ACT Government might want to keep it and, by keeping it, that there would be absolutely no possibility of single member electorates. It seems to be a plain fact that the Electoral Commission has suggested that this might work. If that is the case, the opportunity for the proponents of single member electorates has been lost. I hope that that is not so, but it seems that this advice has been neither sought nor revealed. The losers are the electors of the ACT. Having exposed it here, perhaps they will express their disgust, as I have tried to do, with a system that has been demonstrated in theory and in practice to be totally useless in meeting the needs of the electors. I cannot endorse the passage of that system. I would hope at least that some cognition would be given to the amendment circulated in my name but then hope is pretty faint indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government believes that, despite Senator Bell's comment, it is discharging its duty to the people of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) in providing for a democratic electoral system. It is unfortunate that not all the weight and attractiveness has been recognised in the Hare-Clark system, which Senator Bell and I would recognise as being worthy of some consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do believe that the Government, in making amendments to the d'Hondt system, has offered the Committee an opportunity to bring about a situation where most of the objectionable features of the first election held under that general system can be eliminated. It was an absolute disgrace that some 117 candidates standing for the 1989 election created such a difficulty with the count that nine weeks was taken up in completing the count. That is totally unacceptable. So a new system staged--</PARA>

In that way much of the very adverse commentary which was attracted to the electoral system in the ACT will be dissipated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other points in the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill 1991 quite apart from the question of the actual foundation of the proportional representation system to be adopted, which will assist in assuring that the next election to be held in the ACT is of a more serious kind, if I can put it that way as an outsider looking in. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that some steps had to be taken to discourage some of the less serious candidates, the more frivolous groupings, from confusing electors and adding to the difficulty of the voting and counting processes. For that reason a deposit of $250 is to be required in order to discourage those who are not really serious about putting their names forward from so doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government is discharging its responsibility in a way which, after this election, will allow the ACT Assembly to conduct the electoral affairs of this Territory without the necessity of this Parliament being involved in the setting up of an appropriate electoral system responsive to the needs of the Assembly and for which the Assembly would take responsibility to the electorate. I think everyone in this Parliament looks forward to the transfer of that responsibility and the discharge of it by the ACT Assembly. In the meantime, I commend the Bill to the chamber and hope that it has passage before the dinner hour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not be opposing the amendment, but there are a few things that need to be put on the record. Firstly, when the former Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) introduced the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill in the lower House, he gave no explanation as to why the amendment was being moved in any way, shape or form. On inquiring from the Minister's office as to the reason for the amendment, it was described by his office as being a simple drafting error identified by the working party on the Patents Act. By inserting the phrase `and the regulations', new section 233(1) will read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Subject to this Chapter and the regulations, this Act applies in relation to a standard patent or a petty patent granted under the 1952 Act as if the patent had been granted under this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>This is creating a Henry VIII clause which is, of course, a practice which is universally condemned. At the third conference of Australian delegated legislation committees held in Perth only a week ago, a motion which I actually proposed in the workshop and which was subsequently adopted by the plenary session was worded in this way:</PARA>
<PARA>While noting that there may be a rare, justifiable use of a Henry VIII clause where such use would be subject to tabling and disallowance, this Conference believes that Henry VIII clauses have no legitimate general application in the legislative process. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of introducing that phrase and the regulations is to give to the Executive the power to make regulations to actually change the provisions of the transitional and savings provisions contained in the Patents Act. The Minister has chosen to move an amendment to the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 to effect the amendment to the Patents Act because this Bill is an omnibus Bill and there is a schedule at the back of the Bill which contains amendments to the Patents Act. The amendment to that schedule, so as to effect the amendment to the Patents Act, in effect uses the Henry VIII clause technique. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to this because I do not think it is acceptable for a Minister to introduce an amendment, which may well be justifiable in the rare case that I mentioned in the motion that was passed in Perth, without explaining to the Parliament why a particular technique is being used and the effect of it. This is because chapter 23 of the Patents Act, the transitional and savings provisions, is a grandfathering operation; but by giving the power to make regulations in this way, the provisions of that chapter may be altered. However, they would be subject to tabling and disallowance. So, although the Opposition will not be opposing the amendment, I do think it is important to place on the record the fact that the Minister did not do the House of Representatives the courtesy of saying why this particular amendment was being moved. Mr McGauran, in the other place, noted that no explanation was given. No explanation has been given here, and I think that that ought to have been done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of Bills before the Senate tonight purports to offer a new start to those currently languishing in the dole queues. Instead, it offers little more than a false dawn, an expensive distraction from the main game and a clear straight sets win for the bureaucrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991 forms the centrepiece for the Government's so-called active employment strategy. As such, it is a major disappointment. It is necessary to strip away the complex array of administrative procedures to arise from this Bill in order that the proposals can be seen for what they are: an active employment strategy for more public servants, but offering little hope for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Six hundred new full time positions have been created within the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) to carry out some of the so-called initiatives contained in this Bill. Surely more intensive use of existing CES capacity would have been more appropriate than a wholesale expansion of an organisation very few Australians have a great deal of confidence in. Better still, there would have been an increase in the use of private employment placement agencies. This Bill does little to provide the unemployed with a more appropriate set of incentives to undertake more effective job search activity. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) said recently:</PARA>
<PARA>If you've got an unemployment benefit which is simply there as a right that anyone can access for as long as they like on very generous conditions, is it really helping them much? Sure they're getting income support but is it really equipping them . . . to get back into the labour market?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dawkins is absolutely right. They are fine words, but unfortunately the measures contained in this Bill do not go any distance at all to giving proper effect to that aspiration. Paying unemployment benefit ad infinitum does not encourage an early return to work; it simply promotes a disastrous cycle of welfare dependency. For many, such assistance has become a substitute for paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA> In very few other developed countries are such benefits paid on an ongoing, open-ended basis. In the United States, for example, unemployment benefit is typically paid for a maximum of 26 weeks, with the possibility of a further 13 or 26 weeks if the particular state's unemployment level is above a specified minimum. In West Germany the benefit is paid for maximum periods of 16, 20 and 24 months, depending on the age of the applicant. In the United Kingdom unemployment benefit ceases after 10 months. In France unemployment assistance is paid for a maximum period ranging from three of the last 12 months to 24 months of the last 36, depending on age. Even in the classic welfare state of Sweden the maximum period of assistance ranges from 300 to 450 days, again depending on age. </PARA>
<PARA> So there we have most of the developed world providing a cap on the length of time unemployment benefits are payable. Yet here is Australia with currently more than 40,000 people who have been on the dole for five years or more, and a package of so-called reforms which does little to ensure that such appalling instances are ended. </PARA>
<PARA> A lecturer dismissed from the University of Newcastle some 10 years ago has since been on the dole. In a recent court case relating to his dismissal, the judge said that the former lecturer had made no genuine attempt to mitigate his damages by finding other employment, that many of his job applications had been made to Newcastle University, which obviously would not reappoint him, and that he had `engaged in nothing more or less than a charade'? Why is it that this man was able to receive unemployment benefits for over 10 years without making any serious attempt to find work, but merely going through the motions of fulfilling the work test? Why is it that under the so-called active employment strategy, as embodied in the Bill before us today, there is no guarantee that such appalling abuses would not continue?</PARA>
<PARA> One does not have to be very much in touch with the system to know that there is simply a nominal requirement to put down the names of a couple of people with whom one claims to have been in contact. Indeed, that farce which has served both the unemployed and the taxpayers so badly for so long is not addressed in this Bill and presumably will therefore be allowed to continue. The latest justification for that is that it is a matter that will be picked up in due course if there is any centralised concern either through the tax file number or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that one does not have to have been in the system for very long to know that all one needs to do is pick a couple of names out of the phone book. Indeed, I have received many complaints from people who are being rung up by applicants who are not interested in finding work, but who simply want to use these people's names to fulfil the minimum requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike Senator Richardson, caught in a sad downward spiral of pandering to one group of special pleaders after another, the coalition is willing to make the hard decisions. We are committed to ending unemployment benefits after nine months, after which time special benefits will be payable in cases of undue hardship and where employment has not been found despite serious job search. Such a policy is not out of step with international thinking, nor is it out of step with the attitude in the electorate. It reflects the view that prolonged, let alone indefinite, welfare dependency is not in anyone's best interests. The sooner people are back in touch with the labour market, the better their chances of establishing new careers. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill does very little for those who have been unemployed for less than 12 months. For these people it will be business as usual. How can we call this an active employment strategy when we are waiting for someone to join the ranks of the long term unemployed before they are given any assistance? Why wait until the problem has eventuated? Surely a program of earlier intervention is far preferable. To this end, the coalition intends legislating to ensure that after six months of being on the Job Search allowance, an unemployed person's entitlements are reviewed, and so also is that person's whole job search strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a mandatory requirement for attendance at an interview and participation in a counselling session which will explore the available options as well as stressing the nine-month cut-off date. Rather than leaving the person out in the cold for an entire year, the coalition intends to do something for the unemployed. But this is not the end of the problems we have here with what purports to be an active employment strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> This package of reforms also features a disturbing over-reliance on government training programs. Fifty thousand extra places in such programs are to be created at a cost of $227m up to 1993-94 and this is in addition to the extra $105m announced in the March industry statement. The 50,000 places is small beer compared with the number of Australians displaced by Mr Keating's engineered recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past year, more than 144,000 jobs have been wiped out; an extra 319,300 Australians have become unemployed and an additional 222,473 are on the dole. But what are the 844,000 unemployed being offered by this Labor Government in return for such catastrophic job losses-50,000 places in bureaucrat-intensive government programs over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the recent headline in the Northern Territory News, `Aborigines want jobs, not training' the same can be said for most other unemployed Australians sick of going around on the training roundabout with no jobs in sight. Not only do many of these training programs amount to little more than a very expensive means of keeping the unemployed amused while sitting on the sidelines, but also their content is highly questionable. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the Newstart program-as opposed to the allowance-for those who have been on benefits for 12 months or more. Featuring so-called counselling and a show bag of glossy pamphlets telling one how to find a job, the program is little more than an insult to the long term unemployed who have presumably already spent the past 12 months doing the rounds of the bureaucracy. These people want jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> An Australian National University academic, Dr Bruce Chapman, suggested in a recent paper that much of the expenditure on government vocational training is wasted unless training is followed fairly quickly by a job. So what do we have in the midst of the most serious downturn since the Great Depression-the Government throwing even more money at training people who will not have the opportunity to put into practice what they have been taught. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of trying to get people into the workplace as quickly as possible, the Government prefers to keep them out of the work force for as long as possible. The only real winners in this orgy of government labour market programs will, as usual, be the recession-proof public sector. It is time for a real solution-labour market reform. It is time for a system of trainee wages to provide the unemployed with real jobs and real training opportunities, rather than enduring the slap in the face of yet another training program leading nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government simply does not have a true active employment strategy. What it has is a farce. The current strategy provides for the active employment of bureaucrats and little else. It is a waste, a sham and a set of lost opportunities. Apart from assessing this Bill in the context of the current job climate, it is also important to measure it up against where we are heading. </PARA>
<PARA> The coming few years will be a very rough period for employment. One in 10 Australian workers are currently unemployed and this proportion is rising. Even the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) concedes that the figure will exceed 10.75 per cent-the highest in 60 years. Imagine where we would be without the recent dramatic increases in school retention rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment will rise much further, possibly to stabilise in the medium term at around 12 per cent. This possibly has become even more real, given yesterday's news of yet another decline in the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group job vacancy survey-this time of the order of 6 per cent. On top of this, world capital markets are drying up. This is likely to lead to a rise in world interest rates in the near future, increasing the likelihood of a prolonged world recession. Just as the Australian economy begins to improve with declines in domestic interest rates, it is probable that Australia will be caught up in an exacerbated world downturn. Within the next two years, Australian unemployment may scale new heights, perhaps reaching as high as 13 or 14 per cent. Dr Hewson's prediction of a rolling recession will then become a reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Given current policy settings and the Government's policy paralysis, the consequences for employment of a rolling recession will be terrible. With the economy hitting new depths with each successive downswing, unemployment will ratchet higher and higher. The upward spiral of unemployment could be averted, at least in part, if the industrial relations and wages systems were made more flexible at the individual firm level and if the Government cut loose from its anachronistic security blanket-the accord-which is all about protecting those lucky enough to still be in the game. </PARA>
<PARA> If such a package of comprehensive labour market reforms is not put in place, the Government's active employment strategy will be absolutely worthless, with millions of dollars of public funds being squandered. There is no point in pushing the unemployed through government training schemes if new skills cannot be tried and tested and there is no point in forcing the unemployed to chase nonexistent jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more surprising features of this Bill is the Government's intention to make eligibility for the Newstart allowance contingent upon having been registered with the CES as unemployed for 12 months. With the Newstart allowance comes prioritised access to labour market programs and CES counselling, all with the aim of providing specialised assistance to the long term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, given the deliberate laxity with which the CES maintains its books, it will be possible for someone to register as unemployed with the CES, either find work or drop out of the labour market altogether and then almost 12 months down the track, receive Job Search allowance and then go on to the Newstart allowance, not because the individual is long term unemployed, but merely because the CES has recorded the person as having been unemployed for 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a scheme is quite likely considering that the CES has over 200,000 more people recorded as unemployed than the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Indeed, the Government has, on numerous occasions, admitted to the total hopelessness of CES unemployment duration figures. On 15 April 1991, in answer to a question on notice the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) said that CES unemployment figures include:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . many who no longer require . . . assistance. It is certainly not a measure of the number of people `actively seeking employment.'</PARA>
<PARA>On 16 May 1991 an even more eminent source, Senator McMullan, told the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . people can be registered with the CES and they certainly have no obligation to, and do not necessarily, remove themselves from the register when work is found or they move interstate or whatever. It is not a priority of the CES at this time to keep those records precisely accurate. </PARA>
<PARA>What a damning indictment. The number of people registered as unemployed at a CES office is one of the variables used to allocate staff among CES offices-so the higher the unemployment registrations at any given time, the higher the staff allocation. So herein lies the CES manager's incentive not to purge the office books of formerly unemployed individuals no longer requiring assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are the CES unemployment figures hopelessly unreliable, but also the CES actually has an incentive to inflate them artificially. It will be a priority of an incoming coalition government to overhaul radically this cumbersome and ineffective bureaucracy. This Bill will lead to many of the long term unemployed missing out on prioritised assistance and many short term unemployed receiving extra and special assistance because of legislative sloppiness. The result: poor targeting and more waste. Senator Richardson has, in recent days, been trumpeting the idea that in recent years social security has become more targeted. He recently told the Age newspaper:</PARA>
<PARA>There is also room for efficiency gains, there is also room for some more targeting, but I think we've done so much in the last few years that I have no rabbits up my sleeve. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet another blatant and outrageous political ambit claim which has, of course, been slapped down by other senior Ministers in recent days. Yet here we have Senator Richardson presenting a Bill which has massive targeting problems. Peter Baldwin has told him so, Senator McMullan has told him so and I dare say the bureaucracy has advised him so, but all of that advice is to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA> To target assistance more tightly to those who need it most and to ensure that the millions of dollars the Government intends throwing at such assistance at least has a chance of being of some use, the coalition intends moving an amendment to ensure that the Bill will not end up being the farce it currently is. Let there be no doubt that the CES is a sluggish organisation-the overweight offspring of the lumbering dinosaur that is the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET). Under the new government-a coalition government-it is doubtful whether it can survive in its present form. A recent Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls-DEET survey on community attitudes to DEET programs and policies found that only 12 per cent of people surveyed nominated the CES as the main way in which the Federal Government assisted the young unemployed. Clearly, this is not due to low recognition factors-nearly everyone has heard of the CES. Rather, it is evidence of the low regard that those surveyed have for the quality of the services the CES purports to provide. </PARA>
<PARA> The absurdity of the current duplication of functions, with both the Department of Social Security and CES dealing with different aspects of unemployment, is that during times of prosperity there is a much greater demand for CES services than for those of DSS and during times of adversity this situation is reversed. In other words, at any given time one or other service is clearly under-utilised-a massive waste of government resources and a situation which must be redressed urgently. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government professes to be trying to bring the two services together. Indeed, we have a policy of collocation which, on the latest figures, supposedly shows that some 62 per cent of officers are collocated. There is no reason at all why there could not be full integration, other than of course the potential for job losses and no doubt the political odium that would be attached to that-particularly for those who depend on the Public Service and Public Service unions to be re-elected, as do members and senators for the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is quite clear that the Government will go slow in this, as in many other areas, when all the logic of the argument demands that there ought to be full integration, full cohesion and joint interviewing on the same premise; that is that people should not be shuffled from one service to another, quite often now knowing where to start first, let alone not knowing where to come out at the end. What we have here is not an active employment strategy. It is a piecemeal, poorly conceived and unimaginative strategy for waste and lost opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> By comparison, the coalition will put in place a set of integrated and holistic policies which will ensure that income support need not be passive. More effective job search on the part of the unemployed will be ensured as will more job opportunities for the unemployed. Industrial relations and wages reform; the introduction of a goods and services tax in place of the antiquated and distortionary wholesale sales tax system to reduce taxes on exports and raise general efficiency; the reform of the Reserve Bank of Australia to ensure that it pursues price stability so that workers become less concerned over the distributional struggle as prices rise, and more concerned with productivity enhancement; and a whole series of micro-economic reforms, including privatisation, will ensure an expanding economy in which active income support, rather than passive income support, to the unemployed, will quickly become a reality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating three Bills cognately tonight and I wish to deal with each of them separately. Firstly, the Social Security (Rewrite) Transition Bill 1991 makes no policy changes. It is simply to ensure transition from the Social Security Act 1947 to the new plain-English Act of this year. I do not want to go through this Bill in any detail. It is relatively straightforward and I take this opportunity to commend again those people who were involved with the drafting of the plainEnglish version. It has certainly introduced a far more accessible piece of legislation. The Australian Democrats support this Bill and will not be moving any amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 implements minor Government initiatives and amends the 1947 Act. Legislation yet to come before the Senate will ensure that these provisions are included in the new Act when the 1947 Act is repealed on 1 July this year. It is fair to say that these initiatives are generally not of concern and, in most instances, actually benefit the clients of the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I do not wish to go through it in detail, but I want to look at two clauses-clauses 8 and 19. Clause 8 alters the Act so that scholarship payments awarded outside Australia for the purposes of education and training approved by the Minister do not count as income for the purpose of the income test for pensions, benefits and allowances. This change appears to have come about primarily as a consequence of the Mary Guy case in Tasmania where Ms Guy would have had her invalid pension reduced significantly if she had accepted a scholarship from overseas. The clause has a retrospective element effective on 1 September, but this is mainly to ensure that Ms Guy is covered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has indicated its dissatisfaction with the clause, calling it an example of legislation by press release and it says that it does not come within the limits which the Committee has been prepared to accept in the past. The Democrats also have some problems with retrospective legislation, but consider that in this case it is desirable. It is an example of a very benign case of retrospectivity. It certainly will not disadvantage anyone-in fact, it remedies what is a very unjust situation. It will benefit only a small number of pensioners and beneficiaries who would otherwise have been seriously disadvantaged and it has minimal financial consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 19 removes from review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal a decision made by the Minister under section 251(1B) of the Act to give directions to the Secretary relating to the latter's power to waive a debt due to the Commonwealth resulting from an overpayment. Again, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has expressed concern at this removal of the power to review and it noted that such a decision was also not disallowable. Section 251(1C) requires the Minister to lay any such decisions before Parliament, but there is no provision for either House to disallow the decision. There has been considerable concern expressed about 251(1C) for quite some time. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs stated in its report on Debt Recovery under the Social Security Act and the Veterans Entitlements Act as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>If such instruments as the directions in s251 are legislative or even quasi-prescriptive in character, then they should be subject not only to tabling but also to disallowance. The purpose of this is to preserve the primacy of Parliament in the law-making process. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes that Directions under s251 are clearly legislative, particularly as the Explanatory Memorandum states they are intended to bind the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response to the Committee's recommendations was totally unsatisfactory. In fact, this legislation worsens the position. The Democrats will be opposing this clause and moving an amendment to permit ministerial determinations under section 251 to be disallowable by either House of Parliament within 15 days of their being tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now move to the major piece of legislation that we are dealing with tonight, which is the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991. The effect of this is to abolish unemployment benefits as of 1 July this year and replace it with a two-tier system. It was originally announced in 1990 in a February economic statement and was originally called the active employment strategy. It was, however, renamed Newstart after market research indicated an understandable public cynicism with the name. Perhaps the Australian people found the name a trifle ironic in view of the Government's pursuit of an active unemployment strategy in this recession that we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme is founded on a 1988 social security review by Professor Bettina Cass entitled Income Support for the Unemployed in Australia: Towards a More Active System. It supposedly represents a much closer linking of income support with labour market programs. Its ostensible aims are: to develop a climate of individual support and planning for the unemployed to hasten their return to the work force; to provide greater assistance to the long term unemployed; and to enhance the skills and job prospects of unemployed people with labour market disadvantages and those at risk of long term unemployment. All these aims sound wonderful and are laudable and they are all being trumpeted by the Government from the rooftops. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is offering this as something positive, but these aims do not stand up under scrutiny. Make no mistake-this program will cost the Government votes at the next election because the people whom it will affect worst, the ones who will be severely disadvantaged, are the traditional supporters of the Labor Party. They are the ones most likely to suffer from it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look briefly at how the new scheme works. Firstly, the job search allowance (JSA) is what people move directly on to once they have become unemployed. It lasts for 12 months, but after 3 months an activity test comes into place-the same as the one that is in place now. The unemployed must actively seek paid work and be willing to undertake such work if the secretary, that is, the departmental officer, deems it to be suitable. They must comply with any direction from the Department of Social Security (DSS) requiring them to undertake vocational training courses or participate in a labour market program. In fact, they must take all reasonable steps to get a job and comply with any direction at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployed have to attend at least two compulsory interviews with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) and the DSS. About 10 per cent of JSA recipients will also be required to attend an intensive interview with DSS after three months. Further interviews may also be required of them with the CES. After 12 months, they drop off this system. Here no doubt we will see the first few people who will contribute to the Government saving money because some people will be neither able to follow nor understand how to follow the procedure to reapply for the Newstart scheme, and to make a fresh application on a new set of forms. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the activity test, which still stays, the unemployed also have to get into what is called a Newstart activity agreement. This is done not with the DSS but with the CES. Compliance with this agreement is a condition of continuing to receive the allowance. The CES will now be able to initiate the cancellation of payment where unemployed people fail to meet the terms of this agreement. There is a three-week period in which all the paper work must be done and the application must be made. Indeed, if it is not made, people can be cut off and will need to know that they must appeal. That appeal must be lodged within 14 days to restore them without any loss of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I have three major problems with this Bill. Firstly, the Democrats object to the compulsion. Secondly, the content of the agreement is vague. It is not specifically written down, certainly not in any legislative form. It is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny or legislative control. The actual courses that will be made available are the third major complaint and concern. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases the courses will be worth while but they are compulsory and will benefit fewer people than would have been the case had the university, technical and further education systems, as well as private courses available, been opened up and unemployed people given the option of attending the course most suited to their needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look firstly at the content of the agreement and the fact that it is so vague. It is controlled by the discretion and subjective judgment of CES staff. I do not want to in any way criticise CES staff. They are also seeking direction and assistance with the implementation of this legislation. I will give an example of that later. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is so vague that the Government could force people to do virtually anything. It is all very well for the Minister to say that he will not require anything unreasonable. But we then need to ask why the word `reasonable' is missing from this piece of legislation. It is in the new plain English version. Perhaps we thought it may have simply been taken out from here on, but that is not so. The Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill 1991, the next Bill we will be dealing with in a week or so, arrived on my desk today. The word `reasonable' has reappeared, and I only had to go as far as page 9. Why is the word `reasonable' missing from this Bill?</PARA>
<PARA> Despite its initial assertions to the contrary, the Government has had to admit that one item-606(1) (e)-could have been used to implement immediately work for the dole. I am very pleased to see that this has now been amended, thanks to the pressure from Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS). But still the criteria are very broad, open ended and not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. In fact, originally the contents were not subject to appeal, but the Minister has again recognised an unjust situation and again thanks to ACOSS and its lobbying, we now have that situation remedied. </PARA>
<PARA> Still there is no reciprocal obligation upon the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) to actually provide the services that are supposed to be available. It is extraordinary that the unemployed can be compelled to undertake certain activities when there is absolutely no reciprocal obligation on the Government to provide the services mentioned in the agreement. It rather makes a mockery of the word `agreement'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at why the agreement is needed. As I have already said, the unemployed are required to meet the activity test. DSS can already terminate payments if a person refuses to take up a job, to do a course or, indeed, even if he or she misses a letter and does not show for an interview with no reason. The unemployed already have to participate in market programs or any other course. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does the Government need more? What does it propose to compel the unemployed to do? We do not really know because those regulations will not be put before us. There are already major problems with the types of courses people are compelled to do. I want to read one example tonight from a number of letters I have received. This is from a gentleman, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>I am thirty years of age this year. I have a BA (Hons) and have completed four years of a Ph.D. I suspended my studies in order to take up employment in 1986. I worked as a Researcher/Organiser for a student union for three years, until my contract expired and I lost my job. Thus, as a relatively young person, with a good education, and flexible job skills, I anticipated only short-term unemployment. However, when it became clear that it was likely to be long term, I considered further studies. </PARA>
<PARA>I considered two options. Firstly, completing my Ph.D. However, I would be ineligible for a scholarship or AUSTUDY and would have to lose my unemployment benefits if I enrolled full-time. </PARA>
<PARA>The second option was to enrol in a short-term course, in order to develop specific skills which would enhance my chances of re-employment. For example, a number of advertised project officer jobs required a diploma in strategic planning. Other options included a computing course or a diploma of education. However, here too, I would be ineligible for AUSTUDY, would have to lose my unemployment benefits and, in some cases, would have to pay fees. These conditions rule out any retraining I might consider. </PARA>
<PARA>Then, to add insult to injury, on Sunday last week, I saw the Employment Minister in an interview saying that people who are unemployed are being paid by the Government, so the Government should expect something in return-namely, that they undergo compulsory retraining. Compulsory? I have not even been allowed to undertake voluntary retraining!</PARA>
<PARA>And, to further illustrate this farce, a few weeks ago I received a letter from the CES ``inviting'' me to attend an information session at a local employment centre. However, if I did not accept the invitation I would lose my unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The course, run by the Adelaide Central Mission was a useful and highly commendable one, however, it was of no use to me, being an eight weeks basic office skills course, teaching skills I already possessed. So, on the one hand we have an educational and social security system which prevents me from attending courses which might enhance my employment opportunities. On the other hand, I am forced to attend sessions which are of no use to me whatsoever. And, at the same time, we have a Minister who pontificates on the duties of the unemployed regarding retraining, as if we are a bunch of bludgers desperately trying to avoid education. </PARA>
<PARA>As this indicates, the current system of unemployment payments is not, as the Government and the Opposition like to imply, a passive system. There are already rigorously enforced and very difficult conditions. We need to ask: why is the Government screwing it down tighter and tighter, particularly in the current climate? How can it possibly be of any benefit to the unemployed?</PARA>
<PARA> It can be clearly demonstrated by the jobs, education and training (JET) scheme for sole parents that it is possible to run a successful scheme voluntarily, without compulsion. Here, large numbers of unemployed people participate and participate very willingly. In fact, the JET programs are generally full, to the point of being oversubscribed. People do want to work, to study and to volunteer. The Government needs to get its house in order and ensure that these opportunities are provided before it starts forcing people into activities unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA> As one CES worker told me, the fundamental problem with the active employment strategy is that it is all sticks and no carrots. Where are the jobs once the people finish their courses? Here I must agree with Senator Alston. It is being implied that once these people complete these courses they are somehow suddenly employable and the jobs will be there. But the jobs will not be there. For many people, it is simply a further imposition and a further very disheartening and soul-destroying activity. But members of the Government recognise this. To illustrate this, I want to quote very briefly from a speech made by former Minister Stewart West, recorded in the Hansard of 9 May 1991 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> It cannot be denied that the underlying strategy of income assistance being linked with training and tougher compliance type measures was designed for completely different labour market conditions from those which now exist in this country. To make it brutally clear, what we are proposing is not a strategy for the here and now; it was devised in early 1990 when different economic conditions prevailed. At best, it is now a strategy for the future. It may help to produce better trained people for future jobs, but it is not a strategy for the current economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia is currently experiencing a significant decline in job growth. Already this year, we have seen in March the worst one-month job losses on record since the Australian Bureau of Statistics began keeping records in 1978. The official unemployment level reached 9.9 per cent in April, and we suspect that the real or hidden level of unemployed is closer to 15 per cent. The conservative prediction of the former Treasurer was a rise to around 10 1/2 per cent within a few months, and it seems more likely that the official figure will be closer to 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely it is clear that it is the lack of jobs that is causing unemployment, not a shortage of labour market programs and certainly not the attitudes of the unemployed people themselves. Perhaps the worst feature of all of this Government's program is that it is pandering to the views of those in the community who believe that we do not need to worry about the unemployed because it is all their fault. One sees letters to the editor in the newspapers and occasionally I get a letter across my desk saying, `Yes, we should cut off all benefits and not support them at all because it is all their fault'. Why do those people believe this? Often it is because they see the end result as being that lower government expenditure means that they pay lower taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to look at the practical problems. The infrastructure is simply not in place. It is not just the Democrats who are stating this over and over again; it is also ACOSS and the welfare rights centres. It also includes groups such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence which actually have to work with the unemployed and know how hard many people are going to be hit. But it is also the Public Sector Union (PSU), which faxed this document to me yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . members have nothing to offer the majority of long term unemployed in this climate and regard the compulsory nature of Newstart agreement as wasteful and unjust. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the people the Government is forcing to implement this program without any real direction at all. The membership have voted on and passed four motions. The second motion relates to the provision of additional staff and a claim for over 1,000 additional staff just to make this program work. We must remember that the CES will have 200,000 people on its doorstep after 1 July. The staff also want adequate training so that they can be fully qualified and capable of assisting these people. In particular, they are asking that the Government hold this off. The first motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA>This meeting of PSU members endorses those AES proposals which would increase the employment opportunities for our clients, but to ban any proposed activity testing regime which includes any compulsory contract/agreement as we feel that this would be an unnecessary and intrusive element of our service delivery to clients. Instead we support the development of a genuine client centred service which reflects real client needs.</PARA>
<PARA>A number of other people, including CES officers, have written and telephoned me to express their concerns. The first is the difficulties that people from non-English speaking backgrounds are going to experience. Will there be specialised staff to assist them? Secondly, what about young people with special needs-people with psychiatric problems such as schizophrenia who do not qualify for a invalid pension or disability allowance? The third concern relates to professional people, such as the one I mentioned earlier, who already have one or more tertiary qualifications. So much for a clever country!</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the significant and welcome injection of funds into labour market programs, there will still not be enough places to go around. It has been estimated that only about 19 per cent of unemployed people gained access to labour market programs in 1989-90. With increased funding, this number may rise to 25 per cent-that is, one in four-but what does the Government intend to compel the other 75 per cent to do? Some labour market programs have merit but most are short term and basic and offer low skills training in areas where frequently there has already been a great loss of jobs and where there are certainly reduced opportunities for employment. There are no positions available as apprentices, in trade courses or in technical courses and, most important of all, there are no jobs available at the end of these courses. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look now at the human rights angle. There are also serious philosophical problems which go to the heart of the sort of society we want this country to be. Article 25 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights signed in 1948 states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services and the right to security in the event of unemployment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I go on to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Article 6(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA>The State Parties to the present Covenant recognise the right to work, which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely chooses or accepts, and will take appropriate steps to safeguard this right. It is interesting that some people in this place can get very concerned about human rights and international obligations when it comes to political advertising, and other people can get very concerned about rights for specific groups such as the charter of residents' rights and responsibilities in approved hostels and nursing homes which passed through this place last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, these are both very important issues and people have legitimate concerns, but where are the concerns now for people who are unemployed? It is an accepted view that citizenship confers a right to adequate income to fulfil basic needs. The Brotherhood of St Laurence has commented that:</PARA>
<PARA>Adequate income security . . . is a recognition of the fact that inability to obtain work is a function of economic, social and political forces in a changing society and is not the fault of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment exists because of economic and structural forces. It has been some time since the Federal Government has operated from a full employment policy. There is now an acceptance that some level of unemployment will persist. We will not suddenly recover from a situation of 10 per cent unemployment. In fact, it is most likely that we will still have around 5 per cent unemployment at the turn of the century. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we do in this climate? We introduce contractual obligations upon the unemployed without a corresponding commitment on the part of government at least to attempt to create more employment, provide adequate resources for the strategy and develop improved opportunities for paid work experience in labour market programs. This is certainly basically putting the blame back on the unemployed for circumstances which are obviously beyond their control. It is nonsensical, irresponsible and divisive to perpetrate the myth that the unemployed are without jobs because they cannot be bothered to look for them. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation represents a fundamental shift away from the concept of the unemployment benefit as an entitlement and a compensation payment from the community for the inability of the labour market to provide adequate income through employment. This strategy certainly reverses the concept of unemployment benefit as an entitlement. Again, I would suggest that this is something that the community needs to look at very carefully and to understand the ramifications of. Make no mistake, the legislation will not reduce unemployment; it will not suddenly mean that lots of people, for genuine reasons, are no longer in need of support payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at income support generally. Looking at waiting periods, the Executive Director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, Bishop Michael Challen, observes that many of the 4,809 people receiving material aid from the Brotherhood in the first three months of this year were doing so because they were waiting to qualify for social security payments or because the payments they were receiving were insufficient to pay for their rent, food and clothing. There is another myth that somehow these benefits are of such a luxury standard that nobody need bother, nobody need worry, about finding employment because that person is on such a good thing. Let us also be clear-I refer here to some information that Senator Alston gave us-that we do not need to cut off totally the unemployed who have been on a benefit for nine months, which the Opposition's amendments to be moved tonight or tomorrow would effectively do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stress to Senator Walters that if these amendments were passed now, without anything else in place-any of the special benefits that the Opposition has talked about-they would mean nothing was available. We have been through them very carefully with several sets of legal advice. We wish we could have supported the Opposition. We also agree that the Newstart program is effectively a waste of time, and that the labour market programs and the additional CES programs can be accessed without compulsion. If the amendments were passed, people would be cut off any benefit altogether after nine months. I wish to read the comments of a couple of other people, particularly Bettina Cass. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Bettina Cass is the professor of social policy at the University of Sydney and the author of a ground-breaking two-year review of the Australian social security system. Pointing to the US, she says: ``There is very little evidence as to what the long-term unemployed in the US manage to live on, but we know there is a very high incidence of despair and violence. That, surely, is what Australia would wish to avoid.''</PARA>
<PARA>It is not a disincentive to get to the point where we are forcing people into destitution. They simply have no choice in the stakes. They simply drop out of the system and the community picks up the cost eventually, through the health system, the police, or the gaols; there is an enormous cost to the community. I quote again from the article:</PARA>
<PARA> Even commentators to the right of the political centre have significant reservations. Asked whether he believes that discontinuing the dole would result in more crime, Barry Maley, of the Centre for Independent Studies, says: ``There is an intuitive feeling we have that if people are out of work and starving they will do something about it, whereas if you support them with the dole they have much weaker incentive to do that.''</PARA>
<PARA>Let us look briefly at job creation. People do want to work. What the Government should be doing is looking at specific job creating programs. Here I refer to a report by the National Advisory Group on Local Employment Initiatives which has, unfortunately, been lying on a shelf somewhere gathering dust. The report, which is entitled Local Employment Initiatives: A Strategic Approach, is four years old and the Government does not seem to have opened it. This report offers an innovative and intelligent approach to providing and funding employment projects at a local level with the aim of generating employment through the development of viable initiatives; for example, cooperatives, municipal enterprises, community businesses, environmental projects or socially focused enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I ask those Australians who are lucky enough to have jobs at the moment: do they really want to make it so difficult for people who are out of work, through no fault of their own, to get income support that we will see more and more families queuing for handouts from welfare agencies? Do ordinary Australians, those lucky enough to have work, accept that this legislation will put greater strain on our health system and on our police forces across Australia, as is already happening in South Australia? Under the current system they are already unable to cope with the steadily increasing crime rate. People will survive; somehow they will feed their families. Do the ordinary people of Australia accept that the pressures will increase further on our schools, as more and more school counsellors are required, on our transport police, on our rail systems and on public order in general? Do people really want to be party to this punitive campaign against the most vulnerable people in our society, against those who are not as fortunate as themselves?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation being debated this evening is the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 and the Social Security (Rewrite) Transition Bill 1991. As of yesterday, or the past couple of days, the Government has had the hide to give us another 11 amendments to this legislation, at a time when there are well over a million people looking for jobs. Looking at the March figures-we can look only at the March figures because the April figures will not be available until tomorrow or Thursday, and I hate to think what they will be-the Government has calculated that 844,000 people, or 9.9 per cent of Australians, are unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us consider how those figures are arrived at. They do not include a tremendous number of people who are basically either unemployed or underemployed. If a person is unemployed and works for one hour a week for a friend and no payment is made but a survey is undertaken and that person is asked whether he has done anything at all in the way of employment that week and he says, `Yes, I worked for a friend for an hour, but I did not get any money for it', he is still not classed as unemployed, irrespective of whether he has been paid. Again, if people take part in any training scheme, they are not classed as unemployed. Figures for March 1991, provided to the Age newspaper under the Freedom of Information Act, show that 1,054,000 people were looking for work. Never before in Australia's history have one million people been unemployed. I believe that the Government is panicking, trying to save on unemployment dollars, and is looking for a way out of the huge bill that it knows will come its way. As I say, these figures are for March. What will the April figures be like? They are due out either tomorrow or Thursday. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures go further than that. Looking at the tables, we find that 9.7 per cent of Australians, or 832,800 people, work on a casual or part time basis for fewer than 15 hours a week. On top of that 9.9 per cent, an additional 9.7 per cent are underemployed. In the past three quarters, an average of 190,000 people have been shifted from the unemployment benefit to other benefits such as the special benefit, the sickness benefit and the invalid pension. This means that an additional 190,000 people-10 per cent-are removed from the unemployment figures by being placed on other benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the people who have just become unemployed or who have just been thrown out of a job, what hope can they possibly feel, when the Government of the day is behaving in the way it is? We have the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who has admitted that, while he did not like doing it, he had to mislead the people about his agreement with Paul Keating because had he told the truth he would not have won the election. We have the situation where the Prime Minister misled the Australian people and, as a consequence, this charade has been going on in the Parliament-while we have one million people unemployed, and all the tragedies that arise from that. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time-and I think it was probably because the Prime Minister was under such pressure over his leadership-the Government refused to support the Industrial Relations Commissioner when he brought down the 2.5 per cent award wage decision. The Government refused to support him and came out and said that it would support the unions. Indeed, we had Mr Hawke himself sitting with the employers on the waterfront, demanding that Accord Mark VI be followed. Accord Mark VI was for an immediate payment of $12 per week, with an additional wage increase of about 4 per cent to be negotiated at enterprise level and an additional 3 per cent employer superannuation contribution to be phased in over the next couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than go for the Industrial Relations Commissioner's decision, when we have more than one million people unemployed, the Government still went for the unions, and that is because the union power within this Government is paramount. Telling the truth to the electorate is not paramount. The deal done between the Prime Minister and his Treasurer at the time concerning who would take over the leadership is paramount. But the question of the number of unemployed people is not paramount in the Government's thinking. Paramount, though, is the deal done with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) on the award wage under Accord Mark VI. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight Senator Lees told us that the Democrats would be willing to support our amendment. She said that she thought that the Newstart arrangements with this Government were just a waste of time. If we put through amendments to make special benefits applicable after nine months, will the Democrats support those?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure him that we are interested. But I will be amazed if the Democrats support our amendments. In the coming months, as former Treasurer Keating indicated, the unemployment figures will be horrific. In just the last week in Tasmania three large industries have closed. Ovaltine, which has been synonymous with Tasmania, has closed down, with the loss of 170 jobs. A fishing company has gone into receivership, a company that worked out of George Town, with the loss of another 70 jobs. Today, we have seen the loss of 68 jobs in the silicone industry. That may not sound much to the larger States of Victoria and New South Wales, but it means a tremendous amount in my State-and I hate to think what tomorrow or Thursday will bring in terms of further unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I appeal to members of the Government to start getting their house in order again, to pull themselves together, to give up their head counting and their number crunching and to think of the people out there who are unemployed, in ever increasing numbers every day. Instead of mucking about as they have been doing, they must think of how they are going to deal with the present recession, which, according to the Government, we had to have because we were expanding too rapidly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed active employment strategy is based on some false and incredibly arrogant assumptions. The plan, developed before the recession, assumes that a personal lack of effort rather than a lack of jobs is the reason for a person being unemployed. I am surprised that I have not come across the word `deems' in this legislation, because `deeming' a condition or a situation that a person might be in seems to be a favourite method of operation. Nevertheless, the strategy assumes that somebody who is unemployed, by definition, has no skills worthy of employment and that new skills must be acquired before employment will result. That assumption is certainly wrong. I think just a couple of examples might suffice to illustrate this. The Tasmanian Teachers Federation estimates that there are some 1,000 unemployed teachers in Tasmania. We need to ask: what sort of training does the active employment strategy propose for such unemployed teachers? What about the other unemployed professionals whom we know exist?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A couple of case studies were sent to us just this evening. Are these unemployed professionals, people who have made a significant contribution and sacrifice in order to train and obtain qualifications, meant to scrap their years of education and go for a new start? I suggest not. I suggest that the assumptions that come with this strategy are faulty, when they assume that such situations can develop. The training programs that we have at the moment and the vocational courses that exist now in our institutions of higher education are already over-subscribed, so it is difficult to see the need for the active employment strategy's compulsory training contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployed people who exist now have already indicated their willingness to undertake training. They are already trying to crowd into existing training opportunities. The Government's existing programs have failed to meet the demand that exists now. According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald on 11 March this year, Government spending on job training and employment programs has declined by 69 per cent per capita since the 1982-83 recession. That sort of statistic gives the lie to the assumptions made in this Government's approach to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that after a long period of unemployment it is much harder for people to gain new employment. The increase in the number of long term unemployed people will far outstrip the extra places promised by the Government for training and work experience. According to the Australian Council of Social Service, only 26 per cent of the long term unemployed were able to secure a place in training programs last year. By next year, the increase in the number of long term unemployed will mean that only one in four will be able to secure such a place-that is, if those training programs exist as they do now. </PARA>
<PARA> In the current climate it is imperative that this Government place a higher priority on training and employment services, including paid work experience programs. They are the sorts of things that are hard to define but they are the sorts of things that people find extremely valuable. The paid work experience program is not necessarily defined as employment, but it is the pre-vocational experience which people are able to use to both identify themselves to prospective employers and identify prospective employers to them. That is the sort of commitment or strategy which we should have seen in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest unemployment figures are due out on Thursday and, as we have heard, most market analysts expect the figure to top 10 per cent of the Australian work force. This would represent a record number of 844,000 people. That is a 60 per cent increase in just 12 months. It is hard to imagine a 60 per cent increase-it is very seldom depicted in that way-but the rise over the last 12 months has been astronomical. </PARA>
<PARA> In Tasmania we have the second highest unemployment rate, seasonally adjusted at 10.8 per cent, behind only Western Australia which had a figure of 11.1 per cent. It is the teenage job seekers who continue to be badly hit. We are all well aware of that. To repeat the sort of message that we are so terribly familiar with, unemployment among 15- to 19- year-olds rose in April to nearly 26 per cent and there are figures which suggest that these proportions run more closely to one in three. </PARA>
<PARA> I would support the contention that there is an unemployment level which is hidden by these sorts of statistics. Dare I say it, I agree with Senator Walters that the survey techniques used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in this instance, of discounting those who have had some form of employment for more than an hour in the survey period as having been employed, are nonsense. Such a failure to count people is really flying in the face of commonsense. As I said, I agree with Senator Walters that there would be a greater number of unemployed people than those surveys revealed, especially young people. </PARA>
<PARA> According to a report in the Australian Financial Review of 3 June, the number of job advertisements fell by more than 6 per cent just in May. Last Thursday we were told by the former Federal Treasurer, Mr Keating, that his prediction was that unemployment would hit 10.75 per cent in 1991-92. I do not know whether that was a swan song from him, but I would suggest that it was a conservative one, whatever it was, because there are employers who are still scaling down their staff and there are other economists who predict that that figure might get even higher. </PARA>
<PARA> It depresses me to have to say these sorts of things because I believe that there is some sort of talking down effect when people in parliament, or anywhere else in public, make those sorts of statements. It is not quite the effect of a run on a bank but it is depressing. It is depressing for me to have to repeat these statistics with which we are all too familiar. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that more than half a million Australians have been out of paid work for three months or more. That is a statistic which we cannot deny and have to face up to. Figures from the ABS, such as they are, show that in April 509,200 people were unemployed for three months or more and this was a rise of 200,000, or 65 per cent, in the nine months from July 1990-a shocking set of statistics. They are statistics which, rather than glibly glossing over them and saying they are too embarrassing to look at, we should emphasise enough until something is done that is actually useful. </PARA>
<PARA> Continuing with the depressing statistics, in that same period the number of people out of work for one year or more increased by 46 per cent to 182,500. That figure is expected to rise above 200,000 by the end of this year. The official figures suggest that anyone losing a job is at risk of long term unemployment and there are currently around 30 unemployed people for every job vacancy. </PARA>
<PARA> A report recently released by the Brotherhood of St Laurence stated that most of the Federal Government's policies are irrelevant and will do little to stem this surge in poverty and long term unemployment. It is strong criticism indeed. The report was considered and not flippant at all, and one into which went a great deal of research. The report was entitled Unemployment in the Recession: Policies for Reform and stated that high unemployment and the recession mean that the Federal Government's key policy vehicle-the active employment strategy-has already lost much of its relevance. That is because the active employment strategy was developed before this recession for conditions of high employment growth. That is the logic which we have to question. In addition, the report from the Brotherhood of St Laurence says that the active employment strategy is really only half a strategy, because it does not have a strategy to enable unemployed people to get jobs but merely to qualify for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats agree with a number of the recommendations in the report of the Brotherhood of St Laurence. These include increasing the number of trainees and apprentices, and increasing resources for the technical and further education (TAFE) sector, in particular, for retraining and upgrading skills. The report also recommends that the Government should stimulate the economy to provide more jobs and more opportunities for paid work experience-there it is again-in labour market programs. It also suggests that training programs such as Jobtrain and Skillshare should become longer and more intensive. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that, as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training which recently held a public hearing in Hobart, I was fortunate to attend a site visit to a Skillshare project in Hobart, with which I am familiar-the Willson Training Centre. The representatives from that group were unanimous in their recommendations to our Committee, but in particular about one. They suggested that the modular approach-the short term skill training sessions-was not in accordance with the demands and needs of those who are unemployed and seeking employment and training for employment in overwhelming numbers from that provider of training. Those experienced people who have been working in this area for more than a decade were able to tell us that longer and more intensive periods of time in which to prepare people for employment were very important and what they needed. They said that the 12-week or similar modules of training were frustrating these experienced trainers and making it difficult to place people afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA> These mickey mouse, fancy courses that seem to be drawn up by bureaucrats in isolation from the real work force attract the sorts of criticism which the bureaucrats and the designers of such things should have taken into account at least eight years ago, because these criticisms have been consistently made by the people involved in preparing young people for employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats also support the development of enterprise schemes, including the opportunity to establish local cooperatives, which at the moment is administratively and legally difficult but which nevertheless encourages and supports the establishment of various business projects. It is the clumsiness of our administrative and legal procedures which, in many cases, precludes those sorts of things from being established. Rather than assume that people need training to find employment, it might be wiser to look at the administrative red tape and mumbo jumbo that we put in front of people who have the capacity to develop employment for themselves in a number of enterprises if only they were given the opportunity and if only the administrative procedures were made a lot easier to establish such things as worker cooperatives or local work groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Moving away from the job market, at least in theory Australian universities are experiencing record levels of unmet demand and over-enrolment. That is another problem which shows the irrelevance of this active employment strategy because people are clamouring for places at existing training institutions, if we define universities, for the purpose of this debate, in that way. There are no Tasmanian figures for unmet demand for higher education simply because there is no admission centre in that State but a number of applications are still rejected. There are other students who apply only to mainland institutions because they are aware of the situation and know that tertiary enrolment in Tasmania is difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> We can measure this nationally. We know that, in 1990, 20,000 people who qualified for entry into university failed to get a place. This year the unmet demand figure is closer to 30,000 and that is the measurement we are able to make. That does not include those who may have qualified but who knew that getting a place was difficult and knew that it was a pointless or fruitless exercise. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee reports that up to 29,100 eligible applicants have failed to gain a place this year. That is an increase of more than 40 per cent since 1990. The problem demonstrates that people are seeking training and a development of their skills, which would enable them to be more employable. At least that is one of the reasons why people are trying to get into university. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a proposition which will compel people to enter a training contract or arrangement, which has as its end point a training agreement. Yet at the moment this Government has been unable to rearrange or schedule its activities or priorities so that people who are already willing, without any compulsion, to enter into further education are unable to have that willingness met with the provision of a place. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution is not what has been proposed by some as an up-front fee for students who qualify but who miss out on places. That would effectively place Australian students in competition with full fee paying overseas students. No doubt the idea could spread across the board. This really would be back door privatisation of our universities. This has been suggested by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and we disagree with it. The Liberal-National Party coalition has also suggested it and we disagree with it too. The Industry Commission draft report on the export of education services, released today, also suggests it and we disagree with it, too. We do not feel alone because we know that it is not a proposition which should be supported. Thankfully, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, has already ruled this out. He was reported in the Australian Financial Review on 28 May this year as doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand why the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee might be tempted to suggest this because it is frustrated knowing that, according to its research, Australian universities have enrolled 15,000 more students than they had been funded for this year. So the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee can be forgiven for coming up with such a suggestion. I cannot imagine why the coalition would come up with that suggestion. I will not forgive the coalition, no matter what its reason. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of universities is indicated in a landmark study by the National Institute of Labour Studies released in April this year. That established that Australia would face a shortfall of academic staff in our universities of up to 20,000; just a shortfall of staff would be up to 20,000 by the year 2000. Again, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee believes that continuing expansion in higher education, especially at the demand that it can see knocking on the doors now, is such that the shortage might be even greater-perhaps up to 25,000 by the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA> In a similarly unfortunate manner, the TAFE system has found it impossible to cope with the demand for places this year. Estimates are that TAFE institutions are being forced to reject approximately 100,000 applications. Yet again this proves the lie to this strategy that requires people to enter compulsory training contracts, agreements or whatever they are. With 100,000 people unable to get into existing TAFE courses, what on earth is going to be the situation farther down the track when this strategy is brought into force? One would imagine that to get the house in order we could get the existing institutions able to meet existing demand before we propose that there be imposed upon them an additional need to be catered for. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the state of our tertiary sector at the moment, there is an urgent need to redirect funding to construct new buildings, to increase infrastructure, employ more staff, and increase funding for off-campus studies. In my direct experience, off-campus studies provide an excellent return for the investment the community makes in the provision of those studies. Not enough consideration is given to this particular sector of our education provision. The provision of off-campus studies is a particularly effective way for people to develop new skills without needing infrastructure to the same extent as on-campus studies. By definition, a campus is not required and by practice many of the other expensive requirements in education provision are not so expensive in the off-campus provision of education. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that we would be wise to look at the opportunities which are becoming increasingly available with developing technology to regain the lead which Australia once had in this area. We did have an international reputation for our initiative and our use of technology in helping people in remote areas gain skills. That may be one way that we can increase the provision of skills for our population without adding inordinate expense. </PARA>
<PARA> But, without any funding and without redirecting the funding which we are now providing, Australia will continue to lose its academic and research base. The quality of the education that we can provide even now has deteriorated because of overcrowding. I suggest that anybody who has not witnessed such overcrowding should visit any tertiary campus in Australia as soon as possible. Next week would be a good time. Simply by visiting a campus, the overcrowding is demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats would support a greater emphasis on vocational training, as has been suggested both by the Brotherhood's report and others. Vocational training is not necessarily simply defined as labour market training, but as training in preparation for vocations. I think this difference should be apparent. It is interesting to note in passing that the very successful pre-vocational programs of the TAFE system were discontinued last year. I hope that it is fact and not rumour that they will be reintroduced, because those who were involved in those programs have been able to tell me that the pre-vocational courses were successful on the basis of a number of criteria and that their discontinuation is difficult for those participating to understand. The reasons why I support the pre-vocational programs are a little like those that I have given for supporting paid work experience programs. Those pre-vocational courses allowed prospective employers to evaluate their prospective employees and, as such, were particularly effective. </PARA>
<PARA> The critics of our present system say that the German model, rather than the overblown American model, is the one that we should be following. Under the West German model, employer spending on vocational training equals nearly half of the government spending on all forms of education. The models are there. I suggest that they are well known as well. What is frustrating is our inability to recognise what is good and what is quality and to take advantage of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The present figures for Australia in comparison with those of overseas countries are depressing and disgusting. They are disgusting to somebody who believes that there is a future-that we have a future which we can grasp and a future which belongs to those who are ready for training now. Yet we see that we have had a drastic cut in apprenticeships; that there are 47 per cent fewer apprentices than in the record year of 1989. In that year, analysts thought that we would still fail to match supply with future Australian demands. But Australian Bureau of Statistics figures now show that two out of three unemployed Australians are without any post-school qualifications, including apprenticeships. People with trade qualifications make up 8 per cent of our total unemployed and people with degree qualifications still make up 6 per cent. This is changing as our recession deepens. </PARA>
<PARA> Graduates, it is thought, succeed because of their adaptability. Richard Blandy from the Institute of Labour Studies made that assertion. But, with current trends, we will be educating many people who will be scrambling for even fewer professional jobs. As such, undergraduate qualifications will be progressively devalued. The obvious situation is that, while present circumstances have created a job squeeze, industry, by cutting back the number of apprentices it trains, is laying the foundations for a skills shortage in the near future. It will not be an option for Australia, as it has in the past, to import skilled migrants to meet that need. We will suffer greatly from that skills shortage in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> During the past few months I have spoken to thousands of young people across Australia. The common fear of those young people is that they are being forced into study or training programs with very little prospect of employment after years of subsistence living as students. We are not properly catering for these people as students anyway. Many students are, in fact, hidden unemployed. They are young people who are not successful at school but who no longer have the option of skilled or semi-skilled labouring jobs. On the other hand, unemployed people are prevented from undertaking part time study to improve their prospects. That is another contradiction of this scheme. At the moment, Austudy is still less than the adult unemployment benefit, and tertiary fees discriminate against disadvantaged students. We have people who want to take on a career based on further study and improving their skills. The way we have organised our Austudy regulations and administration makes it extremely difficult for those people to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In this strategy we have the assertion and the assumption that people do not want to continue their study. In fact, the mumbo jumbo that people confront in the administration of the many schemes we already have make it very difficult for people to engage in further training even when they want to. I feel that this is yet another example of a scheme which has been dreamt up in isolation from the real world. It is a scheme that we should not endorse in any way at all. </PARA>

<PARA> This evening I want to address only two specific issues that impact on this scheme and on so many people throughout Australia. For this issue I am relying principally on my experience in the Northern Territory, where there are some unusual effects of the social security system, es- pecially in regard to young people searching for jobs and looking for a genuine new start. Secondly, I will address a few comments to the specific problems that many unemployed Aboriginal people find that they have to cope with, not just because of their dire economic straits but also because of their isolation and the unusual and abnormal education and sociological problems in many remote communities of Australia. In looking at the legislation I was interested to note the following comment in the explanatory memorandum:</PARA>
<PARA>The Newstart Activity Agreement would be a document outlining the activities which a person has agreed to undertake as a condition of ongoing qualification. Under the terms of the Agreement, a person could be required to undertake activities such as job search, participation in vocational training courses or labour market programs, paid work experience, training designed to assist the person in searching for work and measures designed to eliminate or reduce labour market disadvantages of a person. A person may also propose voluntary work. </PARA>
<PARA>When negotiating the agreement, the CES would be required to take into consideration the person's education, experience, skills, age and physical condition as well as the state of the local labour market and training opportunities available. </PARA>
<PARA>Through representations that I have received, my attention has been drawn to literacy. I want to concentrate particularly on a report entitled A National Adult Literacy Strategy that has been prepared by the Australian Council for Adult Literacy. There is a fundamental issue that must be addressed in looking at problems of the unemployed and in asking them to undertake specific training programs. Adult literacy and numeracy is the foundation upon which all further training is built. I think that is a fundamental statement. It is certainly the key emphasis that the Australian Council for Adult Literacy has addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at problems of people who are caught up in the unemployed network and the social security system we need to wonder very seriously about the adequacy of the base qualification for participation in other vocational training. If people are unable to participate in the offered or suggested vocational training or educational training schemes, in effect, we will be compounding the problem by requiring them to participate in particular programs from which they cannot achieve a satisfactory objective at the end of the day. The Adult Literacy Council is concerned that people without basic literacy and numeracy skills would be unable to access these sorts of training programs and, therefore, risk losing their benefits. Drawing again on the national strategy document produced by the Australian Council for Adult Literacy, I quote from its rationale:</PARA>
<PARA>As a nation we must become more productive. A flexible workforce capable of developing transferable skills, is one vital element in achieving this economic goal. Retraining, job redesign, award restructuring and skills improvement will succeed only if it is recognised that adequate skills in literacy and numeracy form the basis for learning new skills and knowledge. For many people, their initial education will not, for various reasons, equip them to deal with a changing work environment. Seventy per cent of those who will be in the workforce in the year 2000 have already left school. Means other than those provided through the compulsory education sector must be available to enable people to develop literacy skills as their circumstances and needs change. </PARA>
<PARA>The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Where lack of literacy withholds access to employment, to advancement within employment, education or to the acquisition of new skills, neither economic productivity nor social justice is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>Currently, literacy programs, particularly in the Northern Territory, are stretched to the limit. They will be unable to cope with any increase in applications or referrals from the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES). Therefore, I challenge the Minister responsible and the Government, as part of the provisions of what they are intending to achieve by this legislation, to outline clearly to the Senate and to the Parliament the means by which they are going to ensure that the people from the various networks of unemployment and social security will be first assisted and trained in appropriate literacy courses to reach the desired level for participation in the appropriate vocational and other educational training that is required. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter is complicated because of lack of research into the level of illiteracy-right throughout Australia, not just in the Northern Territory-particularly among people in geographically isolated areas who have no access to literacy programs. This is an urgent and serious matter. It will, of course, involve the participation of the various State educational departments and educational authorities. I note that Senator Bell alluded to many of those issues. We have to be sure that the Government's intention in this legislation is that it will reach the appropriate consumer need in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue that I would challenge the Government to consider very seriously relates to the particular problems that apply to unemployed Aboriginal people in remote communities throughout Australia. I noted recently that the Public Sector Union in the Northern Territory urged CES workers to reject the contract system for long term unemployed. This, in turn, led to media speculation that they would refuse to operate the new scheme. The Sunday Territorian of 19 May 1991 reported their concerns. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Other perceived difficulties with the proposed system will be peculiar to the Territory. How, for example, will the contracts apply to Aborigines- in some settlements unemployment is as high as 90 per cent-and who will have the job of securing the contracts?</PARA>
<PARA>We must now engage and rely on special technology for those isolated parts of Australia that have to participate in programs such as these. The development of Imparja Television Pty Ltd in central Australia-which, of course, reaches a much wider network throughout outback Australia; particularly in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia, as well as the Northern Territory-is a medium that I would commend to the CES for ensuring that programs can be effectively delivered and for which special programs can be developed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government very generously makes available some $2m for application to the operation of Imparja on an annual basis through the administration of the Northern Territory Government. I hope that this is an area where the Government will look sympathetically at the particular needs of Imparja and the various government departments which must be charged with the responsibility of ensuring that unemployed Aboriginal people in remote parts of Australia, along with other unemployed Australians, are not denied their basic rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991 is being introduced in a climate of record unemployment. I thought that I would spend a couple of minutes tonight giving a brief Queensland perspective. In Queensland the latest official unemployment figure is 10.7 per cent, which equates to over 164,000 people. The hidden figure, no doubt, is even higher. The percentage of young people is undoubtedly higher, as is the percentage of Aboriginal people who are unable to find work. Over 10,000 Queenslanders lost their jobs in April and now have to compete with the thousands of others looking for decreasing numbers of jobs. The headline of a recent article in the Courier-Mail summed it all up in these words: `The Jobless Nightmare'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A quick ring around the jobs advertised recently in Queensland produced the following information: a position as a junior accountant produced 25 written applications in the first three days; a position as a receptionist in a legal firm produced 50 applications; a position as a real estate salesperson produced over 50 applications; a position as a community worker produced 30 written applications in the first three days; and a position as an assistant in a print shop produced 120 applications. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention these basic figures to show that I believe people are trying very hard to gain employment. The inference of this legislation-that people will not look for work unless they are forced to do so-is, I believe, highly questionable. As well as there being insufficient jobs available, as previous speakers have pointed out, there is already insufficient funding for higher education places, with an unmet demand for last year of close to 5,000 people. The figures for this year are expected to be higher. Those people trying to attempt to improve their skills by attending technical and further education colleges are also about to be faced with vastly increased fees in Queensland, courtesy of the Queensland Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the active employment strategy, with its emphasis on compulsion and policing of unemployed people at a time of enormous unemployment, is an outrageous imposition on the many people who are already suffering greatly as a direct result of the Government's failed economic policies. The new procedure which will be introduced as a result of this legislation will place greater power and responsibility on the staff in Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) offices. CES staff, using very broad discretionary powers granted in this legislation, will be able to penalise so-called offenders by removing their benefits, potentially for enormous lengths of time. </PARA>
<PARA> The workload and the stress load on CES and Department of Social Security (DSS) staff will be hugely increased by these measures. Staff in these departments do a good job in circumstances that are made more difficult every day by the growing numbers of unemployed people and by policy changes. However, there are always occasions when a staff person can be unfairly harsh on people and in many ways I think that this is more likely to happen when staff workloads are too high. CES staff already have the power, in effect, to terminate a person's benefit by determining that the person has failed a works test. Failing a works test means that the beneficiary is deprived of income for two weeks for a first offence or for six weeks for every subsequent offence. </PARA>
<PARA> There have already been cases which show how dangerous it is to give broad discretionary powers to staff and a few examples that I know of from Queensland in recent months include: a person failing a work test-and his income being cut off-for being five minutes late for a CES interview; a person not attending a job interview because he was at the hospital whilst his wife gave birth to their first child. Anyone who loses his source of income because of an unfavourable CES report and who wishes to dispute the determination is also likely to face the prospect of being shuffled between CES and DSS offices as they try to sort out how to get some money. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent reports on racist violence in Australia and on black deaths in custody have shown that racism is still widespread in Australia. The potential for Aboriginals or migrants to be subjected to unreasonable demands as a result of conscious or even unconscious discrimination is another cause for worry. </PARA>
<PARA> To provide greater opportunities for training and vocational courses is quite obviously desirable. To reduce the security of unemployed people's income by forcing them to jump through every hoop they are instructed to is outrageous. The many people who are faced with the daunting prospect of unemployment need support and encouragement, not hoop jumping. The last thing they need is to be faced with a range of penalties and compulsory contracts being imposed upon them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main Bill which we are debating tonight, the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill, is being discussed at a time when the number of jobs has drastically declined and there has been a massive increase in the number of unemployed. The present rate of unemployment is 9.9 per cent and it is predicted by those on both sides of this House to increase. The number of unemployed is at a record high. As Senator Walters has said, there are more than one million people registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) looking for work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition to these figures, there are hundreds of thousands of hidden unemployed: those who remain studying although they want to work; those who are working part time but who really would like to work full time; housewives who wish to enter the work force; and recipients of other Department of Social Security benefits-invalid pensioners and sole parents who would like to better themselves financially in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria, the number of unemployment beneficiaries rose by 84,000 or 120 per cent. That figure more than doubled during the year from April 1990 to April 1991. That is the climate in which we are debating this Bill. It must be recognised that during this recession-the Keating devised recession-that there are simply not enough jobs to go around. It is widely recognised that a job slump has occurred in all sectors-the skilled and unskilled, primary industry, manufacturing and the service sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In a very tight labour market, it is imperative that people are given an opportunity to find work and improve their skills. The unemployed should not be given open-ended access to government benefits for little or no positive job search and skill improvement assistance. The Government must take up the challenge of promoting and fostering more innovative, flexible employment and training programs which are oriented towards skills which are needed in the future. There should be more use of community resources and a greater emphasis on community endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there must be greater flexibility and innovation in industrial relations. As far as manpower planning, for example, is concerned, there ought to be part time and casual work and training and re-skilling wages. These are some of the issues that Senator Alston raised earlier in order to address the concerns. In addition, economic changes are required to lead to the creation of the jobs which will rectify some of the problems that we are seeing here. Just having this sort of program is not enough; we need an overall approach. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the issues that I do not think has been mentioned this evening which is of concern to me is the upcoming bulge in the number of long term unemployed. The rapid increase in unemployment has been concentrated over the past six months. This means that there is going to be a rapid influx of those who have been unemployed for 12 months during the next six to 12 months unless there is a major improvement in economic circumstances. If we believe what Mr Keating said about the level of unemployment and how long it will be sustained at the present level or greater, we can expect that bulge not just to be a temporary bulge but quite a large one-a pig going through a python. In fact, the pig is going to be enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> The consensus is that the economy will pick up no earlier than 1992. Both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Senator Button recognise that unemployment will be one of the last areas to pick up if and when the recovery occurs. The Government's failure to introduce a more flexible industrial relations system will exacerbate and prolong the present constriction of the labour market, particularly at the youth and mature age ends of the market, which currently are practically non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA> There are presently 180,000 long term unemployed. The 60,000 increase since the beginning of this year is made up of those people who were unemployed at the onset of the recession, who predictably have not been able to find work since. When the full effect of those who have lost their jobs during this recession is felt, it is not unthinkable that the number of long term unemployed could reach 300,000 in the first half of 1992. This is the scenario facing a Commonwealth Employment Service which will be required to negotiate, update and check compliance with Newstart agreements that have been made with each and every person who has been unemployed for longer than 12 months. This will place an enormous strain on the staff and skill resources of the CES, but we have been given absolutely no indication of the number of recipients of Newstart agreements, nor has there been any convincing argument to show that the CES has sufficient resources to undertake this task effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> It has to be ensured with the implementation of this legislation that every client who negotiates a Newstart agreement fully understands what that agreement entails. It is important that each client is treated with the same courtesy, respect and fairness. I have been told that the officers undertaking negotiations will be at an ASO4 level. They must have an intimate knowledge of the process of negotiating these agreements and they must have the relevant people skills: patience; ability to listen; a genuine interest in the client's well-being; and an ability to communicate on the same level as the client. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a wide cross-section of people entering into these agreements: migrants; those with literacy problems; rural people; unskilled people; young people and old people. Unless the CES officers possess well-defined negotiating and people skills, the marked differences in age, command of the English language, life experience and knowledge of the social security system will result in conflicting situations. Every client should have the opportunity to study the agreement form, both before they enter the negotiations and again before they sign the form. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, I believe all clients should be allowed to be accompanied by an advocate who can assist them during the negotiations. They should also be allowed to bring family members with them, as they may be directly affected by the agreement. Clients should be informed before the negotiations commence that if they consider that they cannot communicate effectively with the officer who is chosen to negotiate with them they can ask to be interviewed by another officer. Apparently, the CES does not have any migrant liaison officers of its own and it has claimed that it will purchase this service from the Department of Social Security. The question I have is: will every client who requests such assistance be provided with it throughout the negotiation process? I envisage that this process will be very costly and time consuming and I wonder whether this has been budgeted into the costing of this program. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question I wish to ask is: what is the legal status of the Newstart activity agreement? The agreement itself and the legislation are quite clear about what will happen if the client does not comply with the provisions set down in part B-they will not be eligible for continued payment of the Newstart allowance. However, what will happen if the CES cannot provide the activities which are laid down in the agreement-particularly if it is a Commonwealth program which is part of the agreement and the program is not being run, there are too many people in it, or for some other reasons the persons are not able to undertake the agreement because of some breakdown on the part of the Commonwealth? What will happen if a Newstart client is injured whilst undertaking a training or voluntary work program that is set down in the Newstart agreement?</PARA>
<PARA> I brought this concern to the attention of the Department of Social Security and I was told that a legal opinion was being sought urgently from the Attorney-General's Department. I have not received a copy of this opinion; however, the office of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) has informed my office that the opinion states that the Department would not be liable unless it suggests an inherently dangerous activity. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems odd to me that I might sign an agreement with the Commonwealth as an unemployed person and proceed on my way to the voluntary activity which is part of the agreement and I might be insured when I am taking part in that voluntary activity-meals on wheels or whatever program the agreement might have set out-but what happens if I am injured on the way to the local council to undertake meals on wheels on a two-day basis? What responsibility does the Commonwealth have? I hope that has been clarified because, in fact, I have entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth which is almost like an employment situation. I am doing that as part of an agreement in order to receive my benefit. What happens if I am injured on the way to the program? Will the Commonwealth also ensure that any program I am engaged in has appropriate insurance cover? They are issues of some concern to me with regard to the Commonwealth's liability. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston raised another question which I have also raised with the Department. I have asked the Department why 12 months was chosen as the time someone is unemployed before he or she is required to negotiate a Newstart activity agreement? There is no evidence to show that the choice of 12 months is anything more than an arbitrarily chosen figure. I think it might have been appropriate to look at some pilot studies to see whether the starting of these programs should have been different according to different age groups. Is it better to start earlier with younger people so that they do not learn some of the behaviour which we know can occur with the long term unemployed, especially the young? Is it more appropriate to have different starting times for different age groups? They are the sorts of questions and the sort of flexibility that I would have liked to see in this sort of program. </PARA>
<PARA> When the ideas which formed the basis of this Bill were mooted in February 1990, the number of unemployed was such that 12 months was an acceptable cut-off point at which clients would have a reasonable chance of accessing a Government labour market program. But sadly for the unemployed, this Keating-designed `recession that we had to have' means there are now not enough places to enable someone who has been unemployed for 12 months to be confident of obtaining labour market program access. This seems to me to be one of the crucial factors in the implementation of this Bill. I hope that the Government has thought this through adequately. I believe we will see significant problems as that bulge of long term unemployed people comes through. I hope I do not have to say, `I told you so', but I believe I will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating cognately the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 and the Social Security (Rewrite) Transition Bill 1991. I wish to address briefly some aspects of the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill. The thrust of the Bill, the individual provisions, and the criticism that the Australian Democrats have of that particular Bill have been addressed in some detail by Senator Lees who has direct responsibility for this portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to raise a few questions which are certainly raised by this type of legislation where we are forcing unemployed people to obtain training and where we are forcing people to look for jobs which are not there, at the risk of having their unemployment benefit-their sustenance-withdrawn. The question must be raised: what are these unemployed people being trained for? Will there be any jobs for them once they have undergone training, or is it all just a cruel hoax-a device to get people off the unemployment list and reduce the percentages? Will they be led to believe that if they undergo training they will be okay when the sort of training being provided to them will not enhance their job prospects at all?</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth remembering that at present there are 27 unemployed people for every job available. I refer to a press report which appeared in the Australian on 4 May 1991 describing a queue of 5,000 applicants for jobs at the new department store, Daimaru, in Melbourne which invited applicants to present themselves on a Sunday. I think we should note, for instance, that one of those applicants had an honours degree in arts history and an honours degree in museum studies and, yet, had been unemployed for five months and was very keen to find a job as a shop assistant at Daimaru. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other examples of that type. An advertisement for a kitchen hand at McDonalds in Elsternwick drew 47 applicants. An advertisement for a machinist drew between 50 and 60 applicants and an advertisement for a storeman driver for Tarantos Ice Cream drew 100 inquiries in the first hour and 45 people were interviewed by telephone. An advertisement for a junior receptionist with Concept Ads drew 150 inquiries. So it goes on. We must ask whether this active employment strategy actually has an aim. Does it end anywhere or does it end in a dead end? After all, we now have close to one million people unemployed, a 30 per cent unemployment rate for young people in the age group of 18 to 21 years-perhaps the greatest crime we are committing at the moment-and 50 per cent unemployment amongst the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to be careful to assess where we are continuing along this road with the present policy of deregulation and reduction in customs tariffs. Apart from the recession that we had to have-according to the former Treasurer-there are structural reasons for the loss of jobs in many industries and this is being pushed along and accelerated by the Government's policies. So-called reform on tariffs means that tariffs are being reduced even though nations in Europe, in the Americas and Asia are not doing any such thing. They are not opening up their frontiers and delivering their businesses to international markets as we are prepared to do. Why do we not use the reduction in tariffs as a bargaining counter to ensure that the farmers in Europe no longer receive the 40 per cent subsidies that they have enjoyed for so long which make sure that our farmers cannot sell wheat and meat in Europe?</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that other problems are raised by this Bill. We have been told by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that we must become the clever Australia to be able to compete internationally and to increase our exports and thereby provide jobs at home. Yet, when we look at the state of tertiary education and the facilities that are available for people who are prepared to contribute to our becoming the clever society, we find that thousands of people simply cannot find places and that there is over-enrolment such as we have never had before. The community has risen to respond to the Prime Minister's call, yet the Government is not prepared to provide the necessary infrastructure to ensure that these people can study, obtain qualifications and contribute to the productive endeavours of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> In this connection, we should look at the educational qualifications of our unemployed. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that two out of three unemployed Australians are without any post-school qualifications. These people are most likely to be the long term unemployed. People with trade qualifications make up 8 per cent of the total unemployed and those with degree qualifications 6 per cent. It is time that we engaged in a concerted strategy to enable our people to achieve the sort of educational qualifications which maximise their choices and chances to achieve jobs and to contribute to a productive Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a network of organisations which provide effective assistance to our unemployed people. I am referring to the network of welfare rights centres which are engaged at the moment in supplying badly needed support and advice to unemployed people and the sort of lobbying that this Government needs to ensure that unemployed people have some sort of chance as they proceed along their unenviable road. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that the welfare rights centres are currently fighting for their own survival. The centre in Melbourne needs $156,000 to pay for an administrator, information officer and researcher and has on-costs of $44,325. The salaries of the three officers are all in the region of $35,000 to $37,000. The centre in Geelong needs a regional service coordinator, a half-time secretary and $22,000 for on-costs, a total of $71,305. </PARA>
<PARA> An increasing number of people are relying on social security. The safety net for unemployed people has now been removed or is being removed with the advent of Job Search and Newstart. The law is highly complex and appeal procedures are slow and daunting. Access to information, advice and assistance is restricted by the very same factors which put people in need of social security. </PARA>
<PARA> The welfare rights centres are attempting to cater for a demand that is far greater than its capacity and a demand which is increasing every day. The centres are funded through a smorgasbord of State governments, local government, legal aid, charities, foundations and trade union centres. This funding is inconsistent, insecure and diminishing. State governments are increasingly citing the absence of Commonwealth Government funding for welfare rights centres as the reason for the withdrawal of their own funding support. It is time that the Commonwealth Government accepted its responsibilities in these times of rising unemployment and the calamitous state of our employment market to assist people who are in this situation so that they can help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to some of the economic measures that the Australian Democrats believe should be taken to ensure that jobs are available. These measures have been placed on the agenda before, but the Government has not reacted with alacrity. I wonder whether the change in Treasurer might have some possible effect on the direction that the Government is prepared to take. I believe that the new Treasurer, Mr Kerin, is a little more amenable to strategic intervention in our economy to ensure that the environmental and social objectives are met. In that sense I would suggest that it is time to call yet again for increased public investment in transport, communications, housing, health, education and research. We all know that in these areas infrastructure is badly lacking and that we have a million people waiting to do productive work. It is up to us and the Government to provide these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to advert briefly to the community work program, which is part of the Australian Democrats' policy in this area. Many jobs cannot be carried out at this point because the funds are simply not available. They are jobs for which the recipients of services could simply not find the funds. This applies to private persons such as pensioners, who would dearly love to have their fences repaired, houses painted and gardens brought into order but simply cannot afford to pay commercial rates. They are not alone. There are local government authorities that would like to have conservation work carried out in their public parks but cannot find sufficient rate revenue to achieve that. The community work program has the chance to fill that gap. The concept is one of offering jobs, through local government administrations, to people who are unemployed to allow them to draw the unemployment benefit and to add an hourly payment which would bring the total amount they receive to an amount equal to the award wage. </PARA>
<PARA> This would require some amendments to our social security legislation, but it should not be beyond us. The community development employment program used on Aboriginal communities has required such amendment. It has been an unqualified success, giving people who otherwise would not have employment, the opportunity to earn their own living and to contribute to the well-being of their communities. Unless we do these sort of things and are prepared to think laterally with the aim of achieving a society which is socially just as well as economically robust, our society will not be become a sustainable society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hawke Government has presided since 1983 over a widening gap in income distribution in this country. I refer to a study by Marc Lombard from the Macquarie University School of Economics and Financial Studies, completed just a couple of months ago. The main findings of this study are threefold. Firstly, there has been a marked widening of the income gap between 1983 and 1989. As an example, the top one per cent of income earners earned as much as the bottom 11 per cent in 1982-93 but in 1989 they earned as much as the bottom 21 per cent. So there was a doubling. Secondly, the gap was further increased by the Government's taxation policy through the lowering of marginal, and hence average, tax rates. Thirdly, the female share of the national income, relatively low compared with the male share, had remained almost stationary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These findings are worrying, especially when unemployment figures are so high. We know that women and their dependants will usually be the first and worst hit in a recession and the ones who will suffer most from this social security package. In this regard, I commend to other senators the work entitled Common Wealth and Common Good, published by the Catholic Bishop's Committee for Justice, Development and Peace, written by Dr Michael Costigan. This has been a three-year consultative process in the community. It is not yet finalised, but the draft version highlights the need for a more equitable distribution of wealth in this country. There are huge inequities which became worse during the decade of greed in the 1980s. There is a plea for compassion as our community seeks to address the injustices as well as the inequities. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about this draconian piece of legislation, which is quite obviously part of the Government's overall approach to labour market deregulation through introducing a work for the dole scheme via the back door. The Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991 provides for what is euphemistically being referred to as the active employment strategy. My concern is that basic wages and conditions cannot be maintained within the existing work force once the reserve pool of labour, constituting the unemployed, is forced into the labour market at Government discretion, regardless of skills and training. </PARA>
<PARA> The irony of this legislation being introduced at this time is that it was conceived during a period of job growth. It is essentially a program that attempts to train and educate unemployed people to better equip them as job seekers. But Australia is currently experiencing a significant decline in job growth. In March this year 82,400 jobs were lost. This collapse in the job market makes this legislation appear increasingly irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the Senate will abolish unemployment benefits and replace them with a new system of conditional payments. The Government has attempted to deceive the welfare lobby into believing this change is for the benefit of the unemployed when, in fact, it is not. The new system is punitive and will create added stress and insecurity amongst unemployed people. The new arrangements, known as Job Search and Newstart, are a means of ending the so-called dole by introducing a Job Search allowance (JSA) for the first 12 months and after this period a Newstart allowance. There is, of course, no automatic transition from one allowance to the other. The new programs are designed to involve unemployed people in compulsory labour market programs in return for a strictly conditional payment. These labour market programs are not new. A full range including Jobstart, Skillshare, Jobtrain and Job Clubs have already been available to unemployment beneficiaries for some time. Attendance rates have been high despite the non-compulsory nature of the programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole idea of this legislation is to provide less scope for social security and Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) officers to exercise compassion in dealing with individual cases, and more scope for penalising unemployed people through the new contract arrangements known as activity tests, set to ascertain a person's so-called attitude to job seeking and training. To introduce such a punitive system during a time of record unemployment levels at more than 10 per cent, but with the generally accepted figure of at least 12 per cent as the hidden rate revealed by CES figures, is unjust. It is also ironic that while the Government fought for many months to reject the use of the dreaded `R' word for recession, its own ranks, including Senator Peter Walsh, are now calling the severe economic decline a depression.</PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line is that the jobs people will be trained for are simply not available. People should be trained for unemployment and be involved in appropriate community-based work, not employment that does not exist, which will just further add to the loss of self-esteem and an increase in the poverty cycle. This legislation compels people to enter programs proposed by the CES with little input of their own or freedom of choice, limited appeal rights should they dispute the suitability of the CES proposals and, ultimately, the termination of their income should they refuse to comply or fail to come to an agreement with the local CES office. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Patterson has pointed out, many of the people in the CES offices will hardly be experts in dealing with these very sensitive matters as they arise on a daily basis in the offices right around the country. It is this element of compulsion that concerns the Greens because the current system generally is working and is not, as the Government has implied, a passive system. The current system of unemployment benefit payments requires that beneficiaries must be actively looking for work and be available to undertake suitable employment when it is offered to them. In practice, the work test is used to terminate benefits-that is, where a person fails to turn up for an interview or refuses to accept employment offered by the CES. Contrary to the media and other propaganda, the system of payment of unemployment benefits is not widely abused; it is highly focused and rigorously enforced. </PARA>
<PARA> The other draconian aspect of the active employment strategy is that the programs that are recommended do not involve any direct response to what the community wants or what an unemployed person would like to do. For example, there is no flexibility in the training system and there is no allowance for community-based enterprises such as tree plantings or involvement in programs reversing land degradation in rural areas. The Labor machine will have to reject the old economic model which saw full employment as achievable and will have to work towards greener and more democratic models. But at the moment we see people being trained for unskilled labour such as bar work or mechanics training, even though jobs in these areas, and in particular the trades, are simply not available. Therefore, the compulsion aspect concerns me, as does the irrelevant nature of the labour market training initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> People would be better off moving into the non-money market, as is happening under the local employment trading scheme, whereby people exchange goods and services in their own communities, keep a balance sheet in LETS units and remove their community work from the traditional money market. This scheme is great for building a sense of community and will thrive as unemployment worsens, but it throws the Australian Taxation Office into a spin because earnings are not in dollars and are therefore not recorded. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation at a time of rising unemployment in order to coerce unemployed people to participate in a social engineering experiment should not be passed. The repercussions will include much higher levels of stress amongst unemployed people, higher crime rates as a result of large numbers of people being deprived of income support and more homeless and destitute people living off the streets-as if we have not had enough examples of so many thousands of young people in Australia already in that very sad situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Green policies are directed towards reducing the existing inequalities in income and in the ownership of wealth and resources. Such policies seek to reduce the stigma attached to the receipt of social security benefits and to keep benefits in line with the consumer price index so that all citizens are guaranteed a minimum income if they become unemployed. This is a basic right in all societies that should never be challenged. Instead, we are being presented with a so-called active employment strategy which represents a punitive approach threatening the notion that citizenship confers a right to an adequate income to fulfil basic needs. As the Brotherhood of St Laurence says:</PARA>
<PARA>Adequate income security . . . is a recognition of the fact that inability to obtain work is a function of economic, social and political forces in a changing society and is not the fault of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA>Other speakers in the debate have testified to this already. I would say that it especially applies in our community so far as young people and Aboriginal people are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of adequate income security is a right in the event of unemployment and one which is recognised by the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. This new employment strategy is completely one-sided and is based on contractual arrangements between the unemployed and the Government with no reciprocal commitments from the Government which can cut people off benefits at any time if it is found that their attitude is inappropriate. This whole legislative package smacks of an Orwellian nightmare in which the thought police are actively trying to ascertain a person's frame of mind and ongoing loyalty to the state machine. </PARA>
<PARA> The new program means that unemployed people will be, as I have previously stated, separated into two classes. Those who have been unemployed for less than a year will go into Job Search; and those who have been unemployed for more than a year will be deemed to require special supervision by CES officers under Newstart. People who have already been unemployed for more than a year as at 1 July 1991 will go straight into Newstart. Others will begin on Job Search and be progressively transferred to Newstart as they reach 12 months unemployment. To go back to day one, a person leaving Job Search to take up employment has to stay in work for at least six weeks. Similarly, people leaving Newstart have to be employed for at least 13 weeks before they can return to the beginning of the Job Search program. Obviously, there are going to be some gaps between those programs. What do people do for an income in those gap periods?</PARA>
<PARA> Each Newstart applicant will be required to enter into a special contract with the CES called a Newstart activity agreement in which they will promise to adopt and maintain correct attitudes in order to keep themselves permanently in an employment-ready state. These attitudes will be taught and refined in special training courses. Non-compliance will be detected through the application of an activity test which will have statutory punishment for failure in the form of deferment of support payments. JSA recipients will also have to attend at least two compulsory interviews with the CES and the Department of Social Security (DSS). Ten per cent of Jobstart recipients will also be required to attend an intensive interview with DSS after three months and further interviews may also be required with the CES. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addition, the whole new strategy does not involve the creation of any new labour market programs. It relies on an increase in the number of places available under existing schemes when the Department of Employment, Education and Training is already stretched to the limit in terms of its internal budget and the pressures on its personnel. Apart from being quite malicious in some of the wording, this legislation is, as I have mentioned, an extension of the Hawke Government's obsession with labour market deregulation, which sees an end to the central wage fixing system and the introduction of arrangements that are negotiated on a personalised basis between employers and individual employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The push for a deregulated market economy relies on exploitation of the reserve pool of labour to lower wages and to increase profits for the employers and government. In this new deregulated environment, workers will be encouraged to underbid each other for wages in return for the few jobs that are available. The whole notion of pushing Australian wages down to make the country more competitive with newly industrialised nations in the Pacific Rim and using the unemployed as coolie labour is anathema to the basic rights of the worker. Without years of media bashing and scapegoating by employer lobby groups of the unemployed, this legislation would never have been acceptable to the Australian public or to its representatives in this place. People are being actively conditioned into believing the stereotype of the dole bludger. Of course, that has been going on for a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA> I must point out that all Australians have a right to a minimum standard of provision of income in order to meet their basic needs. If this cannot be provided through the labour market, it should be provided by the state as a matter of right and should not be contingent on people meeting such harsh eligibility criteria or having to prove their moral worth. While not condoning the abuse of the social security system, the Greens maintain that much of this abuse is the result of inadequate levels of benefit, which leave people with no effective alternative but to cheat the system, especially if they wish to keep pace with the expectations of our consumer oriented society, which of course I question. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment is a harsh reality for hundreds of thousands of Australian families right now through no fault of their own. However, it will be a time not only for those without adequate income but also for all of us to re-evaluate the quality of our lifestyles. All of us need to get off the consumerist bandwagon. However, to make it difficult for people without jobs to get access to a guaranteed minimum income is cruel; it is unnecessary and it is totally unacceptable in this relatively affluent society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to say, and I am sure that the Senate will be pleased to hear it, that I will not be taking up much time this evening on this legislation. Senator Lees has already given the point of view of the Australian Democrats on the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, and the Social Security (Rewrite) Transition Bill 1991. I just want to add a little in relation to New South Wales and, in particular, my portfolio area of housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Newstart proposal requires that the unemployed accept training; however, many unemployed have already tried to get training. They have tried to enrol in universities or technical and further education colleges only to be turned away. Courses are oversubscribed, in spite of the higher education contribution scheme. In 1990, in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, there was unmet demand for places in higher education of 3,700 to 5,400. The figures for this year are in the range of 4,700 to 6,900. Obviously, we are not in a position to supply education and training for all those who are eligible and keen. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is forcing many people, who have not been able to study the course of their choice due to lack of places and who are unable to get work because there are no jobs, to take short term courses chosen by a Commonwealth Employment Service officer which gives successful students no formal qualifications and which may, indeed, be in areas where the individual already has skills. Worthwhile Skillshare courses are already oversubscribed and, even with the planned additional places, the courses will be in high demand if they meet people's needs. So why not provide sufficient places in all educational institutions now to enable people to select a relevant course without the Government resorting to standover tactics, backed up by the threat of having their bare bones survival income taken away? Will there be any jobs for the job searchers or the new starters once they have emerged from their courses?</PARA>
<PARA> A ring-around in Sydney last weekend showed that there are many more applicants than there are jobs. A job advertisement for a bar waiter or waitress produced 160 applicants; for a storeman and driver, 90 applicants; for a receptionist-typist, 200 applicants. A job advertisement for a machinist resulted in 50 inquiries. Even a job requiring trade qualifications, a carpenter-joiner, produced 40 applicants. The New South Wales Teachers Federation has 15,000 to 20,000 teachers listed as unemployed or underemployed. They are trained but there are no jobs for them. Presumably, their only option is to take jobs for which they are not trained and for which they are probably overqualified. Many teachers will succeed in getting one of those jobs but, in doing so, will ensure that someone else is on the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> As we weather this recession, an increasing number of people will have to rely on social security for their income. They are victims. The vast majority are not responsible for their lack of employment. They have no control over government economic decisions. They want a regular paid position. The Democrats are particularly worried about the access which those people have to housing, which accounts for a large part of any person's income. We are seeing an increasing number of people on the streets month after month. The active employment strategy may have a lot to answer for in this respect. Any person who lacks, for whatever reason, the resilience and the inner fortitude to run the Job Search-Newstart obstacle race is likely to go downhill very quickly with homelessness waiting at the bottom of the down slide. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen to the families of all those who fall through the net, the families of those who do not have the language skills to negotiate and understand all the paperwork? Already these people are having benefits cut off and are being forced to rely on welfare support. These problems can only increase with Newstart. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Australia is a signatory, states in article 25 that everyone has the right to an adequate standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the deterioration of economic circumstances is creating an immense problem in the housing area, with a greater number of people now being unable to afford any sort of housing at all. This is especially true in Sydney which has the highest housing costs of all major cities and where the levels of poverty are probably higher than in other parts of Australia once housing costs have been paid. Despite these problems, the Federal Government has refused to allocate any additional funds to providing new services for homeless people. Indeed, under this Government there has been a declining emphasis on essential programs. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, in last year's budget submission to the Federal Government, the Australian Council of Housing Societies drew attention to the fact that the housing situation among low income earners, including the unemployed, was getting progressively worse. The Council suggested that with the deterioration in our economic circumstances and increasing unemployment, the homelessness issue among Australia's low income groups, including the unemployed, was set to deteriorate. This is especially the case among Australia's homeless youth. This is despite the recommendations of the Burdekin report, which highlighted the appalling situation now facing Australia's homeless youth in our cities, suburbs and country areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though the homelessness issue has been getting progressively worse with this recession, the Government continues to cut back funding to essential housing programs. Such government programs are now often the only remaining option for low income groups struggling in the housing market today. Continued government funding cutbacks in the housing area will effectively destroy the Government's social justice strategy. Let us hope that the 1991-92 Budget will contain some measures aimed at assisting the housing problems of our lowest income earners. It is certainly disappointing that in past years the Commonwealth has effectively reduced its funding to housing in real terms when delivering the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquiry into homeless young people received much evidence that amongst Australia's young people homelessness is a large and growing problem. These problems have clearly worsened under the current recession and it is necessary for the Government to meet the responsibilities as a matter of urgency. Some low income groups, and in particular the young unemployed, are being forced into inadequate and inappropriate forms of housing. Consequently, these new social security packages of Newstart and Job Search will fail to achieve their goals because problems, such as the housing crisis and youth homelessness, will have an immediate counter effect on any positive outcome which these new unemployment packages are intended to create. </PARA>
<PARA> The social problems created by the housing crisis and youth homeless are immense. Yet, the staff of the Department of Social Security have been allocated three hours per year to counsel their clients. Obviously, that is an insufficient amount of time and agencies, such as the welfare rights centres, will find themselves in even more demand. Payments are now tightly targeted, yet many who are eligible do not receive their entitlements. The law is highly complex, while appeal procedures are slow and daunting. Access to information, advice and assistance are restricted by the same factors that put people in need of social security. </PARA>
<PARA> Welfare rights centres are attempting to cater for a demand for information and assistance far beyond their capacity, and it is on the increase. The centres are funded from a mixture of State government, local government, legal aid, charities, foundations and trade union sources. The funding is inconsistent, insecure and diminishing. State governments are increasingly citing the absence of Commonwealth government funding for welfare rights centres as a reason for their withdrawal of funding support. Without Commonwealth support, even the limited network of welfare rights centres will contract and disappear over the next two years. The network of welfare rights centres is seeking the immediate establishment by the Commonwealth Government of a national welfare rights advocacy funding program, which would be a significant and tangible contribution to social justice. In the current economic climate that is desperately needed. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.42 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation before us, the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, and the Social Security (Rewrite) Transition Bill 1991, is a symptom of a great deal of what is wrong with this Government and, indeed, of what would be wrong with the Opposition, if it were in government, because their policies are not all that dissimilar. What it indicates is that the Government is totally misreading the portents of history. Increasingly, it is attempting to design solutions for yesterday's problems and it is not considering where society is going and where it needs to go and designing the sorts of employment options, educational facilities and technologies that would fit a society moving towards the twenty-first century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the early 1980s, Barry Jones wrote a book, Sleepers, Wake!, in which he pointed out that if the technologies for automated production of goods and services then available were applied-and of course this relates to a social decision which should have been made but which has never been properly faced-all the goods and services then made could have been produced with only some six to 10 per cent of the population working, with some 90 to 94 per cent of the population technically unemployed. Some honourable senators would recall that when the Hawke Government first came to office in 1983, one of the first things that Mr Hawke did was to call a national economic summit. The message in Sleepers, Wake! was to be put to the summit by Barry Jones, but the Prime Minister made a deliberate decision to exclude Barry Jones from the national economic summit, on the grounds that the people who were hand-picked and invited to that summit might be disturbed by the sort of message that Barry Jones would have to tell them. </PARA>
<PARA> That backward looking, instead of forward looking, approach of the Government has continued ever since. The Government is inventing solutions to yesterday's problems rather than considering the future direction in which we should move. Consider for a moment comparing the economy to a pipe-and this is a good analogy because the economy is currently measured through gross national product or gross domestic product-to a measure of the flow of goods and services through the economy. One observes that what goes into that pipe at one end is resources and human labour and what comes out at the other end is pollution. The Government-and indeed, the Opposition would attempt to do the same if it were in government-has endlessly increased the flow through that pipe, using up more and more resources and more and more human labour on the input side while producing more and more pollution on the output side. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, that makes very little sense. Moreover, it is neither sustainable nor consistent with the Government's stated aim of designing a sustainable economy. If one considers the economics of an individual householder, that householder does not attempt to increase the amount of money and human labour required to maintain the house. Quite sensibly, an attempt is made to decrease the amount of money and the amount of labour necessary to maintain the house. Similarly, with the national economy, there is no sense in endlessly attempting to increase the use of resources and human labour. In that sense, to attempt to create work simply for its own sake is quite ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> In a productive economy such as we have in Australia at present, the task is not simply to create work, when work is narrowly defined as that for which one gets paid. The task of society is to employ people in creative activities in which they can feel socially useful. I believe that the majority of people wish to feel socially useful. There are very few people in our society who are really bludgers in the true sense of the word, who want to sponge on the rest of society. Most people want to feel socially useful. There is a whole variety of ways in which they can do that beyond that which is normally accepted today as work. One of the requirements that need to be put in place, if we really are to be forward looking rather than backward looking, is to redefine the nature of work. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, none of this is to be found in the legislation presently before us. If we were to redefine the nature of work, we might discover that much of what is now done in the community, in the way of voluntary and unpaid work-and I use the word advisedly-indeed comprises the main part of economic activity but remains unmeasured because it is work for which no payment is made. I refer to work predominantly carried out by women in the home as wives, in the way of child rearing, and also the work of many, many people in voluntary organisations. Without this work the economy of this country would simply grind to a halt. Because it is not paid for, it remains unmeasured and absolutely silent within the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats, in looking forward, would far prefer to recognise that, in a very productive economy, such as we have at present, the task is to more equitably share out the goods and services that that productive economy makes available. The old-fashioned way of doing that is to make people work-and I use the word now in a narrow sense-for payment, and it does not matter how destructively they work or how useless the work is, work is invented, they are paid for it and are considered to be legitimately participating in the economy. However, that is a ridiculous way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate vision of the Democrats is to have what we would call a national support income, an amount of money that everyone in the community, every Australian citizen, as of right, would be paid. It would be a minimum amount but one on which a person could build by way of paid employment. It would be paid to individuals rather than to families, so that people who chose to stay at home and work in the home and people who chose to do voluntary work would be able to do that also. It would be free of means testing, of course, and free of the poverty traps which would lie just beyond the limit of the national support income. This would remove the vast bureaucracy. With the legislation before us one can anticipate an absolutely Hitlerian bureaucracy to supervise the means tests that are built into it. We would prefer to see a scheme free of means testing and free of the vast bureaucracy necessary to supervise those means tests, a scheme which would lead people to contribute towards our society in ways that they choose for themselves-in other words, it would be a much freer society. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme which is before us, basically, is one which blames the victim. It absolves the Government entirely from responsibility for creating this iniquitous system-this system which means that people can quite literally starve before they become eligible for support. It victimises them further if they infringe the system in any way, often in ways which are to be quite arbitrarily determined by this Hitlerian bureaucracy. It does nothing at all to direct the Government's attention to the fact that it has created the economy. It is the Government which has said that we must have a recession. It is the Government that has created the conditions in which, necessarily, large numbers of people become unemployed and unable to support themselves. Yet we do not find anything in this legislation or elsewhere which recognises this. This is legislation which is victim blaming of the very worst kind. </PARA>
<PARA> We find also that the Government is maintaining, at these times of high unemployment, the importation of the skills component of the migration program. This has allowed, since 1947, the running down of educational programs in this country, the lack of proper training of individuals in this country and the substitution of Australian trained people with migrants. This migration program, since its inception, has been justified partly on the grounds of providing skills which are not available in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If, since 1947, we are still not providing the skilled people necessary in this country, that says something about the sorts of educational and training schemes which successive governments have simply failed to provide. It is about time that we stopped using that excuse, that we stopped the skills migration program and that we began properly training people and properly building the education programs which would, indeed, be the pathway to a clever country. </PARA>
<PARA> As other Democrats have indicated, we are really quite disgusted with this piece of legislation. It is not in any way addressing the twenty-first century problems that we should be looking to. It is not going to build a more just and fairer society. It is not, of itself, going to produce the skills which are necessary for tomorrow. There is nothing in this. It is based on an economic model which is backward looking. The Government and the Opposition still look back to Adam Smith and market forces and the laissez faire market driven mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been very instructive in recent days to hear spokesperson after spokesperson from the Government and the Opposition and, indeed, economic journalists saying, `When the economy recovers we must be positioned so that we can take advantage of that recovery', as though the economy was some disembodied instrument out there, totally out of control and totally not a creature of the creation of this Government. That is the extent to which the Government has deregulated, simply left the economy to market forces and absolved itself entirely of the responsibility for the iniquitous situation in which we now find ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many aspects which our spokesperson on this legislation will address in the committee stage, with quite a large number of amendments. These really deal with the detail, attempting to rescue some modicum of fairness and justice from a basically deeply flawed piece of legislation. I simply conclude by saying that if one had the chance one would scrap this legislation and write a totally different type of Bill altogether. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no purpose in that. We will not be taking the amendments. There is an agreement with the Opposition-and Senator Newman would not know this because she is always behind on these things-that we will be going into the committee stage on these Bills tomorrow. So, no, I am not waiting for that. Why does not Senator Newman listen? It would do her a bit of good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having listened to Senator Alston, as I was saying, it is quite difficult to answer a speech which totally avoided any of the issues so I think I can ignore it. But if one looks through the Opposition's speeches in general, again, there is little of any alternative to what the Government is putting. That makes any reply difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as Senator Patterson's contribution is concerned, there are two things to say. Firstly, I know that she asked a question some time ago in a committee about a legal opinion from the Government. I have received agreement from the Attorney-General's Department for that opinion to be made available to her on a confidential basis. Obviously, we do not publish legal opinions, but we will be contacting Senator Patterson and making that available to her on a confidential basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, she raised some questions which I think really relate to the way that Newstart has worked. One would have to say that the measures in the existing Newstart strategy have proved pretty effective. We have been pleased with them and, until the recession was biting deeply, there had been a big reduction in the number of long term unemployed. What is more, even in the recession, if one looks at the percentages one can still say that that scheme has had its effect in at least trying to minimise the number of long term unemployed as a proportion of total unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> I am more concerned with the contributions of the Australian Democrats because at least I respect the position from which they were coming, I might say, not the position to which they got, but the one from which they were coming which was, I think, worthy of some discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees said quite a few times, as have a number of her colleagues, that they do not basically believe in any scheme of this kind, anyway. I understand some of their worries but, while it is all right for Senator Alston to say that he does not want anyone put on a bureaucratic training roundabout, as he put it, the truth is that Australia's future will very much depend on the skills of its work force. If Australia is to waste an occasion such as this, when so many who are unemployed could be trained and their skills improved not just so that they can be the first to take advantage of the upturn when it comes but also so that the skills of the work force at large are improved, Australia would be missing a golden opportunity. That is certainly not what the Government would have in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of the points that Senator Lees raised were covered in a number of meetings that we had with the Australian Council of Social Service and like groups. Senator Vallentine referred in detail to work for the dole. Perhaps some other senators did; I did not hear every speech in the debate. The Government has never believed and does not believe that this Bill allows work for the dole. So that there can be no doubt, so that no unemployed person in Australia would have to be concerned about this, we will be moving an amendment to make it clear, even to the most obtuse among the Opposition let alone any other grouping in the Parliament but mainly to make it clear to the Australian people, that as a government we would never support such a measure.</PARA>
<PARA> This issue has been raised by a number of Democrats but, basically, it is scaremongering. There will be no work for the dole under this Government. Dr Hewson did suggest that the Opposition would have some, and another issue was visited by him. Senator Alston's response was to try to limit this and say, `No, we will only do it for the over 55s', which is even worse than Dr Hewson's contribution but I am sure that, too, will be dropped before too long. I can assure the Democrats and any of those interested groups in the community who have made representations on the issue that we will not accept it anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been quite a bit of discussion, not so much here tonight but before tonight and referred to by Senator Lees, about the use of the word `reasonable' here and there in the Act. Over the years the word `reasonable' has been introduced into the Act somewhat sporadically and certainly not systematically. It is a matter of concern to me that if we were to add it to this legislation we would be doing no-one any good. Obviously as a principle of administrative law the Government has to be reasonable. Given that this is the Hawke Government, it has always been reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> We will have to ensure that in the administration of the Act we continue to apply those principles which we have been applying all along. Governments are held to account on their reasonableness and that will not go away. It would change absolutely nothing to put `reasonable' into the Act and simply add further to inconsistency. Either we put in every single clause right through legislation such as this that a government should act reasonably or we cut it out. I would be opting for cutting them all out and relying on that general principle of administrative law. </PARA>
<PARA> The line taken by the Democrats and by some in the Opposition that the Newstart program is not appropriate for today's labour market also misses the entire point of the Newstart program. It is not going to be the case that a person who undergoes a training scheme, comes out of that training scheme with his or her skills improved and then finds it impossible to find a job, will suddenly be cut off. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be tremendous flexibility in the preparation of the agreements about which we will be sitting down to talk to individuals to enable us to administer this program with all justice, or perhaps it is better to say `justness' to which Senator Coulter referred towards the end of his speech. As is so often the case, it will depend upon the way the departments administer it rather than the words of the Bill because many of these things finish up in administrative arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure Senator Coulter and Senator Lees that the Government, in the preparation of the agreements that we are talking about, will allow for plenty of flexibility, such as the flexibility that would permit those Aboriginal groups to whom Senator Tambling referred to suffer no injustice and to be placed under no added pressure and the flexibility which would enable those who live in some regional areas that are particularly depressed, and where there are not too many employers, not to knock on the same three doors every week to show that they had been looking for work. Given the flexibility that will exist in the system, we ought to acknowledge that this is a long term strategy, not a short term fix. It is not meant to fix the recession; rather it is meant to address the long term difficulties in improving the skills of the Australian work force, and we will certainly continue to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I share the concerns that Senator Bell expressed. We have to look more broadly, when talking about improving skills and training, than just at universities and technical and further education colleges. Most of the people affected by this program will not be going to those kinds of institutions. There are many ways that skills can be improved without going to universities. I would hope that all honourable senators would understand that. In any event, the industry statement released by the Government earlier this year went a long way in announcing extra places and how much we might do. </PARA>
<PARA> One point raised by Senator Tambling that is also worthy of mention is the question of literacy and numeracy skills. The Government must have a strategy for very early intervention where these deficiencies are discovered. All honourable senators would be aware that many people will go to great lengths to avoid revealing that very deficiency because it is a matter of sometimes considerable personal embarrassment to people that they do not have literacy or numeracy skills. The difficulty we then face is in making real contact with them so that they can explain the extent of the problem and how the Department might be able to give them some advice on how to sort out the problem. Already the Government has announced some considerable funds for that intervention program. I would not pretend that we have done all that we need to do yet. It is a matter that we ought to be looking at further during the course of Budget discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> For many workers it is the lack of a literacy skill that prevents them from getting jobs and it is the skill training that they need. I acknowledge that that needs to be done. I do not need to say anything more about Senator Patterson's contribution. I did say something before she came into the chamber. I am not sure whether she heard it. </PARA>

I also suggest that the cost of such a scheme would far outweigh the benefits. That is perhaps one suggestion that I will not be taking up. That just about covers the contributions of all those in the debate except for that of Senator Walters, and I will not waste too much time covering hers. In summary, this legislation provides the first real guarantees that those unfortunate enough to be unemployed will have a real opportunity for meaningful training and hopefully for better and more secure futures.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of Bills now before the Senate is a very important combination of Bills aimed at reforming the telecommunications environment in Australia. The Opposition, as we have already made plain in the other chamber, supports the competition Bill but opposes the merger Bill. I believe that the competition Bill-if I can describe it as that-although a step forward, is not quite what it seems. It depends critically upon the Australian Telecommunications Authority-Austel. In many respects we have serious concerns about the guaranteed independence of Austel. In the United Kingdom, for example, Oftel, its counterpart regulator, is directly accountable to the Parliament; whereas in Australia Austel is very much the creature of the Minister, an arm of government and very susceptible to ministerial direction. One of the Bills contained in the package provides for an additional amount of funding, of the order of $4.5m, for Austel, but it remains to be seen whether that will be in any way sufficient to ensure that the regulator is able not only to keep a watchful eye on the dominant carrier but also to ensure fair play between the dominant carrier and the new entrant in terms of basic carrier services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is playing for very high stakes in this area. It is quite clear that massive amounts of money will be required to be put up-front by a new entrant, and perhaps that is one of the reasons why the field has already narrowed to two effective consortia. That, I think, in large part reflects the widespread perception, both domestically and abroad, that the restructuring contained in the merger Bill is fundamentally flawed, is driven by the politics of playing to the telecommunications unions and, in this respect-and perhaps in very few others-I would have to say that Mr Keating got it right. The only trouble was he was rolled where it counted; that is, in Cabinet. The dominant players in that game were much more concerned about pandering to the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association and other bodies which were scared stiff about privatisation and the effect that it would have on the unionisation of a private sector work force, and which were not at all concerned to ensure that we have full and dynamic competition, as is the case in the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to stress the fact that to date we have given the rest of the Western world some seven years start. Not only the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan but also many other Western countries are now coming to realise the real virtues of competition in terms of efficiency of service, quality of service and price. Yet what we have here is a government that had every opportunity to learn from those international experiences but instead chose to put a politically flawed deal on the table and then tried to justify it in the marketplace. That is why there is a great deal of nervousness about a new entrant having to fork out something of the order of $3.5 billion over the next seven years to achieve an effective role out of a second network. </PARA>
<PARA> We remain to be convinced that there is any guarantee that the new entrant will achieve 25 per cent of the market. Certainly the comparable experiences in Japan and the United Kingdom suggest that the dominant carrier is likely to have well in excess of 90 per cent after a five-year period. Although I think it is fair to say that both of the two major contenders have very deep pockets and, no doubt, are praying for a change of government so that they will be able to get their shows on the road without being hostage to politically motivated changes, nonetheless they know that they are playing for very high stakes and are critically dependent upon the effectiveness of the regulator to guarantee fair interconnect and to ensure that the pricing regime is one that does not disadvantage them too greatly. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, of course, we have the mammoth monopolist, which has for so many years been able to shelter cosily behind a statute that has given it all and more than any monopolist could dream of, suddenly crying poor. Despite the fact that it made a profit last year of about $1.3 billion and is set to return the same sort of figure this year, it is still crying that it needs another $300m. It has been to the Government and pleaded for more assistance on its balance sheet. It is clearly aware that it is going to be operating with one hand behind its back because it will not be able to get out into the marketplace and raise funds. Yet we have this preposterous proposal for a $1 billion merger fee, which I had hoped the Democrats realised would cripple Telecom Australia; but I am not so sure, from their amendment, that they appreciate that they will simply be allowing the Minister to go right ahead and set that same figure. If I am not right, I am delighted to be corrected. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe we have misread their amendment. I will revisit it overnight. I hope, as we had previously anticipated, that they share our view that this is yet another flawed way of raising funds on the part of the Government. It has nothing to do with trying to ensure reasonable competition between the carriers and it is punishing Telecom quite unnecessarily for being a victim of the political deal that, unfortunately, Senator Richardson and his colleague the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) were not able to deliver when the matter was before Cabinet. As a result of that, we regard the merger proposals as not only a subject of suspicion but also doomed to failure. We would hope to be in a position not only to privatise but also to open up the market in such a way that we would not be stuck with this unholy combination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The duopoly that is intended to prevail until 1997 will be unravelled once we come to government-upon proper notice. We certainly will not accept any obligation to pay compensation. We reject as quite abhorrent the crude attempt on the part of the Government, as contained in clause 70, to allow the Minister to enter into a secret agreement with a second carrier whereby any amount could be provided by way of penalty, quite unrelated to any damages that might flow from the premature, in its eyes, exposure to the marketplace and yet find that the Government is liable to pay perhaps a billion dollar penalty fee. </PARA>
<PARA> That is preposterous nonsense and we would not regard ourselves as being bound by that. Nor should the Government be able to keep a straight face when pretending to the market place that that is a fair arrangement. One would have thought at the very least that any such agreement would have to be tabled and would have to be made public, but there is no such obligation. I treat the mere fact that the Government has had the temerity to propose that in the clause as being indicative of its lack of bona fides in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major matter of concern in relation to unbundling is the ability of Austel to direct carriers to supply services to the public generally if Austel is satisfied about a number of matters. One of those matters is that the carriers' compliance with the direction will not unduly affect the practical ability of the carriers to be the primary suppliers of telecommunications services in Australia. Once again, the opportunities for special pleading are limitless. One can well imagine that it would not be a very difficult task for Telecom to be able to demonstrate on a plausible basis that somehow the practical ability of the carriers to be primary suppliers of telecommunications was jeopardised. </PARA>
<PARA> We used to get the same sort of arguments about community service obligations. Any attempt at all to require Telecom to bear any additional burdens was met with the contention that somehow this would be the end of the dominant carrier as we knew it. I would have thought that at the very least, the powers should be limited to a situation where it would be necessary for the carrier itself to demonstrate that any such changes would prejudice the effective and efficient delivery of telecommunications services. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also additional concerns about the ability of the dominant carrier to set a price regime for itself and its competitor which was different from those prices that would be prevailing for retailers or third parties. This is particularly so in relation to Telecom's ability to offer lower pricing regimes for such products as packet switch services and leased lines which it could easily do for its Auspac service and then to charge other retailers such as Australian Associated Press a higher price for an additional service on the basis that the basic carrier service was the final product. </PARA>
<PARA> We regard that as being pregnant with dangers because it raises the possibility that while the Bills contain lip service to the concept of full reach sale capacity, the practical effect may well be that down the line we will find that 90 per cent of the market for telecommunications services will have been effectively reserved to the carriers and that resellers and value added service providers will be simply marginalised and, given the lead time that will be available, they will find it very difficult to get into the game. So we have great concerns on that score as well. </PARA>
<PARA> This is part of the hidden agenda that is built into the 20-plus discretions which are available to the Minister and which have the capacity to nobble almost any competitive scheme if the Minister were so minded. Therefore, of course, there will be an enormous burden on Austel to ensure not only that there is a level playing field but also that there is a regime in place which allows each of the carriers to provide services on a fair and reasonable basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) continues to shirk another basic issue, that is, whether a third mobile licence will be granted. Given the fact that by the year 2000, something like 70 per cent of all telephone calls will have a mobile component, one would have expected that this critical decision would have been made well before now. Again, that is probably typical of the way in which this Government has managed to duck the hard decisions. It seems to be more absorbed with the politics of the issue. This is certainly not what consumers want. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the fact that the rest of the world has had about a seven-year lead time already, one would have thought that the time for full competition for mobile communications had well and truly arrived. But of course one has to remember that even back in 1980, we were talking seriously about pay television being introduced into this country. We can probably say that it is as far away as ever, not for any logical or technical reason, but simply because of the politics of the issue. That is what disturbs those who have to deal in this dynamic area, one where not only are the growth rates predicted to be higher than almost any other sector of manufacturing or services, but also one where there are enormous export opportunities for Australia if we get it right. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecommunications is currently a $10 billion to $12 billion industry in Australia. Telecom's asset base is something of the order of $15 billion. It is looking at another profit in excess of $1 billion. I have always thought that it had the unique ability to understate its profit and to pitch it at the politically optimum level. It does have very considerable demands for infrastructure and capital outlays, but the fact remains that if we did have truly competitive carriers in this market, if they were not hamstrung by the Government and by the constant shadow of political intervention, they would be able to make a much more significant contribution to our export services' bottom line. </PARA>
<PARA> We do have very significant concerns about the merger. It has been flawed since the outset. It is not going to contribute one iota to having a proper regime in place. It must have been patently obvious to every member of the Cabinet that OTC Ltd, which has had a very impressive record, not only in terms of service provision, but also in terms of efficiency and rate of return, was the obvious competitor to Telecom. Around those two organisations one could have built both a second international and a second domestic carrier. That was a regime that was crying out to be implemented. All those in Cabinet know that the only reason that did not come about was because of the prevalence of political jockeying. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, we do not have an optimum regime. It will be very difficult to restore or achieve that in the short term, but I am confident that, when we have the opportunity to do so, we will unravel much of this unholy collusion that is going on at present. I feel very sorry indeed for those in OTC who I think have always prided themselves on their ability to prosper in the international environment, who were prepared to welcome the competition with open arms. Now we find that they are forced into a backdoor merger with Telecom, which does not have a competitive culture, which despite Austel's pro-competitive charter is going to be a most unwilling partner in most of these enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> Some time ago I noted comments by an American import about the number of jobs that might be lost, particularly in the country division of Telecom, but nothing much has changed in recent times to have suddenly brought that enlightenment about. The fact is that Telecom has always had the capacity to dramatically reduce its work force. In terms of lines per employee, it has a very poor international record. It would have been a very simple matter to have achieved the sorts of redundancies and staff reductions that Telecom achieved in New Zealand, not to the disadvantage of thousands of technicians and others who have managed to achieve one of the greatest featherbeddings in history because most of those people who have been given unlimited opportunities in the private sector to become very real competitors, to have broken the first phone monopoly, to have been prepared to start repairing phones at weekends, to have reduced the waiting time from weeks to perhaps hours and to have started to turn the industry around. Unfortunately, it is business as usual and, as a result, we find that Telecom is going to be dragged screaming and yelling into the twenty-first century. The merger Bill is one that we cannot wear, particularly in regard to the merger fee. I am hopeful that the indications from Senator Kernot tonight bear fruit in the morning. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the competition Bill is concerned, I think I have already indicated that we have some very serious concerns about the way in which competition will come about. But, at the very most, one can say that there are some positive aspects which have been welcomed by industry, and to that extent I think we are prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt in that area. But there will be a need for a very flexible regulatory regime to enable the carriers to take part in, hopefully, the exponential growth that is available in a fully competitive market. I, therefore, move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) condemns the Government's failure to allow reasonable time for consideration of the measure; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) condemns the Government for choosing structural arrangements in telecommunications which do not satisfy the requirements for full micro-economic reform, noting that the bill:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) lacks clarity in important areas;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) leaves significant detail for determination by regulations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) fails to provide for a sufficient degree of independence from Government for Austel;</PARA>
<PARA> all of which factors have the potential to compromise further the development of the truly competitive telecommunications sector required to deliver the promised benefits to consumers and to the Australian economy at large''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Telecommunications Bill 1991 and the six accompanying Bills have a unique capacity to influence the quality of life of each and every Australian. The Bills have the ability to determine how we will relate to each other, how we will work, live and even play. Very few technologies have the ability to touch our lives in this way. The scope, size and comprehensiveness of these Bills indicate that this Government does understand the power of the telephone to change society. Called by the Government at various times micro-economic reform, structural readjustment and deregulation, the sweeping reforms in this Telecommunications Bill and accompanying Bills are bold in concept and execution and obviously part of this Government's wider mission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But like all `visionary' ideas, it takes a giant leap of faith, hope and even great reserves of charity on behalf of the community to accept the totality of that vision. The Australian Democrats do not. We do not believe that competition will necessarily lead to increased productivity and changes in work practices. It is a fact peculiar to telecommunications that technology, as much as competition, is likely to result in lower prices. This is in fact what has happened in this country with respect to STD charges. </PARA>
<PARA> At other times we have seen the implications of this Government's, what I call, blind faith experiment in the area of financial deregulation. Honourable senators have heard me say this before: we oppose the view that deregulation is the ultimate panacea. Deregulation has not delivered the goods across the board. Probably everyone notices that airline schedules still, almost exclusively, coincide. One of the big benefits we were promised with deregulation of the airlines was that they would not. It has not happened. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision whether to deregulate or privatise must be taken on a case by case basis. Tonight, by way of amendment, we will seek to ensure that the domestic telephone user is protected from any failure of this grand vision. Although we disagree with the fundamental assumptions of this Bill, we find some of the numerous acts of omission rather concerting. Belief in deregulation, privatisation and competition is one thing, but asking the rest of us to take so much completely on trust is another. The people of Australia are asked to believe, as an act of faith, that the quality of service afforded to them will at least remain the same, if not improve, even though all overseas experience indicates a decrease in quality of service immediately following deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also expected to believe that the same Government which starved Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines Ltd of vital capital, leading eventually to their privatisation, will meet the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation's billion dollar requirements in the future. We are asked to believe that a price drop in STD and international trunk charges will adequately compensate for allowing a competitor access to the infrastructure we have paid for. </PARA>
<PARA> We are asked to believe that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), in making his directions to the multimillion dollar foreign owned network carrier, will not be influenced by the relationship between the entrance fee and the Budget deficit. We are asked to believe that the 12,000 people working in the $3 billion telecommunications equipment manufacturing industry will not lose their jobs and their career plans when the Government allows unrestricted foreign products into this country. It does take blind faith to believe that the impetus to telecommunications reform did not come from the need to off-load the $600m loss-making satellite failure, Aussat. </PARA>
<PARA> We are asked to believe so much on so little evidence. We are asked to believe, when we do not know the pivotal piece of information-the price the new carrier is expected to pay to access Telecom Australia's infrastructure. This will determine the success or failure of this experiment. Interconnect fees will not be set until after this Bill has passed the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> We are expected to believe that the new entrant will not simply cream skim the top of Telecom Australia's lucrative trunkline markets between central business districts and overseas when we have the British experience of the new entrant, Mercury, as evidence that this may in fact happen. We are asked to believe that competition will work when the Government does not have a national telecommunications plan for the new carrier network. The Minister is waiting for suggestions from the bidders for the new licence. We have no idea of its size, cost, geographic locations, its effects on the environment, or its effects on our cultural heritage or Aboriginal lands, yet we are being asked here tonight to grant this unknown new network carrier immunity from State and Territory laws. </PARA>
<PARA> We are being asked to grant the Minister absolute discretion unquestioningly in the crucial licensing section of the Bill. It is not that we do not trust the present Minister, or any future Minister, or the regulatory body, Austel. It is simply that at this point in time I think we are being asked far too much. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true-and I acknowledge this-that it is difficult to draw up legislation for an industry that is rapidly changing, innovative and dynamic. I understand that the Minister wants flexibility and choices to cope efficiently with the changing needs of society. The successful new bidder will need some kind of certainty as an incentive to invest the billions of dollars. We understand these needs. But why should the consumer take all of the giant leaps of faith? Why should the new entrant have the guarantee when the people of Australia have none?</PARA>
<PARA> The basic assumption behind these Bills is that competition per se will improve the quality of our telephone communication service or, at least, the quality will not deteriorate; after all, the force of competition should apply equally to services and customers. But competition does not apply equally to all services and/or all customers. There is a powerful incentive, called the profit motive, to allocate attention and resources away from the services where competition is weak to services where competition is new and strong. This package of Bills before us now has the single-minded objective of maximising the choice of a telecommunications carrier for the minority of customers. </PARA>
<PARA> In advanced mobile societies, access to the telephone can be regarded as an essential requirement of active citizenship. If these Bills go through the Senate unamended, Australia faces becoming a society divided into information and communications rich and information and communications poor as the fundamentals of telecommunications policy have been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> Nowhere is this more obvious than in some of the omissions I referred to earlier. Where in these Bills or the accompanying press releases is there a national policy that will contribute to regenerating this alien economy and provide industrial competitiveness? Where is the strategy for telecommunications to contribute to cohesiveness in this vast landscape? The network roll-out plan, which is jargon for the geographic location of the new telecommunications carrier network, is still undecided. Since the network location will be decided by market forces, it is self-evident that, unless stringent licence conditions are applied, the new entrant to the market will compete only at the lucrative end, which is the multinational trunk line users and the multisite companies. They will benefit from major reductions in the prices of STD and international calls. But the majority of Australians, the 80 per cent who do not use telephones for data transmission or business trunk calls, may end up unwittingly subsidising these businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> There are good reasons why the interests of the majority, the 80 per cent of the population, need to be the focus of telecommunications policy. Each and every Australian has already made a fundamental investment in that network to the tune of $3,500 for every ordinary household. Ordinary Australians have already paid to establish a network and a satellite system from which big business in particular will gain an enormous profit at their expense. It is for this reason that I will move a number of amendments to even the odds for the majority of telephone users who have been ignored or have had less emphasis placed upon them by those who have formulated the policy of maximising choice for the minority. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Telecommunications Bill 1991 and the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Bill 1991 provide that Telecom Australia be the universal service provider and that Telecom alone will bear the burden of the 80 per cent majority of telephone users, it is difficult to see how the Government's stated goal of maximising the choice of the telecommunications network supplier can contribute to the maintenance of a universal service, given the inevitable concentration by the new entrant, or entrants after 1997, on those customers with the highest revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government has been so busy tilting the level playing field heavily in favour of the new foreign owned entrant against the incumbent Telecom that the paying public's contribution and shareholding in the new AOTC is ignored. For perfectly sound economic reasons, Telecom's competitor is likely to be interested in only the profitable heavy trunk line traffic and the new mobile telephone network. It will be uneconomic for the new carrier to supply telephone services to homes. As a result, Telecom will be forced to compete and drop prices in the high density STD and international calls areas but, at the same time, will be expected to cater to the unprofitable 80 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The key issues which will determine Telecom's ability to provide a universal service have been omitted from these Bills. The interconnect fee, the price which the new carrier will have to pay Telecom to access Australia's $20 billion telecommunications infrastructure, has not been decided. Instead, the Government has left the starting date off the AOTC merger Bill as a spur to Telecom to set an accessible interconnect fee. The Democrats wish to break that nexus with an amendment which will put a start date on the merger otherwise, I believe that Telecom and OTC Ltd employees will suffer unnecessarily because of the extended uncertainty involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Other key elements which will determine whether Telecom can meet its universal service obligation have also been left out of these Bills. The Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1991, which merges the assets of OTC and Telecom into a new body corporate, does not include a capital structure for the newly formed AOTC. We have attempted to redress this with an amendment that leaves the board and the Minister plenty of scope to find creative solutions. Although a publicly owned company, denied the protection of the shield of the Crown, AOTC is unable to borrow funds to recapitalise its telecommunications network without what first seems to be like begging the Loan Council for permission. Since the Loan Council has withheld that permission for two years now, we have no guarantee that AOTC will have access to the massive capital it needs to upgrade. Without that capital to improve the network, the 80 per cent majority of telephone users-the ones we are talking about-will suffer deteriorating service and quality. I intend to move a number of amendments which will protect consumers just in case the vision fails and they are left with a deteriorating service. When and if the quality of service does decline, the majority of telephone users will not be able to do much about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Telecommunications Bill 1991, one of the functions of Austel, Australia's telecommunications regulator, is the protection of consumers from unfair practices of the carrier. This Bill does not charge Austel with the specific function of ensuring that the overall interests of the Australian community are taken into consideration in the development and the promotion of the telecommunications industry. The problem for domestic telephone users is that they are not a single, well organised interest group, unlike many of the other participants in this multi-billion dollar decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumers have no redress other than to the Federal Court of Australia if they do not like a decision made by the Minister, particularly pertaining to licence conditions for the new carrier. Clause 69 of the Bill provides that the Minister may request Austel to prepare a report in respect of proposed licence conditions under sections 64 and 65, but he is not obliged to do so. Austel may only participate in the process at the invitation of the Minister, since many licence conditions have the potential to impact significantly on both business and domestic telephone users as well as specific segments of the community. Although it will be possible to challenge a decision of the Minister in the Federal Court, in practice this option will be limited because of the prohibitive cost. A person who unsuccessfully challenges the Minister faces not only his own legal costs but also government costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move a number of amendments to the Bills to provide a mechanism which is both efficient and convenient for ensuring that the public interest is taken into account without delay in the decision making process. I will also move amendments which give Parliament the right to disallow decisions of the Minister with regard to licensing and which disallow decisions by Austel where the Minister has delegated his power. Not so long ago Queensland, my home State, provided Australians with evidence of what can happen when an executive ceases to be accountable to parliament. Those famous or infamous words, `Now, don't you worry about that', motivate me to take the necessary steps to ensure maximum parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> In the unusual government initiated consultation process over these telecommunication Bills-a process which I want to commend to other Ministers who may find the necessary stamina-I have to say that I did come away with the distinct impression on some occasions that many lobbyists, staffers, bureaucrats and political journalists thought it was quite a bad idea to boost the ability of legislatures to curb executives. This is a profoundly worrying trend because it is based on the conviction that what this country needs is not more democratic checks and balances but more efficient-or some vague notion of what `efficient' to them means-government. </PARA>
<PARA> This attempt to bypass Parliament is something of which we are seeing more. It does not justify leaving major decisions involving our infrastructure to private deals between any Minister and a multi-billion dollar foreign conglomerate. I am not suggesting impropriety, but I do believe that Parliament's functions are to scrutinise legislation, to keep a check on the Executive, to oversee public expenditure and to be the ventilator of grievances. The Telecommunications Bill 1991 gives the Minister absolute discretion over the appointment of a new carrier, and declaring, varying and revoking licences. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, we are being asked to speculate on political futures. As events this week have shown, it is all too easy for a Minister to be returned to the back bench overnight leaving undone private promises, commitments, and a nod and a wink with undertakings to industry, businesses, consumers and other political parties. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight only briefly, primarily for the purpose of tabling, with the leave of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), a document which arises as a result of two legal opinions-presumably all opinions given by the Attorney-General's Department are legal-in respect of the National Health Act 1953 and the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1991. Both these Acts contain the standard secrecy provisions. The sensible interpretation given in the past has been that the Parliamentary Privileges Act prevails in respect of those matters. However, more recently, the Solicitor-General has given an opinion which goes to the heart of the powers of both the Senate and Senate committees, particularly in respect of privilege. The proposition that is proffered by the Solicitor-General is that, if a witness is subpoenaed before a committee of the Senate and under coercion is required to provide information to that committee and is in breach of the secrecy provisions contained within the Act, he would then be committing a criminal offence for which he could be sent to gaol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Privileges Act itself makes quite clear the consequences for any witness that does not answer, does not appear and does not provide information as requested. I do no more than seek leave to table an opinion. I have asked the Clerks of the Senate to give me an opinion on the conflict between the opinion that the Solicitor-General has given and that which I have understood to be the previous case. I was proposing then with adequate notice to ask Senator Tate during Question Time to give me a considered opinion as to what the real position is in respect of the secrecy provisions and of the committees generally. I seek leave to table a letter to me by the Clerk of the Senate dated 3 June which simply sets out his view in respect of the Solicitor-General's opinion. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The variables in the Regional Staffing Model are, by client type:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) client populations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) new claims.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the following fixed adjustments are made to the outcome determined by (a) and (b):</PARA>
<PARA> * ratios for unmeasured work categories;</PARA>
<PARA> * ratios to incorporate relief factors;</PARA>
<PARA> * a statistical calibration factor set at the time of the work measurement to ensure that the measurement did not produce an outcome different from the then existing staffing levels;</PARA>
<PARA> * a factor which determines the number of managerial staff in Regional Offices; and</PARA>
<PARA> * a fixed addition for social work and welfare staffing.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The parameters or weighting used for the variables identified above when the Regional Staffing Model was last used to adjust departmental allocations to each of its State administrations for workload changes in its regional office network were the following:</PARA>
<PARA> * Client population and new claims data were the best estimates existing at the time of the application of the model for average numbers for each benefit type for the 1990/91 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> * Activity ratios are used to determine the workload associated with client populations. These ratios are a combination of historical and current activity data extracted from the Department's pension, benefit and allowance processing systems. These counts are weighted by standard times for each work category. The times are determined primarily by the results of statistical work measurement exercises and are agreed by the Departments of Social Security and Finance and the Public Sector Union.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The principle the Department has used and will continue to use to determine when it re-runs the model to vary regional office staffing levels is one of balancing the need to match accurately resourcing levels to workloads with providing a degree of stability in the level of resourcing against which its regional management is required to budget.</PARA>
<PARA> In practice, the number of times that the re-running of the model will result in variations to staffing levels will depend mainly on the extent to which the projections of client numbers used in the previous run of the model have proved to be accurate. In this context, while client number projections are under continual review, there are three major points in any year where the projections and hence staffing levels are reconsidered. These are in the period immediately prior to the beginning of the financial year, immediately after a Budget is brought down and at the mid point of a financial year. It is anticipated that these will continue to be major review points.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Department allocates resources for its regional office network to each of its State administrations on the basis of the one model. (The exception to this is resources associated with workload variations arising outside the range of work covered by the measurements underlying the model, eg: adjustments associated with policy initiatives implemented after the model's work measurements.) While a single model is employed for this purpose, it takes account of variations between States in characteristics which affect workloads.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, while exact arrangements vary between State administrations, each allocates resources to its Area administrations using formulae based on the Regional Staffing Model but which take account of local conditions. In turn, Area administrations take further account of local factors in distributing resources to each Regional Office.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department is undertaking two major adjustments to enhance these processes.</PARA>
<PARA> * From 1 July 1991, resources will be allocated nationally direct to the Area level of the Department's administration. This corresponds to the removal of the State tier from the Department's structure and will streamline the allocations processes.</PARA>
<PARA> * The Regional Staffing Model is being reviewed and restructured in association with the Public Sector Union. This will ensure that the model remains up to date. In the processes, the issue of recognising local factors which affect resource requirements will be addressed further.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) ``There is currently no specific limitation on arsenic and cadmium in seaweed in the Food Standards Code. The `All other foods' category of the Code permits total arsenic to a maximum of 1 mg/kg and cadmium to a maximum of 0.05 mg/kg. Recommendations are going forward to the National Food Standards Council to amend the Code to permit the following standard for seaweed (85% moisture content)</PARA>
<PARA> - inorganic arsenic</PARA>
<PARA>maximum permitted concentration 1.0 mg/kg</PARA>
<PARA> - cadmium</PARA>
<PARA>maximum permitted concentration 0.2 mg/kg</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Several recent shipments of seaweed were found to contain more than the permitted levels of total arsenic and cadmium under the `All other foods' category including one which contained more than 100 times the permitted level of total arsenic. One sample was found to contain more than 40 times the permitted level of cadmium. The shipments were detained by AQIS pending the receipt of test results to determine the level of inorganic arsenic present and, then for advice from the Department of Community Services and Health about the implications for human health of the levels of arsenic and cadmium reported.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Japanese Embassy made representations to AQIS and the Department of Community Services and Health to establish the basis for Australia's concerns about the safety of seaweed and kelp products.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) On the basis of expert advice received from the Department of Community Services and Health most shipments were considered to have inorganic arsenic and cadmium levels within acceptable limits and were permitted importation. Because of that assessment, there was no necessity to identify the seaweed in the manner suggested.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Department of Community Services and Health advises that the Public Health Committee at its meeting on 15 March 1991 concluded that there was no immediate evidence of significant danger to health from the presence of inorganic arsenic up to 1.0 mg/kg or cadmium up to 0.2 mg/kg. These limits are the same as those applying for fish and fish products in the Food Standards Code. The Public Health Committee has now recommended to the National Food Standards Council that these revised interim standards be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) A number of shipments were released prior to the meeting of the Public Health Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Department of Community Services and Health has advised that arsenic is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer on the basis of epidemiological evidence in situations of high natural or occupational exposure to inorganic arsenic. It has been associated with basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin as well as with a pre-neoplastic form of dermatitis, known as Bowen's disease.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The Department of Community Services and Health has advised that a Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake for inorganic arsenic in food has been established by the FAO/WHO Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants (JECFA) on the basis of toxicological data presented to it. Results of analysis for arsenic levels in food conducted as part of the Australian Market Basket Survey show levels of arsenic to be very low in the diet, well below the JECFA recommended Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake. It would therefore seem unlikely that there is an association between dietary intake of arsenic and skin carcinoma in Australia. The high incidence of skin cancer found in Australia is more likely to be associated with exposure to UV radiation in sunlight.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) I am advised that the arsenic found in fish and other marine organisms is in the form of arsenobetaine. In all of the seaweed varieties which have been analysed thus far the arsenic is in the form of arsenofuranosides.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) The Department of Community Services and Health advises that considerable evidence indicates that arsenobetaine is toxicologically inert and is excreted unchanged in both animals and humans. The evidence for the arsenofuranosides is more limited but indicates that partial metabolism to simpler organic arsenic compounds occurs followed by rapid excretion. There is no evidence of conversion to inorganic arsenic in either case and no indication of toxicity in humans.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) See answer to question 6.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) Yes, it is possible for State authorities to prohibit the sale of any foods which do not comply with State food laws.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Department no longer has staff who work only as counter officers. Alterations to the Administrative Service Officer structure following the introduction of the Second Tier Wage Agreement have resulted in counter and assessment work being combined into a new designation of Counter Assessor. This designation is at the Grade 3 level (AS03) and increases in the numbers of staff at that level since 1 July 1990 are set out below.</PARA>
<PARA> The increases do not reflect solely the increase to workload associated with rising numbers of unemployment beneficiaries. There is a range of other factors which have affected numbers of staff at various classification levels over the same period. Most particularly, the Department introduced a new on-line computer processing system in its offices which increased requirements for staffing resources at the AS03 level (but with larger reductions at lower classification levels).</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to separate accurately the impact that this change had on requirements for AS03 staff from that of rising unemployment beneficiary numbers. Decisions on resources to be deployed at particular classification levels are a matter for local managers and are influenced by local factors.</PARA>

<PARA> * STRATHFIELD (-1) where there was a small decline in the client populations in that region;</PARA>
<PARA> * CAIRNS (-2) where there was an internal staffing reorganisation resulting from efficiencies deriving from improved workflows together with a reduction in the number of seasonally employed staff;</PARA>
<PARA> * ROCKHAMPTON (-3) where there was a reduction in the number of seasonally employed staff;</PARA>
<PARA> * WOODRIDGE (-10) where staff were transferred to the newly opened BEENLEIGH office which assumed responsibility for part of the client workload dealt with at WOODRIDGE; and</PARA>
<PARA> * BROOME (-3) where staff were transferred to the KUNUNURRA office which assumed responsibility for part of the client workload dealt with at BROOME.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Since 1 July 1990 the Department has increased and improved the range of training available for public contact staff. These have included training programs in respect of skills essential for public contact as well as technical training in the entitlement conditions applied to social security payments. In addition, over the same period there has been extensive training undertaken in respect of the introduction of new computing systems and the ``plain English'' Social Security Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) The department as a whole has no overall policy on the use of direct marketing. The department consists of seven principal operating groups which reflect the functions in the portfolio.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 9 May 1991:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) Has a monitoring program been initiated to gauge public response to The Energy Guide recently launched by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) What are the details of the program, in particular the: (a) total funding; (b) duration; (c) organisation(s) conducting it; and (d) aims and objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) Is it a fact that the program is designed to gauge awareness of the guide and its information, and not the degree to which it changes purchasing decisions; if so, why has this approach been taken, considering that the effectiveness of the guide depends on its success in changing purchasing patterns.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) A monitoring program is being implemented to measure changes in community awareness of, attitudes towards and responses to greenhouse and energy issues, against a benchmark study carried out earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) (a) Estimated cost of the monitoring program is $72 000 for telephone interviews of a stratified random sample of 2000 people.</PARA>
<PARA>(b) The monitoring is being undertaken in blocks of 8 weeks, extending over a period of 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA>(c) The organisation undertaking the monitoring is Quantum Market Research of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA>(d) Objectives of the monitoring are to:</PARA>
<PARA> * monitor trends in community awareness of, attitudes and reported responses to, energy and greenhouse issues</PARA>
<PARA> * track the impact on community awareness and response levels of individual initiatives undertaken as part of the Government's enhanced energy management program</PARA>
<PARA> * assist with evaluation of the program and fine tuning of specific community-oriented initiatives to maximise effectiveness</PARA>
<PARA>(3) No. A number of factors will have a bearing on the perceptions of the community at large about energy and greenhouse issues, including activities undertaken by governments and other bodies. Included among the Commonwealth's activities are the community-oriented initiatives of the energy management program, of which the Guide is a major component. The monitoring program addresses all of these influences and their relative importance in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>The Guide itself should not be interpreted as simply encouraging the purchase of more efficient appliances. It deals with all aspects of home energy efficiency, and monitoring is designed to identify the extent of reported improvement in all aspects.</PARA>
