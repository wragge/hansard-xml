<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Telecom is selling 0055 telephone networks to private contractors who provide offensive and sexually explicit recorded messages to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The providers of these services are advertising in the pages of Australian newspapers in a manner which is designed to titillate and attract calls from the whole community and thus play on the curiosity of children.</PARA>

<PARA> That we, the undersigned, call for the full and total recognition, by Federal Parliament and the High Court and all government agencies that Australia is a Christian Commonwealth according to law and its heritage traditions and customs.</PARA>

<PARA>1. The Adoption of a Christian National Anthem-``God Bless Australia'' to the tune of ``Waltzing Matilda''.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The adoption of a Christian National Motto-``One Nation Under God'', for use on our coins, banknotes, etc.</PARA>

<TITLE>Higher Education in ACT</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. We, the undersigned, wish to signify our strong opposition to the Chubb Report on Higher Education for the A.C.T. which proposes that the Institute of Advanced Studies be separated from the Faculties of the Australian National University and the Faculties be amalgamated with the University of Canberra. We believe that the implementation of these proposals would mean the destruction of the Australian National University's national and international high standing and firmly established reputation as a centre of excellence in research and scholarship. The dismemberment of the ANU would severely effect the ability of both the Institute and the Faculties to attract, or even retain, high quality academic staff, funding and support. It would also adversely affect the recruitment of top students. The maintenance of the Australian National University, as it is now constituted,-a national university with an international, national and local role-is of vital importance to the A.C.T. and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>2. We call on the Senate to reject the recommendations of the Chubb report and to support the integrity of the ANU and the existing relationship between the Institute and the Faculties.</PARA>

<PARA>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, which provides for Commonwealth grants of financial assistance to the States, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and higher education institutions for the provision of higher education. The Bill provides increased funding for higher education institutions totalling some $171m over the 1991 to 1993 triennium. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Government's cost supplementation arrangements, the Bill provides for additional expenditure over the 1991 to 1993 triennium amounting to some $148m to take account of movements in the Department of Employment, Education and Training's Higher Education Salary and Non-salary Indexes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for $4.7m to be transferred, in each year of the 1991 to 1993 triennium, from the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1988 to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The purpose of this transfer, agreed to between the Commonwealth and the Queensland State Government, is to enable higher education courses in Queensland which are currently located within the TAFE sector to be transferred to the higher education sector and funded as higher education courses. This will provide a more appropriate location for the future development of these courses, and will bring course provision in Queensland into line with that in other States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill takes account of altered arrangements for the Special Overseas Postgraduate Fund to enable expenditure under this Program to be spread over the period 1991 to 1994. Originally, $4.3m was notionally allocated for expenditure in 1990/91. The re-allocation of this money is designed to allow for a properly structured program and does not change the approved overall level of funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the transfer to 1991 of $2.2m in unexpended funds from the 1990 higher education research program. In addition, the Bill takes account of revised amounts for re-imbursement of HECS revenue to the States for State-funded places. These revisions have been made on the basis of up-dated information, obtained from the States, on the number of such places eligible for re-imbursement. Some $7m in additional expenditure will be provided for this purpose over the 1991 to 1993 triennium. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>STATES GRANTS (TAFE ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA> The States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991 provides for supplementation to existing grants to the States for TAFE to reflect increases in price levels and adjusts funding levels to reflect the transfer of certain higher education places from the TAFE sector to the Higher Education sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The net effect of these changes is that the Bill provides for a reduction in funding levels of $0.386 million, the total available for technical and further education now being $358.201 million for 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Senate adjourned last night, I was speaking about the amendments that the Australian Democrats intend to move to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1991. Two of those amendments refer to the structure of the Bill which we believe, in at least those two areas, is deficient. I was paying tribute to the detailed work that Senator Watson has done on the provisions of the Bill, but there are two areas which have escaped his attention and which I understand do not enjoy his support, and I regret that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similarly, I am told that the Government is disinclined at this stage to support the amendments, and I wonder why that is so. One of them seeks to ensure that bad debts for which tax deductibility is obtained by companies, particularly financial institutions, that are operating overseas cannot be avoided. That tax deductibility is shifted to another country where there are no taxation agreements with Australia and, in this way, the tax deductibility is utilised for tax avoidance purposes. The Australian Democrats believe that part IVA should be hauled in at this point and that the onus should be on the taxpaying entity in that case to show that the transaction that has been used, which will achieve a tax benefit for the entity, has other normal commercial purposes as well. It is a loophole that should be closed and I again call on both the Opposition and the Government to assist us in closing it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that the Democrats believe deserves some attention is the extension of depreciation and other allowances for Australian companies engaged in commercial activities overseas, including building and construction activities. We believe that we should provide tax incentives for companies investing in Australia, not tax incentives for companies investing offshore. Once again, this measure deserves support from both the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three other amendments which the Democrats will move. They seek to deny tax deductibility in three cases. In the case of high executive salaries, we believe that tax deductibility should be denied to salaries in excess of $200,000. The second item which we believe should not enjoy tax deductibility privileges in our system is the advertising of tobacco and alcohol. Yesterday I put on record the fact that drug abuse costs the Australian community more than $14.3 billion every year. Taxpayers should not be asked to subsidise that sort of expenditure, that sort of damage to our community. Finally, there is an amendment which seeks to deny tax deductibility for conferences held overseas by Australian organisations. If a professional organisation-be they doctors, engineers, architects, or whatever-has a conference in Hawaii, we do not see why the Australian taxpayer should subsidise such a joy-ride. </PARA>

Unless it can be shown that it is an international conference, we are quite happy to agree that tax deductibility should apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are seeking to knock on the head by this amendment is an Australian organisation holding a conference overseas for no reason other than wishing to have that conference in that location and enjoy, at the taxpayers' expense, a joy-ride. These are the amendments that the Democrats will move at the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1991, which was formerly the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1990. It is an omnibus Bill covering a host of not necessarily related amendments. This Bill, amongst other things, gives effect to the personal income tax cuts that were announced in the Budget last year and brought into existence on 1 January 1991 and provides consequential amendments to the medical rebate. There are also measures which allow more accessibility to roll-over relief from capital gains liability and relief measures to remove potential for double taxation on foreign earnings. I will address these three points in more detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill will amend the income tax rates to reduce the lowest rate-that is, $5,401 to $20,700-from 21 per cent to 20 per cent. The Government tells us it is forgoing income of $430m in 1990-91 and $1 billion in a full year. It seems a big reduction when one looks at the overall Budget-and $1 billion is a considerable reduction-but when it comes down to the individual person on the top end of the lowest rate, which is $20,000, there is only a $200 saving. However, I suppose that, for one person, a $200 saving in a tax bill is certainly better than nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to the medical rebate. The lowering of the tax rate also lowers the rebate that persons get on money they spend medically over $1,000. The rebate will come down in direct proportion. The Government says that it will save $1m in one year in forgone deductions; in other words, it is credited to the Australian Taxation Office or Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, capital gains tax relief will be more accessible for asset transfers within a company group. Where there is a change of assets between one fully owned company and another with totally the same shareholders, there is some liability, whether intended or unintended, for capital gains tax. This Bill will relieve that situation. Previous anti-avoidance rules required the issue of shares or security across the two companies to be of equal value and, when transferred, as a consideration of the transfer. We now have new provisions in the Bill where there is deemed to be a transfer of assets. If the shareholders of the company that is taking the assets lose effective control, then they will be liable for capital gains tax. Of course, the situation now is a lot clearer, more defined, and is necessary to make sure that there is no escaping the capital gains tax liabilities. These are the major provisions contained in the Bill, though there are some other minor ones. Irrespective of whether they are considered minor or major, they are there. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this Bill is a continuation of this Government's ever-changing taxation legislation. Far too many amendments have been introduced. The explanatory memorandum is of record thickness. Obviously, this ever-growing taxation Act-I believe that it has increased six times in volume in not much more than the time I have been in this Parliament-means that measures are introduced without much research and thought and anomalies appear as time goes by. We have continual amendments. At least three or four times a year, with Senator McMullan on the other side leading for the Government, we sit in this chamber debating amendments to rectify the legislation. It is time that we wrote a complete new tax Act to sort those things out. Hopefully, we would not then be debating the legislation so often. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that we are paid to be here to debate these amendments in the Senate but further calculations have to be made and further hardships occur outside this place as a result of the amendments. One area that is affected is the continual increase in the cost of accounting. If we take a survey of the costs of businesses, we find that the accountancy fees for filing taxation returns and meeting statutory obligations have virtually doubled in Australia during the past two years. Senator McMullan is looking at me in surprise. I do not know whether he pays an accountant to prepare his taxation returns, but I do and I have noticed that the fees have doubled during the past two years, and I think they have quadrupled in --</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because Senator McMullan is making so much money. Although Senator McMullan might be on a semi-Minister's salary, I am not. The situation is that accountancy fees are increasing and it is a growing concern. We could address that matter if we rewrote the tax Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to other measures that this Government has taken during the past eight years-the ad hoc legislation it brings in and takes out. It gets back to the point I have already made about increasing accountancy fees. Honourable senators can see that. I have pointed many times to the number of measures introduced in the past few years which have then had to be taken out again. The first turnaround was probably about the ban on negative gearing. I know that former Senator Haines carried on about this in the Parliament during her long term here. The Government saw the folly of its ways when it introduced that measure because a turnaround in housing investment followed, and it had to change its policies. That measure worked against the Government and it pulled it out again because of public pressure and lack of investment. </PARA>
<PARA> We then had the famous jealousy tax-the luxury tax on cars. As will be seen from the Forward Estimates that will come before the Senate next week in connection with the luxury tax on cars, the Government is saying that withdrawing the tax in accordance with the industry statement will cost the revenue $400m. I do not know how the Government arrives at that figure. Senator McMullan, the semi-Minister at the table, might be able to tell us. That tax was supposed to raise $100m when it was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during the last Federal election campaign, for use on the black spots on the roads mainly in New South Wales and probably in other places. Figures published have shown that instead of an extra $100m being raised in sales tax on cars, there has been a loss of about $350m due to the lack of car sales. I suppose that there are certain other reasons why cars in general have not been selling in the current economic downturn. But how can the Government say that $400m in revenue is forgone by removing the luxury tax when it knows that it would have produced a negative result?</PARA>
<PARA> A few weeks ago when I asked Senator Button a question-I am still waiting for his answer-he did give an indication to the Senate that the luxury tax certainly was not working in that way. I have spoken to the motor dealers of higher priced cars, as well as the dealers of lower priced cars, and have been informed that even in the last fortnight there seems to have been a certain upturn in the sale of cars since the luxury tax, or jealousy tax, has been removed. This may not be attributed completely to the removal of that tax; it could be attributed partly to the lowering of interest rates that we have finally had in Australia in the last few months. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to another tax that the Government introduced, I think in 1983-that is, the sales tax on hand tools used in production, primary industry and mining. It was not restricted to those areas, but they had been exempt before. The sales tax on tools was applied right across the board. In the industry statement of a month ago the tax was removed. So there is to be another change to the legislation and another change for retailers. Whether they have to charge sales tax is creating further confusion. Nonetheless, it is something that the Government has had to turn around on. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 or 1984 the Government introduced a sales tax on lubricants; in other words, lubrication oil in motors. We had the ridiculous situation at one stage where there was a sales tax on oil at one end of a machine and not on the oil at the other end. It was practically the same oil-one was engine lubricating oil and the other was hydraulic oil-yet sales tax applied to one and not to the other. One had to make certain applications and meet statutory requirements when one bought this sort of oil and that created confusion. The Government fixed that confusion by putting the sales tax on the whole lot. The Government has now seen how things are going and has taken the sales tax off again. </PARA>
<PARA> Sales tax, as a whole, certainly needs revamping. Of course we have the agenda for that when we are in government-a goods and services tax-but that will probably be a couple of years away. The Government has a couple of years to sort out a few of these things before it finally exits from government in this and the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to depreciation. The Government has had various goes at depreciation since it has been in office. Because of the concerns of the former Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, the depreciation schedules were changed from applying to not necessarily the life of a machine, the life of a tool, or the life of anything, to some schedule worked out by himself, his advisers or the Australian Taxation Office, which was totally ridiculous and unrelated to what one would normally use. The Government, once again, had to turn around and change that in the industry statement of last month. I give the Government some credit for the fact that it has brought depreciation more into line with the worthwhile life of machines that industy uses. For example, computer hardware and software change rapidly. In fact, technology changes in months rather than in years. People should be able to write off their equipment over a shorter period. </PARA>
<PARA> The same can be said of heavy machinery used in the mining industry, to which I am very close. One can write a machine off in the life of a project. If an open cut mine is developed and lasts only two years, I presume that machinery bought solely for that purpose will be looked at in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to a point that Senator Spindler mentioned-that is, an investment allowance on Australian made goods. We had quite a liberal investment allowance in the days of the Fraser Government, and I believe it did a lot to encourage developers, farmers and miners to reinvest in plant in their businesses, which did help the economy of Australia. But, once again, when this Government came into power, the investment allowance virtually disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA> The fringe benefits tax has been a great mishmash since it was introduced by this Government. If we look at a Price Waterhouse publication of last month, which dealt with this matter, we see that in that booklet alone there is enough to fill half the taxation Act. This publication relates solely to the fringe benefits tax and certain unintended consequences of its introduction. The tax was introduced mainly to deal with the car and housing situation of employees, no matter where they were in Australia. It has spread from one thing to another and now we almost need a bible to cover just the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This is probably the most obnoxious tax to hit the remote areas of Australia that could have been introduced by any government. Originally I fully supported the fringe benefits tax measures because I believed there were too many rorts in the system by which wages were transferred into non-taxable benefits, but we have to look at what sorts of benefits are non-taxable. I believe that an employer paying the school fees of the children of an employee living in the centre of Sydney, Melbourne, Perth or Adelaide should pay tax on that benefit. He should be hit with a fringe benefits tax. But an employer providing accommodation on the edge of the Gibson Desert in a mining camp, oil camp or whatever is not providing any fringe benefit whatsoever. He will not get anyone out there unless he provides housing. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention another point that was raised only a few weeks ago by a headmaster of a school in Perth. It is a boarding school working on a house system. There is a family looking after, say, 160 boys aged from 12 to 17 in a family situation. This family lives in the end of a four-story block with 160 adolescent boys. Can anyone tell me where the fringe benefit is in those quarters? The person in charge and spouse are at the beck and call of those boys. If somebody has a stomach ache or whatever at three o'clock in the morning, they must attend. Can someone tell me why the supply of those quarters is classed as a fringe benefit? Those people have to live there and to put up with what is there. Does that qualify for fringe benefits tax or not?</PARA>
<PARA> The capital gains tax introduced by this Government is the one we were not going to have, but we have got it. Of course, the unintended consequences of the capital gains tax are also the subject of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to go through the Democrat amendments of Senator Spindler, which he told us about some time ago. I do not think the first amendment is necessary; it is self-evident. He talks of certain wages or salaries which are not deductible. The amendment says that the following should not be deductible:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in respect of that amount of the salary or wages of an employee which exceeds $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that this is another jealousy amendment by the Australian Democrats and I leave that point there. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night, Senator Spindler talked about the way in which investment in Australia encourages companies to go offshore. I know why companies go offshore. Because of the work practices in this country and because they cannot make a profit. But what better way to drive our top personnel offshore than a proposal such as that suggested by the Democrats? Can I be told what more could be done to drive them offshore? For a suitably qualified person I do not think $200,000 is such a high figure when one has in mind top management and top surgeons for instance. Surgeons are hardly on wages, although they could be in certain hospitals. What better way is there to drive such people offshore? This is what will happen if we do not reward excellence and if these things are not deductible. I think that the proposal is ridiculous. The amendments also provide that a deduction should not be allowable in respect of overseas travel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wait a moment. It related to overseas expenses to do with conferences. Senator Spindler went on to explain how that would work where a totally Australian conference is held overseas. On the surface we might listen to his argument, but other things are learnt overseas apart from what is learnt at the conference. Travel is an education in itself. A good friend of mine told me 20 years ago that, if I wanted to keep up with what was happening in my industry, I should travel to the United States of America at least every two years. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to take up his suggestion. But when I did start to travel to those places I learned by observing what was happening and by talking to people in those countries. So people learn at a conference or seminar in Singapore, New York or London. For example, one might confer with colleagues in those foreign lands whom one may not actually meet at the conference being attended. The whole process is a learning curve and the experience gained in those countries can be brought back to Australia. Therefore, the Democrats argument on that score is ridiculous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that my time is running out in this debate, but I will mention something that happened in Western Australia in regard to rubbish disposal. I know that it has hardly anything to do with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill but, back in the 1950s, a racing car driver I know went to the United States. He went there not to attend a conference but for a motor race. While he was there he saw the mobile disposal methods involving big steel bins and so on. Because that man went to America and saw the process in operation, that system was up and running in Perth before it happened anywhere else in Australia. That indicates the side benefits of attending overseas conferences. We live and learn wherever we go. Therefore, I believe that it is ridiculous to cut off overseas travel deductibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Other points put forward by the Australian Democrats are totally ridiculous. The Democrats appear to think that Australia has a mortgage on all knowledge if they feel that we should not confer with overseas people. Does Senator Spindler want other countries to take the same view and cut Australia off their visiting list and not hold international conferences in this country when they would be on the learning curve and we could be learning from them?</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's taxation laws need a total review so that we will not be in this situation again. My colleague in the House of Representatives, Mr Prosser, has just issued a very good paper on the benefits that would accrue to Australia under a Liberal government's goods and services tax. According to a survey conducted by Arthur Andersen and Co., 75 per cent of all small businesses in Australia would like to see the introduction of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> We were not the first to moot the idea of this tax. Indeed, the idea of this tax was floated at the Australian Labor Party tax conference in 1984. Senator McMullan will correct me if I have got the wrong date. At that time, a preferred paper containing this proposal was put forward by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Australia is now in the situation where the community is demanding a goods and services tax to replace the present system of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the thrust of the Bill and its more technical aspects which were so ably referred to last evening by my colleague, Senator Watson. We will not take much notice of the `jealousy' amendments moved by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1991, I wish to raise a number of points in principle before addressing some points in particular. I agree with and endorse many of the comments made by my colleague Senator Panizza. The first point I raise relates to the present Australian taxation system: is the Senate aware that since 1983 in the income tax area alone more than 18,000 pages of tax legislation, memoranda, rulings, court decisions, et cetera, have been generated? Is it any wonder that Australian taxpayers, tax accountants, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and many of its officers are confused? In both the sales tax and income tax areas, one can document the evidence of these confusing and inconsistent rulings made by taxation officers in various States. In connection with that, of the legal challenges mounted in the tax area in recent years, the Taxation Office has been successful in only approximately 51 per cent of these cases. This again indicates the complexity and difficulty of our taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am consistently asked why we cannot have a simple, straightforward tax Act that is easy to administer and easy to understand and one that provides incentives to those who work, produce and invest. I suggest that the current taxation system in Australia is one of the greatest disincentives to improving productivity and business investment. Employers now face the additional load of acting as unpaid tax collectors. As I travel around Western Australia, I am consistently asked why the variety of tax collection systems for employee tax, fringe benefit tax, withholding tax and other taxes has to be so complicated and involve so much paperwork and book work. This impost has significantly increased the cost to business. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, if one happens to get the calculations wrong or is late in lodging a return, one is fined for what is in fact an unpaid service to the Taxation Office. The Government has a responsibility to simplify the tax system, minimise the associated costs involved in the many court cases that occur, and reduce the complication of the collection system and hence the cost to business. In addition, if the system were straightforward and simple, the cost of business engaging accountants and tax experts would be significantly reduced. The cost of compliance in this country is much higher than in other countries such as Great Britain or the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not be repeating the details which have been succinctly covered by my colleagues, particularly Senator Watson, other than to say that the income tax rate cuts are welcome. However, one must add that, until such time as we significantly lower all income tax rates, we are going to continue to have tax avoidance and evasion. This means that fiscal management will have to be much more responsible and wasteful government expenditure eliminated-we will be dealing with some of that next week in the Estimates committees-in order to lower total government expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product. This will allow a significant lowering of income tax rates, which I have mentioned previously. </PARA>
<PARA> The ramshackle, unjust, indirect taxation system we have in this country needs a total overhaul. Senator Panizza referred to the sales tax arena. While the changes that were made in the industry statement are welcome-sales tax was the only thing in terms of taxation that was really addressed in the industry statement-it is still very confusing and very inconsistent. I want to give a couple of examples which highlight the inconsistencies and irrationalities that exist in our sales tax arena. I particularly refer to the rulings and decisions made recently in terms of production and agriculture. Now we have a situation whereby tools that are used in that industry are sales tax exempt from the point of sowing, whereas previously it was from the point of harvest.</PARA>
<PARA> I pose the question: does this mean that if one buys a spanner, a hammer or something to use on the tractor which pulls the combine that plants one's seed it is not sales tax exempt? When it comes to spraying, why is it that if one sprays prior to seeding the tools and things that one uses are not sales tax exempt, but if one post-sprays they are? Can anybody explain to me the logic of a taxation system that has these types of inconsistencies?</PARA>
<PARA> I point out another inconsistency which has not been addressed. If one happens to be purchasing a chainsaw the primary and principal use of which is not to be for a particular activity, one pays sales tax on it. To explain that more succinctly, if one uses that chainsaw 40 per cent to build sheep yards and 40 per cent to cut fence posts, one does not get a sales tax exemption. But if one buys two chainsaws and uses one 60 per cent to cut fence posts and the other 60 per cent to build sheep yards, one gets a sales tax exemption on both of them. There are so many things in our taxation system that are illogical-in fact, I would call them stupid-that it is no wonder that there is confusion in the total arena. This puts great pressure not only on the user of the product but also on the retailer. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole arena of taxation needs to be seriously addressed, whether it be income tax or whether it be our indirect taxation system. It appears that only we on this side of the chamber have indicated that we are prepared to do just that. Having said that I do not want to cover the ground that was covered by Senator Watson because I believe that he covered it very succinctly and very well, I wish to address the Australian Democrats' amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say once again that the Democrats never cease to amaze me. Senator Spindler's explanation of the rationale behind their amendments is incredible, unrealistic and, in my view, irresponsible and will severely disadvantage Australian companies and Australian businesses. Australia might be an island in geographical structure. However, it is not an island when it comes to trade, communications, sharing technology, accepting overseas investment, accepting migrants, accepting our responsibilities towards international aid and a host of other involvements with the world community. </PARA>
<PARA> Why, then-and I pose this question to Senator Spindler-would the Democrats wish to remove clauses 17 to 30 of the Bill before us? It would discriminate against Australian companies investing offshore. It would deny Australian businesses the opportunity to compete equitably internationally-Australian comp- anies that will bring new expertise and knowledge to our country and return dividends and profits to Australia that are vital in rectifying our current account deficit. </PARA>

<PARA> The proposed amendments after clause 90A, that is, 90B and 90C, would severely disadvantage Australian businesses. I will not read them out because Senator Panizza has already touched on them. In the case of 90B Australian business would simply put in place salary packages that would include large components of fringe benefits and it would not work. It has not been thought through. Amendment 90C would simply mean that it would be less attractive for Australian businesses or Australian professionals to seek the latest information and technology or structure, and the collection of that information and technology from conferences internationally. </PARA>

The impact presupposes that all knowledge and wisdom resides in Australia or that we have all the facilities required in Australia to put together these conferences, when it could well be in the interests of Australia and Australian companies to structure one of these conferences offshore. It could well attract expertise and businesses to Australia as a flow on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give an example of how things happen. This has occurred in my district with tourists coming to this country. They came over here as tourists, they had a look around and they have invested in business and in farmland. If we disadvantage Australian companies in terms of organising a conference offshore, we could well be creating a situation whereby we will not be opening the doors to the opportunity for people who have knowledge and expertise which could significantly assist Australia to come here, which could assist in addressing what Senator Spindler himself just raised in terms of job creation in this country-and I mean real jobs which produce real wealth. One might ask the question: how does Senator Coulter feel about this in his position as an academic and a promoter of academia?</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to wind up my comments by saying that in terms of the Australian taxation system, the emphasis needs to be placed on getting rid of complication. We need to lower significantly the cost of compliance. That means that the whole tax structure needs simplifying, and it needs to be structured in such a way that the taxation system becomes an incentive for employees to increase their productivity. It needs to be structured in such a way that business is given an incentive so that a situation will be created where it is attractive to invest and reinvest. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL NO 6</PARA>
<PARA>ADVANCE QUESTIONS TO BE TAKEN ON NOTICE FOR COMMITTEE STAGES OF THE BILL</PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 1. (Clauses 95,96)</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the precedent in Income Tax Regulations, 1990, No 398 preceding the enabling legislation in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No 6 1990, in that regulations adjusting the rate of tax instalment deductions may validly be made before the Bill is enacted. </PARA>
<PARA>How far in the Attorney-General's opinion can regulations of this nature precede Statute Law?</PARA>
<PARA>Is this a case of administrative law usurping Statute Law even for limited periods?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 1</PARA>
<PARA>Section 221C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 authorises the making of regulations to prescribe rates of deductions to be made by employers from salary or wages to enable collection of income tax from employees under the pay-as-you-earn system. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Advice from Attorney-General's Department makes the following points:</PARA>
<PARA> * regulations made under section 221C are valid if their purpose is to enable the collection of instalments of income tax imposed by an Act;</PARA>
<PARA> * the rates of deduction prescribed by the regulations are an estimate only of tax finally payable by an employee and they are not designed to collect the net amount payable on assessment-the amount collected by deduction is taken into account at year's end when an employee's liability for tax is assessed and the law provides for an adjustment where too much or too little tax has been deducted; and</PARA>
<PARA> * regulations enable the collection by instalments of income tax imposed at the rates operative for that year-the regulations retain that purpose even though they enable less tax to be collected than would be the case if the rates of deduction were specifically based on existing rather than proposed rates of tax. </PARA>
<PARA>3. As the regulations do not determine the ultimate liability of an individual for tax it is not a case of them usurping Statute Law. In this instance, the purpose of the regulations is fundamentally different to that of the Statute Law. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Attorney-General's Department advises that there is no legislative link between the regulations for setting the rates of PAYE deduction and the rates of tax contained in the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 which the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill seeks to amend. The Department also advises there is no particular time limit, in terms of the law, about how far the regulations in question can precede the Statute Law which is the subject of concern expressed in the question. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 2. (Clauses 95-98)</PARA>
<PARA>Given the lack of examples in the Explanatory Memorandum, will the Parliamentary Secretary provide a statement illustrating the additional tax a provisional taxpayer would have to pay over and above a PAYE taxpayer for the year to 30 June, 1991 as a result of Clause 93 of the Bill, assuming identical incomes of $25,000. </PARA>

<PARA>QUESTION 3. (Clause 95-98)</PARA>
<PARA>Since this is the first taxation Bill changing the rates of the tax since last year's legislation placing certain tax impositions under permanent legislation, has the Government raised an unintended consequence of providing an additional power to the Senate in making Taxation Laws Amendment No 6 an amendable Bill by the Senate since there is no current supporting imposing Bill?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 3</PARA>
<PARA>Section 53 of the Constitution imposes limitations upon the powers of the Senate to amend legislation. Where the Senate may not amend a Bill it may request the House of Representatives to make the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The Senate's powers to amend a Bill are established by section 53 of the Constitution, and clearly can't be amended simply by implication in a Statute.</PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 4 (Clause 59)</PARA>
<PARA>Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree that a loophole exists under the provisions of section 160ZZO? The application of section 160ZZO requires the transferee to have retained the asset. </PARA>
<PARA>However, an asset in certain circumstances may be transferred from one subsidiary to another subsidiary and then the asset is transferred to a subsidiary of the second subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 4</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is aware of the problems that Senator Watson has raised where an asset is the subject of multiple rollovers. In the short-term, it is not considered that this problem would represent a serious avoidance opportunity; taxpayers seeking to use a series of multiple rollovers to obtain tax deferral advantages would almost certainly be subject to the application of the general anti-avoidance provisions of the taxation law. However, to ensure that there can be no possibility of such tax deferrals being obtained, the Government will introduce appropriate remedial amendments in a later Bill. It has not been possible to prepare these amendments in time for this debate because of a number of technical difficulties that have been experienced in developing the appropriate solutions to the problem that has been identified. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 5 (Clause 59, Subclause 84(11))</PARA>
<PARA>The changes to Section 160zzo are to commence from the 6.12.90. However, many of these changes are to repeal the unsatisfactory changes that had been made from the 15.8.90. </PARA>
<PARA>Logic tells me that if a section of an Act was unsatisfactory and needed to be repealed surely it would be sensible to go back to the date when the Section began its unsatisfactory career. </PARA>
<PARA>Why has this not occurred?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 5</PARA>
<PARA>It has been suggested that the further changes proposed by the Bill to the CGT rollover relief available on the transfer of assets within company groups, should be backdated to 15 August 1989. That was the date from which the requirement to issue shares or securities as consideration for the transfer was imposed as a precondition for the availability of the rollover. The Bill proposes to replace these requirements-which were inserted as an anti-avoidance measure-with a deemed disposal rule, which will prevent tax deferral advantages being obtained where the asset subsequently leaves the group. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The Government does not support any backdating of the amendments now proposed. Before introduction of this Bill, on 6 December 1990, taxpayers knew the requirements that needed to be satisfied at that time to obtain rollover relief. If taxpayers chose not to satisfy those requirements-e.g., by not issuing shares or securities of the requisite value as consideration for an asset's transfer-they did so in the knowledge of the CGT consequences that would result. </PARA>
<PARA>3. At no stage did the Government indicate that any further changes that may be made would be backdated, and it is not satisfied that there is any justification for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 6 (Clauses 61 and 62)</PARA>
<PARA>The legislation that is now being proposed under the proposed Division l9A of Part IIIA of the Act is inequitable in that it does not provide for differential treatment between company groups which have a horizontal structure and those with a vertical structure. </PARA>
<PARA>The underlying purpose of the proposed Division is to ensure that taxpayers are not able to accelerate or create capital losses by disposal or shares, or debt owed by, a company which has previously transferred an asset at less than the lesser of indexed cost base or market value to another company under ` `common ownership''. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation purporting to achieve this aim, is set out in Clause 61 of this Bill. However, it is drafted with such breadth as to apply in circumstances where there is no diminution in value in the shares or debt of the transferor company. This is particularly so where companies are held in a vertical as opposed to a triangular chain. </PARA>
<PARA>In a simple vertical post capital gains structure of company ownership, company B is a direct subsidiary of company A. Therefore, company A and Company B are under common ownership by reason of their being group companies in terms of Section 160zzo. </PARA>
<PARA>If Company A were to transfer an asset at less than the lesser of the indexed cost base or market value to company B, Division l9A would require a reduction in the cost base of the shares in Company A (supposedly to reflect a decrease in the value of Company A) and a compensatory increase in the cost base of the shares in Company B. </PARA>
<PARA>However, given the vertical nature of the structure, there is no diminution in the value of Company A as the asset has simply been transferred to its own subsidiary. Therefore there should be no need to adjust the cost base of shares in company A. Likewise, if no adjustment were made to the cost base of shares in company A, there would be no need for a compensatory adjustment in company B. </PARA>
<PARA>This apparent anomaly will arise at any time a parent company transfers an asset at diminished value to any subsidiary in a vertical chain. </PARA>
<PARA>Further to what has been said, Division l9a would be administratively unworkable where the transferor company was a listed public company. In such circumstances a group asset transfer by listed public companies would require the cost base of all post Capital gains tax shareholdings in listed public companies to be reduced on an individual shareholder basis. </PARA>
<PARA>This reduction would be made having regard to the proportion the market value of each shareholder's post capital gains tax shares bears to the market value of total post capital gains tax shareholdings of listed companies. </PARA>
<PARA>The information required to determine this reduction would not be readily available to shareholders and to expect a listed public company to provide such information on an individual shareholder basis is, with respect, somewhat unreasonable. It is also apparently unnecessary given that there would be no diminution in the value of shares in listed public companies as the value of the transferred asset remains in the vertical group. </PARA>
<PARA>Could the Government explain why it has not accepted this view?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 6</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Watson is concerned that the cost base adjustments required by Division 19a will be made where assets are transferred from a holding company to a subsidiary. It was not intended that cost base adjustments would be made in such cases, and the Bill was amended by the House of Representatives (by the insertion of proposed paragraph 160zzrd (1) (c)) to ensure that Division 19a has no application in those cases. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 7 (Clause 61)</PARA>
<PARA>Comment with regard to the new proposed division 19a. Aspects of this new division reflects sloppy drafting. I refer in particular to the new Section 61, headed ` `Division 19A Transfers of Assets between Companies under common Ownership'' and the section 160zzrf. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposed new s 160zzrf is intended to reduce the cost base, indexed cost base or reduced cost base of a share in or loan to a transferor company by a taxpayer referred to as the ` `second taxpayer'' in certain circumstances. The second taxpayer is only affected where an asset is held as described in proposed 160zzrf (2) (a), and, in the case of s 160zzrf (2) (a) (ii), being a loan to the transferor company which was acquired by the second taxpayer on or after 20 September 1985. Clearly this is wide enough to include a taxpayer being an independent third party lender, such as a bank. </PARA>
<PARA>Could the Government clarify this position?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 7</PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not accept that proposed section 160zzrf could operate in respect of loans made to the transferor of an asset by a third party lender, such as a bank. First, cost base adjustments can only be made pursuant to section 160zzrf if it is reasonable to do so. Clearly, if the lender and transferor are dealing at arm's-length and the loan has not been reduced in value, it would be unreasonable to make cost base adjustments. Also, most bank loans would qualify as ` `traditional securities'' and therefore fall outside the scope of the CGT provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>2. However, the Government is concerned that proposed section 160zzre could operate unfairly in relation to some arm's-length creditors of the transferor of an asset, and will move an amendment to restrict the operation of the proposed section in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 8</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Government considered the possible use of consultative Committees in the drafting and framing of taxation legislation? Consultative Committees are used by New Zealand as a way of forming a closer contact between the three areas that draft legislation-the Treasury, the Tax Office and Parliamentary Counsel. </PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 8</PARA>
<PARA>Although consultative committees are not used in the drafting of legislation, the Australian Taxation Office is familiar with the process. For example, one of the officers who worked on the ATO Simplification Project was involved in the consultative committee to the New Zealand simplification project. </PARA>
<PARA>2. On a more general basis, the ATO works very closely with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the Treasury to produce taxation legislation. The relationship allows each of the agencies to develop its own specialised expertise whilst the information sharing and consultative processes involved in developing the legislation helps to ensure a professional and balanced product. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 9 (Clause 59)</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment to section 160zzo as an anti avoidance provision will create practical problems for purchasers of companies where a liability will crystallise in a transferee company at the time at which the transferee company is disposed of by the group. </PARA>
<PARA>This could occur many years after the original rollover and result in the transferee company being faced with a significant tax liability to be borne effectively by the company's new shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA>Could the Government clarify this?</PARA>
<PARA>(I have been informed that it would be sufficient to meet the anti avoidance objects of the proposed amendments for the liability to subsist for a fixed period of say seven years. This would then correspond with the position in the UK.)</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 9</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments proposed in relation to section 160zzo will remove existing requirements to issue shares or securities as consideration for the transfer of an asset, as a precondition for the availability of CGT rollover relief on the transfer of assets between commonly owned group companies. However, to ensure that previously available tax deferral opportunities are not restored, a new anti-avoidance provision will be introduced by the proposed amendments, which will deem a disposal at market value of previously transferred assets if the company group subsequently ceases to maintain 100 percent ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Senator Watson has suggested that the potential application of this deemed disposal rule should be limited to the seven year period following the rollover of an asset. It is contended that such a restriction would be consistent with the anti-avoidance objectives of the amendments, but would remove unnecessary inconvenience for taxpayers that the Government's proposed amendments may involve. In particular, it is claimed that the restriction would reduce potential difficulties for future purchasers of the transferee company (because of the consequential deemed disposal of the transferred assets), who may have difficulties in determining the tax consequences of a takeover if a number of years have elapsed since the transfer. </PARA>
<PARA>3. The Government has given careful consideration to this suggestion, but has concluded that it cannot justify such a change. First, it does not consider that the concerns expressed have any conceptual basis; the opportunity for tax deferrals would simply be ``put-off'' if the deemed disposal rules were limited in their application. Also, records must be maintained to enable the indexed cost base of an asset to be established; for these purposes, details of any intermediate rollovers obtained would in any case need to be kept so that third-party purchasers of a transferee company should easily be able to identify potential CGT liabilities that may be crystallised as a result of the purchase. The prospective purchaser could then use that information (if significant) in determining the appropriate price to pay for the shares. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 10 (Clause 59)</PARA>
<PARA>A number of taxation experts have stated that there is a large loophole in the provisions under Section 160zzo. Apparently, if an asset is transferred from one subsidiary to another subsidiary and then the asset is transferred to a subsidiary of the second subsidiary, apparently under that situation zzo does not apply because, for zzo to apply the transferee has to have retained the asset. If this were to be exploited in a quiet manner, it would be difficult if the transfer were completed over a number of years and done in two steps separated by a significant time period to make out that it is part of an anti-avoidance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Could the Government clarify this possible anomaly?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 10</PARA>
<PARA>This question relates to the same issue raised in question 4. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 11 (Clauses 58 and 59)</PARA>
<PARA>According to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill the proposed amendments to section 160zzo, namely the removal of requirements for consideration of the same market value of the asset transferred to be given, has been necessitated by the fact that the requirements were overly difficult to comply with. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, would you agree that it is inconsistent that similar requirements are retained for partnership rollovers?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 11</PARA>
<PARA>The requirement to issue shares of equal value as consideration for the transfer of partnership assets to a company wholly owned by the partners, as a pre-condition for the availability of rollover relief, is necessary to prevent tax avoidance opportunities from arising. The same requirements are contained in existing section 160ZZN in relation to transfers of assets from an individual or trust to a 100% wholly-owned company. </PARA>
<PARA>2. When originally introduced, the section 160ZZN rollover contained no requirement that shares of the same value be issued as consideration for the transfer of an asset. Accordingly, opportunities were open to shift value relating to taxable post-19/9/85 assets to exempt pre-19/9/85 shares, because of the rules which conferred exempt pre-19/9/85 status on shares taken as consideration for the transfer of pre-19/9/85 assets. To overcome these problems, a rule was inserted making the issue of shares equal in value to the transferred asset a pre-condition for the availability of the rollover. </PARA>
<PARA>3. The same problems do not arise under section 160zzo, as proposed to be amended. As a result of these amendments, the issue of shares or securities as consideration for the transfer of an asset is not compulsory; however, any shares or securities that are issued will not have the same acquisition date as the transferred asset but instead will be taken to have been acquired at the time they are issued. </PARA>
<PARA>4. It would not be possible to make the issue of shares optional to obtain rollover relief under sections 160ZZN and 160ZZNA unless similar rules to those in section 160zzo relating to the acquisition date of any shares received were inserted. This may cause taxpayers further difficulties and, in any case, it has not been established that the current rules (unlike the former rules for company group rollovers) cause taxpayers major compliance problems. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 12 (Clause 58)</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the necessary election in order to qualify for a section 160ZZNA rollover must be made by all partners. Would you agree that this would appear to be an unnecessary requirement given that the capital gains tax provisions are now intended to apply at the individual level by virtue of the application of clause 44 of the Bill, with the result that it should theoretically be possible for an individual partner to decide whether or not to incur a capital gains tax liability in respect of a particular disposal. </PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 12</PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not accept that it would be theoretically preferable for individual partners to decide whether they wish to obtain rollover relief on the transfer of partnership assets to a company wholly-owned by the partners. Strictly speaking, such asset transfers do not satisfy the general rollover requirements because there is no 100% continuity of ownership of legal interests in the assets following the transfer. </PARA>
<PARA>2. To the extent that the proposed rollover for partnerships involves a departure from that rule, it is justifiable because of the special nature of the partnership relationship. Equally, however, it is not unreasonable for all the partners to determine jointly whether they should elect to obtain rollover relief on the transfer of an asset to a wholly-owned company. To do otherwise would add considerable complexity to the application of the rollover rules, by requiring the cost base and acquisition dates of particular fractions of transferring assets and shares to be determined by reference to whether or not a particular partner had elected to obtain rollover relief. </PARA>
<PARA>3. It is also difficult to see how the requirement could cause difficulties in practice. However, the Government has recognized a potential problem with the amendments as drafted which could prevent an individual partner obtaining rollover relief on the transfer of a partnership interest to a wholly-owned company of the partner. It therefore proposes a further amendment to the Bill to ensure that rollover relief can be obtained in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 13 (Clause 87)</PARA>
<PARA>However, in the legislation and the new rules regarding the cancellation of franking credits built up by mutual life offices, there is according to various tax experts to whom I have spoken the possibility of a constitutional difficulty. I believe that the Australian Taxation Office has been made aware of this. </PARA>
<PARA>The initial reaction of one tax expert was that the effect of imposing the tax would invalidate Section 55 of the Constitution. The other view expressed to me, and this I believe is the stronger view, is that the provision that cancels the credits appears as an acquisition of property under Section 51 (31) of the Constitution without making provision for just terms and therefore the provision itself would be invalidated. </PARA>
<PARA>I have been further informed that should a High Court action on this issue be successful the whole provision would be eliminated. I ask the Government to examine this part of their legislation and consider this possibility!</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 13</PARA>
<PARA>Advice on the constitutional issues raised has been provided by the Office of General Counsel of the Attorney-General's Department. The view expressed was that a franking surplus does not constitute property. The requirement relating to the acquisition of property on just terms contained in section 5l(xxxi) of the Constitution is therefore not applicable. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The Office of the General Counsel does not consider that there is any authority for the view that the removal by the Commonwealth of the franking surplus of mutual life assurance companies constitutes a tax. On this view the Bill is not affected by section 55 of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 14 (Clause 42)</PARA>
<PARA>The life insurance industry feels that the formula method for the determination of franking credits is not appropriate in relation to nonparticipating business (for example, the accident and disability insurance) because there is no statutory restriction on the amount of profit or surplus arising from such business which can be distributed to shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the Life Insurance Act allows for shareholders to receive 100% of the profits from non-participating business and in practice a proportion (if not all) of such surplus derived by companies is generally distributed to shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also relevant that accident and disability business transacted by life companies is akin to general insurance in that it essentially involves the underwriting of specific risks rather than the provision of savings or investment facilities. Such business is in fact undertaken by both life and general insurers and is taxed on a similar basis as general insurance business, that is the tax base is net premium (net of reinsurance and unexpired risks reserves) less claims paid and expenses incurred plus net investment income. </PARA>
<PARA>Consequently, industry believes that franking credits arising in respect to accident and disability business should be determined separately from other business such that the total franking credits arising from the former (that is based on total tax paid and franked dividends received in respect of such businesses) should be available as franked dividends to shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA>Will the Government consider this?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 14</PARA>
<PARA>Tax paid on income distributed to shareholders by life assurance companies should give rise to franking credits so that the dividends paid can be franked. However, this amount of tax cannot be accurately calculated because life assurance companies do not keep records of the separate profits derived from participating and non-participating policies. The tax paid on profits available for distribution to shareholders cannot be calculated without this information. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Complex new tracing rules would be necessary if life assurance companies were required to precisely quantify the amount of tax paid on income derived from participating and non-participating policies. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Following consultations with the Office of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner (ISC) it was decided that the arrangements should be kept simple. The apportionment was therefore based on the maximum proportion of the profits on participating policies that the Life Insurance Act allows to be distributed to shareholders. The advice of the ISC was that in most cases this proportion was generous. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 15 (Clauses 101, 102)</PARA>
<PARA>What is the nature of the loopholes intended to be rectified by amendments under Part 5 of the bill relating to the secrecy provisions to the Taxation Administration Act 1953?</PARA>
<PARA>Do the provisions extend to questionable releases of information under the Freedom of Information Act?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 15</PARA>
<PARA>PART A</PARA>
<PARA>Section 8xa</PARA>
<PARA>The existing section 8xa of the Taxation Administration Act makes it an offence for a person knowingly to take action to obtain information held under or for the purposes of a taxation law, unless the person takes the action in the course of exercising powers under a taxation law. The term ``taxation law'' is defined to mean, broadly, the Commonwealth tax laws administered by the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The effect of the section is very broad. It is being interpreted in some quarters as applying to prevent a person from taking action to obtain information held anywhere in the community (i.e. other than by the Commissioner) where the creation of the information is associated in some way with a Commonwealth taxation law, unless the person is taking the action in the course of exercising powers or functions under or in relation to such a law. This information could include, for example, copies of group certificates, fringe benefits tax returns and PPS papers held by businesses for their own records and also copies of profit and loss statements, balance sheets and wage books where they are prepared in conjunction with a taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Section 8xa as it currently stands is having an unintended effect on the activities of the State and Territory tax authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Prior to the enactment of section 8xa in 1989 the State and Territory authorities had access to the records held by business in ensuring compliance with their laws. However, in some quarters section 8xa is being interpreted to deny the relevant tax authorities access to this information, required for audit in relation to a State or Territory tax, on the basis that the information is held for Commonwealth taxation purposes in accordance with section 8xa. </PARA>
<PARA>5. The change to section 8xa by the Bill will make it an offence for a person to take action to obtain access to records containing information about a person's affairs where those records are in the Commissioner's possession. It will not therefore apply in respect of access to records that are in the possession of someone other than the Commissioner. An offence as a consequence of illegal access to information held other than by the Commissioner is covered by the general law (e.g. criminal law). </PARA>
<PARA>Section 8xb</PARA>
<PARA>6. Section 8xb creates an offence where a person makes a record of, or divulges, information about the affairs of a taxpayer that is or was in the possession of the Commissioner</PARA>
<PARA>and is obtained in breach of a taxation law. The Bill proposes to amend section 8xb so that an offence is created where the unlawful recipient of taxation information uses that information, in a manner whereby it is neither recorded nor divulged. </PARA>
<PARA>7. This amendment is designed to prevent the solicitation and use of confidential taxpayer information by persons (such as those providing credit reference services) where the disclosure to them would breach a taxation secrecy provision. The amendment follows a similar amendment to the Social Security Act 1947 in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>PART B</PARA>
<PARA>8. Sections 8xa and 8xb are directed at preventing persons not employed by, or performing services for, the Australian Taxation Office from illegally obtaining or making use of information that is or was at some time held by the Commissioner of Taxation. They do not deal with releases of information under the Freedom of Information Act 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>9. The Commissioner of Taxation or his officers may release information in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. In doing so regard must be had to the exemption provisions of the Freedom of Information Act including the extent to which the information is protected by a taxation secrecy provision. </PARA>
<PARA>10. The proposed amendments to sections 8xa and 8xb are supported by the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 16 (Clause 44)</PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned that the proposed amendment to partnerships does not achieve the intended clarification referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 44 of the Bill proposes an amendment to section 160a of the Act to include within the definition of ``asset'' for Capital Gains Tax purposes a taxpayer's interest in a partnership asset of a partnership in which the taxpayer is a partner. Whilst this amendment would extend the definition by specifically including such assets, the proposed amendment does not achieve the intended clarification referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum. This is because a ``partner's chose in action'', being the interest in the partnership itself, is not excluded from 160(a). </PARA>
<PARA>Could this be clarified?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER NO. 16</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Watson is concerned that the amendments proposed by clause 44, which will include in the definition of ``asset'' for the purposes of section 160a a partner's interest in a partnership asset, could result in ``double taxation'' on the disposal of a partnership interest. This is because a partnership interest, being a chose in action, is itself an asset for CGT purposes, yet a large part of the value of such an interest may in turn relate to interests in individual assets which themselves are treated as separate assets for CGT purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>There are strong legal presumptions against double taxation which, in the Government's view, would prevent the potential problems foreseen by Senator Watson. However, as the issue is obviously the cause of some concern, the Government proposes a further amendment to the Bill which will ensure that a ``partnership interest'' is itself treated as an asset only to the extent that its value does not relate to interests in individual assets, which are separately subject to CGT. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Watson for the cooperative attitude he has shown in the development of the discussion around the issues that he has raised-and others-some of which have led to technical amendments to the Bill, others which will require further consideration and some on which I think we may have satisfied Senator Watson that no amendments were required. I do not want to suggest at this stage that this practice, which we have developed now twice in a row, of incorporating in Hansard lengthy answers to a series of questions is something which I necessarily want to do on every occasion-it may or may not be appropriate-but I do appreciate the manner in which it has been undertaken on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not go through every point that was made during the second reading debate, much of which related more particularly to things that we will deal with in the committee stage-particularly the Australian Democrats' amendments, although I will make some comments about them-but there are some points to which I wish to respond. </PARA>
<PARA> A general point by Senator Watson about the nature of these omnibus Bills was that we bring together a lot of disparate elements of tax reform in one Bill, and this sometimes holds up desirable changes within it-in this particular example, the proposal to reduce the tax rates. From the Government's point of view, the problem with suggesting that, rather than having an omnibus Bill, we could have a series of smaller, more specific Bills dealing with identified separate areas, is that I do not think we could get a guarantee that the total amount of debating time taken up in debating four or five-or even two-separate Bills, if we broke the omnibus Bill into more than one, would not be greater than the amount we spend on the omnibus legislation. We would achieve the same outcome at greater cost. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not mind there being more debate if it means that more issues are discussed-there is greater opportunity for the Senate properly to review legislation that comes before it-but what we would get from some of Senator Watson's colleagues, from time to time, would be simply greater length of debate but not greater depth. I think that that is a problem that makes us reluctant in the first instance to try to change the manner in which these matters are brought before an already crowded Senate legislative program. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, I think the omnibus Bill process, provided we keep some limit on the size of them and we keep enough Bills coming through to keep up a flow of amendments, does facilitate the joint objectives of keeping the legislative program flowing through the Senate so that we can get the body of legislation we are seeking passed, while keeping the debate manageable. I think the speeches during the second reading debate on this occasion have indicated that. People have managed to traverse the field of all the matters in this Bill. In fact, some of them have managed to traverse a few things that are not in this Bill, and I will come back to that in a moment. I do not object to that; it was an opportunity to talk about tax generally and it was taken up. It is our current intention to continue to pursue taxation laws amendment Bills of the type that we have before us, and I expect there to be more. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to pursue at this stage the interesting debate that Senator Watson raised-and it is not dissimilar to one he raised before-about section 53 and the greater powers to the Senate to amend. There has been some discussion on that in this place before. We have had opinions presented about the powers of the Senate to amend these matters, what imposing a burden means and all of these sorts of very interesting questions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Clerk has outlined ably what the traditional interpretation of that matter is. I think it may be that it is a question we need to have a more contemporary examination of, but I do not want to do it on the run in this particular Bill. I am happy to have a continuing discussion about that with Senator Watson and others. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other general point I should make about the manner of administration of the changes to the rates that came into effect on 1 January and the concerns that have been expressed about the fact that the schedules have been changed and, therefore, the rate at which deductions are being made is in a schedule predicated on these changes. In some way there is a concern that this is, in effect, legislation by regulation. But of course-and I know that Senate Watson is fully aware of this-nothing in those regulations or schedules in any way changes the tax obligation of the individual taxpayer over the financial year. Taxpayers' obligations are determined by the legislation, and properly so. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is quite sensible and appropriate administratively for those schedules so to reflect those changes and I do not think it is a procedural problem that we need to dwell upon-although the capacity of the Senate to receive and to pass legislation expeditiously on the rates is a proper point to raise. I would certainly have been happier had we been in a position to pass it last year, and we discussed that, but the arrangements to facilitate that could not be agreed upon. I acknowledge the general point, but I do not want to spend any more time on it. I am absolutely confident that the procedure is proper and sound, although if the Senate were able to make arrangements to pass such Bills more expeditiously in the future that would be desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to talk much about the amendments that Senate Spindler has brought forward because we will get the chance to do that in the committee stage and I will do it then. In the second reading stage I will talk about the approach to the general question of taxation legislation that those amendments portray, without going to the detail of each of them because I will do that in turn in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the Democrat amendments reflect a lack of strategic approach. The overall approach that these amendments reflect is one to which I have referred before in this chamber as a bower bird theory of tax amendment-that is, one hops around looking for all of the bright shiny bits, picks them up and tries to drop them into the tax Act, without looking at what the aggregate impact of those suggested changes might be. Some of the individual bits are quite bright and shiny; some of the problems with which Senator Spindler is trying to deal are very annoying. It is annoying that sometimes people deliberately hold their conferences overseas so that they can get an overseas trip at the taxpayers' expense. They do do that, and it annoys the hell out of me and most Australian taxpayers. But trying to deal with that in the way that Senator Spindler does has more shortcomings than benefits. I will deal with the detail of this in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I am simply saying that we cannot hop around and say, `Here is a populist little message; the public is annoyed about this'. Knowing that no party which aspires to govern the country could ever support the amendments as put forward, the Democrats say, `We will be able to say to the people who are concerned that we tried to amend it and those terrible major parties conspired against us and would not vote for it'. The corollary is not that they have to put forward an overall considered program for tax reform; the Democrats do not have to think through all of the implications of the proposals that they are putting forward because they have the luxury of knowing that they will never have to implement them. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the underlying problems to which some of these amendments relate are real and the cause of annoyance to many individual Australians and to many members of this chamber-including myself-I do not think the proposals deal sensibly with those problems. We are not going to get very far if we continue to concentrate upon isolated attempts to pick up popular causes without an integrated strategic approach to the question of taxes overall. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I turn to the consistent theme in the speeches of Senators Panizza and Crane about sales tax and a goods and services tax-which did not really relate to the Bill so I will not spend much time talking about it-perhaps they will allow me, for a minute or two, to share their indulgence on this question of the length of the tax legislation, its complexity and the much vaunted issue of making the income tax system simpler. I am not absolutely sure that I think `simplicity'-as much as it is one of the traditional objectives of tax policy along with equity and efficiency-is a very appropriate word, but it is now the word that is in common parlance so let us continue to use it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senators referred to two things which I think are appropriate objectives. The first is to make those tax laws that affect the activities of Australians, as taxpayers, more comprehensible to them-whether they are individual men and women on pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) with a little interest from the bank, or people running very complex corporate structures. The objective should be to make the tax laws more comprehensible to those people who have to comply with them as part of an overall strategy of encouraging people to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations. One feature of a move in that direction is to make it easier for people to understand what it is they have to do. It makes it less frustrating for them and it makes it less likely that they will give up in frustration. </PARA>
<PARA> The other side of that coin is to reduce the cost of compliance-the cost of running the tax system-on two counts. One is the cost of compliance for individuals and businesses-the costs that they incur in meeting the requirements of the tax Act-and the other is the cost of administration; the cost to the Government of administering the tax system which is, ultimately, a cost on those same taxpayers. Those two sides are the real objectives of simplicity. If the only objective is to have a simple tax system that would not be hard at all; one could say that everybody should pay a fair amount of tax and the Commissioner of Taxation should impose a levy that is fair on everybody. That is a very simple tax Act, but as soon as one started to administer it, it would, of course, be a nightmare and nobody would seriously propose that. I am simply saying that making the Act easy to read is not an objective in itself. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not get a `simple' tax system-according to the common, everyday use of that word-because we have a tax system that does, and will, need to continue to administer a very complex society in which people, for tax reasons but also for proper administrative business reasons, structure their affairs in very complex ways. Therefore, the tax system that operates within a modern complex economy will remain complex. </PARA>
<PARA> But it can be made simpler than it is. The so-called blue book on self-assessment is, I think, a substantial step forward to making it simpler for some taxpayers. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced very recently an initiative to try to make a very important area of the tax system simpler-that is, the area relating to superannuation. I think that is a proper priority because it is an area of the tax system that falls on individual PAYE taxpayers and others. Many people who have done their own tax returns all their lives-who have always filled in their tax returns at the appropriate time of the year and sent them off-find that as they retire they have an incomprehensible document before them and they do not know where to turn. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the broad question of simplification of the tax system is very easy to advocate, but it is very hard to do. However, it is a proper priority, which I share. When we then say that one of our objectives is to reduce compliance costs, we have people advocating a goods and services tax. That seems very strange to me, because on all of the evidence I have seen-including evidence from supporters of the consumption tax-it is acknowledged that the aggregate compliance costs for business of a broadly based consumption tax of whichever type, are higher than the compliance costs of a wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not heard that that matter is the subject of debate. Professor Sandford, the British expert on compliance costs, who is a supporter of the introduction of a broadly based consumption tax, nevertheless says that one thing that has to be acknowledged about it is that it will make people put compliance costs up, and I believe that that is clearly and unquestionably correct. Therefore, we cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA> If those opposite are saying that they are looking for a system with lower compliance costs, they cannot then say, `and our solution to the problem is a broadly based consumption tax', because that flies in the face of that objective. If we look at the range of equity, efficiency and simplicity objectives of the tax system, the issue falls at the hurdles before we get to simplicity, because I am opposed to it on equity grounds. We will all have opportunities to debate the problems that it raises in terms of distribution, compensation and the equity problems that arise when and if those opposite get around to telling us what it is they are actually going to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I am simply saying that if they want to come here today and talk properly, as Senators Crane and Panizza have done, about the correct objective of reducing the cost of compliance in the tax system, they have to recognise that that is not what the broadly based consumption tax will do; it will increase compliance costs. Having diverted from the Bill no more than anybody else in this debate, I thank honourable senators for supporting it, and I will deal with the amendments when they arise. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(11.15)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year the Opposition was confronted with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1990, which has been reintroduced with amendments as the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1991. We were confronted with an omnibus Bill which we believed had a lot of imperfections. The question was how to deal with so many difficulties in so many areas given the short space of time available for debating Bills of a complex nature, how to get a semblance of understanding of the issues and, where there were difficulties, to ensure that we could overcome those difficulties by prompt legislative change. I therefore thank the Government for its assistance in resolving this difficult issue. The Opposition placed basically a minimum of 16 issues of concern with the Government by way of advance notice and the Government has responded in a very positive way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a number of amendments, in many cases fully addressing the issues that we raised and, in some cases, addressing the issues perhaps not as comprehensively as we would have wished. On other matters we have been given an understanding that the Government intends to further examine the issues, some of which will be subject to legislative change in the future. We anxiously await those amendments at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties that arise in amending previous legislation is the date of operation. In this mechanism of giving the Government some advance information, we saw an opportunity of bringing down significant amendments at the time of debating the Bill. This is important because, if we have different legislative operative dates-and a number of these matters have come back to the Senate for, I think, the third time-the people who originally complied with the legislation suddenly find that they are disadvantaged as a result of there being a fairer amendment because the date of the amendment does not always relate back to the original change. So when we have a succession of changes, each with a different amending date, there is something of a dilemma for those complying with changing laws. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to one particular company in relation to internal asset transfers. This company accepted the legislation of the day and it did its internal reconstruction. It paid the various taxes, charges and stamp duties that applied, only to find that a subsequent amendment came through which made unnecessary the procedure that was mandatory through the legislation passed earlier. Honourable senators would understand, on the other hand, that the companies that did not take advantage of that situation at the time, or did not see the need to move so quickly, benefited as a result of waiting for the subsequent change. But we have to put ourselves in the position of those that complied with the law as it then was, not knowing at the time that there was a likelihood of change?</PARA>
<PARA> If I may, I will use the title of the Bill to respond to a couple of issues. I take a very simple view of this question of simplicity. Is this simplicity a belated acknowledgment by the Government of the need to restore a lot of taxpayers' rights which have been lost since 1983? We all recognise the need for simplicity, but the simplicity must essentially exist in those areas which affect the great bulk of taxpayers-the ordinary pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) taxpayers and the ordinary businessmen who have an uncomplicated tax business arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> In these areas, I think it is mandatory for government to make the laws very much more simple than they are now. Perhaps Senator McMullan, when responding, might be good enough to tell me whether the Senate is likely to receive, in this session, the first of the simplification changes that were announced in the so-called blue book of December last year. I think the taxpaying community around Australia is anxiously looking forward to those simplification changes. We know that some of those changes require some sort of community debate and some feedback to the Australian Taxation Office, but I believe that the community is awaiting the first of those simplicity changes to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that we are not moving towards simplification of the Act right now. There are a lot of complicating factors in this Bill and I agree with Senator McMullan that, in many aspects, businesses are becoming more technical, complex and international in character. In these areas we are not going to have a simple income tax Act. However, there could have been a better grouping, with more examples and more illustrations. Perhaps it could be internationalised so that a common set of understandings applies to situations both in Australia and overseas. I think it is unfortunate that people who come to Australia and operate here suddenly find themselves caught up in a tax system that does not run parallel to what they experienced overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> One difficulty is that so much of the increased responsibility has been thrown back onto taxpayers. My colleague in the other place, Mr Rocher, spoke about the need for a Bill of rights. This is all tied up in this question of simplicity and the cost of compliance. </PARA>
<PARA> I do welcome the Treasurer's new-found enthusiasm to try to simplify superannuation law. Unfortunately, a great opportunity was lost last year when the concessions that were available to the lower and middle income earners resulted in some amendments that were highly and unnecessarily complicated. I believe that superannuation is an area to which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) should give some priority. It is unsatisfactory when ordinary wage earners cannot really determine the concessional basis of the deductibility in relation to their contributions to superannuation schemes until well into the year. The method is so complicated that in nearly all cases the calculation will require taxpayers to go off to a tax agent. I believe that, in this area, taxpayers should not have to resort to the specialist advice of income tax professionals. The requirements should be self-explanatory and ordinary people should be able to complete their forms on the kitchen table fairly quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) raised the question of compliance. I believe that it is a debatable point. Mr Chairman, I hope that you will allow me some liberty in addressing this area. I did not have an earlier opportunity because the matter was only raised during the summing-up stage. The matter of compliance costs, the goods and services tax vis-a-vis the sales tax, is certainly open to some debate. A single turnover tax with minimum exemptions must have a very low overall compliance cost compared with the complexity of a sales tax, which is multi-rated, has definitional problems, classification problems and so on. Compliance costs is not just a question of signing the cheque at the end of the month; it is determining whether the goods fall into one of several categories. That will be the subject of a more comprehensive debate. I could not let the issue pass without the matter being challenged by our side of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 1 to 9 generally cover issues resulting from the foreign income legislation. Again, it would have been more appropriate had this legislation been introduced at the time the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990 was debated last year. This time gap in bringing forward amendments does leave uncertainties and misunderstandings in people's minds. There is a need to tighten up the presentation of the tax changes to ensure that they are comprehensively introduced to the Parliament rather than on a staggered basis. We have the difficulty of people meeting those requirements where there are different obligations over a set period of time. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to clause 10, we certainly welcome the exemptions for certain pensions. Unfortunately, we again lose the opportunity for a degree of simplification. This question of calculation is not an easy area. It is a little like the deeming provisions coupled with bank transactions. For the first time, pensioners have been introduced to a whole series of complicated arrangements. They have to meet 100 points when changing their bank accounts in order to get the higher 10 per cent interest that is now available from certain banks in Australia so that they do not lose taxation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners are beset by a whole new range of problems. It is unfortunate that people in their twilight years, who have not had many dealings with banks and financial institutions, now find themselves beset by a new array of technical complications and uncertainties. I place on the record my concern on behalf of these thousands of pensioners and aged people who I believe are being put to a lot of unnecessary cost. The fact that they change their account from one type of savings account to another or to an investment account means that they have to meet a whole array of certain points requirements, and that is somewhat difficult for them. </PARA>
<PARA> I give an example to show how stupid the requirements can become. One bank manager, simply by reading a form, asked the father of a young girl when opening a school bank account, `Has your daughter got a driving licence because that is now worth 30 points?'. I raise that example because it is part of this ongoing need to simplify issues. While there is a tendency-and a proper one-to minimise the administrative costs to the Australian Taxation Office, I am very concerned about the added responsibilities and obligations that are now placed on taxpayers. I will address some of those issues later on in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a couple of points for the Minister at the Table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), to consider on the question of compliance costs. I have been quoted figures, and I know the costs involved. A pay as you earn taxpayer-as each of us are in this place-may or may not have another income. That income can be taken as a lump sum if there is some other income coming in and that figure is to be introduced. At the moment, politicians have an added electorate allowance of around $17,000 to $22,000. I know, and have been told, that with compliance on that amount alone and with the cost of a normal accountant-if an accountant is used to do the tax return, which is a good idea-the cost of filing a tax return goes up from about $100 to $1,000. That is contrary to what the Minister was saying earlier about the cost of compliance. He can correct me if I am wrong, but he did not think that it was so great.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cheaper option is to not claim any of those amounts. If an expense is not claimed, the accountant's bill is a lot higher. In that case I have been told, and I know, that the accountant's cost goes up from about $100 to $1,000. From that simple example, can the Minister enlighten me as to why compliance costs are not that high?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are straying rather a long way. I did not say that compliant costs were not high; I said that one of the proper objectives of simplification is to reduce compliance costs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 14, page 12, at end of proposed section 63D, add the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(3) Where a debt that is written off has been transferred from a listed country to an unlisted country, such a transfer shall be deemed to be a scheme for the purposes of obtaining a tax benefit under Part IVa, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the debt was not transferred for that purpose'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment is designed to strengthen the Government's provisions contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill which deal with bad debts incurred by foreign operations of Australian moneylenders. When a bad debt is formally written off, a tax deduction arises to the moneylender. Because the operations of branches in comparable tax countries have been exempt from tax since 1 June 1990, a problem arises with respect to bad loans which crystallise after 1 July 1990, the interest on which is subject to Australian tax prior to this date. The Government has decided to apportion the amount of the bad debt which qualifies for a tax deduction in Australia with reference to the amount of time the interest from the debt would have been taxable in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The examples in the explanatory memorandum on pages 52 and 53 clearly conceive of the transfer of a debt between branches of a moneylender. I am concerned that non-performing lenders' loans attached to branches located in comparable tax countries that would otherwise be written off will be transferred to branches in non-comparable countries or to Australia. When the debt is subsequently written off a higher tax deduction would be available in Australia. The amendment proposes to deem any such loan transfer as a scheme under the general anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVa of the Income Tax Assessment Act unless the Commissioner of Taxation is satisfied that the loan transfer did not occur for tax avoidance purposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The new section 63d has been inserted to ensure that a deduction is not allowable for offshore debts of a branch of a moneylender where the income of the branch is exempt from tax under the new foreign income measures. Therefore, it is appropriate that there is no deduction for bad debts under those circumstances and, naturally, the Opposition does not object. We do not, however, see the need for the amendment that has been proposed by the Australian Democrats because the provision in section 63d stands alone. In addition, if the sorts of shenanigans that the Australian Democrats envisage may occur in some circumstances were going on, the Tax Commissioner would certainly invoke Part IVa. I am a little concerned about introducing a precedent of the nature of the one the Australian Democrats is introducing, however well-intentioned. If we introduce these sorts of provisions invoking Part IVa, it has the effect of implying that if it is not in other sections it thereby places some limitation on the Commissioner as to the circumstances in which he should be invoking Part IVa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that it is far better to have a generalised provision, such as Part IVa, without having to draw the Commissioner's attention to the need to invoke it in certain circumstances. It should be available for all circumstances where there is tax avoidance or evasion and, therefore, the Opposition does not believe that this amendment is necessary. It is adding further words to an already cumbersome Act. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague Senator Crane mentioned in his forceful contribution, over 18,000 pages have been added to the tax laws. It seems an incredible figure. These are the sorts of changes that the taxpaying community and the Taxation Office are having to live with. To illustrate the fact that taxation is becoming so complicated, I mention that the principal university in New South Wales is now providing a bachelor degree solely in taxation. When most of us went through university, taxation was just part of a subject of law, with perhaps one or two seminars. Later it was extended to a full subject. Now, tax law has become so complicated that we are seeing masters awards being offered in a number of universities and an undergraduate degree being offered in New South Wales. This illustrates the complexity and the need for the tax professionals, including those dedicated officers within the Australian Taxation Office, to have an institution, a background in tax, to keep abreast of the necessary changes. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to bad debts, I ask Senator McMullan a question. Under self-assessment there is an increasing problem of when a debt is bad. Senator McMullan might illustrate that matter because in recent times there have been a number of cases under self-assessment where the Taxation Office has not accepted past precedents and past practices as to when it is acceptable to write off a debt as bad. Can Senator McMullan tell us whether there has been a change of administrative policy as to when the Taxation Office considers a debt to be bad. Considering that we are now in an era of self-assessment when penalties may apply, this is an area of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that it is not an easy question to answer. Senator McMullan may wish to take it on notice. That may be the preferable way in which to handle the question. It is a matter of serious concern that there are now some cases where the Taxation Office is not accepting the past practice when a debt is bad, for example, when it is put into the hands of a collector, when it is uncollectable, when it has been outstanding for five months, and so on. Given that we are addressing this issue of bad debts and we have an amendment from the Australian Democrats, perhaps it is appropriate to give some clarification to the taxpaying community as to whether there has been a change in practice, what the practice is and whether the matter could be clarified by reference to a Taxation Office ruling. It is certainly a neglected area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to a couple of points that Senator Watson raised, including the general question of using Part IVa, which must be one of the most underused sections in the taxation Act. I cannot see anything wrong in this particular case when we have prima facie evidence of shenanigans, as Senator Watson termed it, in placing the onus on the taxpayer to prove that the transaction was indeed a bona fide commercial one rather than one simply carried out to achieve a higher tax benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We would like to see evidence from Senator McMullan as to where Part IV has been used in similar circumstances and in other areas to great effect without such a provision. It seems to me that recent disclosures, as a result of the audit program by the Australian Taxation Commissioner's office, show many such shenanigans which have not been picked up in the normal course of events and where Part IVa has not been used. I believe that there is an exceedingly good case for putting pressure on the system so that Part IVa is being used for the benefit of Australia's tax revenue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall deal firstly with the somewhat separate question raised by Senator Watson. Then I shall deal with the amendment itself. Senator Watson raised the question of when a debt is bad and whether there has been a change in administrative policy. I simply say that I shall refer that to the Commissioner of Taxation. I am not sure that it is necessarily appropriate for a ruling but I will refer it to him and get his comments. I think that the taxpaying public in general would be a little more reassured by the Commissioner's opinion than by mine. I will refer it to him for comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the amendment that we have before us, every time one proposes anything that is designed to crack down more harshly on tax avoidance, our hearts warm to such a proposal a little because tax avoidance in the excesses of the previous periods and to the extent it continues now puts an unfair burden on other Australian taxpayers who do not have the desire or the opportunity to exploit the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> However, that does not necessarily make every amendment that looks like it will crack down on tax avoidance something that we ought to put in every Bill that comes before us. This amendment seeks, in effect, to prevent a moneylender from transferring a loan that may need to be written off from a listed country, where it generates exempt income, to an unlisted country, where it generates assessable income and, therefore, might be able to obtain a tax deduction. For example, a loan situated in a listed country for four years could be transferred to another branch of the same legal entity in an unlisted country, held there for a year, and written off. Under the Government's proposed legislation, it is true that the taxpayer would obtain a deduction for 20 per cent of the bad debt in those circumstances, which is significantly different from, and addresses significantly, the problem we have now where a person could get a 100 per cent deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats' amendment raises some problems from our point of view. It recognises only in the negative in terms of the reverse onus of proof. There might be a quite valid commercial reason for transferring loans between countries. Companies might be restructuring their business operations-for example, in response to political or economic instability in a particular country-or they might be trying to streamline their operations. They ought to be able to do that. To the extent that the restructuring affects where the bad debt-if I can use this phrase-resides, they will pay tax accordingly. That is what this clause will require them to do. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a major practical difficulty in determining the precise point, the precise time, at which a doubtful debt becomes bad. This goes to Senator Watson's point and it is a flaw in the Democrats' amendment. There would be significant debate about when, to use my example, in a five-year period, the debt might have become a bad debt. It may not be as simple and as straightforward as it seems. I think that the sorts of arrangements that are targeted here are likely to be caught up under Part IVa. I think that that is the more appropriate way to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that we are not having a proliferation of court cases under Part IVa is not necessarily a sign that it does not work. It is more likely, I would suggest, to be a sign that it does. The fact that one does not have to take initiatives to prosecute is more likely to be a sign that Part IVa is engendering enhanced compliance than that we are failing to use it in circumstances where appropriately we could. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not yet seen an indication where the administration of the Australian Taxation Office approaches a taxpayer, say arising from an audit, though not necessarily in those circumstances, and raises a concern about a particular procedure and says that part IVa will be invoked if he does not change his assessment and pay tax accordingly. If the person then complies, he is very unlikely to put out a press release saying, `I am only doing this because I was threatened with Part IVa'. That does not seem to me to be a very conceivable scenario. Obviously, I neither have, nor should have, the information under the tax Act to indicate-and if I did have the information, I would not be in a position to reveal it to the chamber-that any individual taxpayer might have had Part IVa invoked or threatened. I think that it is widely and properly regarded as an effective anti-avoidance measure. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that the sorts of transactions about which the Democrats are understandably concerned are tax avoidance transactions, people are liable to Part IVa now and are not effectively any more liable to Part IVaa under the Democrats' proposal. The Government's amendment, incorporated in the Bill, is a substantial improvement on the operation of the law as it stands and it ought to stand as it is. </PARA>

The rationale for my question is that many small businesses perceive themselves to be in an environment with government bringing forward, on a regular basis, the collecting of income. This is reflected in the new regime of corporate tax payments where there is a very short interval between the earning of income and the payment of tax. In many cases there is a deficiency in terms of cash flow because of the extended credit terms that are offered by some companies.</PARA></TALK.START>

A number of companies could find themselves paying unnecessary penalties in the case of a tax audit if there has been a change in administrative procedure-for example, of insisting that there is a technical wiping off of the company off the register of companies by the liquidator before the debt is allowed-and that will certainly be a matter of some concern. I think there is a precedent for that sort of concern in the taxpayers' minds because the deductibility for capital losses now, in the event of an investment loss, does not arise until the company has been technically cut off the register. This is causing a lot of concern to people who have capital gains, particularly capital gains losses, because, as we know, those losses are not available to be offset against income, only against future capital gains. I believe that is an inequity which needs to be addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats oppose these clauses. Clauses 17 to 30 in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill provide depreciation and other allowances for Australian companies building or engaging in other commercial activities overseas. The Australian Democrats believe that Australian companies should be encouraged to engage in commercial activities and to provide jobs in Australia, not offshore. We find it nonsensical that we provide incentives for Australian companies to provide jobs, to carry out research and development and to develop products which can be used in international markets to fortify our position there and to reduce our balance of payments to a more favourable position, but then encourage Australian companies, by depreciation and other allowances-in fact, we are giving them incentives-to move their operations offshore. We believe that that is a very short-sighted policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that there is a theory that the whole world is one market and that we must participate, but surely this Government's duty is to ensure that Australian business provides jobs, provides a viable economy and makes Australia competitive overseas by building up our industrial capacity in Australia. The Australian Democrats oppose these clauses, which provide tax benefits to companies operating offshore. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal-National Party coalition does not perceive these changes by way of amendment to be an incentive. It does not perceive them to be a subsidy, but a legitimate cost of operations. Why should one company operating in Australia vis-a-vis its branch operating overseas have a different taxation regime for the deductibility of expenses?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a question of consistency in the application of taxation law. There is a need for international consistency in the determination of income. The Liberal-National Party Opposition perceives these provisions to be an omission from previous legislation. We acknowledge that the Government has moved to rectify a previous deficiency in earlier legislation to which we drew attention. We welcome the changes and believe that they will make Australian industry very much more internationally competitive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be brief on these clauses. The opposition to these clauses reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of decision making and the proper manner of operation of the taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point is the most important. Fundamentally, we have changed the law to provide that income which was not previously taxable as Australian income is now taxable, and that is a very good thing. We are proposing that the standard tax law should apply to that, that is, expenditure incurred in earning income is deductible against that income. That is the law and always has been. We say that these provisions will enable that to continue to be the law. It was right that we should have extended the tax law to offshore income, but it remains the application of the standard taxation principles that expenditure incurred in earning income should be deductible against it. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that one can have either principle. One can say that it is not assessable income and that one cannot deduct the expenditure incurred. That was the previous situation. It was worse. I did not support it, but at least it was consistent. The other principle is that it is Australian income. By previous legislation we deemed that income to be Australian. We are now saying that we will tax on the profit but not on the revenue and ignore the costs incurred in earning that money. That is not a sensible definition of income. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that a sensible analyst with any understanding of the operation of any organisation, let alone just business or a business operating overseas, would think that people would charge overseas and do their research and development because they could get depreciation on their buildings over 40 years. Nobody will make a research and development location decision based on that sort of factor. It is absurd. We are simply saying that we have properly defined this income as Australian income, that the normal tax laws should apply to it and that the expenses incurred in earning it should be deductible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to pick up one point made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) and it relates to the criteria that would be applied by businesses when they decide where to locate their activities. It is a matter of public knowledge that most overseas countries offer much higher tax incentives and other incentives to businesses to locate activities in those countries, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia. Why should we add to that? If our companies, our Australian businesses, find it in their interests to go overseas, that is highly regrettable. They withdraw economic activity and withdraw jobs from Australia. We are adding to the balance of the things that those people will look at. Certainly it will not be the only deciding factor, but it may well be the straw that finally breaks the camel's back. The Australian Democrats cannot see the sense in these amendments and we are pressing them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While understanding the rationale behind some of these changes, the Opposition must express some concern at the cancellation of past built-up credits in the matter which has been brought about in the legislation before us. However, we do seek an assurance from the Government that it will look into a further amendment in the case of accident disability formula that is presently in this legislation. I think, unofficially, we have been told that the matter will be subject to some further examination. I was wondering whether the Government could give us some assurance that this matter is under active consideration and tell us when we are likely to receive an amendment to overcome an anomaly. It is a question of whether the credits accrue to profits or to shareholders funds. I think there is a need for parallel treatment of policies written by life companies vis-a-vis general insurance, so it is a question of ensuring that there is appropriate consistency in the law no matter who writes the particular business.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>In the interest of time I will speak on all the Government amendments at the same time, to save doing it three times. These further amendments propose some minor alterations to the capital gains tax changes proposed by the Bill and result from further representations made to the Government. The amendments do not change the substance of the Bill and impose no additional obligations on taxpayers. They will apply from the date of introduction of the Bill, 6 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will ensure that no double tax can arise on the disposal of a partner's interest in a partnership asset and will also ensure that an individual partner can obtain roll-over relief on the transfer of an interest in a partnership to a company wholly owned by the partner. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed further amendments will also limit the operation of new anti-avoidance rules which apply where an asset is transferred between companies under common ownership for actual consideration less than the asset's indexed cost base. The amendment will ensure that no cost base adjustments will be made to genuine third party loans which are not reduced in value as a result of the asset's transfer. Full details of the amendments are contained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum previously circulated. I commend the amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I would like to draw the attention of the Committee to what a lot of people regard as an unsatisfactory feature of the capital gains tax legislation as a result of the changes to introduce the concept of market consideration. While it is indeed a preferable alternative to the issuing of securities, I do believe we have an unsatisfactory situation. The records have to be kept almost indefinitely because in 25 years time there could be a change, a disposal of the assets, and there is a need therefore to keep the records for 25 years plus five years. That is not easy for any organisation to ensure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The retention of records over such a long period of time with the changes of personnel is difficult. I believe the Opposition's approach to capital gains, whereby there is a cap on capital grains over a certain period of time so that long-term savings are not subject to capital gains tax, is preferable. I believe these provisions illustrate some of the difficulties of not capping capital gains and having the provision extended over such a long period of time. Here is an example of one of the practical difficulties of having to trace and to keep all these records for such a long time. </PARA>

<PARA>  `(12) For the purposes of subsection (10) ``prescribed overseas travel expenses'' means expenses incurred in respect of attendance at a conference held, or otherwise organised and controlled, by an Australian organisation where that conference is held outside Australia.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The first of these amendments seeks to remove tax deductibility for the remaining advertising expenditure that is still legal for tobacco as well as all advertising for alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA> I can do no better than rest my case on the authority of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Peter Staples. I refer to the Minister's press statement of 6 March 1991 which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Drug abuse costs the Australian community more than $14.3 billion every year. </PARA>
<PARA>This was in fact the finding of a study undertaken by two senior economists for the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse which was released on that date by the Minister. The two academics carrying out the study from the Macquarie University and the Health Economics Department at the University of New South Wales, Mr David Collins and Helen Lapsley, have estimated the annual economic cost of tobacco use at more than $6.8 billion and the cost of alcohol abuse at over $6 billion. The cost of illicit drugs to the economy was estimated at nearly $1.5 billion. But we are not dealing with those today. </PARA>
<PARA> In his statement, the Minister stressed that the estimates by the researchers were based on the most conservative figures and wherever there was a range of costs they always adopted the lowest cost estimate. Mr Staples also adverted, seeing we are talking about taxation matters and the economy, to the effects on the economy of such a large amount of money which is simply going down the drain, and which we support by allowing tax deductibility for promotional expenses. I quote from the statement:</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of micro-economic reform, there is clearly much to be gained for the Australian economy and the community generally by focusing on the social and financial policies which determine the extent of cigarette use and alcohol abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the case is well made. I shall not detain the Committee any longer. The Democrats believe strongly that we should not support promotional expenditure on advertising these products, which result in these massive costs to the Australian community, by allowing tax deductibility. My amendment seeks to remove that deductibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment seeks to remove tax deductibility for that part of incomes that is above $200,000. We were told that it is the politics of envy or jealousy to suggest that that would be a just measure. I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that this is roughly eight times average weekly earnings. While certain high-fliers, certain banks and certain paper entrepreneurs may well find it advisable to pay salaries above $200,000, $500,000 or even above $1m, we consider that somewhat obscene when we are asking the workers of this country to abide by the accord and to moderate their claims for wage increases. We do not mind if people pay $500,000 or $1m or any other amount above $200,000. We just do not see why that should be encouraged by allowing the employer a tax deduction for the amount above $200,000. People who advocate that this should continue should look at the disparity in wealth and income that we have arrived at in Australia. I refer again, as I did yesterday, to an article by Richard Farmer headed `Wealth by Stealth'. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Even within the top 20 per cent of income earners, the benefits of Labor's tax changes have not been felt by many. The top 5 per cent have grabbed all the extra income. Their share of the total after-tax cake is up from 10.6 per cent to 14.2 per cent, with the top one per cent accounting for 2.5 of those 3.6 percentage points. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Given this massive redistribution, there are two surprises. The first is that the ACTU has been able to keep the wages accord in operation at all. For those earning $35,000 or less, and that was more than 80 per cent of tax payers in 1988-89, there must have been something obscene at watching what happened to executive salaries compared to their own. </PARA>
<PARA>I concur, and that is the reason we are pushing these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The third amendment seeks to remove tax deductibility for expenses of conferences held overseas by Australian companies or organisations. It does not attack legitimate expenses of people travelling overseas to acquire knowledge or information, to attend international conferences, to carry out research or to use sabbatical leave to increase their knowledge. It would indeed help if Senator Panizza and Senator Crane were a little more conversant with the facts of the amendment before they made such claims. </PARA>
<PARA> The only area that would be attacked by our amendment would be if an Australian organisation such as, say, the Australian Medical Association of New South Wales were to have its annual general meeting and conference in Hawaii. The question I am asking Senator Panizza is: why should he and Australian taxpayers support that sort of rort? Why should we pay for holidays overseas of people that can conduct their business equally well in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Panizza interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I pick up the particular point that Senator Panizza raised that when one is at a conference one is in a position to do additional research and to acquire additional knowledge. I venture to say that, if a taxpayer can substantiate to the Commissioner of Taxation that, apart from attending to the business of the Australian organisation at the conference, he has carried out research or acquired knowledge or information which was essential for his business or profession, I believe that would be an allowable tax deductible expense. The Minister might like to clarify that point in his response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have dealt with the details of the three amendments. I would like to advert to some of the general points made in particular by the Minister who said, in effect, that we should not worry about individual amendments to the tax legislation. He said that that was simply gleaning in bits and pieces, like a bowerbird, all that glitters. He said that we should wait for the Government to introduce comprehensive tax reform. The question is: how long should we wait and why should we not attend to the individual items that come to our attention, either by constituents or because they are obvious areas of unjust operation of our taxation system? Why should we defer?</PARA>
<PARA> I recall that last year I moved amendments to remove sales tax from recycled plastic products as well as from wheelchairs and other equipment used by disabled people. The argument that the Minister gave me then was, `Well, we have to look at the industry statement; we have to consider our position; we have got to look at it in toto and we will do something in due course'. The net result of that procrastination is that disabled people still pay sales tax on items of equipment that they have to use. We are not supporting the recycling of plastic products by removing sales tax from them. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay tribute to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, who saw fit to move to agree to such an amendment to remove customs duty from wheelchairs and other items being used by disabled people. I pay tribute to his understanding of the need for such piecemeal reform. So what if it is piecemeal? So what if we see one particular item that needs to be rectified? Are we going to sit back and say, `No, we will allow whatever is wrong with the system to continue for another six months or another 12 months until we are ready to present an omnibus Bill that is two inches thick'? I believe that is not the approach that this Government should take. It is not an approach that the Australian Democrats are prepared to countenance. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Minister's attention to yet another item that Senator Bell mentioned recently. He has been asking tax authorities on numerous occasions why members of volunteer fire brigades are subject to fringe benefits. Why, when they receive no money for the work that they do-protecting the homes in their neighbourhood-do they have to pay fringe benefits tax for fireproof overalls that they receive, for instance? If we brought in an amendment like that, would the Minister also say, `This is too little an item to be worried about. We will leave it until we revise the whole tax legislation in two or three years time'? I believe it is almost an arrogant approach; I do not use that term in a personal sense, and I am sure that the Minister will not take it personally. But it is an arrogant approach for the Government to say, `Yes, we know there is something wrong, and thanks for drawing our attention to it. We agree with you, but, no, we are not going to do anything about it'. I believe it is a situation that we should not countenance. </PARA>
<PARA> I rather regret that Senator Watson, though obviously competent and conversant with tax legislation, does not accept, as we do, the responsibility to address such items-such reforms-which affect individual people. They are not big items, I agree, but they are nevertheless items that people have said are wrong; that people agree are wrong. Senator Watson has said, `Yes, I agree with you in substance but, no, we are not going to support you. We do not think it is the job of the Opposition to interfere with a government's financial or Budget strategy'. That is what Senator Watson told me last time when I talked to him about the sales tax on wheelchairs and recycled plastic items. I am afraid I have to ask Senator Watson why he is in the Senate. Is it simply to assist Senator McMullan to finetune taxation legislation, but not to address obvious items which require amendment? If the Opposition takes that view that it is not going to interfere with the Government's financial or Budget strategy, what is its purpose in being in this place?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -There will always be temptations to use the Income Tax Assessment Act for purposes other than raising genuine income tax revenue. Whatever provisions a government links in this Act to promote other economic or social goals, no matter how desirable, there will always be unintended consequences. There are too many such provisions already adding to the huge set of words. My advice to the Australian Democrats is to use a more direct process than by way of amendment to income tax legislation; that comment is addressed to Senator Spindler's amendment No. 3.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to amendment No. 4 proposed by the Australian Democrats, I remind them that many of Australia's largest companies would be denied a deduction where the salaries of their senior executives exceed $200,000. We simply would not get the best sorts of people under those circumstances to manage some of our very biggest companies. The amendment is framed in such a way as not to refer to remuneration packages as such. Therefore, the relevant payers of salaries in excess of $200,000 would resort to add on fringe benefits allowances, with the companies paying the fringe benefits tax. That is the weakness in the Australian Democrats' amendment that they have put forward. This would make the fringe benefit remuneration packages even more attractive to the wage recipient. Already the Income Tax Assessment Act provides for excessive amounts in certain circumstances with private companies to be deemed in dividends. Therefore, I believe that amendment No. 4 reflects the politics of envy. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to amendment No. 5, dealing with overseas conferences, I do believe that there is a genuine attempt here to rectify a problem. But I must say that on the Opposition side we acknowledge certain drafting deficiencies in the manner in which it has been put forward. In addition, it does presume that all knowledge and wisdom resides in the minds of Australians. There is the presumptuous proposition that does tend to take an isolationist view of the world, which Australia, in these sorts of circumstances at the present time, cannot accept. </PARA>
<PARA> If agreed to, this amendment would actually preclude Australian people who are competent experts in their particular field, whether it be academic, scientific or industrial, from getting involved in organising or controlling-it is very loosely worded-any international conference. I believe that to put such an imposition or a restriction on the ability of those people to organise or control even an international conference-I know that was not the intention of the Democrats, but this is the unintended consequence that must automatically follow from the wording that has been put before the Committee today-is a presumptuous and preposterous matter that we surely should contend. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Senator Coulter certainly would be outraged to think that, if he were to get involved in organising or controlling a good international conference-it could be inferred that it had been organised by Senator Coulter in Australia-even though it might bring some of the best academic brains around the world-</PARA>

We could have deductibility for repairs to chainsaws used to cut down trees in certain forests. That is another moral issue. If the Democrats want to get selective, I can get selective too.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I ask the Minister whether his attention has been drawn to a speech by the Opposition spokesperson on retirement incomes policy at a recent conference in Wollongong of major superannuation funds in which the spokesperson, Senator Alston, suggested that improvements made by the Government relating to trustees of superannuation funds would lead to a decline in standards of probity in the management of these funds. Can the Minister advise the Senate whether or not there is any substance to this suggestion?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, of course there is no substance to this allegation by Senator Alston. I might say that I had the pleasure, on invitation from the organiser of the conference, to address the conference the next day. The conference was still scandalised by the attempt-crude though it be-of Senator Alston to politicise the debate on superannuation. The hairy-chested interjector we know here collapsed into a Uriah Heap at the conference in the face of stern questioning from the floor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The truth is that under our Administration, the Hawke Labor Government, superannuation cover is now a right of ordinary Australian working people. Indeed, since 1986 some 2.3 million extra Australians now have superannuation cover because of our support through the accord in achieving that principle as a principle of wage fixation in the national wage case of that year and their having access to that right through their awards. That is a quite significant achievement when one considers that ordinary working people in this country aspire to a dignified retirement.</PARA>
<PARA> In the past superannuation was something that applied to the elite managerial circle of companies more typically than it applied to ordinary working people in factories, plants, offices, mine sites and elsewhere where they were working in Australia. That right has brought with it a role for those people to serve as trustees on industry funds. It seems that the point of Senator Alston's complaint was that, because some people may have got there by being nominated from a union, somehow or other they lack probity or responsibility in managing those funds. That is an outrageous slur. It is an indication of the approach that the Opposition has to the rights of ordinary workers. Of course, that was rejected quite clearly by the participants in that conference, many of whom were actuaries, professional fund managers and others who have direct experience of the management of these funds.</PARA>
<PARA> The other point worth making is that I was questioned at that conference about a fund which has obviously been mismanaged. The interesting example of this fund is that it is in Western Australia. I will not name the company because it is said now that the company proposes to change the situation. But this was a fund in which the company went into receivership and the receivers, when they looked at the entitlements in the fund, found that the fund had been mismanaged as a cash box for the company rather than as a fund containing deferred income of workers. Since the fund had been run down the entitlements of workers that should have matured through that fund were not there. Here is the case of the mismanagement of the past in the private sector in the area that in my view was not properly regulated until we came along. It has nothing to do with a union fund but is an example of how superannuation funds in the past in some companies-certainly not all-were seen not as deferred pay but as a cash box to be raided by the companies where the directors of the company were often the same as the trustees of the fund and they appropriated the money for the needs of the company rather than for the interests of the beneficiaries of the funds.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industrial Relations. It relates to the compliance provisions of the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act which have seen the naming in Parliament of those companies which have failed to comply in the past. Is the Minister able to advise whether there has been an improvement in the rate of compliance with the Act recently?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2191" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, there has been, as Senator West has rightfully pointed out, being a senator who has taken an avid interest in the important social reforms of this Government. In 1986 the Hawke Labor Government introduced the Affirmative Action (Equal Opportunity for Women) Act and that is an integral part of our program to increase and improve opportunities for women in the workplace in Australia. The Act does require that public and private employers comply with it by saying what the composition of their work force is and what strategies they are proposing to adopt to improve the opportunities for women. Therefore, the underlying theory of the Act is that employers should be encouraged to think about the problems and encouraged to answer the problems in the most appropriate way for them. The only sanction for not doing this is that those employers who are errant are named in Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 7 November last I tabled the annual report of the Affirmative Action Agency which showed a pleasing 97 per cent compliance rate. Some 2,300 private firms complied with the Act, but some 75 firms were named as non-compliers. I can now say to the Senate that 26 of those 75 firms have complied and I think that does show that the sanction of having them named in the Parliament is effective and does encourage compliance.</PARA>
<PARA> One of those 26 firms, Suttons Investments Pty Ltd from New South Wales-the only company of all of the companies in this country which, for three years in a row, had been a militant non-complier-has now complied and it has now filed a report with the Affirmative Action Agency. Characteristically, the Suttons report shows that in that company women are concentrated in the lower paid menial jobs and that the executive positions are occupied exclusively by men.</PARA>
<PARA> The Affirmative Action Agency believes that the Suttons report shows that the company is mindful of that distortion and that it does now intend to address it. The Agency advises me that it now looks forward to an improvement in compliance, given that this, if you like, most extreme non-complier has now seen the error of its ways and is proposing to alter the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude this answer, I emphasise that I would be wrong to concentrate just on the negative aspects of this matter. In its report the Affirmative Action Agency announced the triple-A awards for companies which are best practice models in Australia for respecting the aspirations of women in the work force. The names of those companies always bear repeating as the model companies, and they are: Lend Lease, Westpac Banking Corporation, Esso Australia Ltd, Griffith University, Western Sydney University and Hewlett-Packard Australia Ltd.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I preface my question by referring to the comments made by a senior Minister last weekend that the economic orthodoxy in Australia over-emphasises the market and underplays the role of government. Firstly, does the Minister agree that the level of the Australian dollar is critical in determining whether Australia has a competitive manufacturing industry? Secondly, does the Minister further agree that the Government might need to take measures to influence the exchange level of the dollar? Specifically, would the Minister now support the proposal to increase the withholding tax on interest paid to foreign lenders which would, firstly, put downward pressure on the exchange rate; secondly, increase government revenue; thirdly, discourage further foreign borrowings by Australians; and, lastly, lessen the tax avoidance opportunities currently available?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not respond to Senator Alston. Ignorance is bliss and he is in a state of bliss at the moment.

So is inflation and so are a whole range of other issues which go to the competitiveness of the Australian economy, whether it be the performance levels of firms or the environment in which firms operate in respect of taxation and other issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind Senator Spindler that the value of the Australian dollar has fallen since September last year from 89c of the US dollar to 78c. That is an indication of how the market judges these issues. So the answer to the second part of Senator Spindler's question is no, the Government does not see any need to influence the level of the Australian dollar.</PARA>
<PARA> The third point relates to the support for the proposal for a withholding tax. Senator Spindler suggested a number of things that a withholding tax might do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly agree with the view that one would have liked to have encouraged more industry involvement in the cooperative research centres, particularly in respect of how new centres or proposals were generated. A very large proportion of these proposals were generated from research organisations such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and university departments. Having said that, some 50 centres will be established by 1994-95. Some of them are extremely good in terms of their industry participation. For example, one based on the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute in Melbourne has very high quality and important industry involvement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first of the 15 cooperative research centres were announced by the Minister for Science and Technology last month. As Senator Crowley comes from South Australia, I note that South Australia is the beneficiary of two grants and part of a third grant under the cooperative research centre program.</PARA>
<PARA> The cooperative research centres are designed to capture the benefits of Australia's world class capabilities in resource-based industries-environmental and waste management, material science, information technology, medical research and the Antarctic region. Many of the applications received were of a very high standard and justifies the conclusion, which I am certainly prepared to draw, that Australia can be proud of its research and development capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Private industry is a participant in 12 of the 15 centres. Industry is contributing over $90m to those 12 centres in cash and kind. Half of the centres have a strong engineering component and will promote the flow of engineering skills into industry. Two of the 15 will be located in Tasmania, two in Queensland, two in South Australia and two in the Australian Capital Territory. Victoria and New South Wales will have three centres each, while the centre for aerospace structures will be jointly located in Victoria and New South Wales. One would hope that, with the success or impending success of some of these centres, there will be more applications and more industry participation at the initiation stage of these types of research centres.</PARA>

At this stage I am advised that that review is continuing and a final decision is yet to be made. The AIDEX exhibition, as Senator Vallentine knows, is conducted by a private company and it is not scheduled to take place until November this year. Under those circumstances the Government does not regard finalisation of the review of any defence involvement as being a matter of pressing urgency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of the review of our defence export guidelines, both Senator Ray and I have indicated that they will be reviewed in the light of recent international developments, particularly the Gulf war. That remains the case. The matter was discussed recently by an interdepartmental committee. It will be the subject of further deliberations by that committee and, no doubt, by the Ministers immediately involved prior to any announcement that Senator Ray might make on that subject.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the last part of Senator Vallentine's question, I am aware of the interest of a number of Middle Eastern states in purchasing further supplies of arms from the United States. I cannot comment on the specific figure of $30 billion worth of pending orders. I do not know whether that is accurate. The Government has already spoken to a number of other governments, including that of the United States, about post-Gulf war arms control. These proposals for arms control are still in an early state of development. I simply say that the Australian Government would be wholly in favour of any means that may prove practicable to limit either the further arming or the rearming, as the case may be, of countries in the Middle East region.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I might just say that Australia, as Senator Vallentine should be aware, is a very active participant in all the principal forums which are addressing controls on both conventional and non-conventional arms and their delivery systems. The work that is going on has general application, apart from its particular application in the Middle East. I shall only list them, not talk about them. They include: first, the United Nations expert group on arms transfers which is currently looking particularly at conventional weapons and the possibility of an international register to guarantee a greater degree of transparency; secondly, various efforts that are being made, in which this Government is very prominent, to get a convention on chemical weapons into place; thirdly, the efforts that we are making in the area of nuclear non-proliferation, including vertical proliferation, through our enthusiasm for a comprehensive test ban; fourthly, the status we have as a party to the biological weapons convention and the active role we are playing in trying to bring other states to become parties to that convention; and, finally, our recent membership of the missile technology control regime where we again are playing a recent, but active, part in controlling further development of those systems, which obviously bear so much on arms delivery.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. I draw the Senate's attention to, and welcome, the recent release from imprisonment by the Appeal Court in London of a group of men who have become known as the Birmingham Six. I ask the Minister: bearing in mind that the Australian system of justice is a direct development of the British system, are there any lessons or consequences from this appeal decision and previous trials to Australia's legal system of justice? Will the Australian Government be adopting any special initiatives to monitor the royal commission set up by the British Government to investigate this apparent major miscarriage of justice that incarcerated six men in prison for 16 1/2 years for crimes the courts now accept they did not commit in the first place? Finally, I ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that no similar or like incident could occur within the legal system of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for his question. I know that, as Irish Australian for the year, his concern in this matter stems from that passionate concern for justice which has characterised the Irish people over many generations. I am delighted to be able to acknowledge his recent selection to that status. Of course, I am also aware of the case of the Birmingham Six, where allegations of impropriety and perhaps criminality on the part of investigating officers, the police involved, have led the British Government to establish a royal commission into the criminal justice process in England and Wales, or perhaps in the whole of the United Kingdom-of that I am not sure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that there are several lessons to be learnt from that exposure of the shortcomings of the investigation that was undertaken which led to the incarceration of the Birmingham Six. I suppose the first lesson we ought to take is that capital punishment should have no place in a criminal justice system. Criminal justice systems are quite fallible and, in this case, the Birmingham Six would certainly have been executed for what was alleged to be a terrible crime of murderous terrorism. It also reminds us of the fact that where we have those advocating the return of capital punishment in relation to most serious crimes, we have to be particularly on guard against the sorts of pressures that can be felt by police and, indeed, juries to bring alleged culprits to successful prosecution in these cases.</PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore very good that, on 2 October last year, the Australian Government was able to accede to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights second protocol which signified that Australia had abolished the death penalty and was part of the world community which made that one of its central tenets of civilised behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also the case that one has to take special steps to safeguard the criminal justice system from being distorted by perjury and other methods of fabrication of evidence by police officers, which appears to have been the case in that instance. In that respect, the Senate, perhaps as early as this afternoon, will be taking a very important step in ensuring that certainly in the case of Australian Federal Police investigations of serious fraud matters and drug trafficking offences of a most serious kind there will be a video recording made of the questioning of suspects, whether under arrest or not.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this will be an extremely important protection, both for the police against whom allegations of verballing might be made and particularly on behalf of those persons who might be subjected to questioning and who could have evidence fabricated against them by police officers who are being overzealous in the attempt to ensure that the suspect they have faces the court and is convicted. I believe that the Senate this afternoon will be taking a very important step to overcome some of the difficulties which have been revealed in the case of the Birmingham Six.</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, only two or three weeks ago, in a majority judgment, 4 : 3, the High Court indicated that it would be unsafe now in Australia-and certainly the judge should warn the jury against this-to accept uncorroborated evidence of simply a written confession by a suspect. Therefore, the video taping that we are undertaking will be certainly in accord with the spirit of the decision of the High Court in that case.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McKiernan finally asked whether I was satisfied that no similar incident could occur within the legal system of Australia. The answer is clearly no. As my friend and colleague Senator Collins will know from his strong advocacy in the Chamberlain case, we have an instance in Australia where certainly a decision by the court system was found to be not secure at all, largely because of the difficulty in relation to forensic evidence. Once again, had there been a death penalty in place, very clearly, Lindy Chamberlain would now be dead.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there are many lessons to be learnt. As for the question of whether we will keep an eye on the royal commission being established in the United Kingdom to look into the criminal justice system there, of course, we will but perhaps it may well be the case that the royal commission should examine Australian practice as it is developing and the protections that we are affording, both in the interests of those suspects who are taken in for questioning and in the interests of the police. I believe that the royal commission established in England could well learn from the Australian system how to erect safeguards to ensure that the terrible miscarriage of justice that occurred there does not recur.</PARA>

<PARA>So as long as substantial donations can be made to political parties or candidates without disclosure, they can be used to purchase influence. The law that allows secret political donations, creates conditions conducive to corrupt conduct.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, there is widespread support in the community for the Government's proposition in terms of full and adequate disclosure, not only for political parties but also for third party organisations. In fact, even Senator Hill, I believe, made some comments which did not unequivocally reject the proposal in that area.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposals in this area are interwoven. On the one hand, we are providing for full and adequate disclosure. On the other hand, we are attacking the problem by containing campaign costs. As I have said consistently, we cannot do one and be effective without doing the other as well. The Government's proposals are geared towards the achievement of good, clean, honest government in this country. We are doing that by containing costs in this area. As I said yesterday, we are doing it in such a way that it enhances the democratic system.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone mentioned the name of Mr Bob Hogg. Mr Hogg has had different views on this proposition but I must say to Senator Vanstone and others that two main basic premises have driven the Government in producing the package of proposals in this area. One is to ensure a clean political environment and the other is to provide equity in the political process. As a consequence, we have taken the hard decision to not only provide for disclosure of all income and expenditure for parties, but also ensure that audit provisions can be undertaken in such a way that they are effective. At the same time we are taking this measure to ensure that the containment of costs of campaigning, by the prohibition of radio and television political advertising, has a very meaningful effect on the need for political parties to ensure that they are adequately funded by the corporate dollar.</PARA>

Those decisions on advertising take place over those particular periods of time. We would also argue that, because decisions on funding are taken in two or three years' time and not now, the precise figure on government advertising cannot be produced.

He asked a question last September in the Estimates hearings about the duration of employment in regional offices for departmental officers who `completed spells of employment'.

In regional offices it is a bit less, the average being 6.2 years-just a tad more than 286 days, I think one would have to say. As far as transfers and resignations are concerned, the DSS rates are more than comparable to other agencies.

<PARA> Progress towards implementation was considered by the council of Australian transport Ministers, the Australian Transport Advisory Council, on 5 April this year. At this meeting the Commonwealth indicated a willingness to make an equity contribution of $150m to establish the NRFC. Further work will be undertaken by a committee of officials to examine options for establishing the equity shares and funding of the NRFC. Transport Ministers will meet again in early May and the issues will also be considered at the next Special Premiers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the last part of Senator Schacht's question about this initiative being destroyed by parochialism, I sincerely hope that it is not. But that prospect, of course, always remains. Only a week ago I had the pleasure of opening, jointly with the Northern Territory Attorney-General, Daryl Manzie, an Australian Securities Commission office in Darwin. It is this kind of joint Federal-State initiative-like the national rail freight initiative, the proposals in the Inter-State Commission's recommendations on road transport charges and the Australian Securities Commission's initiatives that were launched by the Federal Government-that we need to break down some of the inefficiencies in this country caused by the parochial attitudes engendered by entrenched attitudes on States rights. I certainly hope that that does not rear its head in this very important matter of a national rail freight corporation.</PARA>

In view of the fact that it is some six months since the matter of the Ravenshoe sawmill was referred to the Attorney-General's Department, I ask the Minister: have any charges yet been brought in relation to the disappearance of $7.6m of Commonwealth money from the mill?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that it would be appropriate for me to talk about whether or not somebody is about to be charged. I do not think that Ministers can do that. But I can give him a resume of what has occurred to date. Between June 1988 and April 1990, when the company went into receivership, the Government paid $7.5m under a loan and subsidy agreement worth $8m in net present value terms to Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd to retool its sawmill and maintain a work force of 40. The Minister wrote to the receivers on 19 June and 14 September 1990 to seek details of how that had been spent. Incomplete reports on the use of Commonwealth assistance were received from the receivers on 19 and 25 September. Information indicates that there is a question whether the loan and subsidy assistance had been applied in accordance with the agreement and on 16 October the Minister referred the matter to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General's Department and the Minister's Department briefed senior counsel in December of last year. As a result of that, further information was sought from the receivers in January this year. When it became apparent in February that the receivers were unable to provide the information sought, the Minister's Department commissioned Price Waterhouse in Canberra to review the company's records. That report was received in early March and a copy sent to senior counsel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister's Department wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 20 February. This was followed on 8 March by reference to him of the Price Waterhouse Canberra review. Senior counsel advised his legal opinion to the Attorney-General's Department on 26 March this year and the Minister's Department, the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Federal Police are continuing to examine the legal issues.</PARA>
<PARA> So it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on that matter until those investigations are completed. Similarly, it would not be appropriate to release the information provided by the receivers, senior counsel, or Price Waterhouse because possible Commonwealth legal action might be prejudiced.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that some recommendations on this matter will be going to the Attorney-General within a matter of days. I can assure Senator O'Chee and the Senate that we will endeavour to make that information public at the earliest possible opportunity.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Zakharov gave me notice of this question as it involves detailed matters of which I was unaware. Ninety-five per cent of the applications for registration and assessment received by the Child Support Agency are processed within 28 days, and that is the objective of the Agency. In the few cases where there are delays, they are caused by the unavailability of relevant information-for example, a tax file number cannot be obtained for the liable parent or the relevant tax return may not have been lodged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Early last year there were problems with delays in the Child Support Agency due to a lack of resources. The Government moved quickly to address this problem and backlogs were cleared by September 1990. A structural delay of eight weeks for the first payment to be made to the custodial parent through the child support scheme is due to the arrears method of payment. Child support which is assessed for the first month is not due until the seventh of the next month. The maintenance collected is deposited into the custodial parent's bank account on the first Wednesday of the following month. After this initial delay, payments are made on a regular monthly basis, provided that the non-custodial parent makes his or her payment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Child Support Agency has examined options for reducing this delay in receiving the first payment. No quick improvements can be identified while a basic tenet of the scheme-only paying out what is collected-remains. However, client dissatisfaction has been less obvious now that there is better understanding of the payment and disbursement cycle. Prior to the Government accepting the challenge of implementing the child support scheme, statistics indicated that approximately seven out of 10 people with liabilities to pay child maintenance failed to pay that maintenance at all, or if they did make payments they were irregular, both in amount and in time.</PARA>
<PARA> The Agency is successful in recovering over 70 per cent of liabilities registered for collection. This represents a significant turnaround compared with the pre-scheme collections. The Agency is currently collecting nearly $10m each month for the benefit of more than 135,000 children. Approximately 1,000 new registration applications are being processed each week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some further information as a result of a question which Senator Coulter asked yesterday. Inquiries with the Queensland Government reveal that the agreements to which the honourable senator was referring-that is, those agreements of developers for all-electric subdivisions; I think that is a rough translation of what he was saying-and their possible contravention of the principles of the Trade Practices Act were brought to the attention of the relevant Queensland Minister last year.

<PARA> The honourable senator's statement is supported by a study presented in July 1990 under the national energy research, development and demonstration program entitled, `Greenhouse Gas Emissions from the Australian Energy System: The Impact of Energy Efficiency and Substitution'. Furthermore, I can also confirm that a report by the Australian and New Zealand Environment Council of September 1990 entitled, Reducing Greenhouse Gases-Options for Australia identifies Queensland as a State where solar hot water heating should be encouraged.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Paper No. 4 concerns the Advance to the Minister for Finance for March 1991. It is a very interesting document. The Advance to the Minister for Finance is tabled each month. The March statement of the Advance is a more comprehensive statement than has been the case on many other occasions, in the sense that there are many more requests for usage of the Advance to the Minister for Finance than is normally the case. I do not wish to dwell on all of them, but I commend consideration of the details of the Advance generally to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to particularly draw to the attention of the Senate an application for funds from the Advance to the Minister for Finance for $2m to fund an increase in the Government's emergency relief program for 1990-91. That $2m is an increase on the original Budget appropriation of $7.6m and therefore represents an increase of 26 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement accompanying the request for this application of funds from the Advance to the Minister for Finance says that the reason for the request is `that there has been an unforeseen increase in the demand for emergency relief.' The growth in claimants stems mainly from recently unemployed people and low income families with mixed financial commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> These funds will provide additional emergency relief, particularly for agencies such as the Salvation Army, the Society of St Vincent de Paul and the Smith Family to distribute to people in financial crisis. The point I want to draw to the Senate's attention is the large increase in the requirement for this year. It is an unforeseen increase and is perhaps as stark an example as one could find of the human tragedy and misery that has been occasioned by the Government's economic policies which have led to the deepest recession that this nation has faced since the period of the Great Depression 60 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has told us time and again that he deliberately engineered this recession. Yet we find in the Advance to the Minister for Finance an unexpected, unforeseen demand for an additional 26 per cent of funds to go to those very important and valuable voluntary agencies that provide such wonderful support for people in crisis and destitution in our community. Whilst fully understanding and accepting this additional payment, it is in itself a stark indictment of the policies of this Government and of the human misery and tragedy that it has caused to so many countless thousands of Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch I was addressing these three Australian Democrats amendments. Before I go any further, I have an explanation to make. Whilst addressing those three amendments, especially the first one on the selectivity of business deductions for promotional advertising or expenditure in respect to alcohol or tobacco, I said that it would be a very selective deduction. In other words, the thrust of this amendment is not to allow a deduction for promotional advertising of those products. In the part of my contribution to the debate about why that should not be, I said that other senators could come into this chamber and work on their pet subjects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggested that Senator Harradine might use these methods in the issues that he takes up. He has taken exception to my reference to that. I did not mean to denigrate his work in this place or his ideas. Since he has been in this place, I have been somewhat of a supporter of his. If Senator Harradine refers to his correspondence, he will see that during the past 10 years I have written to him on various issues. I could quite easily have used, and could still use, other honourable senators as an example. For instance, Senator Calvert is a proponent of animal liberation and could quite easily ask to exclude the tax deduction for ammunition in kangaroo culling for the same reason. If Senator Harradine has taken exception I apologise, but my comment was in no way meant to bring him down in the eyes of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall now summarise my objections to these three amendments. I have almost completed my comments as to the first. I believe that we cannot selectively address tax deductions for expenditure. If there are any social or moral reasons for attacking tobacco and alcohol, so be it. Senator Harradine was able to have an amendment passed to take away export incentives on videos involved in the pornography industry as a way of attacking that industry. When it comes to taxation, I believe that all assessable income should be treated in the same way, irrespective of whether it relates to alcohol, tobacco, pornography, animal culling or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> I had partly addressed the $200,000 cap that the Australian Democrats suggested on deductibility of wages. As I said, it is a ridiculous suggestion, because employers being limited to that figure would restrict themselves to employing top management or experts to that salary level. That would cause people qualified to earn a much higher salary to go overseas to seek employment. Last night in the second reading debate Senator Spindler suggested that we should be doing everything to keep industry in Australia, to keep expertise in Australia, to keep technology in Australia and to keep business in Australia, and here he is with an amendment that will tend to send our top, highly qualified executives overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to address the Democrats' fifth amendment, which relates to travelling expenses for conferences or seminars held overseas by totally Australian companies and attended totally by Australian people. I have probably said all that can be said against this amendment in the second reading debate. However, I will briefly go over my comments. I do not believe that we have a mortgage on all knowledge in Australia. I know what Senator Spindler is up to. He wants to prevent these conferences being held overseas so that Australian personnel attending them do not attend them as part of a holiday at the expense of the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> In that regard, the expense is not paid totally by the Australian taxpayer. The tax benefit would only be in direct proportion to a person's tax rate. If a person's nominal tax rate is 30 per cent, that is the rate at which a person can receive a tax deduction-not a 100 per cent refund. No-one receives a 100 per cent tax rebate. One may get a 100 per cent deduction, but the saving in tax is not 100 per cent. Unfortunately, some people seem to think that taxpayers using these mechanisms will receive 100 per cent of the amount that is spent on such a conference by way of a tax refund. They believe that if expenses of, say, $10,000 are tax deductible, that a total refund of $10,000 is received. That is not so. In effect, an amount of $10,000 is taken from that person's total taxable income. That is the difference. </PARA>

With the comments we get from the Democrats it is a bit hard not to turn around and let them have both barrels in the right direction. If a person reduces his taxable income by the amount that he claims, it certainly does not reflect totally what goes into his pocket.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other reasons, as I have mentioned, for holding conferences overseas. Not all conferences are held in Hawaii. If we held a conference in Hawaii, which is roughly halfway between Australia and America, we could get American experts who are not prepared to come all the way to Australia to go there and address the meeting. There could be something in Hawaii, or wherever, that people have to look at. For instance, there could be a hospital conference somewhere. I believe that Toronto, Canada, has the top hospital for mesothelioma in the world. I know that one of those conferences will be attended by Australians next year. There are other things to look at or to do. It is not just a case of sitting down discussing things around a table-or, as Senator Spindler said, having a holiday. There are reasons for doing this, such as special interests, special places and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the way interstate air fares have been and were before deregulation, it has been far cheaper to hold a conference overseas-for example, in Singapore-and fly people out of all of the capital cities in Australia to Singapore or wherever than to fly them from one capital city to another. That is what has led to this sort of thing. I cannot see that such an amendment is necessary. These conferences must continue if we want to get the experts from around the world to attend conferences run by Australians. </PARA>

<PARA> The other point I want to raise is in relation to proposed section 90c and the emphasis it places on Australian organisations. I think it is rather convenient and irresponsible that Senator Spindler uses as an example-I presume a hypothetical example-the New South Wales Australian Medical Association (AMA) going to Hawaii. In selecting that example, Senator Spindler insinuates that in fact the conference was a junket, an excuse for a holiday. I do not know whether the New South Wales AMA went to Hawaii, but certainly if it did, as my colleague Senator Panizza, who spoke before me, outlined, it could well open up the scope for that organisation to invite to Australia experts from other countries such as the United States, Canada and South America. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with some realities that we have to face about Australian organisations. The amendment says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Australian organisation where that conference is held outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to give a couple of examples of conferences that have been held outside Australia by Australian organisations. One was run by the Australian Wheat Board. It held a conference in Russia some two or three years ago when it was establishing certain aspects of the wheat industry and developing that industry. In particular, it was developing Australian trade in the production and sale of Australian made bread. At that conference, it assisted the Russians and other European countries in promoting our product. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the meat industry. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation is the Australian organisation representing this industry. It seems to me that it would be very appropriate to hold a conference in Korea to promote the Australian product and to get expertise from other countries in the Asian area. Countries such as Thailand, China and Japan, to name just a few, could be involved in that. I would see holding a conference in Korea as being a very productive move. This would be in the interest of Australia and would assist in creating Australian jobs. It would assist in overcoming our country's current account problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The same sort of approach could be taken to the wool industry. Once again, it seems very appropriate to me that the Australian Wool Corporation, or any new body that is formed after that, should organise a conference on wool in a country such as China to promote and develop trade. This would assist that country and us in gaining expertise from other business interests around the world. It would assist us in developing our trade in China and promoting that product. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of this type of amendment with its blanket approach could in fact significantly disadvantage Australia in many areas. We can go further by looking at the consequences for Australian business organisations involved in marketing our products and developing our trade. As I said before, I think it is irresponsible to select the New South Wales AMA and insinuate that it is having a junket in Hawaii when the issue is far broader and far more important than that. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly wanted to comment on Democrat amendments Nos. 4 and 5-I am not going to comment on the others because they have been covered-because, if adopted, they would have far- reaching ramifications. I sincerely hope, and believe, that they will not be. The ramifications involved in these types of broad amendments could and would seriously disadvantage the development of Australian trade and opportunities, which lead to Australian jobs and earnings coming back to this country, in many areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal with several matters that have been raised on these three amendments. The first relates to the generalised comments made by Senator Spindler in responding to what I dubbed the bowerbird theory. Given that he so clearly incorrectly summarised what I have been trying to say-I know that he would not do so deliberately and must have misunderstood-let me be more explicit. I am referring to the fact that it is easy for minor parties and for parties that do not have responsibility for the consequences of that which they propose, or that do not have to administer the tax system, to hop about littering the tax Act and the tax system with things which look bright, glittery and attractive, but which have no significant impact or net disadvantage. It is simply another version of a problem which arises not infrequently in this place, and I must say in this instance it is certainly not exclusive to the Australian Democrats on this particular matter, and that is a failure to distinguish between talking about something that is important and doing something important. These three amendments are examples of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not doubt the worthwhileness of the objectives which people are seeking to pursue by these three amendments. In the instance of alcohol and tobacco they are dealing with subjects of great significance. The other matters are of minor moment in financial terms but are matters of some symbolic significance which annoy a number of people, not least myself. I make it clear that when I reject something today, as I have done in the past, because I think it looks attractive superficially but is of no substance or of insufficient substance, I am not saying that no small changes should be made to the Act and that we should wait for some mega-change to the Act. In fact, this Bill is a classic example of the fact that that is not the case because it is full of a large number of small changes to the Act. It is a big Bill, but it is essentially a Bill containing a number of small changes to the Act, all of which I think are appropriate. Indeed, the next Bill that is to come before the House and the sales tax Bills which will come before us in the course of this session will be similar. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the example chosen by Senator Spindler regarding people with disability, I have said that, although everybody is sympathetic with the need to provide greater assistance for those people, there are two points to be made. First, in my view, fiddling with the tax system is not the correct way to provide assistance for those people. The appropriate way for governments to assist people in need is to provide on-budget assistance. Secondly, on the last instance, I recall our discussing that the general principle is the point of significance. I am not sure that the greatest need for people with disabilities lies in the area of the purchase of motor vehicles. If a priority is being set for which area of assistance will be given, I am not sure that that would be it. Therefore, I am not sure that the amendment that was proposed on the previous occasion was appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I sometimes share with Senator Spindler the frustration resulting from the wheels of change turning very slowly. Things that I would like to see happen are initiated but, when the button is pressed, they take a long time to eventuate. It is not a question of in some way arrogantly saying, `Wait for us to fix it' and then doing nothing. In these instances they are not matters in which I believe anything is likely to be done or appropriately should be done through these sorts of amendments to the tax system although, in at least some instances, there are things about which I would like to see something done. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 3 concerning the advertising of tobacco and alcohol is a classic case of being seen to do something but in fact doing something that will have no effect at all. There are two measures available to government to do something about the consumption of cigarettes and alcohol. One, which is in my view the only one with a track record of having any significant impact, is to change the price-to put up the taxes. I notice that there is a move among the States to do that and I hope that they do. It is a great pity that one of the States is equivocating about that, and I hope that the Queensland Government changes its mind and supports the increase in taxes. It is a matter that the Federal Government has dealt with from time to time and may need to deal with again. </PARA>
<PARA> The most effective way of discouraging tobacco consumption is through the tax system, that is, by raising the price of the product, and not by fiddling around the edges. If we adopted Senator Spindler's amendment, I suspect that the price of a packet of cigarettes would not rise by 1c. I also happen to think that advertising tackles the symptom but not the problem. However, if one believes that advertising is the real problem-and I have no difficulty with it-we should do what we have done, which is restrict or, in the case of cigarettes, ban advertising in the areas over which we have jurisdiction. Those things are effective; they do something about the problem. They are not seen as a sort of Dr Feelgood measure. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody in this Senate is more opposed to cigarette consumption or more concerned about its consequences than I. But that does not mean that any measure which talks about it and sticks one's tongue out at the cigarette companies will in some way have any impact at all. It will simply litter the tax system with inappropriate measures which have no beneficial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in the area of the restriction on salary or wage deductions, Senator Spindler is seeking to deal with a problem of real significance, although not great financial significance, to the tax system. It is very annoying sometimes to look at the annual reports of major reputable companies. I am not talking about the fly-by-nighters or some of the people who have recently been ripping-off companies to their own advantage; I am talking about reputable companies still operating efficiently in Australia. When one looks at the back of the annual reports where they have the schedule of salaries, one finds that, say, 50 or 100 executives in an Australian company have salaries higher than the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and whose salaries are rising much more quickly than average weekly earnings. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is correct. Those salaries are rising much more quickly than average weekly earnings or any other reasonable measure. We have had a significant problem of a blow-out in executive salaries in Australia. There are those who say it has been led by the lawyers; that is not for me to say. The solution proposed by Senator Spindler is not unique: members of my own Party have raised it with me and publicly. It is worthy of some consideration, but I cannot see how it could be made to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most major Australian companies-all of the ones that I am familiar with that have this sort of salary level involved-are what are known in the vernacular as group companies. There might be six or seven companies, and one would wind up either with an incredibly complex piece of legislation, having to track the employment record of every individual around the group company-and another chapter would be written for the tax Act for a revenue impact of about nothing-or with people still being paid, as some chief executives are, $850,000 to $1m; they would just get paid by seven companies instead of one. </PARA>
<PARA> That might annoy Senator Spindler; it might annoy me. But we are not here to feel better after we have done something. We are about impact, about outcomes, and I believe that what Senator Spindler is proposing will have no outcome other than possibly to increase the number of executive salary packages that come in the form of fringe benefits instead of wages and salaries or make more complex the mechanism by which executives get paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not see how we can draft something that will work. I have looked at the proposal. It is not simply just saying, `Ha, ha, there is a drafting error there; it will not work'. I have tried constructively to find a mechanism that will make it work-this is not the first time it has been raised with me-and I cannot find that mechanism. I do not think Senator Spindler can make that work in the way that he proposes. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a similar problem with regard to the denial of a deduction for certain overseas travel expenses. Some of the rip-offs that take place, which again in revenue terms are very minor, must annoy the hell out of many Australians who cannot afford to go on holidays or who, in the case of my constituents, have a big trip when they take the car and drive to Bateman's Bay. That is their holiday and, when they see their taxes subsidising people having a holiday in Hawaii, then of course it annoys them-and properly so. It is not one of the better features of our society that the most affluent in it believe that they have the right to be subsidised in their luxuries by those less affluent than themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> But the problem with this sort of proposal is that, firstly, it stands in the way of very worthwhile things that we would want to see happen. Let me just give honourable senators an example. There is an outfit in Western Australia called, I think, Pacrim which runs the Pacrim conferences. A Western Australian-based company, it is a successful outfit organising international conferences. It fits the criteria of the Democrats' amendment and it makes money organising conferences. The first successful Pacrim conference in Perth was a very big money-spinner for Australia. There have been two more, one in Hong Kong and one in San Francisco. </PARA>
<PARA> We would not have got everybody to come to the successful Perth conference if they had not known that subsequently such conferences would be held in other places around the Pacific. I hope the conference comes back to Australia quite soon. But if we tried to hold them all in Australia we would have 10 competitive Pacrims, one of them in Hong Kong, and we would be squeezed out of the market. Perth certainly is not the most centrally placed conference venue in the Pacific by definition. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not even in the Pacific. My geography is that good. But this conference was successful and it was a useful initiative. There are Australian bodies that ought to hold conferences overseas because they are promoting Australia there. For example, if the Australian Institute of Petroleum Ltd or the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association held a conference in an Asian region it could well win a lot of business for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the Democrats have the problem of what constitutes a conference and who the organiser is. There are loopholes galore in any proposal like this. Every smart accountant in every organisation involved would find them and we would still find the conferences that annoy both Senator Spindler and me going ahead. It would be an impediment-although not an insuperable problem-to legitimate activities that we wish to see taking place. It is a sledge-hammer to crack a walnut, and I accept that it is a very annoying little walnut. But the proposal will not achieve the Democrats' objective. It has a down side risk that is not worth taking, even if it were to achieve what is a very minor objective. I do not criticise the Democrats' intention in any of the three matters, but the vehicle is either ineffective or inappropriate. Therefore, the Government will not be supporting any of the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Committee long but I wish to rebut a couple of brief details. First of all, my reference to a hypothetical Australian Medical Association conference from New South Wales being held in Hawaii was just that-an entirely hypothetical one. It was not intended in any way to cast aspersions on a particular organisation; it was simply an example of the sorts of things that have happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point is that the issue is not whether certain things should be done or should not be done, but whether they should be supported and encouraged by taxpayers' funds. In all three amendments, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) has acknowledged-and I am grateful for that acknowledgment-there are worthwhile social objectives. We have two points here: firstly, we do not wish to use taxpayers' money; and, secondly, by removing a taxation advantage we seek to discourage certain behaviour. That does not seem to have been understood in all details. </PARA>
<PARA> I am encouraged by the Minister's statement that he appreciates and to a large extent agrees with the objectives that are behind these amendments. I believe that that opens up the way for some detailed consultation, which I will certainly seek with the Minister, to ensure that we achieve these objectives, if not by this specific means then by other means which can be developed after careful consultation and equally careful drafting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to clause 98, transitional-provisional tax for 1990-91, and the discrimination that applies to provisional taxpayers by virtue of the Bill before the Senate. I remind the Senate that clause 93 provides as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . that the amendments to the personal tax rates contained in this Bill for 1990-91 . . . will not be used in the calculation of the 1990-91 provisional tax. The rates of tax to be used in the 1990-91 provisional tax calculations are the rates announced in the February 1990 Economic Statement and subsequently declared for the 1990-91 year by the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Act 1990. (Act No. 87). </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that on an income of $25,000 there is an extra payment of $96 by way of provisional tax by virtue of this discrimination. For most people in business the current period is, indeed, a difficult one with incomes slashed as the recession bites deeply into most sectors of the economy. The question of provisional tax and applications for variation weigh very heavily on people's minds and I think it is unfortunate that we have this additional imposition. I ask the Government whether, in the present circumstances, it is an appropriate time to review the penalties and the other arrangements that surround the question of applications to vary provisional tax assessments, because I believe such a change would be most welcome.

The distinction must be made between requirements under the provisional tax system for people to make payments at a particular time, and other changes which might in the circumstances affect the tax liability of taxpayers-that is, how much tax they have to pay. I think it is an important distinction to make that it may be that provisional taxpayers are paying a little more in the first instalment than otherwise might be the case, but the important question for all of us is how much tax we have to pay in a year.</PARA></TALK.START>

Can Senator McMullan see any valid reason for continuing with an uplift in a declining economy?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The uplift was brought in originally because of the rising economy during the previous 10, 20 or however many years. I am not aware of how long the uplift has been in place, but I know it has been in a good while. I think it came in under the Fraser Government. The economy was expanding, and if a business was managed well it was doing the same. In a downward situation as we have now-and unfortunately for Australia it has been there for a while-why does the Government persist with an uplift? I thought it might consider bringing in a downlift. </PARA>

<PARA>The Australian Democrats have prepared a range of amendments to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1990. The amendments seek essentially to bring some reforms to the competition law in Australia which, in our view, are badly needed. The critical area is the criterion which is applied when an acquisition or a merger is proposed. The amendments I have moved seek to change the criterion that is being applied, from the current criterion of market dominance to one of substantially lessening competition. That is the criterion that was applied before 1977 and we seek to return to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Some supporting amendments round out the picture. Perhaps the most important provision is the requirement that notification be made whenever it is intended to proceed with a merger or acquisition where the target company has capital in excess of $10m and where a lessening of the competitive position is expected. Once that notification has been made, the Trade Practices Commission will have 30 days in which to decide whether the disadvantages of substantially lessening competition are outweighed by a net public benefit which could lie in greater efficiency attracting further business in this particular industry, or various other matters which lead to the need to rationalise a particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments suggest further that these criteria should also be applied to current situations of market dominance and that, if it is found that the position of market dominance in a particular industry is not outweighed by public benefit, then divestiture would be available as one of the measures that the Commission could apply to the court for. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a brief outline of the amendments which have been circulated. I have taken note of the comments which were made yesterday; particularly those of Senator Austin Lewis, who stated that it was difficult for him and for the Opposition to have considered these types of amendments-which are fairly substantial-in the short space of time available. He complained that we did not give him enough time. I say, as a part defence at least, that the thrust of the amendments had been communicated to the Opposition and the Government before the recess-some three weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is true that the actual amendments have not been circulated until today and if either the Government or the Opposition takes umbrage at that there is a very clear remedy that I could suggest in general terms; and that is to provide the Australian Democrats with sufficient staff commensurate with the shadow portfolio responsibilities which they carry. My colleagues and I have responsibility for four, five or six portfolios each, yet we have the staff complement that is available to back bench senators with no portfolio responsibilities from the other parties. If we are going to have an efficient working of the Senate, I think this matter requires serious attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to the amendments before the Senate. In view of the far-reaching importance of the amendments and the Government's desire, which has been made clear to me, to address these matters in a way which gives sufficient time for consultation in the community and between the political parties, I understand that the Minister is prepared to support a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, provided this reference includes terms of reference which specifically include all of these amendments, plus a broadening of the issues to the extent that other matters need to be discussed. I would flag my intention to seek leave to withdraw my amendments, but I will be interested to hear the Minister's statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler has been holding discussions with myself and with the Opposition leadership in the Senate with a view to ensuring that his concerns, which find some expression in the amendments that he has put into the chamber this afternoon, are dealt with in some appropriate parliamentary forum. I am glad he has acknowledged that the present consideration of the Trade Practices Amendment Bill is not an appropriate vehicle for considering the very substantial issues which would be raised in any considered deliberation on the amendments which the Australian Democrats have put forward. This is particularly so as they deal with the whole crux of the test which ought to be used in dealing with mergers and acquisitions in the Australian marketplace and whether the test should be that there is a substantial lessening of competition or that some real dominance results from the merger or acquisition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that it is very pertinent to recall that on 12 March this year in his statement Building a Competitive Australia, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, indicated his conviction that the trade practices legislation was our principal legislative weapon to ensure that consumers get the best deal from competition. There is no doubt that, if consumers are to derive the benefit of a more competitive Australia by being able to purchase goods and services at a lower price than would otherwise be the case, the vigilance of the Trade Practices Commission and the statutory foundation from which it works needs to be constantly under review and should be monitored by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke quite properly pointed out that there are many areas of the Australian economy today that are immune from that Act, for example, some Commonwealth enterprises, some State public sector business organisations and significant areas of the private sector, including the professions. For this reason, Mr Hawke has suggested to the Premiers that one of the main agenda items at the Premiers Conference on 12 May this year should be the whole question of the scope of a national framework of competition policy and law. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Premiers are receptive to the initiative, taken in a very positive way by the Prime Minister, to ensure that the benefits of a more competitive Australia are enjoyed by consumers, particularly in areas where, at the present time, the writ of this Parliament as circumscribed by the Constitution and therefore of the Trade Practices Commission, does not reach. It will be interesting to see which State public sector businesses and significant areas of the private sector, including the professions, might be brought within the purview of the Trade Practices Commission as a result of those consult- ations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather opportune that concurrently with that particular examination by the Premiers Conference, this Parliament, through the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, might undertake an examination of some crucial areas in the statutory foundations, the very statutory framework, in which the Trade Practices Commission operates and under which it derives its authority to intervene in the marketplace on behalf of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the time that will be taken over the next few days, perhaps weeks, by the Opposition, the Government, the Democrats and those independent senators who wish to contribute, in deriving a set of terms of reference which encompasses the main concerns which underlie the amendments offered by the Democrats today, and perhaps some others which may be of importance, will be time well spent. This is an important area of micro-economic reform that is required to be undertaken in this case within the portfolio of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee will be well placed to call for written submissions, to hear witnesses and to canvass the issues in a very considered and deliberate way. The Attorney-General, with whom I have held discussions, has been undertaking discussions with colleagues as to the way in which a re-examination of the trade practices framework might be undertaken. He has indicated his support for the work of the Senate Committee, certainly as an alternative to rushing into a decision and voting on the sorts of amendments which were put forward by Senator Spindler this afternoon. It would require too hasty a judgment on these very important issues if senators on both sides of the chamber were called upon to make a judgment on these major issues without the benefit of the deliberations which might be forthcoming from a Senate committee consideration of a well-drawn set of terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Bill. I thank those senators who have spoken in support of the Bill and I indicate to Senator Spindler and to the Opposition that we look forward to taking part in drawing up the terms of reference for the consideration of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler, by this mechanism of introducing an amendment and then withdrawing it, has brought to the attention of the Parliament the desire of the Australian Democrats that the subject matter of the dominant market test-the trade practices legislation-should be again looked at. In principle, we agree with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) reminded us last night that the House of Representatives, through one of its committees, has recently been looking at aspects of this law in relation to mergers and acquisitions, although I think it is some considerable time since the Senate has done so. It is an area in which I have had a long interest, being one of the areas of my postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics some years ago. I know only too well the difficulties in competition law and the many arguments that can be put as to the appropriateness of different tests. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great difficulties is the question of the appropriate market. Australian business and industry are facing a very different environment to that which they faced, say, 10 or 20 years ago. Australia needs to become more international and what seemed to be an appropriate marketplace in many areas for assessing competition, which is something that we all want to encourage, may not simply be so today. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia now needs to have companies in many areas that are clearly internationally competitive. To be internationally competitive, they may need to be much more dominant within the Australian more limited marketplace than they have been in the past. We appreciate it to be an important but nevertheless complicated area of law, and one that is worthy of further consideration by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the most appropriate committee, as a former member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I understand its skills and record in relation to law reform. I am also aware of the enormous workload that it has had to undertake in recent times, particularly as a result of the changed procedures of the Senate which have resulted in many Bills being referred to it for limited inquiry. It has placed a great additional time obligation upon senators in that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I know, for example, that it was mentioned that Senator Lewis, who has a particular interest in this area of law reform, is not presently a member of that Committee. I am sure that he would want to contribute to a further parliamentary examination of this area of law reform. So that just brings to mind that it might be more appropriate to have some other body used in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I indicate our support for a review and further examination of these issues, I would like to have the opportunity to talk with my colleagues, senators on the other side of the chamber and the Australian Democrats as to what might be the most appropriate parliamentary Senate vehicle for that consideration. But, as I said, in principle, we support a further consideration of the issue and actually appreciate the fact that the Democrats at this last moment have decided not to press their amendment. It really does deal with much wider issues than those which the Bill is designed to cover. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We wish to refer to some parts of the Social Security Bill 1990. We support the Bill and are pleased to know that the Social Security Act 1947 has been put into plain English-and we expect it to be as successful as it has been in other cases.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Reid for indicating the Opposition's welcoming of the Social Security Bill. I certainly agree that to have such a massive piece of legislation, which is so important to the lives of many millions of ordinary Australians, presented in plain English form is something for which we should pay a tribute to the Parliamentary Counsel and those officers in the Department of Social Security who laboured on the task to such good effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the particular questions raised by Senator Reid, I understand that the index is almost completed. It will be printed very shortly and made available free of charge. As to the question of the purchase of the Act, I understand there is a distribution list of perhaps some 4,000 or more organisations, community groups, voluntary organisations and so on. These welfare based organisations will receive a free copy of the legislation to enable them in turn to provide advice and service to those who might call upon their assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> As for getting the material out to those community groups who may be able to make use of it and to whom welfare recipients will turn for advice, the fact that it will be provided free of charge will go a long way to satisfying Senator Reid's concerns. However, I admit that in the case of an individual it still provides a rather prohibitive barrier. But if such a person cannot afford the money for the complete set of statutes, as I say, he or she seek advice from one of the organisations. </PARA>

It is with some difficulty, however, that I now ask my questions as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) is not able to be present.

Indeed, many of the recommendations are in quite considerable detail. My questions to the Minister would have related to what specifically he is doing on each of the recommendations from the Department. For example, is the Government accepting that some matters will have to be dealt with after July in the coming Budget session? In particular, the Democrats are very interested in the final recommendation where the Welfare Rights Centre recommends a formal review after 12 months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Trusts (Hague Convention) Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for it to consider the question of whether the Government should be entering into the Hague Convention with reservations in relation to article 16 and article 22. We wanted the opportunity for senators to listen to the views of the acknowledged expert in Australia in this field, Professor Michael Pryles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Professor Pryles played a significant part for the Government in relation to the conferences that dealt with the detail of this Convention. He seems to have played a part in the drafting of it as well as arguing the Government's case. It was of interest to us to determine whether it was his view, as the accepted expert, that it would be in the best interests of Australia that reservations be entered on these two controversial articles. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Pryles gave evidence to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Although he failed to convince the Government and the Australian Democrats that the reservation should be entered to article 16, he made it patent that such a reservation should be entered. I want to take the opportunity in this Committee debate in this chamber to reiterate our support for the position that Professor Pryles advocated, I thought most convincingly, before the Senate Standing Committee, particularly that a reservation should be entered to paragraph 16(2). </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting that, when that issue was first put before the Rome convention, Australia opposed the second paragraph and the convention supported that opposition. The proposal to include that paragraph in relation to foreign mandatory laws was defeated. Subsequently, however, the matter was reopened on the basis of a French proposal and a majority was obtained. The Australian position was first to oppose it and was successful but, when the matter was reopened, Australia lost. Nevertheless the Australian Government now indicates to us that, despite the inclusion of the controversial second paragraph, it will not enter a reservation. Australia's opposition to that provision was consistent with the opposition of other common law countries, apart from the United States. In particular it was opposed by the United Kingdom. Professor Pryles told us that he spoke against it for Australia and the Canadians also supported the Australian point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue is really one of certainty of law in relation to trusts. The second paragraph introduces something which is unknown in our trust law, that is, that the law of a third state, referred to in the article as `another state', may be taken into account in determining the appropriate law to be applied to a particular trust issue. In particular the paragraph says that if another state has a sufficiently close connection with a state, in exceptional circumstances effect may also be given to the rules of that state which are of the same character as mentioned in the preceding paragraph. That indicates a new uncertainty that will not enable those who settle trusts to determine with any certainty how those trusts as they might apply to property in third countries, for example, will be interpreted in future. Therefore, it seems to us that, in the interests of sound law interpretation, Australia should enter a reservation. I think that it is the case that Britain has done so. </PARA>
<PARA> The only argument for not doing so seems to have been that we want to encourage those states that do not recognise trust law to join in the convention and therefore to enter reservations maybe to give signals that are not encouraging. On balance, in our view, there is no doubt that when one balances the sending of a signal, which may or may not have some persuasive value-and there is no evidence that it is having any persuasive value-with seeking to maintain certainty in the interpretation of trust law, one must come down on the side of the latter. Therefore, we are astonished that the Government has decided that it will enter this convention, which we support in principle, but is not prepared to enter a reservation to article 16(2). I use this Committee stage again to urge the Government to reconsider its position. Perhaps the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) should again take the issue back to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and at least encourage him to read the evidence of the Government's acknowledged expert in this field who, as I said, has put a position strongly contrary to the position adopted by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter of controversy related to article 22. The first paragraph of the article provides that the convention applies to trusts regardless of the date on which they were created. Thus, it could be applied retrospectively, which causes us concern. The second paragraph provides that a contracting state may reserve the right not to apply the convention to trusts created before the date on which in relation to that state the convention enters into force. When one links that to article 16 and to the lack of certainty that occurs by the inclusion of article 16(2), one becomes particularly concerned. We find an instance of retrospective interpretation and the application of a law that may never have been thought to be applied by the parties to the trust. That in our mind is totally unsatisfactory. Therefore, the Australian Government should be taking the opportunity presented to it in article 22(2) and thus enter a reservation to that article. Therefore, in the instance of article 22 I also take this opportunity, at the last moment, to urge the Government to reconsider its position and, in the interests of certainty of legal interpretation in this country, to enter a reservation to that provision as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few brief comments. The Australian Democrats support the Trusts (Hague Convention) Bill without amendment, as became clear during the sittings of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. We do not believe that an issue arises on article 22 that requires any reservations. The decision on article 16 was a little more complex. We have carefully taken account of the arguments put forward by Professor Pryles. At the end of the Committee meeting I asked him where he stood, and he said that on balance he would prefer a reservation. I regret to say that on balance I came down on the other side, believing that certainty is not an all important virtue that overrides the necessity for flexibility and that we are faced with a situation where the world economy could create unforeseen circumstances and where deregulation has encouraged many people to use whatever legal mechanisms are available, including trusts in particular perhaps, to avoid taxes or to use international laws to their advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this particular case we feel that, rather than accept that the settler of a trust may at all times be the person to decide which law shall apply, it is good policy to enable a court to make the final decision. Article 16(2) is very careful in circumscribing the circumstances that would enable a court to do so. There must be a sufficiently close connection and it would only happen in exceptional circumstances. We believe that this formulation is preferable to a certainty which might in some cases be wrong. Accordingly, the Democrats support the Bill as it stands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government thanks those senators who have indicated their support for this very important Bill, the Trusts (Hague) Convention Bill, which will enable trusts-which are a very well known feature of common law countries-to be recognised and the property, the subject of the trust, therefore, to be protected in several law jurisdictions, mainly, in continental Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We think that this is a most important international agreement-known as the `Hague Convention'-that has been reached in relation to this particular matter. We believe that it will be of continuing importance to those Australians who enter into or who are the beneficiaries of trusts where the property is situated in a country which does not, in its normal legal operations, recognise the trust idea at all and is quite unfamiliar with the way in which trusts operate. </PARA>
<PARA> So we think this is a most important protection being afforded to Australians who may be the beneficiaries of trust arrangements where the property is held elsewhere. For that reason, we prefer the general Australian Government principle of not seeking to make reservations but seeking, as far as possible, to rely on a treaty practice which says that if a convention or treaty has been devised in an international forum where we have played a very major role we should ratify on the basis of the text agreed to at that particular international forum rather than make reservations. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we could make reservations-that is our sovereign right-in relation to article 16(2). But it is even more important to recall the history of the drawing of this particular article where, in relation to that second paragraph, which was inserted at the insistence of several law jurisdictions, Australia argued for and obtained the inclusion of the phrase `in exceptional circumstances'. Because Australia actually tried to limit the way in which the court might exercise the discretion conferred in that paragraph and played, in other words, a very full and effective role in the drawing of the actual words of that particular paragraph, I think it would now be somewhat churlish of Australia to say to those countries with which negotiations were conducted, `Having achieved some modification and narrowed the operation of that second paragraph of article 16, we are now going to make a reservation on the whole of that paragraph anyway'. That would be somewhat churlish. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia will have a much better chance of arguing in favour of several certain law countries ratifying this particular convention if we can say that we, certainly on our part, have acted in absolute good faith in the negotiations and in our ratification of this particular convention. Therefore, the Government accepts the determination of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that there ought not to be a reservation in this particular circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the possibility of a reservation being made to article 22 is concerned, Professor Pryles pointed out that in fact the retrospectivity in this particular case would apply to the benefit of the operation of Australian trusts overseas in several law jurisdictions-and other jurisdictions, for that matter-in so far as the convention would apply very well regarded rules in international law, choice of law rules, to trusts regardless of the date on which they were created, and in that way the trusts would be given a protection even if they were created before the convention was itself brought into being. In that particular case, we have a very beneficial instance of retrospectivity operating in a way which is to the benefit of those Australians who may be able to take advantage of this particular convention should it be ratified by the nation in which the trust property, for example, is situated. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, the Government thanks those senators who have indicated their support for the Bill. It will pass. Obviously, there is no amendment offered, but I indicate that the Government will not be exercising any executive discretion to make reservations on the convention when it does ratify it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few general comments-and I think I can make them under clauses 1 and 2. They are comments I would have made on a motion that the report of the Committee be adopted. But I do not get the opportunity to do that because the Senate has decided to proceed by the alternative mechanism of putting the amendments in this chamber rather than simply adopting the report of the Committee with the amendments that are included within it, or seeking to amend those amendments within the Committee report and adopting it then. I therefore take this opportunity to say a few words about those amendments on which we were unsuccessful in the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do that in an effort now to save time. Under this alternative procedure, we could of course move those amendments again here, but that would be, to use a word Senator Tate used a moment ago, a little churlish. In a spirit of goodwill, we will not do that, but I do want to make the point that may not otherwise come through the debate in the Committee stage, and that is that the principal issue of the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1991, which was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, was debated at great length and with the benefit of a considerable number of expert witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA> That principal issue was whether upon arrest there should be a time restraint of a fixed number of hours in which police could question the person arrested or, alternatively, whether there should be provisions in the Bill that the period of questioning should be for a reasonable time. The Government's legislation provides for a fixed period of four hours with some provision for an application to be made for extension, except in the case of Aboriginal and young people, in which it provides a maximum period of two hours for questioning. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of this long debate in the Standing Committee, which took place on three or four separate occasions, we moved our amendment that the position in the Bill be changed to provide the alternative of a reasonable period of questioning. That was defeated by the Government and the Australian Democrats joining together and supporting the original provision. Nevertheless, it is our view, which we hold even more firmly as a result of the detailed consideration of the issue by the Standing Committee, that the inclusion of a reasonable time provision would provide for better legislation than that which has come back to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The main groups which have supported the four-hour limit are academics and civil liberties groups. Whereas these groups are obviously well-intentioned, in our opinion and on the evidence that was put before the Standing Committee, their concerns about what they saw as a more loosely defined reasonable time have simply not been borne out in practice. The common law is to the effect that after arrest a person must be brought as soon as practicable to be charged and therefore there is not an opportunity for further questioning after arrest by the police. That, one would have thought, from the point of view of civil liberties groups, would have provided for a greater protection than in fact is the case under the Government's Bill. However, they did not seem to address it on that basis and in fact they thought that there was greater security in providing for a fixed period of questioning after arrest. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to those who put that view, I think it is wrong. Common law was held in the High Court case of Williams in 1986 and, as I said a moment ago, there is no power for police to detain a person who is suspected of having committed a crime for the purpose of questioning that person or for completing an investigation. The common law requires that the person, once arrested, be brought before a magistrate as soon as is reasonably practicable to decide the question of remand or bail. </PARA>
<PARA> Two of the judges in the Williams case expressed concern that the common law might not achieve a proper balance between the competing public interests of law enforcement and individual liberty. However, two other judges pointed out that the law relating to the powers of arrest assumes that at the time of arrest police have sufficient information to lay the appropriate charges. The question of policy, as much as it is appropriate for judges to comment upon that, seems to be an issue upon which judges at that highest level have different views. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our opinion that the common law does not provide a proper balance of community interests. Thus, we are supporting legislation to prescribe a period in which the police can question after arrest. Thus, as I said, we are supporting the concept of legislation in this area and we will, at the end of this committee stage debate, be supporting the Bill. But our difference with the Government is in what is the most appropriate period for which that questioning is to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the police having a power to detain arrested persons prior to charging them for the purposes of questioning and for carrying out further investigations. However, I stress that this is not the same as a power to arrest persons solely for the purpose of questioning, and there was much debate on that issue within the Senate Standing Committee. Seven Government amendments were ultimately put and agreed to by all of us, which makes it much clearer. The provisions in the Bill apply only to a person who has been legally arrested. For that reason alone the Committee hearing was well worthwhile. It overcomes the concern that was put to the Committee by Mr Merkel, QC, who was interpreting the Bill otherwise and in fact believed that it was giving a power to question without arrest. That is simply not so and any doubt about it is now removed by the new Government amendments which were accepted yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the issues raised in the Williams case, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) introduced this Bill, which will provide for a fixed time pre-charge detention period. The question of whether police should have the power to question arrested persons prior to charging and, if so, under what restraints, has been the subject of numerous inquiries over recent years. I might briefly mention a few of those inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is the Phillips committee. In 1984 that committee, chaired by the then Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions and subsequently Mr Justice Phillips, now head of the National Crime Authority, recommended that a six-hour pre-charge detention period be prescribed to allow questioning and further investigation. This recommendation was implemented through changes to section 460 of the Crimes Act 1958 in Victoria, those amendments being made in 1984. No extension could be made to the six-hour period without the consent of the arrested person. </PARA>
<PARA> There then followed the Coldrey committee, which looked at the change that had been made in the Victorian law and found considerable disquiet among Victorian police and prosecuting authorities. As a result that committee, which was set up to review the situation, reported in 1986 that the fixed period was too inflexible and recommended that police should be required to take an arrested person before a magistrate within a reasonable time-which, of course, is the provision that we have argued should be included within this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coldrey committee found that the six-hour detention period had significant shortcomings. Most of these arguments apply equally, if not more so, in relation to a four-hour fixed period. It was inadequate in the case of complex investigations or where there were multiple offences. The necessity to apply for extensions of time disrupted the continuity of investigations. The six-hour period could easily be eroded by time lost in travelling, obtaining medical treatment or legal advice. In some cases it was simply not practicable to bring the suspect before a magistrate where, for example, he or she had been admitted to hospital. There was a risk that the upper time limit could be regarded as the norm and arrested persons might be detained for six hours where it was not necessary for the purposes of the particular investigation involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that, despite these shortcomings, a fixed time period adequately covered most interrogations and in fact 99.5 per cent of them were completed well within the six-hour period. However, as Mr Justice Phillips pointed out in his evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the police were able to persuade the Coldrey committee that there was a significant number of cases that might not be adequately dealt with within the framework. The Coldrey committee was sufficiently concerned about such cases to recommend amendments to the Victorian Crimes Act to prescribe a reasonable time-to apply the tests that we argue should be applied-with provision also for the exclusion of dead time, which we concede is included in this Government Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The next committee to examine the issue was the Gibbs committee in its review of Commonwealth criminal law and, of course, this Bill is based on the recommendations of that committee. One important departure is that the Gibbs committee recommended that a six-hour limit apply in the case of serious offences and a four-hour limit in other cases. So not even in the case of the Gibbs committee was the Australian Government prepared to accept its recommendation of six hours, but has restricted it further to four hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gibbs committee concluded that it was desirable that police have power to detain arrested persons for the purposes of questioning. As I said, that is something which, on balance, we have decided to support. It recommended that once arrested a person ought to be brought before a magistrate as soon as practicable after the end of an investigation period, such period being six hours in the case of a serious offence and four hours in other cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee also gave a list of times which should be excluded as dead times in the calculation of the relevant time period. These included the time for transportation between the place of apprehension and the nearest police station; the time taken to communicate with a legal practitioner, friend, relative or guardian and the time taken by any such person to arrive at the police station; if an interpreter is arranged, the time taken for the interpreter to arrive; any time in which the person receives medical attention or when questioning is delayed because of the person's intoxication; any time during which an application for an extension of the investigation period is in progress; and any time taken to conduct an identification parade. </PARA>
<PARA> It was recommended that provision be made for an application to a magistrate for an extension of the investigation period to a total of 24 hours for serious offences which, of course, is far greater than the extended time period that is allowed for in this piece of legislation before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee was of the view that an investigation period of less than six hours would not be worth while in the light of the Victorian experience. So the Gibbs committee, at least, has learned something from the Victorian experience even if this Australian Government has not. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee did not recommend a shorter period for Aboriginal persons or young people. However, it did recommend additional procedural safeguards for such persons. Again, the Australian Government has departed from the Gibbs committee recommendations in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I want also to refer briefly to the New South Wales Law Reform Commission's work in this area, and I might have to do so in a second bite at this exercise. The recent report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission comes down in favour of a fixed four-hour pre-detention period. (Extension of time granted) In his evidence to the Senate Standing Committee the author of the report from the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, Professor Weisbrot, spoke of the Law Reform Commission's significant problems with the concept of reasonable time. The Commission felt that it would be appropriate to give a significant degree of statutory guidance as many police officers, it said, are young and/or inexperienced and would, therefore, benefit from legislative guidance rather than being required to exercise their own judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission was concerned that the only method of review is retrospective judicial exclusion of evidence. The Commission was also of the view that a reasonable time regime was too uncertain for the suspect. </PARA>
<PARA> Although these are valid arguments, the fixed time regime has many limitations which were emphasised by various witnesses in the context of the Senate Committee's examination of the Bill. The principal argument in favour of fixed time is that it increases certainty for police, arrested persons and legal advisers and ensures protection against unduly prolonged detentions. It also has the advantage that it is likely to reduce the amount of time spent in criminal trials in contesting the admissibility of material relating to confessions or admissions obtained during detention. It would enable there to be greater certainty in deciding whether or not a confession had been illegally obtained if the relevant time period had been exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a fixed time pre-charge detention is inflexible even allowing for the possibility of extending the period for up to a further eight hours. The representatives of the police at the Committee hearings were able to cite example after example of actual cases in which investigations, although taking more than the allowed four hours plus the eight-hour extension, did not go for an unreasonable time in the circumstances of those particular cases. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the necessity to apply for an extension damages the continuity of the investigation period and may bring matters to the attention of the criminal community with undesirable results, such as the intimidation of witnesses or the destruction of evidence, as was submitted to the Committee by these police witnesses-experts within their field. Mr Justice Phillips also put to the Committee his concern that although the Bill provides for questioning for a reasonable time within the time constraint-in the case of this Bill four hours, in the case of the Victorian legislation six hours-what develops is a presumption that questioning for that maximum period of four hours or six hours is reasonable, and that is undesirable. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Phillips did not feel that the provision in proposed section 23c (4)-which says that the investigation period commences when the person is arrested, and ends at a time thereafter that is reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances-would solve the problem. The prosecutor could still tell the jury that in assessing the weight to be given to the accused person's assertion, it should take into account that the whole scenario occurred within the time frames specified in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the test of reasonableness as assessed by a judge, which we advocate, has many advantages. It means that police investigations will not be hampered by a needlessly inflexible time limit, although the police will still be accountable before the court for the method and time of their interrogation. As I said, Mr Justice Phillips, from his experience of a six-hour investigation period in Victoria, supports the alternative of a reasonable period. As a judge, he found that disputes often arose as to when the period commenced, which question does not arise if a reasonable time regime applies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also has serious difficulty with the provisions which allow the shorter two-hour pre-charge detention for Aboriginal and young people. In relation to Aboriginals, the shorter interview time was strongly defended by the representative of the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service-something we concede. However, we remain unconvinced that this sort of special provision is the most effective way of dealing with the problem. For one thing, it is a fundamental principle of Australian law and democracy that all citizens ought to be treated equally. If special provision is to be made for one group within our society, this surely discriminates against other vulnerable groups in our community which have not had such a provision made for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, however, if the reasonable time regime applied the problem simply would not arise. It would be a matter for the judge to determine what was a reasonable time for investigation in any particular circumstances, taking into account the special characteristics of the person involved, and that might be whether a person is Aboriginal, young or illiterate, or any other matter that seems relevant to the judge at the time-a much more flexible and a much better safeguard, we would submit. It must surely count for something that police are in favour of a reasonable time regime because, after all, they are the ones who will have to justify that their interrogation was reasonable in all the circumstances, and we should not discount the expertise and experience that they have in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say in passing that I did think that the police witnesses who gave evidence before the Committee were particularly impressive. We believe that they have a legitimate and, in this instance, persuasive view. We were particularly disappointed that before this Senate inquiry the Government had not sought the views of the police from around the States, despite the interest that had been shown. In fact, the total lack of consultation with those people with interest in this legislation is something about which the Government should be particularly embarrassed. It is not as if there were any great urgency in relation to this legislation. It would have been commonsense to have consulted those people who have to operate under this new legislative regime. The failure of the Government to do so is, we believe, an indictment of its practice with regard to this particular piece of legislative work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police Association, not surprisingly, was particularly critical of this aspect, as have been various police Ministers in their correspondence with the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee. Other law enforcement bodies were not given the courtesy of consultation either. It is also obvious that consistency of State and Federal laws in this area is vital: yet, as I said, the Government did not make any attempts to consult with the States. Now it seems that the State and Territory police forces will have to operate simultaneously under two separate regimes. </PARA>
<PARA> Many examples were given of the serious operational difficulties which will arise. Obviously, these issues can be resolved, but that is not the point; the point is that they could, and should, have been discussed before the legislation was introduced. In fact, it is fortunate that the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee hearings provided a forum through which the police could put forward their concerns. As I have said, it is totally unsatisfactory that they were not given an earlier opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, while the Opposition supports the basic thrust of the Bill, we can only condemn the way in which the Government has gone about introducing it in such a high-handed manner. We remain unconvinced, in light of the Victorian experience and the evidence from police representatives and others who appeared before the Senate Standing Committee, that fixed time periods for pre-charge detention are more appropriate than the reasonable time regime which we have advocated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to take this opportunity to make a number of general comments on the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1990 and to refer to those amendments of the Australian Democrats which were not accepted. It is a piece of legislation which we have subjected to considerable consultation and research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of whether it should be reasonable time, or a set time limit-in this Bill it is four hours plus eight, or two for certain disadvantaged sections of the population-during our period of consultation and research we in fact found that our position had moved. Initially we had adopted a position which was similar to the current situation in Victoria, which allows reasonable time, but we found that as we went and talked to people who were operating in the field-criminal lawyers, people who were represented through legal aid centres or Aboriginal legal centres; people who were particularly affected by this legislation-we found that there was sufficient evidence, rather than some of the anecdotal evidence that had been adduced by some of the witnesses, to show that in fact the four-hour limit for police was a generous limit. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention briefly one piece of information which I think is very telling. During the preparation of the Coldrey report some statistics were collected in Victoria and it was found that in only 152 cases out of 42,000 did the police require more than six hours for the interrogation of the suspect-in these circumstances the person who had been arrested for the purpose of being charged with an offence. That is less than 0.5 per cent. I think in order to put that into perspective we need also to take note of the fact that at that time the six hours did not make any exclusions for so-called `dead' time, which is done in this particular Bill. It makes exclusion for a range of situations, such as obtaining legal representation, obtaining interpreters and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The other factor which I think impinges critically on this issue is the fact that at the time when the statistics were being taken people who had been arrested were being interrogated and the results of the questions and answers were recorded in the time-honoured fashion-namely, by two-finger typing. Obviously, particularly in extended interrogations, this added a time element, which has now been removed in this particular Bill by the introduction of taping facilities which are mandatory, where practicable. I will return to the phrase `where practicable' in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we believe that the time limits offered to police for this particular purpose are more than adequate compared with the record of their work in previous years. We also believe it is necessary to take account of the position of the person who is being interrogated. In a democratic society we must start from the position that no-one should be deprived of his or her liberty without just cause. When we look at the police record in quite a number of areas-and I have only to refer to the recent Gundy matter and, similarly, to the numerous reports which we are receiving from the Royal Commission which is inquiring into deaths in custody-it brings it home very forcefully indeed that we must introduce as many safeguards as we possibly can for people who are not used to our system of legal administration. Clearly, it is a principle which applies to every person who comes into contact with our legal system and with our law enforcement officers. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the specific amendments which the Australian Democrats sought to move but which were, regrettably, not accepted. The first amendment we sought to introduce would have allowed the person who was being given a caution to remain silent to repeat that caution in his or her own words to ensure that the import of it was fully understood. We believe the answer we received-that this danger of a person misunderstanding the meaning of the caution could be averted by the court subsequently being invited to look at the video or tape recording of interview-is inadequate. We believe that in our society a person who is being given a caution, which is an extremely important element in the subsequent legal proceedings, has a right to have a safeguard introduced to ensure that he or she understands it fully. </PARA>
<PARA> The same sort of amendment would seek to extend the categories of people, currently Aboriginal people and minors, who are given a two-hour limit. We want to extend it to people who are illiterate, people who are not fluent in English and people who are suffering from an intellectual disability. It has been argued in response that some of those people might require more time owing to their disability and that the time limit should be increased to more than two hours. However, that attitude does not take into account the pressure that is put on persons who culturally are unfamiliar with the way in which police officers in our legal system prosecute their task. We have received advice from people who are operating in the field that this psychological pressure can often lead to people being severely disadvantaged. I believe that we should take that into account on the grounds of civil liberties and plain humanity. I regret to say that these amendments have not been accepted. We will continue to monitor the effects of this legislation and we will seek to reintroduce the amendments if required. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue that I believe is worth mentioning is that the Bill currently requires the recording of interviews where practicable. The Government has admitted that there may be many situations where recording equipment is not available. In that case, it is submitted that a written record should be sufficient. I would strongly disagree with that. While it is obviously and realistically the case that recording equipment may not be available on certain occasions, there is absolutely nothing to stop the law enforcement officers repeating the interview and having it recorded on the earliest possible occasion following the arrest of a person. I believe that the arguments that have been put forward in response to some of our other amendments are actually devalued by the Government's rejection of this particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to these comments, I put on record the Democrats support for the Bill as it stands and I also welcome the Government's amendments, which in some measure were in response to the evidence provided by witnesses during the committee hearings, particular by Mr Ron Merkel, QC. I believe that puts the position of the Democrats on record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon in Question Time, I was asked about any lessons that Australia could learn from the fate of the Birmingham Six. That was a case where certain persons had been convicted of acts of murderous terrorism. It was decided some 16 years later, only a few weeks ago, that the police in the investigation of those terrible events had acted in a way which created a situation where one could no longer say with confidence that the Birmingham Six had been properly convicted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been decided in the United Kingdom that a royal commission should be established to look at the process of the criminal justice system as it operates in that nation. I commented during Question Time that that royal commission would be able to learn a lot if it came to Australia to see, on the one hand, how we are tackling the sorts of problems which arise in the investigation of offences, where one has to balance the interests of the community in securing the detection and the eventual conviction of those who offend against our society by breaking the criminal law which has been established for the nation through the Parliament or in the various jurisdictions of the States around Australia and, on the other hand, the very real necessity to ensure that suspects are protected from undue zealotry on the part of investigating officers, which might lead to the fabrication of evidence as, for example, where the practice of verballing occurs and a purported confession is produced to a court, apparently and indeed signed by the accused person, but which has been put together by investigating officers and the suspect has been intimidated into signing it. I believe that this is now not at all a common or usual occurrence in Australia. The most important clause of this Bill is not so much what has been the cause of controversy-even in the committee stage of the Senate's consideration of this particular legislation-as the clause which provides for the taping of interviews of suspects, whether under arrest or not. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Australian Federal Police investigations into matters of serious fraud or drug traffic offences which warrant the most vigorous investigation and, one hopes, result, where appropriate, in the charging and successful prosecution of those perpetrators, the great virtue of this legislation is that it will be made clear that, in the investigation of those federal offences, unless the questioning of suspects and any confession or admission that might be made is recorded, it will not be admissible. Where it is reasonably practicable to tape-record the confession or admission, to quote from the Bill, that must certainly be done and the confession or admission will not be admissible unless it is. </PARA>
<PARA> So that is the basic structure of the Bill, which I think has not been given sufficient attention or weight. I think it will turn out to be a most important protection for the liberty of the subject. It will also prevent the series of accusations that is often levelled against the police during a trial that an accused person was verballed. It will now be absolutely clear to the court from its viewing of the videotape. Moneys have been provided in the last Budget for the Australian Federal Police to begin to establish videotaping facilities in the various States of Australia, in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory. It will be very apparent to the court whether there was any overbearing of the suspect so that he or she signed under duress, or whether what is alleged to have been confessed was not, but was some sort of fabrication by the interviewing officers. I believe that that will be of great benefit to the police in establishing their integrity in the questioning process and it will save a lot of court time, which is also a further benefit of this particular provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue which took up the greatest time of the Committee was the question of what rights our society should confer on police officers when they wish to question a person after arresting that person but before charging him with any offence, the High Court having held that there was no common law power residing in police officers to question a person before having taken that person before a magistrate in the shortest practicable time, even when some period of questioning could clear the person who had been arrested. The Federal Government has effectively been required by the High Court to provide a rule which will govern the activities of those persons investigating federal offences nationwide, particularly the Australian Federal Police who operate in other States and Territories of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, it was not good enough to wait for the States to come to either a common view, which they have been unable to achieve, or a settled view even within a particular State: for example, Victoria and the way in which it has changed its legislation in this regard. We had to provide a rule for the Australian Federal Police, in particular, Australia-wide to overcome the difficulty revealed by the High Court decision. That has been done in a way which is very fair to the interests of both law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation of Commonwealth offences, in that time is provided for questioning of suspects after arrest but before they are charged. On the other hand, there is a recognition that the person arrested deserves certain protection-for example, that he or she has access to legal advice and an interview friend. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, all the proper cautions must be provided. For example, under proposed section 23f:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if a person is under arrest for a Commonwealth offence, an investigating official must, before starting to question the person, caution the person that he or she does not have to say or do anything, but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>It must also be made clear in a way which the person understands. Of course, the right to remain silent is not affected. The right of a person to refuse to answer questions or to participate in an investigation, except when required to do so by or under an Act, for example, is totally preserved. As always, the burden on the prosecution to prove the voluntariness of the admission made by the person is also noted and reaffirmed in this statute. </PARA>
<PARA> The treatment of persons under arrest is given particular attention. One aspect which is of absolute paramount importance to a person who is arrested and, admittedly, engaged voluntarily in helping the police in their investigation by perhaps admitting to the answering of some questions is that under this legislation both the suspect and the interviewing police officer know that at the expiration of four hours-and perhaps less if it would be reasonable to conclude the line of investigation before then-if the person is to be detained whilst further investigations take place, the police officer has to make an application to a magistrate for an extension of time, perhaps up to eight hours. We have to give great weight to the fact that this will put a real discipline on the investigating police and provide some reassurance to the suspect that the matter will be reviewed after some four hours. </PARA>
<PARA> It is far better if one is trying to ensure the integrity of the criminal justice process that that review takes place on the same day as the questioning rather than perhaps a year or two later at the trial of the accused person where in fact the judge may look back on the events and say, `No, the person was held for what was in excess of what should have been apparent to the police officer was a reasonable time for the line of the investigation and questioning that was being undertaken'. I believe that it is far better for everyone concerned that that matter be determined effectively in a final manner by the magistrate after some four hours. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government legislation does set a balance which should be very acceptable in a democratic society. In this legislation we have overcome a deficiency revealed in the way in which our society can deal with crime. It was a deficiency revealed by the High Court of Australia in the Williams case by empowering investigating police officers to engage in some necessary questioning of a suspect. We have also recognised the very real need to protect those persons who are being subjected to arrest and who are participating in the investigation process by answering a series of questions that have been put to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I also emphasise that the Government was happy to make amendments which made absolutely clear that this Bill does not confer any power to arrest. We believe that that was clear in the Bill as it was written. For example, I quote proposed section 23r:</PARA>
<PARA>To avoid doubt, it is declared that this Part does not confer any power to arrest a person.</PARA>
<PARA>We have doubled up on that provision and made it abundantly clear that nothing in the proposed legislation alters the law so as to give police a power to detain involuntarily. That has been an extension that we have offered to 23r. Quite clearly, as I say, we have affirmed that the Bill does not extend powers of arrest. We have made clear in the earlier sections that we are speaking about lawful arrest-that is, that the power has to be derived from some lawful authority other than by the clauses of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion that has taken place in the Committee has been useful. There was an extremely high quality of contribution by all the witnesses to that Committee, who put their cases very forcefully. Those persons who came and gave evidence to the Committee are to be commended for the spirit in which they gave it. Indeed, the Committee is to be commended for the spirit in which it was conducted under the leadership and chairmanship of Senator Cooney-a person of great fame; a Rumpole-type character in the criminal law courts of Victoria-who had a very real passion for getting this legislation right. In chairing this Committee, Senator Cooney has ensured that the Senate has before it a Bill which should receive the support of the whole chamber. </PARA>

It is our view, and certainly the view put by law enforcement authorities, that the court should take into account the number and complexity of the matters being investigated, as one aspect, in order to determine whether the time for the interrogation has been reasonable. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(i) any reasonable time during which the questioning of the person is suspended or delayed to allow the person to rest or recuperate.''</PARA>
<PARA>The second Opposition amendment relates to the dead time provisions of the Bill; that is, the times which might not be included in the calculation of the four-hour period for questioning. The Bill includes a number of examples of aspects that take time which should be excluded-to mention one in passing, the time arranged for an interpreter. We think another should be added; that is, any reasonable time during which the questioning of the person is suspended or delayed to allow the person to rest or recuperate. We think that in some instances it may be reasonable that a person be allowed to rest and recuperate. The time taken for that should not be included within the four-hour time constraint and, therefore, this should be an additional dead time exclusion provision. </PARA>

One would not want a situation-I suppose it would always have to be voluntary-where the police suggested that a person take five or six hours to have a sleep or a snooze, which could extend the time during which the person is being held whilst investigations are being undertaken.

<PARA> ``(j) any reasonable time during which the questioning of the person is suspended or delayed to permit such forensic examinations as are reasonably necessary to the investigation to be conducted.''</PARA>
<PARA>The third Opposition amendment also relates to dead time. It is to include another example; that is, reasonable time during which the questioning of the person is suspended or delayed to permit such forensic examinations as are reasonably necessary for the investigation to be conducted. There was considerable evidence put before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, particularly in relation to drug-type cases, that it is not simply a matter of asking questions but of asking questions in conjunction with forensic evidence, and it takes time for tests to be completed. </PARA>
<PARA> The police were concerned that, within these now very strict time limits, if there was not an exclusion for the time taken for this testing it would unreasonably and detrimentally affect their questioning and, therefore, the preparation of their case. We accepted that argument and we put it to the Senate Committee that there should be such an exclusion. Concern was expressed by the Minister and, I think, by Senator Spindler that, as the provision was then drafted, there was no constraint on the time and that this testing might take a considerable period so that the time period as a whole could become unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that, we have inserted at the beginning of this provision, in a similar spirit to the last amendment, that it is only for a reasonable time during which the questioning of the person is suspended to permit those forensic examinations as are reasonably necessary for the investigation to be conducted. We hope that we have now overcome the concerns that were expressed by the Government and by the Australian Democrats. It was never our intention to draft an amendment that would allow a person to be held for an unreasonable period during which such investigations are taken but simply to allow the police a reasonable time to complete questioning in conjunction with such necessary forensic testing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have very little to add to the rebuttal offered by Senator Spindler. Although I admit that there has been some modification of the original proposal that was put forward in the Committee on Wednesday morning, nevertheless I believe that the situation would lead to the suspect being uncertain and in no position to ascertain how long the dead time might run. Given the fact that one would be dependent on forces outside the control of the investigating officer and the laboratories that might be undertaking the forensic tests and examinations, I believe that it would be very difficult to ascertain with any definite prediction how long the forensic examination dead time might last. Therefore, I think it has all the difficulties, particularly with the proper addition of the word `reasonable', to open up questions in trials on future occasions which, as Senator Spindler has said, would undo much of the way in which the Bill has now been structured, which has the general concurrence of the Senate.

I make it quite clear that we place no bar, and intend to place no bar, against the people being questioned selecting a police officer whom they personally know and trust to become their interview friend in the situation in which they find themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it has been put to us by people experienced in the field that when a list of strange names is being provided for a person who is being questioned it is inappropriate to have included on that list police officers who are professional colleagues of the personnel questioning the person arrested.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept this amendment. I emphasise that we are talking about the drawing up of a list of those persons who might, in a particular region, act as interview friends or interpreters for Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who are under arrest and investigation for Commonwealth offences. I believe it has to be emphasised that that particular list would be put together, and is required to be put together, in the terms of the Bill. The particular provision states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In establishing and maintaining a list in relation to a region, the Minister or his or her delegate must, from time to time, consult with any Aboriginal legal aid organisation providing legal assistance to Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders in that region. </PARA>
<PARA>Given that provision, surely no constable would commend himself to the Aboriginal legal aid organisation with which the Minister, or the Minister's delegate, must consult if he was of a disposition which would not be regarded by the Aboriginal suspect as giving grounds for confidence that the interview friend would in fact protect the interests of that person during the interview. I believe that it would be quite unfair and it is-I apologise to Senator Spindler-something of a smear to say that constables cannot be put on the list of those who might act as interview friends and interpreters for Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is important, as the Bill recognises-I do not think it is disputed-that questioning must not take place unless an interview friend is present, or unless the right to have an interview friend has been waived. It seems to me that the compiling of such a list undertaken in that consultative way with an agency-for example, Aboriginal legal aid organisations providing legal assistance-would, after all, lean towards protecting the interests of the suspect. These organisations are obviously very keen to ensure that everybody on the list would be of a type and character that would, as I say, instil confidence in the suspect that his or her rights would be protected during the interview process. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons, the Government cannot accept that constables should be, as a class-without regard to any qualities whatsoever-excluded from the possibility of being on that list. </PARA>

Although there is an obligation of consultation, it is the Minister, the Government, that determines the list of persons, interview friends and interpreters that are to help the arrested person in appropriate circumstances.

<PARA>SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this Bill will give effect to the announcement made earlier in the Government's Statement ``Building a Competitive Australia'' of a reduction in the rate of sales tax on `luxury' vehicles to 30%. </PARA>
<PARA>The reduced rate of sales tax for `luxury' vehicles will apply to all taxable dealings that occur on or after 13 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>When the rate of sales tax on `luxury' vehicles was increased by this Government last year, motor vehicles specially fitted out for transporting disabled persons while seated in wheelchairs (which were previously subject to tax at the 30% rate) were excluded from the higher rate of tax and became taxable at the general rate of 20%. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will ensure that these vehicles remain subject to tax at the lower rate. </PARA>
<PARA>The reduction in the rate of sales tax on `luxury' motor vehicles will cost $15 million in 1990-91 and $45 million in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this Bill will amend the wholesale sales tax law to introduce a system of quarterly payments of sales tax for small business. </PARA>
<PARA>As announced by the Treasurer in the 1990-91 Budget, the Bill will amend the sales tax law to give eligible sales taxpayers the option of lodging returns and paying tax on a quarterly rather than a monthly basis. </PARA>
<PARA>This measure builds on the Government's previous initiatives to assist small business and it addresses, in part, the recommendations of the Report on Small Business by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology as they relate to the wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the current sales tax law, taxpayers who have any taxable dealings in a month are generally required to lodge returns and pay tax within 21 days of the close of that month. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will allow taxpayers to pay sales tax on a quarterly basis if their annual sales tax liability for the year ended 30 June 1991 was $50,000 or less. </PARA>
<PARA>To protect the threshold from erosion by price increases and to ensure that the new system will continue to benefit small taxpayers the threshold will be increased each 1 July in line with movements in the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA>Eligible taxpayers will have the option of lodging one return for the quarter or a return for each month of the quarter. Such taxpayers may also make payments at any time during the quarter provided that their full sales tax liability for the quarter is paid by the 21st day after the end of the quarter. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxpayers will be ineligible to become a quarterly payer if they have not lodged all outstanding returns and paid all outstanding sales tax liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>The new quarterly payments system will apply for taxable dealings that occur on or after 1 August 1991. The first payment of tax under the new system will be due by 21 November 1991 for taxable dealings for the months of August, September and November. </PARA>
<PARA>This measure will result in a one-off revenue loss in the 1991-92 financial year by delaying sales tax collections for June of that year and an ongoing interest opportunity cost from delayed collections. The cost will be $49.8m in 1991-92 and $5.9m in 1992-93. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill 1991 was debated in the Senate on 11 and 12 March. On behalf of the Opposition, I moved an amendment which was accepted by the Senate and indeed the debate was completed in my absence. Senator Michael Baume handled this matter for the Opposition in the committee stage and Senator Bell spoke in support. So the Opposition and the Australian Democrats achieved an amendment to this Bill. Yesterday the amended Bill was considered in another place. The House of Representatives disagreed with the amendment. Last night we circulated a message that notes that disagreement and gives two reasons for the disagreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The House of Representatives, in which the Government has a majority, was reluctant to see a reduction in the time that is given for a Minister of the Government to table any report that is received by the Minister-in this case, from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training-and for that report to be published. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation up until this time is that the Minister has 15 days to table the report. Our amendment in the Senate was that that time be reduced to five days. Of course, the reasons, in summary, that were given at the time were that we wanted to see a much more speedy receipt by the Parliament and the public of information while it is up to date, and that we did not want to see a government, through its Ministers, being slow in bringing forward information. </PARA>
<PARA> Two reasons were given for the House of Representatives disagreeing with this Senate amendment. Of course, the Opposition in the House of Representatives agreed with the amendment. The reasons were: firstly, all other reports of this kind are required to be tabled in 15 days; and, secondly, the longer period, the Government maintains, is required for the reports to be printed. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only say that the good objective of our original amendment was to bring to the attention of the Government and the public the widespread discontent with the Government's failure to justify its damaged policies in higher education. We wanted to make sure that this whole Parliament understands that the Government is damaging higher education. Also, the Government ought to make sure that when education advisory bodies bring reports to the Minister, these reports are brought to the Senate while they are fresh because we need to watch what is happening, to receive such advice, and to receive it on time.</PARA>
<PARA> The debate now in the two chambers has in fact provided opportunities for our concerns to be made very clear. The Government has been forced to provide detailed justification for the present period of 15 days. I note that the Government, in all this debate, has acknowledged that the actual delay on average over these past two or three years has been 42 calendar days-that is, all reports have on average been tabled in Parliament six weeks after the Minister has received them. I still dispute that 42-day average. I believe that in some instances 8 1/2 to nine calendar weeks have gone by before the Parliament and the public have had access to a report given to the Minister, and yet the Minister does not have to do anything to the report. </PARA>
<PARA> All that aside, even considering what the Government has admitted-that is, a delay of 42 days-we have demonstrated that the Government is not meeting its own guidelines. This month the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM and C) has circulated a report entitled Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports. I know that this refers to departmental annual reports, but there is a reference on page 5 to furnishing and tabling of reports. Paragraph 3.2 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Subsection 25 (8) of the Public Service Act requires the Minister to have the report tabled in both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days after the day on which the Minister receives the report. The Government has decided that in future the Minister, if 21 calendar days have elapsed, will endeavour to table the annual report within the next three sitting days. Should the statutory 15 sitting day period expire before those three sitting days have elapsed, the Minister would of course be bound to meet the statutory obligation.</PARA>
<PARA>Here PM and C defines a higher goal than the statutory requirement. All I can say is that, on the Government's own admission, it is not meeting even the PM and C's guideline on this matter. On page 1716 of the Senate Hansard of 12 March, Senator Michael Baume set out the relevant dates relating to reports over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said all that, I now turn to the speech made by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) in the House of Representatives yesterday. He referred not only to the two reasons for the House of Representatives message, but made this highly cynical conclusion on page 2168 of Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA>It is very likely that the effect of the proposed new clause and amendment would be for the National Board of Employment, Education and Training to delay formal transmission of reports to the Minister in order to allow the necessary time for ministerial approval for printing and tabling. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister threatened that, even if this amendment were to be carried by the Parliament and if there were reduced time for tabling in terms of the statutory requirement, let alone the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet guideline, the Government through its Minister would evade that statutory requirement by ensuring that the report was not received by the Minister until certain administrative matters had been concluded. Then the shorter statutory period could be met, but the whole spirit of what we were after, that is, the speedy publication of information to Parliament and public would be evaded by the Government's cynical administrative procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from the Minister's speech in Committee in the other place yesterday that the Government has in mind to adopt administrative devices to achieve delays, despite any Opposition amendment and despite guidelines from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I hope that the Government will rethink that and will adopt the spirit of our amendment by ensuring that we see a much more speedy publishing of reports in future, especially in the area of higher education. In the circumstances we do not insist on our amendment. It would be pointless to do so because the Government has said that were we to do so it would still evade it. In future some action may be proposed here in the Senate to achieve a more comprehensive solution that will not be able to be eroded by this cynical Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that one matter that the Senate is to contemplate is that reports of this kind will be tabled in the Senate and House of Representatives before they are printed. I know that there are requirements in our Standing Orders regarding reports once tabled being able to be circulated to all senators, and that would require printing. By an integrated consideration of Standing Orders and our current practice, and with the goal in mind that we have up to date information, we may be able to contemplate and gain unanimous support for such the idea in this Parliament of a Minister tabling almost immediately a report that he receives. If one volume is laid on the table of the Senate and the House of Representatives, as happens when a ministerial statement is circulated prior to its being given under the two-hour rule, arrangements may be made to make duplicated copies available to members until such time as the printed copy is available to everybody. </PARA>
<PARA> The advantage of such a procedure, not only in this particular area but more widely and indeed comprehensively, would be that the Parliament would receive reports within a few days of the Minister receiving them rather than 42 days or eight and a half weeks later, without the objections to which Senator Collins and Senator McMullan referred in the Senate debate in March, or indeed those to which the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services referred yesterday. If we were to comprehensively change our procedures in these matters, this would be a test as to whether a government was evading bringing information before the Parliament or whether it was being fair dinkum in reasons such as those we have received from the House of Representatives. I summarise the Opposition's view by saying that, because of the cynical approach by this Government, we will not insist on our amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have very little to add to the description given by Senator Teague as to the reasons for not insisting on this amendment. I think that the matter was well expressed by him. The amendment was not supported originally in a light-hearted manner by the Australian Democrats. The support was given for an amendment that we thought would serve to make a very valuable and important point about the treatment of reports by this Government, and indeed the treatment of reports by Parliament in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That point is also made in the latest issue of the publication Committee Bulletin in the parliamentary committee system. This information is contained in volume 2, No. 2 of February 1991. By coincidence I happened to receive my copy this morning. I was surprised to read on page 4 of that publication the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>There are also no hard and fast rules within the bureaucracy as to the timing, form and content of government responses to Parliament reports, which makes the process more unpredictable from the outside. Absence of such guidelines is quite astounding given the importance of the policy issues raised in many reports and given the fact that some inquiries take several years of research and preparation. </PARA>
<PARA>I realise that that is not exactly parallel to the concerns that were expressed in this particular piece of legislation but it is relevant and goes alongside the concerns expressed by Senator Teague as to the availability of information to members of Parliament and as to the accuracy and timeliness of such information. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me to lead to the need to express some sort of caution about allowing these things to get out of hand in terms of the amount of time between reports being delivered to responses being received and reports being tabled. This whole matter needs to be examined. I think that the fact that we have sent the recent amendment to the other place signals a concern. If that has been achieved, then at least I am satisfied with that. We will not continue to make any more fuss about this matter in the hope that the message has been received. </PARA>

I thank both Senator Teague and Senator Bell for their indications that they will be supporting this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to correct the record. Senator Teague ascribed to the Government a statement which in fact the Government did not make. Indeed, Senator Teague reiterated this matter in his final remarks. He alleged that the Government had said in the House of Representatives that the Government would simply get around these new provisions by some devious means. </PARA>
<PARA> When I look at the record, I find that the Government in the House of Representatives said no more than I said in the Senate when this matter was debated, and that was:</PARA>
<PARA>It is very likely that the effect of the proposed new clause and amendment would be for the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) to delay formal transmission of reports to the Minister in order to allow the necessary time for ministerial approval for printing and tabling. </PARA>
<PARA>That does not describe any element of deviousness by the Government. I take that charge seriously: to accuse the Government of trying to deviously outwit a resolution of the Senate requiring the tabling of a report is a serious charge to make, and it is refuted. </PARA>
<PARA> We were simply stating the fact that the new proposed reporting timetable would have been so onerous and so difficult to meet that, in order not to breach the new rules, the organisation itself may well have been forced into delaying the actual transmission of the document until it had had time for approval, printing and tabling so it would not be in breach of the new arrangements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill 1991, which deals, as one might gather from its title, with the ongoing saga of the electoral system in the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian Capital Territory achieved self-government with the passage of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, and the electoral system for the Territory was specified in the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988. This system-termed `modified d'Hondt'-was adopted as a compromise following a drawn out and lengthy debate, and provided for a form of proportional representation not previously used in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first elections for the ACT Legislative Assembly were held on 4 March 1989; and, as everyone in this place knows, the exercise was perceived to have left a lot to be desired. It is fair to say, however, that virtually any electoral system adopted would have had difficulty in coping with the peculiar circumstances of that election. </PARA>
<PARA> Most people would agree that there is no doubt that many of the problems revolved around entrenched opposition to self-government. I remind the Senate that there were 117 candidates for 17 positions and that the ballot paper was a metre wide, with 139 boxes. The two major parties attracted less than 40 per cent of first preference votes with 60 per cent of preferences following no consistent pattern. In the event, groups such as the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party, the Surprise Party, the Party! Party! Party! Party and so on did not win a seat, but as a result of their mischief-and I think that is the best way to describe it-it took some nine weeks for the results of the election to become clear. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, a subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters-ably chaired by my colleague, the honourable member for Chisholm, Dr Michael Wooldridge-inquired into the election. That Committee canvassed exhaustively the history of the ACT electoral system and the experiences gained at the first election. It described the tortuous nature of the negotiations that led to the final outcome. Given the way that the modified d'Hondt system was adopted, it is not surprising that the Committee's report was illustrated with a camel-highlighting the well known maxim that a camel is a horse designed by a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As a threshold question, and in retrospect, we could well ask why this Parliament retained control over the electoral laws of the ACT and did not give them that power in the first place. After all, I understand that when the Northern Territory achieved self-government electoral laws were included in the powers given to the elected assembly, as is only logical. By now, however, residents of the national capital have had self-government for nearly three years. Surely, it is appropriate for them to decide the alternative they prefer. It is my understanding that the Government intends to give them that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Government has committed itself to holding a referendum to allow the residents of the ACT to choose the system that will be used. The choice being offered will be either the Hare-Clark proportional representation system or single member electorates. Further, the Opposition supports the repatriation of electoral laws to the ACT so that in future this Parliament will not have to concern itself with the minutiae of ACT electoral matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the Government's commitment both to hold a referendum and to repatriate the electoral legislation after the 1992 elections, we are able to take a different attitude to the Bill now before the Senate. The Opposition voted against this Bill in the lower House because, although we supported many of its provisions-and provisions recommended by the Standing Committee-we could not support the basic thrust of changes to the method of voting. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government had proposed was to prevent voters from distributing preferences across party lines; in other words, they were to be locked into a party list. We accept that this procedure would have shortened the time needed to obtain a result but believe that denying freedom of choice was too high a price to pay for this time saving. </PARA>
<PARA> Following our opposition to the Bill in the House of Representatives and expressions over here that we could not support the Bill with the preferences limited to party lists, at the request of the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) I had discussions with him, following which he wrote me a letter in which he incorporated his proposal to address the concerns that we had expressed, pointing out the proposal for a referendum and for transferring the power to control the electoral system over to the Assembly. That letter to me was dated 14 March. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I subsequently responded on 4 April and indicated to him that we agreed in principle with the proposal he had made in his previous letter, with one or two small reservations. One reservation was that we wished to be assured that the questions asked in the referendum and explanatory information provided with those questions would be framed in such a way as to be equitable to both options. The other reservation was-and this indicated no doubt on the intent of the Minister but was simply a matter of prudence-that we would need to see the proposed amendments to ensure there were no unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> We maintain our position on this issue of preferences and look forward to the Government moving amendments to abandon this proposal. Further, we also objected to the proposal to limit the deadline for the receipt of postal votes, thus requiring votes to be received by the close of polling on election day. The present time allowance of two weeks after polling day is designed to ensure that no voters are disenfranchised, and this is consistent with the practice in Federal elections. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other place the Minister noted that the Government was relaxed about this issue, and I trust that this amendment will return to the current time-frame. While it is appreciated that with the ACT the election date is known, it seemed to us that restricting the postal votes to the election date would not save any time simply because, as is the case now, the preferences could be distributed across the voting paper. We were also somewhat concerned that some enthusiastic person might decide to use it as a precedent in other elections, which we believe would be very much a backward step. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of reforms recommended by the Joint Standing Committee which the Opposition has always supported. We understand that the Government's amendments will preserve those sensible changes. Many of them could be described as merely housekeeping and would overcome some of the worst features of the previous system. In brief they will provide, firstly, that political parties must have existing parliamentary representation, or at least 100 members, to be eligible to maintain registered status; and, secondly, that no individual may register or be the registered officer for more than one political party-and there are good reasons for supporting that. It stops one individual registering some 40 or 50 parties and acting as their registered officer simply to distort the electoral system. As I mentioned earlier, very few electoral systems could have withstood the pressure that occurred at the first election. The third point is that the deposit required from candidates nominating for election be raised to $250, which brings it into line with the House of Representatives and, I understand, most States. Fourthly, the amendments will provide for clearer, more logical rules about formality, and, fifthly, they will provide for the Electoral Commission to conduct a two-stage count allowing an indication of election outcomes to be obtained on the night of the election. I think that is important. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the debate on this Bill in the lower House canvassed a number of other matters. For example, I read with interest the contribution of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), who floated the suggestion that the ACT should be `disappeared'-to use his words-as a separate entity and included in New South Wales. I am not sure how the Government and the people of New South Wales, or the people of the ACT, would respond to this proposal, but I would point out that there would be major difficulties in achieving it, which obviously the honourable member for North Sydney did not contemplate, because of the necessity to change the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Some speakers in the other place rather mischievously, I thought, tried to turn the debate into a consideration of the merits of voluntary voting, and I note the comments of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). I would be happy at any time to have a full-scale debate on that subject and note that this very fundamental change to our electoral system was enacted in 1924 in less than 2 1/2 hours, without a division in either House. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties of the legislation-and this was commented on by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee-is that the legislation that covers the ACT electoral system is not limited to one Act of Parliament but to a number of Acts. It is worth quoting what the Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is of the view that this situation presents a person who wishes to look up the electoral law that applies to the ACT with a very confusing task. A person would have to refer to three separate pieces of legislation, including cross-referencing four different Schedules, in order to establish what the electoral law is.</PARA>
<PARA>This was highlighted by the fact that when the Bill was passed in the House of Representatives the Opposition took a view that, while it could support most of the Government amendments as recommended by the Standing Committee, it could not support the proposal which limited the preference to party lists. It was interesting that counsel engaged by the clerks to provide proposed amendments which would satisfy our requirements found it to be a daunting task. If those experts had a daunting task, what hope is there for ordinary senators to be able to contemplate an issue such as this? I understand that it is the intent of the Government to refer this Bill to a committee to review the proposed committee stage amendments, and that those amendments will embody the changes outlined to me by the Minister in his letter of 14 March. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the situation as it now stands is that, as I understand it, the people of the ACT will go to the next election under a system which has improvements based on the recommendations of the Standing Committee but which preserves the right of voters to place their preferences where they wish. At the same time, they will vote in a referendum to determine the type of electoral system they want and, based on the outcome of that referendum, future determinations of the electoral system in the ACT will be determined by the ACT Assembly itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is somewhat unusual for me to be speaking at this stage in the debate, but I thought it appropriate that someone on behalf of the Government should put formally in the debate the changes to the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill which will be proposed subsequently and which Senator Parer has referred to. I realise that Senators Reid and Bell would not be handicapped in participating if I did not because they know broadly, as I do, what is involved in those matters, but it just seemed appropriate, in terms of properly conducting the debate, if, rather than speak later, I did it early just for the sake of the record showing that the changes were outlined in broad intent and that people were able then to speak about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no real secret about what we are now proposing to do, and that has been accurately reflected by Senator Parer's comments. Firstly, this Bill will be substantially amended to restrict it to those provisions retaining bipartisan support, and those matters were outlined by Senator Parer accurately in the second reading debate. The Bill will also be amended to provide for a referendum to determine the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) electorates preferred electoral system. It is a fairly substantial task of drafting to have those amendments done but we are now engaged in a process which will enable us at the end of the second reading debate to refer it to the appropriate committee. In the course of this session we hope to have the legislation concluded so that the people in the ACT know what that electoral system is-although effectively they do now-and know the manner in which the referendum will be conducted. The contest for the election and the debate around the referendum can then proceed in a proper and informed manner for the remaining period. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps to the relief of the people of the ACT-perhaps not-the next election is approaching remarkably rapidly. The election will be held early in February, which is some 10 months away. But the real significance of it is that most of the effective campaign, particularly on the more esoteric matters such as the electoral system, will need be concluded by Christmas so that people can concentrate on the issues dealing with formation of Government itself. </PARA>
<PARA> So the period from when we get this Bill passed, say some time in May, is not a long one for what is a fairly important debate, even if it is easier to conduct in a smaller and more compact community such as the ACT. I will not reiterate, as I was otherwise going to, the matters of agreement because Senator Parer has done that adequately. As I have said, the Government's timetable with regard to those changes is broadly that we will be seeking to have the committee report back in May and we will be trying to conclude the legislation in the course of this session. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the changes that have been agreed upon. Notwithstanding that clearly the Government would have preferred more substantial changes, they will be improvements which will be welcomed. The capacity effectively to be confident of the election outcome on the night, even if it is not finalised, will substantially enhance the reputation of both the system and self-government itself. There is no doubt that the counting process and the delayed outcome last time were substantial debilitating factors, as were the proliferation of parties and the deliberate attempts to make the transfer of responsibility to the ACT into a farce. I suppose one can say that that was successful. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose one should say, to be fair to the d'Hondt electoral system, that it is actually not a bad electoral system. As Senator Parer said, it was put under extraordinary strain by the arrangements that individuals made in the manner in which they sought to contest the last election. It is not, of itself, a bad system although by the time the Senate had finished amending it, the one that we gave the ACT as a so-called modified d'Hondt had its shortcomings. The basic d'Hondt system is not a bad system but it is totally discredited in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible, beyond this next election, to proceed with further elections under it. That is not because the result will be so unfair or so unreasonable-I do not believe that the last election result was unfair-the problem with it is that it reflected accurately the votes of the electors. They turned out and voted for the people who got elected. It is very hard to find in the streets of Canberra the people who voted for Craig Duby. By normal laws of arithmetic about 14 per cent of the people out there should have voted for him, but of every 100 people I meet I do not find one who admits to it, except Craig. I have found nobody else-and sometimes he is not sure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may have been a compliment. The people of the ACT are expressing grave reservations about the outcome of that election. People tend to blame the electoral system for the outcome, but that is not reasonable. The d'Hondt system did that which it purports to do well-it delivered a result that essentially reflected the intentions of the voters when they went to the ballot box.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us come back to some sort of history of how we got to that d'Hondt system as a bit of background to properly assessing where we should proceed from here. I do not want to do that at great length but I think it is important, for a complete picture, that we give some indication of how it is that we got to this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there had been a lot of discussion about electoral systems for the ACT in the various discussions about self-government. Various forms of proportional representation had been contemplated at different times-different numbers of electorates and different types of electoral systems-but this Government, from the time it took office and expressed a desire for and commitment to achieve self-government, always indicated as its preferred option a single member electorate system. I am not saying that that was the only proposal we ever put forward, because we were aware that there was never a majority in the Senate for that proposal, but it was and remains the Government's preferred option. I will come back to my case for that subsequently. I am simply now making the historical point that that is where we started.</PARA>
<PARA> We were forced to seek a proposal that could win majority support in the Senate. We did not want another so-called butcher of self-government incident. I believe that it was correct that we entered into that process of negotiation, notwithstanding its frustrations and notwithstanding, to some extent, the inadequacy of the outcome. The greater objective of transferring responsibility for their own affairs to the people of the ACT-the greater objective of self-government-needed to be achieved and was more important than the short term detail of the electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> I share with Senator Parer the view which I expressed in my party room then, and I am now happy that it has been achieved, that the electoral system should have been handed over then, but there was not the confidence of people in this Parliament-I think on all sides of the Parliament-that the Assembly would be a body to which people were happy to hand over the electoral system. It may be that the result of the first election justifies the caution of people on both sides of the chamber. That is a matter for debate. I am not sure that that is correct, but I can see that people would perhaps feel justified. Nevertheless, it is appropriate that we should now be proceeding to hand over. It was more important that the major issue of self-government was achieved than that the minor issue of under which electoral system it should operate and that should not be allowed to continue to obstruct the achievement of that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a lengthy and frustrating negotiating process in which I was involved. One of the most frustrating features about the continuing discussion about ACT electoral systems has been that some people-not senators present, but the Australian Democrats' representatives at that time-did not seem to understand what negotiation meant. They put forward their proposal and everybody else put forward theirs. We would then enter into a long series of discussions about possible variations and they would nod and say, `That is interesting', and come back the next day and say, `Thank you very much, but our view is exactly what it was yesterday'. They would seek compromises from everybody else but in the end it was impossible to come to any agreement with the Democrats because they could not see the wood for the trees. There had to be some other form of agreement which was eventually arrived at, and an electoral system was agreed which led to that last election. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before, whatever the lack of legitimacy of d'Hondt in the eyes of the ACT people-and there is no doubt that that is there and that it is necessary to come up with a mechanism for replacing it, and the referendum is the appropriate mechanism at this time-the election result last year reflected the wishes of the voters. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to consider this Bill before us now-and I will not dwell on what it might have been-as I have outlined it, with the changes which the Government intends to pursue in the committee stage. The Bill, as originally introduced by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), was not that which I would have preferred. I have publicly and privately supported a referendum for some time. I welcome the fact that the Bill is now going to reflect that objective. Even before that objective was achieved, I welcomed the commitment by the Minister in the second reading speech to transfer responsibility to the ACT to determine the electoral system. In the Westminster system of government, under which we operate, that is the alternative mechanism and the normal, standard and appropriate mechanism for determining the preferences of electors on major issues. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have referendums on major issues-they are not appropriate for resolution in that manner. I think electoral systems are somewhat different. In the normal course of events what happens, and what will happen with regard to all of the other issues in the ACT-what people want to do about the hospital system or the school system-is that people put forward alternative packages of policies to the electorate, and the electorate chooses through the ballot box and elects the government on the basis of its judgment about the balance of policies which those people put forward. That is how the Westminster system allows those decisions to be made. It is how governments are formed and how the policy process has proceeded traditionally. I thought that was, of itself, an appropriate mechanism-and it would have been-but I prefer the referendum model and I am pleased that we are going in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACT people will get a new electoral system and the opportunity to indicate what electoral system it is that they would prefer. It will be a very brave ACT government which does not act in accordance with that. There is no doubt that everybody campaigning at the next election here will have to commit themselves to accepting the outcome of the referendum. It is inconceivable that anybody would contemplate not doing it as a matter of democratic process, but as a matter of electoral reality no-one would be able to withstand the pressure of saying, `We would not accept the outcome of the referendum'. Although the legislation will not make the referendum outcome binding, it will be binding-it will bind people effectively politically, and it should. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve that, as I have said, we have a fairly strict timetable, because we do need to be able to get the legislation passed in sufficient time for people to know what they are campaigning about for an extended period and so that the education process, the communications process and the process of democratic consideration can proceed. We have encountered some stumbling blocks before getting to the point of holding a referendum; one of which I think was perfectly legitimate. The question of cost is not one that can be brushed aside. It is all very well for people to say-not many people are still saying it-that the referendum should have been conducted earlier because it would not cost much money. The first point I make is that it is other people's money; it is the taxpayers' money and if we can do something for no cost or, alternatively, we can spend several hundred thousand dollars doing it, we would be absolutely irresponsible to choose the expensive option instead of the more cost efficient one. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the current proposal to hold a referendum is an excellent outcome. It significantly reduces the cost to virtually nothing and it also avoids the inconvenience of conducting a separate referendum. It does mean that we will have to conduct the next election under d'Hondt, only slightly improved. I would have thought that, with a bit more cooperation-I am not being critical of anyone here, I think all of us probably fell a bit short-we could have found a compromise electoral system once we had decided that we were going to have a referendum. But no parties-including my own-have chosen to pursue that route. I am, therefore, happy that we are proceeding to the referendum. That is the most important thing and it will resolve the question. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be supporting the single member constituencies option in that referendum. That will be a surprise to no one; I have said it on very many occasions. I said it in about the first speech I made as an elected representative of the ACT in 1988. It is very easy for people to be cynical and say that the Labor Party in the ACT or I support single member constituencies only because we think we will win under that system. I have supported single member constituencies as the appropriate electoral system for the Northern Territory for 20 years and my Party has never won there. We did not win any seats in the first election which was held in the Northern Territory, but that did not lead me to say, `Let's find a new electoral system under which we can do a bit better'. I supported the continuation of single member constituencies. There are other States in which the Labor Party has had notorious lack of success-fortunately in some cases this has been redressed recently-but there was never a suggestion in any of those mainland States that there should be a change of the electoral system in favour of adopting the proportional representation system. </PARA>
<PARA> What I find somewhat more surprising is those parties whose policy changes from State to State, depending upon whether they think they can win under one particular system or another. At least the Democrats are consistent; they always support the only system under which they could get elected, and then accuse everybody else of self-interest. We have a situation where, in my view--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If they did that I suspect they would do better than they did last time. I want to outline, very briefly-because there will be plenty more opportunities to do it, and I will take them; and because I think that it is important and, in a sense, it is the first time we have discussed the electoral system which will result from the referendum-the fundamental reasons why I will support that system. First and foremost, it is a system that the people of the ACT understand and are comfortable with. It does have that degree of democratic legitimacy which d'Hondt lacks. That factor should not be underestimated. It is very important that we say to the people of the ACT that the system of democracy which exists now-the democratic process of determining priorities between people in the ACT as they proceed to resolve issues in conflict-needs to have that degree of legitimacy which democratic government requires. Therefore, I think it needs the electoral system that most people in mainland Australia regard as being the way in which people choose governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a large number of other factors concerning the importance of a local member-based system, for government and for the people. It both assists individuals and, in my view, makes for better government. It also means that voters can choose the person that they wish to represent them in their local area and they can exercise a clear choice between identifiable individuals whom they can scrutinise. That is particularly appropriate in a Territory such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important reason why I have always supported the single member constituency option is that it means that candidates have to be able to command majority support in at least one area of the electorate. In effect, that means that, over the ACT as a whole, parties aspiring to form government have to put forward a comprehensive package of policies across a range of issues. They have to say, `If we are the Government this is how we will address education; this is how we will address health'. People cannot then get elected by ignoring 19 of the 20 key issues and concentrating on only one because they know that maybe 5 per cent of the electorate is concerned about it. I do not care whether the 5 per cent are people who have views with which I agree or disagree; I do not believe the appropriate mechanism for choosing a government is the fortunate coincidence of cobbling together a number of individuals and groups who have put together sectional interest-appealing policies. I will be mounting that argument on a more comprehensive basis over the weeks and months to come. Obviously, like everybody else in Canberra, I will accept the outcome of the referendum, whichever way it goes. It will not change my preference for what I think the better system is, but I will certainly accept the wish of the people as expressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The next task we have-it is not an easy one-is to formulate the questions that need to be put in the referendum. In one sense it is terribly easy. We will say that one will be, effectively, the House of Representatives system and one will be Hare Clark. But what sort of Hare Clark will we have? My personal view is that the Government should not try to choose that. The people who advocate it should, in some way, choose what sort of Hare Clark system we will be putting forward to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The main problem I have found is identifying what Hare Clark means to the people who advocate it. It has many advocates, but they all think it means something slightly different. Malcolm Mackerras started off from a position of support for three electorates of seven members. He stated that that was the only way that we would have real Hare Clark because we had to have even numbers in the electorates. He has now changed his view and favours two electorates of five members, and one of seven members. The view he put to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters was slanted in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Proportional Representation Society of Australia originally favoured Hare Clark with some minor technical modifications taken from the Tasmanian model. It was not sure, at that stage, how many electorates it wanted-probably two. However, it was definitely opposed to electorates with only five members. That is leading to a situation whereby if there are 17 members there would have to be two constituencies-there is no other way that 17 people could be elected without at least one of the electorates having five people in it. That was the Society's option then. I am advised, upon reading the Canberra Times of 23 March, that it now favours the so-called Buchanan model, which I will talk about later. I must admit that the Buchanan model reminds me somewhat of an Edsel. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats originally proposed what they called the discrete community system, in which the ACT would be broken up into four defined areas with members allocated to each area on the basis of enrolment. They said that the four defined areas would be Belconnen, central Canberra, Woden-Weston Creek and Tuggeranong. Conveniently, they would come up with four or five members for each of those and, conveniently, each electorate would be just of the size--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to speak briefly on the impact of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade tabled last year on Australia-India relations. This report shows what can be achieved by a parliamentary committee in this place. Committees can advise, inform, educate and influence policy. I would like to congratulate my colleagues on the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for their work on that inquiry and for their work in the preparation of the report. As is the case with all standing committees, there were eight members on this Committee. Over the course of two parliaments, there have been more than eight senators involved in the preparation of this particular report, which was tabled here in August last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were two principal recommendations: firstly, for the establishment of an Australia-India council, an advisory body to develop the relationship in the broad between the two countries and, secondly, for an Indian studies centre, which was to be a centre of excellence in a major Australian university. It was to be a repository of expertise on India in this country. The objective was to seek private sector funding for it. The Committee in its deliberations discovered that many of the Australian experts on India in our universities were about to retire and this was one of the reasons for the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> In December, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, responded to the report, as was required, and he endorsed the Australia-India council. He indicated that he would seek funds in the next Budget in August for that council. I think it is fair to say that in respect of the Indian studies centre, the Minister endorsed the idea in principle, but he came back to the Committee and suggested to us that we come up with further details and further proposals to refine that particular recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Easter recess of the past three weeks, I took the opportunity to travel to India. I went there to publicise the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. While there, I had meetings in Bombay and New Delhi. In Bombay, I met with leading figures in the commerce, trade and financial sectors. In New Delhi, I discussed the report with political leaders, diplomats and government leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> There was great interest in the report in New Delhi. In fact, I did not have to publicise it in the business and government circles because people were very well informed on the report and had read it. Many people made very positive comments on the report and there was also very positive comment on Minister Evans's response to the Committee recommendations last December. In fact, one leading industrialist in Bombay even provided me with a written critique of the report. It was a very positive critique which showed that people in the top positions were taking the time to read the report of the Senate Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that the report has had a modest positive impact on Australian-Indian relations. I would not want to overstate it but, certainly in business and political circles, it was regarded very favourably. On leaving New Delhi last Thursday, I was told that the report is now being sold to other embassies in that capital city as it is regarded as being the most concise contemporary document on India and on one country's relationship with India. </PARA>
<PARA> In official and business circles, the response to the report has been overwhelmingly positive. It is certainly a major talking point with the political and business elites in the country and, in a very modest way, it has helped to add to Australia's credibility in India. The report is now in its third or fourth print run and I understand that yet another large order was submitted for the report last week. </PARA>
<PARA> As chairman of the Committee, in India I had the privilege of meeting with Mr Rajiv Gandhi last Thursday. I spent considerable time with him at his campaign headquarters discussing a range of issues relating to Australia. The focus was on economic issues and the talks were very productive. I also had the opportunity to speak with three Ministers in the present Indian Government, including Mr A K Sen who, as the Minister of steel and mines, takes a great interest in the importation of Australian coal, which is our major export to that country. </PARA>
<PARA> I also had the opportunity to meet with the governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Venkitamanan. I was able to do that despite the very severe economic problems that India was having at the time. I was most impressed that he was able to see me, given that he had the International Monetary Fund knocking on the door to talk about India's foreign exchange problems. In addition to the many business leaders I met, I also had a round table discussion on the report with representatives of various think-tanks and universities in New Delhi. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Australian business should look now at investing in India. While there are foreign exchange programs at the moment, there could well be relaxation of economic controls after the elections next month, and I believe that the complex Indian system of licensing, of tariffs and of foreign exchange controls will be under the microscope in the aftermath of the Indian general elections. I believe that Australian business should get in now. Certainly, in the past, India has not attracted a great deal of foreign investment, but that situation could well change. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is more scope for cooperation between the two countries and certainly more scope for stronger political and business links. No doubt members of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade will be looking at the May election results with great interest and they will be looking for any consequent changes in policy stemming from those elections.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.36)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my first speech in this place in September of last year, one of the issues on which I commented was the subject of the lack of accreditation in this country of private training providers. I illustrated, by way of example, some difficulties that were occurring with two private training providers in the hospitality industry in my home State of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regrettably in this country there is no formal registration of private training providers. With the explosion of private training in this country, a number of instances of malpractice have emerged. On the first occasion that I spoke on this matter, I drew to the attention of the Senate claims in brochures that the courses that were being offered had some form of accreditation. That was incorrect. The place at which the training was taking place, in this case Wrest Point, gave the impression that that workplace itself, which has a high reputation in the hospitality industry, was carrying out the training, when in fact it was not. There was a range of other problems, some particularly serious, which I will comment on at another time, which verge on criminal practice. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of one of the two training operators, I am pleased to say that, following my speech to this place, I received some contact from that organisation known as the Hospitality Training Group. The managing director of that organisation is Ms Natasha Lakajev. She contacted me following my speech. I did in fact write to her expressing my concerns about a number of that company's practices. I have to emphasise that problems that I believe occurred in this training program are minor compared to problems in the other training program which, as I said, I will be referring to at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA> I pointed out to the Hospitality Training Group that I believed that its pamphlet was misleading. Having talked to Ms Lakajev, I do not believe that that was intentional, but the pamphlet was misleading. It referred to accreditation when in fact it had not received accreditation at that point in time. There is an organisation in the hospitality industry known as Tourism Training Australia, which is recognised by all the various parties within the industry as the appropriate body to provide accreditation through a subcommittee known as the Australian hospitality review panel. </PARA>
<PARA> Following my conversations with the managing director of the Hospitality Training Group, members of the group have received accreditation in a number of the training modules that they offer to the public. Those training modules are introductory food and beverage, customer relations and interpersonal skills. The group was granted accreditation provided that greater emphasis was placed on team- work in the teaching of the interpersonal skill module and, when advertising, that reference to work experience is omitted as it is neither guaranteed nor supervised. </PARA>
<PARA> Further to that, on the written material that the members of the particular training group publish and on their registration forms, they must state which modules they have accreditation for so that students are made aware of the level and extent of accreditation. These matters, whilst important, are relatively minor compared with the malpractices that go on in the private training area in other areas. Following Miss Natasha Lakajev's communication with me, I assured her that I would bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that her training scheme is operating under the auspices of, and with the full accreditation of, Tourism Training Australia and that I would not hesitate to recommend her course in terms of its accreditation, fitness and proper course content to persons who wish to undertake training in the hospitality industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, there is one other particular scheme-there may be others-I have been made aware of which, I understand, given what has been presented to me in the last six months, is carried out in a criminal manner. I have initiated particular actions in regard to that scheme and will be reporting on that at another time. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying that, regrettably, these incidents, and others which I am aware of in other industries, illustrate the need for some form of formal accreditation. If the burgeoning and rapidly expanding private training sector-about whose existence I do not have any complaint-continues to expand, it should offer training in a proper and accredited form in order that persons who undertake private training are well aware of what they are being trained for and that they are receiving value for money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) $1,677,744</PARA>
<PARA> (2) $71,026 (on facilities, i.e. on building modifications and fittings).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The balance has been spent as follows:</PARA>

<PARA> (g) Community groups such as scouts, school parent groups, youth programs etc assisting the assimilation of Defence Force families into the community-$220,861</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Family Support Funding Program has a wider role than the support of child care. The objectives of the program are to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) encourage self-help among Service families;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) improve access to community facilities; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) maximise the benefits of presently available facilities and resources by limited funding of programs which benefit a majority of service families.</PARA>
<PARA> The program recognises that initiatives for family support should come from the families themselves and that each location where there is a concentration of Service families will have differing needs and priorities. The breakdown of the Family Support Funding Program monies represents the priorities accorded by the families to the projects and programs they wish to see implemented. The child care needs of Service members are being addressed separately.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The ADF has established a range of community based facilities. Two centres, the Laverton Child Care Centre at RAAF WILLIAMS and the Sunny Centre at Swanbourne are operating as licensed centres within their relevant State requirements. Both centres are now eligible for the Government's fee relief program. These centres were primarily sponsored by self-help groups with the assistance of local commanders, and cater for ADF members and civilians.</PARA>
<PARA> Many other ADF bases and units have established some form of child care facility such as playgroups, creches and kindergartens. However, these are generally provided by the particular community members for themselves and are also outside the parameters of work-based child care. These facilities have attracted some funds from the Family Support Funding Program, as can be seen from the figures previously quoted.</PARA>
<PARA> In line with Government policy on public sector work-based child care, Defence is currently preparing a child care policy which will cover both community and work based facilities. A working party has been drafting this policy and is presently finalising it in terms of Government guidelines on the implementation of employer supported child care in the public sector. It is expected that some of the existing child care facilities will meet the criteria for work based child care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The rules that apply to the commencement of sole parent's pension are the same as those that apply to all other types of pensions. Payment generally commences from the first available payday following the date on which the claim was lodged (between 1 and 13 days after lodgement). There is no waiting period of the sort that applies in respect of unemployment benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> Sole parent's pension is not a payment made only for the reason that a woman gives birth. Sole parent's pension is payable to parents, either male or female, or to the long-term custodians of children on the basis of the parental responsibilities involved.</PARA>
<PARA> In the majority of instances the events which may cause a person to apply for sole parent's pension are recent birth of a child, separation from a spouse, death of a spouse or imprisonment of a spouse.</PARA>
<PARA> New applicants for sole parent's pension are required to provide details of any recent employment history in order to verify that earnings have ceased, or to establish what rate of earnings will continue. These details are relevant to applying the income test and determining the appropriate rate of pension.</PARA>
<PARA> Specific information on the reason for leaving employment, where this is applicable, is not available. This is not necessary to the determination of entitlement and, in accordance with privacy principles, is not collected.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No, although details, including information about the former employment, are obtained.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The precise detailed information sought is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> Data indicate that over 80% of JET clients overall have been on pension for 12 months or more.</PARA>
