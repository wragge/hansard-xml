<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to the coup in the Soviet Union, which is tragic for the people of the Soviet Union and worrying for peace and security in the whole world. What protest has the Australian Government made to this abrupt end to what have been evolving democratic processes in the Soviet Union? What support can Australia give to international efforts to avoid a return to the old communist order which has been discredited politically and economically? In particular, will the Australian Government support the United States and others in refusing to accept the leaders of yesterday's coup as a legitimate government?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="655" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall go straight to the specific questions and then add a few more general points on the situation in the Soviet Union. We have, this morning, called in the Soviet Charge d'Affaires to express the Government's very deep concern at the overturning of constitutional authority in the Soviet Union; to express our anxiety that such problems as there may continue to be in the Soviet Union are resolved by peaceful means, not manifestly unconstitutional means or potentially violent means; and to advise that the use of force in any form could not but damage our bilateral relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should say that we have also expressed our concern about the implications of the coup for the conduct of Soviet foreign policy, and our concern that the foreign policy that was so successfully mapped out by President Gorbachev remain on track. I have also instructed the Ambassador in Moscow, to the extent that he is able to make contact with the new governing regime, to convey formally similar points to him.</PARA>
<PARA> No-one would be in any doubt about the nature of Australia's reaction in the light of the Prime Minister's very clear and very firm statement on television last night and the public statements that I have made subsequently on behalf of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> It is, of course, not Australian practice now to do other than to recognise states. We do not recognise or de-recognise governments. Therefore, the question that is put to me about our reaction to the particular group now in authority-the State Emergency Committee-and whether we recognise it as the government of the Soviet Union simply does not arise in those terms. We are, of course, closely monitoring the reactions to the situation of other countries around the world. We will be guided to some extent in the nature of our reactions by the way in which concerted international opinion does develop.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation in the Soviet Union is obviously a ground for very serious concern. The State Emergency Committee has already passed decrees banning opposition groups and demonstrations and establishing control over the mass media; the KGB and the military have been ordered to ensure compliance with emergency regulations; the military is deployed in force around key strategic locations in Moscow and Leningrad; and we have reports of the appointment of a military governor to replace the democratically elected city council of Leningrad.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation in the Baltic states, in particular, is also ground for very considerable concern. There are reports that Soviet forces have stormed radio and television stations and have seized other strategic sites in the Baltic republics, with at least one person having been reported as killed in Riga. The situation in other republics whose reaction will, of course, be extremely important as events unfold is, at the moment, somewhat unclear. Crucial republics, in terms of their reaction, are the Ukraine and Kazakhstan but, at the moment, the evidence about the nature of either the crackdown that has been applied to them or their response remains pretty fragmentary.</PARA>
<PARA> I should say that all our assessments at this stage are of a preliminary nature. Obviously, as more comprehensive reports come to hand from the various sources that are available to the Government we will be in a better position to make considered judgments about what is likely to happen. Let me say, however, that it is still unclear that this bid for power by the traditionalists represented in the State Emergency Committee will succeed in the longer term. It would be premature, in our judgment, to make extremely pessimistic judgments at this stage. We should not rush to any judgment that these developments are irreversible.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, Mr Yeltsin's position, as the democratically elected Russian President, gives him a pivotal role in determining how the crisis plays out. The degree to which he may be able to muster popular support against the new leadership will, more than anything else, determine how this crisis plays out and whether the coup succeeds. As has been reported, he has called for a general strike and, according to our latest information, Russian workers in large numbers are now heeding his call, while some military units may also be siding with the democratically elected Government of Russia.</PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be appreciated that the Soviet Union is a country, as a whole, which is very vulnerable to industrial disruption through the coal mines or other key locations of that kind. It is quite unlike China or a number of other countries in this respect and, as such, the role that is played by the striking workers will be a very important element in the conduct of the crisis.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me comment quickly on the situation so far as foreign policy is concerned because I am sure that this will be the subject of a later question, if it is not already implicit in what Senator Hill has put to me. Again, I think it would be imprudent to make overly pessimistic judgments about the implications of all this for the conduct of Soviet foreign policy. There may well be some spill-over of the new domestic circumstance into foreign relations, but the nature and extent of that are still unclear.</PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, we note and welcome the public statement by Mr Yanayev on behalf of the Emergency Committee that the new regime will honour treaty commitments, agreements and arrangements entered into and that, in essence, it is not contemplating any basic policy shifts. Whether those assurances can be taken at face value or whether there is a risk of arms control and related treaties being now undermined, we will simply have to wait and see.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, however, I do not think we need be unduly alarmed at the prospect of any major recreation of the Cold War, particularly in terms of the situation in eastern Europe. Soviet troops are now completely out of Czechoslovakia and Hungary. It is inconceivable that they could play any role, although they are still there in large numbers in East Germany. There are also some 60,000 of them in Poland and that may well be a stone in the shoe in the situation there. But, generally speaking, the notion that the Warsaw Pact might somehow be recreated, Comecon recreated and Europe divided in the way that it was before is, I think, genuinely inconceivable.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, that is not to say that there may not be some falling away of the level and quality of the cooperation that the world has seen from the Soviet Union in the conduct of a whole variety of other important foreign relations issues in recent times. To the extent that the new world order had any clear-cut conceptual heart, it was essentially the cooperation of all the major powers, through the processes of the United Nations, in the resolution and addressing of a whole series of important foreign policy issues ranging from Angola, Namibia, Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq to Cambodia and the conduct of the Gulf war itself.</PARA>
<PARA> While it may well not be in the Soviet Union's interest to divert from that particular path, in a great many of these things currently running, equally, it simply cannot be assumed that that level of cooperation will continue in the future under the sorts of people that are now-for the moment anyway-back in charge. That is a matter of great concern for us and, of course, the rest of the world. It is that sort of situation that we will be monitoring very closely.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, so far as President Gorbachev is concerned, the Australian Government-and I am sure I speak in this respect for the Australian people as well-is deeply concerned at President Gorbachev's removal. It is an event that does mark an historic watershed not only for the Soviet Union but for the world at large. President Gorbachev, whatever his failings might have proved to be in the conduct of domestic economic policy-and those failings were manifestly considerable in that area-did break the mould of the whole course of post-war world affairs in the Soviet Union and did set the Soviet Union on the path of, we still believe, irreversible, ultimate democratisation. The walls were brought tumbling down in all sorts of ways. The contributions that were made to human rights and a whole variety of other matters of great moment to the international community were immense.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is too early, for all the reasons that I spelt out earlier, to write an obituary for President Gorbachev, but this occasion today should not leave unremarked the immense contribution that he has made to the principles of democracy and freedom around the world.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs to his answer to my question of last week on the need for stricter control of ownership of guns in which the Minister advised that some 75 Australians are murdered each year with firearms. I draw the Minister's attention to the murder and suicide in Sydney over the weekend in which eight persons were killed. What action has the Government taken to bring in national gun laws? Will the Minister use his office to raise the matter of control with a view to having the police Ministers come to a uniform position on gun laws? While the Minister has taken action to stop imports, can he take any action to halt the sale of the weapons already listed as prohibited imports which are still on shelves in some stores?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="657" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Jones both for his question of last week and for this question. In the wake of the very tragic killings at Strathfield Plaza in Sydney, I express on behalf of all senators, I am sure, our deepest sympathy to the families of those victims who were gunned down so mercilessly and to those who survived but who suffer from the trauma of that event.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last week I spoke of the need to change the culture of our Australian society from being so gun-ridden that in some situations of violence where persons become deranged, go berserk or cross a threshold in domestic violence they have access to such an arsenal of weapons that they can get hold of a military assault weapon designed to kill other human beings. Access to those sorts of weapons is something which we need to change in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that earlier this year this Senate gave support to a regulation, which I together with the Minister for Small Business and Customs proposed, to ban the importing into Australia of those semi-automatics which were designed by military forces-principally the Soviet Army, the Red Chinese Army and others-precisely to kill other human beings and which were being imported into Australia in their thousands. That particular regulation received the confirmation of the Senate after some debate in this chamber, and I believe that that was a very important move within the Federal Government's constitutional power.</PARA>
<PARA> I have to report that that was done in spite of the undermining and virtual sabotage of the Police Ministers Council by Mr Ted Pickering, the Minister for Police and Emergency Services in New South Wales, who did everything possible to prevent that particular import regulation from being put into place. So I was pleased, in the wake of the tragedy, to see the Premier of New South Wales yesterday indicate at a press conference the following:</PARA>
<PARA>I've therefore just informed the Minister for Police that I would like him effective today, to ban the sale or resale of those weapons that have been banned from importation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I thought that was a very good move by the Premier in overruling his Police Minister, but within a few hours the Police Minister had clawed back a position so that the regulation he gazetted banned only the sale and resale of Chinese military or military look-alike weapons. I believe that not only was lacking in sense, as had been put so eloquently by his Premier, but also usurped the role of the Premier in this regard. Today I am pleased to say that the Premier has written to the Prime Minister in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Hawke,</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing to you regarding the question of firearms legislation in Australia. The recent tragedy in this State highlights the need for Governments to consider the question of national uniformity so that all military and other weapons banned by your Government from importation into Australia cannot be sold or resold within this country.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to give credit to Mr Greiner for having the political good sense to reaffirm the position he took in his press conference early yesterday-undermined by his Police Minister-in his letter to the Prime Minister. Certainly I on behalf of the Federal Government will cooperate fully.</PARA>
<PARA> It falls to me this year to be Chairman of the Australian Police Ministers Council. I will be consulting with my State and Territory colleagues to bring them together, I hope, well in advance of the Premiers Conference scheduled for November so that we can deliberate and put forward a motion on these matters for consideration and decision by the Premiers. It is quite intolerable that the old colonial boundaries, the territorial disputes, the parochial jealousies and the States rights label should frustrate a nationwide approach to gun control laws throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> We are now in a situation where we can resist that slide into gun-ridden violence which characterises much of United States society. We need to take a stand as a nation. I believe that all Australians believe we should. I am pleased so far with the very real support that emerged from this chamber in regard to the import regulations. I am sure that all honourable senators will support a move to nationwide laws regulating the possession and use of these weapons within the Australian community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to criticism of meetings held twice a year by Federal and State labour Ministers?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports of a statement made by Senator Jocelyn Newman criticising the frequency with which ministerial council meetings have been held during the life of the Hawke Government. I am somewhat surprised that an Opposition frontbencher from a smaller outlying State such as Tasmania would criticise the frequency with which ministerial councils are held for the reason that ministerial councils are meetings between Federal Ministers and the State Ministers with corresponding responsibility at State level. A four-day forum in which States, particularly the smaller States, can have an interchange of ideas and policy with the Commonwealth represents an example of a federation of States, with a Federal government and strong State governments under a Constitution working very carefully and very well together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have thought that there would have been commendation rather than criticism for the frequency with which this Government has used the ministerial council format to make the federation of Australia work more effectively. Because Senator Newman comes from a smaller State, I find that a very odd criticism to make. However, the question relates to a meeting of such a ministerial council in my portfolio on Hamilton Island.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a big back down. Since the Hawke Government was elected in 1983 there have been 17 meetings of the labour Ministers advisory council, an average of two every year. Most of the venues for those meetings have been in Adelaide or Sydney. Darwin has had two of those meetings, Perth has had two, Melbourne, Canberra and Hobart have had meetings, and there have been two meetings in New Zealand. There has been a meeting on Hamilton Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I go to the detail of this meeting on Hamilton Island, I should say-and I should say this very carefully because Senator Newman may wish to know it-that the tradition at these meetings is that the State government nominates the venue and, as the hosting government, makes the arrangements for the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> The meeting on Hamilton Island was held on 13 May 1988 at the request of the then Queensland Government, which was the then National Party Government of Queensland. If there is a criticism of where this meeting was held it should therefore be directed to the now defeated National Party Government in Queensland. Senator Newman may well wish to query National Party senators from Queensland to see whether they can use any influence to cough up an apology from the now deposed Queensland Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services to a report on peak community bodies entitled You Have Your Moments, released by the Department earlier this year, which proposed a three-tier funding structure for such organisations. I ask the Minister: firstly, have the organisations mentioned in the report been officially or unofficially advised of which category they will come under for funding purposes and, if not, when does the Minister propose to advise them? Secondly, will the proposed categorisations result in current funding levels to any of these organisations being reduced and, if so, which organisations will be affected?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services has provided me with some notes for an answer, Senator Lees having given notice late last week of her area of interest. With regard to the first part of the question, in July last year the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services referred the matter of the funding of national secretariats by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services to the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular, he requested that the Committee consult and report on the future policy parameters which might be used as a guideline for the funding of national secretariats of peak health and community organisations by the Government through the Department. The recommendations adopted from the report came from a bipartisan committee. All organisations mentioned in the report have been unofficially advised of the category they will come under for funding purposes. Letters of official notification will be dispatched by the end of August 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the second part of the question, the proposed categorisations will result in current funding levels to a number of organisations being reduced, but only from 1 July 1992, and then only if the organisations are unable to attract additional funding by way of project grants. The organisations to be affected are as follows: the Consumers Health Forum; the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of the Disabled; the Australian Community Health Association; the Family Planning Federation of Australia; the Australian National Association for Mental Health; the Australian Council of Alcohol and Other Drug Associations; the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations; National Lifeline; GROW; the Haemophilia Foundation of Australia; the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care; Student Initiatives in Community Health; and Natural Family Planning-Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that those funding reductions will apply only from 1 July 1992, and then only if the organisations are unable to attract additional funding by way of project grants. When finalised, a list of categories for each organisation will be made available. At present only 24 organisations are funded through the Health, Housing and Community Services portfolio for ongoing secretariat funding, although other interested organisations made submissions to the review.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Maguire has always taken an interest in the automotive industry, particularly in Adelaide. The Mitsubishi announcement about export of a wagon to the United States is not surprising news to me but is nonetheless encouraging. The automotive industry is suffering very much at the moment from the recession and the lack of demand for motor vehicles. I make the point that, since 1984, the Government has been working towards a restructuring of the automotive industry. I think that there has been a very good response to that by management, the unions and the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The export of the Magna wagon to which Senator Maguire referred is another move towards the integration of the Australian car manufacturers into the international strategies of their parent companies. By that I mean that the Australian industry is no longer focused on a small domestic market. Mitsubishi is developing, in Adelaide, a left-hand drive Magna wagon for export. Its engineering team has been working on that for some time. Mitsubishi, however, is only the latest of the Australian car manufacturers to get into export markets. Mitsubishi already exports cars, aluminium cylinder heads, pressed panels and other components. Toyota is to build a state-of-the-art plant at Altona in Melbourne to produce 100,000 cars a year, many of them for export. Ford is tackling the problems it has encountered in building the United States market for its Capri vehicle. Nissan is exporting the Pintara--</PARA>

I just want to make the point that all this has happened since the introduction of the Government's motor industry plan in 1984.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine is right in identifying those four elements as the formal criteria for the recognition of statehood-that is, permanent population, defined territory, government and a capacity to enter into relations with other states. However, Senator Harradine needs to appreciate that those elements have in international law and practice been a little more refined to bring out their actual implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we talk in terms of a government, accordingly, we do not talk just in terms of whether there is somebody elected or otherwise that seems to be exercising some authority within the territory in question but we look at whether that government is in effective control of that territory. When we talk in terms of a capacity to enter into relations with other states, we have regard not only to whether it is perceived as it stands by other states as an international entity capable of entering into such relations but also to whether in practice it is so able to exercise that degree of substantive independence in the conduct of all its relations that it ought genuinely to be regarded as a state.</PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty and the problem with the Baltic states and Croatia-the situation may be a little more ambiguous with Slovenia in Yugoslavia-is that they are manifestly not in control of their own territory. The ability of the military of the parent state to exercise its will, its authority, is all too unhappily still evident. That is the reason why the international community, including Australia, has been slow to react to the requests that have been received for formal recognition.</PARA>
<PARA> We all understand the utility of a formal recognition of statehood-not least in Yugoslavia in so far as it would instantly, in a sense, internationalise a conflict that can otherwise be characterised as being purely internal. We all understand the moral force of the argument where there has been an expression of democratic will from the entity in question. We have seen that now from all of the entities in question. We certainly understand the moral force of the argument so far as the Baltic states are concerned, given the history of those states and the takeover by the Soviet Union in the early 1940s.</PARA>
<PARA> But it is a matter of adopting some consistency in the way in which one deals with these situations; otherwise one gets caught up in the most terrible conundrums in dealing with secessionist movements or splits of one kind or another in states all around the world. Particularly in the current era when ethnic and nationality identification is becoming such a widespread phenomenon in international life, we can expect to find many more such examples of these sorts of issues. It is crucial under those circumstances-and I hope Senator Harradine will appreciate this-for us to maintain as much consistency as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> All that said, we are closely monitoring the situation in all of these different areas. We are having regard to the way in which other members of the international community-in particular those more immediately closely geographically concerned in Europe-are reacting. We hope that it will be possible, sooner rather than later, to take this process a step or two further than we have found possible so far.</PARA>

The Minister, in his response to Senator Hill's question about the Soviet Union and the new leader of the Soviet Union, said that the Government does not recognise governments; it recognises states. Under those circumstances, the Minister's response to my question was not consistent. Why does the Government not declare that, in its view, under international law the Baltic states have achieved statehood and Croatia and Slovenia have achieved statehood? Are we to assume from the Minister's answer that this question is to be determined by the power arising out of the barrel of a gun?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have given a very full explanation of the criteria we apply in determining whether or not to recognise a particular entity as a state. It is essentially based on objective criteria and analysis of the kind I have described. We no longer apply the notion of recognition or derecognition of governments because, to be frank, there never was any firm objective foundation on which that recognition issue was applied or not applied. It was a matter of wholly subjective government and an expression of moral reaction, if you like, more than any reaction to the objective situation on the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I said that we no longer recognise governments but we recognise states, I was not in any sense meaning to imply that we have picked up all the kinds of value judgments that we used to apply to the question of recognition of governments and brought them straight over into the recognition of states so that if we like a particular entity or the people running it we will henceforth give them recognition; if we do not like them we will not. That is not the principle we are operating under at all. We are operating under the principles that I have described.</PARA>
<PARA> That does not mean that we are reduced to impotence if we do not like what a particular government in charge of, or assuming power within, a particular state is doing. We can express negative reactions in all sorts of ways. We can join with the international community in doing that and there are various other forms of sanctions that can be applied in appropriate circumstances. But it is a very different issue from the one of recognition of statehood and I hope that that will be appreciated.</PARA>

Will the Minister advise the Senate how he is able to reconcile his self-congratulatory remarks with the following international terminal performance indicators compiled by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority: in the March quarter 1991, simple average crane loading rates in main Australian ports were below loading rates for the corresponding foreign ports by 21 per cent in the East Asia-Australia trade; 24 per cent in the Europe-Australia trade; 54 per cent in the Japan-Australia trade; and 95 per cent in the US-Australia trade? I further invite the Minister to explain why, if the reform program is being implemented so successfully, figures from the same source show that, between the September quarter 1989 and the March quarter 1991, simple average crane loading rates in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne on the Japan-Australia and the US-Australia trades actually declined.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The very purpose for which the Government is preparing these performance indicators, at my direction to WIRA to do so, is so that people will have an opportunity to examine these comparisons. There was nothing at all self-congratulatory about the statement I made in the Senate last week; quite the reverse. In fact, I am often taken to task for being a little too pessimistic in terms of my public statements because I continually assert-and I do so again today-that the Government is not satisfied with the pace of waterfront reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statement last week was meant to advise the Senate of the position factually. One always runs this risk with an Opposition that is determined to oppose whatever happens, particularly if it happens to be productivity arrangements made by agreement with rather than coercion of the trade union movement. The difficulty is that the Opposition's major benchmark in terms of progress on the waterfront is to be measured in the amount of union blood that is spilt in the process, which I personally think is a silly measure.</PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that, unfortunately, because of the difficulties associated with the national wage case, the reform process was effectively derailed for a number of months. Last week, I simply indicated the factual position, that is, that since this Parliament last sat and since the national wage case matter was resolved satisfactorily for the unions, the employers and the Industrial Relations Commission, there has been an acceleration of the pace of waterfront reform. We expect that somewhere between 1,100 and 1,200 employees will have left the industry by the end of this month and that the lost time will be made up. All parties are committed to that.</PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, it is to precisely the situation to which Senator Archer referred and which has not yet been completely addressed by the Government-and we do not expect it to be fully addressed until the end of the reform period-that the whole reform process is directed. The sustainable improvement in productivity that this Government is seeking will be reached only by a process of agreement, rather than putting troops on the docks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 May this year I announced that the Government had appointed a committee of senior public servants-in fact, secretaries of various departments. The Departments are the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance, the Department of Social Security, the Department of Administrative Services, the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Public Service Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The secretaries of all of those departments, and the chief executives in the case of the ATO and the PSC, were appointed to a committee to examine how productivity bargaining can be introduced into the Australian Public Service; how we properly measure productivity for the purpose of working out what it is that is being bargained over; and whether or not it should be bargained, if it is proceeded with, on the basis of across the whole of the Public Service or on an agency by agency basis. The implication is that if agencies can create productivity efficiencies in their own right they may well be able to negotiate a wage outcome based on those achieved productivity outcomes-that is, specific to the agency rather than pooled and averaged across the whole of the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA> This is quite an important refocusing-as the question proposes-of wages policy in the Australian Public Service. It is aimed at making the Australian Public Service a more productive service. It is aimed at allowing wage increases to be linked to the generation of greater productivity so that people can move ahead of the ordinary wages round if they can be more productive in their employment in a way in which there are advantages to the Australian taxpayer and the Government in terms of the quality of the service provided and the cost of that service.</PARA>
<PARA> That committee is to report at the end of this month. There will then be a period for public commentary on the report so members of the public will have a chance to express their views. Anyone who wishes to do so should express that view to me. I will then prepare Cabinet recommendations on the basis of them. When we launched this study group by departmental secretaries, it was also considered that we should have an outside-of-the-Public-Service view on the best way to pursue productivity bargaining.

<PARA> These reports are based on no substantive evidence at all. This is a small but very important scheme that assists some of the most isolated Australians we have living largely on pastoral properties by subsidising the cost of providing them with mail and with the supply of perishable goods.

One of the options that have been canvassed by the independent consultant whom we appointed to have a look at it, Dr Rolf Gerritsen, was the prospect of transferring this scheme to the States. The purpose of that is very simple. In terms of administrative efficiency, this is a scheme designed for isolated people within a State that is provided entirely by intrastate air operators in the Territory and, indeed, in Queensland-small companies and charter companies.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a legitimate concern that this can be administered far more efficiently at State level than it can from a centralised point in Canberra. Senator O'Chee is wrong in asserting that the review report did not canvass the need for the Federal Government to make funding arrangements available for this scheme. In fact, he will find the specific reference to these funding arrangements on page 47 of the report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1991-92. It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the Budget proposals of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Budget comes after a year in which the Australian economy fell into a recession following seven years of strong economic and employment growth. It was a disappointing year for all Australians; a year of lost jobs, squeezed profits and dashed hopes. </PARA>
<PARA> But we could not continue to spend more than we produce without imports being far too high and bringing on an acute current account crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> We were living beyond our means. We could not continue to do that without facing dire consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> A slowing of the economy to more sustainable rates of growth had become a necessity. Managing that transition, however, is a difficult and delicate task at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of factors accentuated these difficulties over the past year or so. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an unprecedented and unsustainable boom in asset prices in the second half of the 1980s. Its subsequent unwinding pulled the rug out from many speculative investments and business ventures. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure of some financial institutions heightened the loss of confidence amongst investors and consumers, further contracting the level of demand. </PARA>
<PARA> Added to that, a tighter monetary policy was operating for the first time in a deregulated environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Exacerbating these influences, the decline in our terms of trade through falling commodity prices severely hurt the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The objective of stepping down to lower growth but stopping short of recession was not achieved. The Government takes no satisfaction from that. </PARA>
<PARA> It will give no comfort to those Australians adversely affected by this recession, but we should recognise that several other major countries had a similar experience. In particular, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have also been in recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, that added to our difficulties by reducing the demand for our exports, especially commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> The signs are still tentative-and may remain so for a little time yet-but the Australian economy is set for recovery in 1991-92. The recovery will be slow. </PARA>
<PARA> The task we face is to ensure that the recovery proceeds at a sustainable pace and that we lock in the economic gains of the past year. These gains relate particularly to the current account and the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year saw substantial improvement in our current account, not just through reduced imports but also through stronger export growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The contribution of net exports to growth in 1990-91 was the highest in three decades. This achievement was all the more remarkable in the face of the difficult conditions in our major export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The current account deficit declined from almost 6% of GDP two years ago to 4% last year. And it will fall again this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation has also been very substantially reduced. Over the last year, inflation fell to 3.4% compared with 7.7% during the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a major gain. For the first time in decades, our inflation rate is clearly below that of our major trading partners. This improves our level of international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not let these important achievements slip away. </PARA>
<PARA> What is now required is a rate of recovery that consolidates this progress and secures a return to sustained employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day, what counts for investor and business confidence, investment and a larger traded goods sector, and thereby increased employment, is getting the fundamentals right. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget has been formulated with that objective foremost in mind. </PARA>
<PARA>BUDGET OUTCOME</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Budget this year will be in deficit for the first time in five years. </PARA>
<PARA> By allowing the Budget to swing into deficit, the Government has provided a substantial cushion-about $13 billion over two years-to counter the impact of the downturn. This stimulus will contribute to the recovery in the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, we have maintained the underlying integrity of the Budget. Since last year's Budget, all new expenditure decisions by the Government have been paid for by savings in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the economic downturn, outlays are expected to rise and revenues fall in real terms. The net result of these changes is that the Budget deficit this year is estimated to be about $4.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> As a share of the economy, outlays will be slightly higher than last year, but this increase is more than accounted for by the increase in outlays associated with the slowdown in economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Revenue will be at the lowest level as a share of GDP since the late 1970s. This reflects both the full year effects of the tax cuts made last year, and the impact of the economic slowdown. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>OUTLAYS</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I now turn to outlays. </PARA>
<PARA>FAMILIES INCOME PACKAGE</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the Family Allowance Supplement by Labor in 1987 provided the basis for targeted income support to families. Today, Mr President, I am announcing that this Labor Government is building on that work. </PARA>
<PARA> A major families package will provide additional assistance to low and medium income families with children, and target Family Allowances more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> From April 1992, the income test for the receipt of maximum benefits under the Family Allowance Supplement will be increased from $18,000 to $19,300. This will raise the income threshold for the maximum benefit to align it with the indexed AUSTUDY threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> This change means that a family earning $20,000 per year with two children will be eligible for family assistance payments of up to $97 per week free of tax, an increase of up to $12.50 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> To encourage eligible families to apply for the Family Allowance Supplement, the administrative arrangements for the payment of income support will be simplified. </PARA>
<PARA> From January 1993, existing income support schemes for the care of children will be combined into a single payment payable to the principal carer. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will improve the arrangements covering the current structure of family assistance payments. </PARA>
<PARA> From January 1992, the Government will introduce an assets test for the Family Allowance at $600,000 of net assets excluding the family home. </PARA>
<PARA> For the next two years, families with very low incomes but assets above the threshold will be able to retain the Family Allowance as long as they meet a liquid funds test. </PARA>
<PARA> The assets test for the Family Allowance Supplement will also be relaxed from January 1992 for the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA> Low income families with assets above the current level of $347,500 but below $600,000 will become eligible for the Family Allowance Supplement provided they meet the liquid funds test. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures address, for the first time, the particular problems faced by income poor but asset rich business people, especially farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> Statements detailing these and other measures are being released by the Ministers for Social Security and for Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA>MEDICARE</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Budget also contains significant reforms to Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare is a fair health system-it guarantees medical services to people who need them. </PARA>
<PARA> However every 20 years the number of medical services used per person in Australia doubles. That was happening before Medicare, and is still happening. If that continues, all Australians will have to pay more for health care. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is therefore reforming Medicare to change benefit arrangements to slow the growth in the use of medical services and to assist the medical profession to lift the quality of care available from General Practitioners. Subject to safeguards, the Medicare benefit for visits to a GP will be reduced by $3.50 from November 1991. Doctors who direct bill Medicare will be able, if they wish, to recoup this sum from their patients. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, this Medicare benefit will be reduced by a further $1.50 from November 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> The following safeguards will ensure that those most in need retain access to free health care. </PARA>
<PARA> First, holders of various concession cards-that is, pensioners, veterans, low income earners and usually their dependants-will continue to have access to GP services at no cost provided their GP chooses to direct bill. A total of 4.5 million Australians, mostly low income people, will be protected in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, heavy users of GP services-families in particular-will gain extra protection. From next January, the existing safety net which applies to individuals will become a family based safety net with a threshold of $246 per year. Thus, for a family of two adults and two children, the threshold will be reduced from $984 to $246. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will undertake discussions with the medical profession on a range of issues concerning General Practice, including funding mechanisms and doctor supply. </PARA>
<PARA> Further changes are also being undertaken in diagnostic services to contain rapidly growing costs. These changes reflect agreements reached with relevant pathology and radiology professional bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> In time, these reforms will save almost a billion dollars a year. </PARA>
<PARA>BETTER CITIES</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the cities of the nation have to change. </PARA>
<PARA> And they have to change if Australians are to be provided with better access to facilities and services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Prime Minister will announce details of a program aimed at creating better cities. The program is the first step in building a new partnership between Federal, State and Local Governments so that our cities and the quality of life of the people who live in them can be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth funding for this program will be more than $800 million over a five year period. $56 million will be allocated by this Labor Government during 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>EDUCATION AND TRAINING</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, better training and education provides the basis for more meaningful jobs and a richer community life. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has increased the number of higher education places from around 250,000 in 1983 to 350,000 in 1991. There will be further increases in 1992 additional to the 13,000 already approved for 1992 in the current three year arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Another $57 million will be provided for capital funding of higher education in the next two financial years. There will also be increased research funding. </PARA>
<PARA> These decisions are in addition to the cost of the recent increase in academic salaries, over $120 million this year. </PARA>
<PARA> To help pay for these items, the Higher Education Contribution will be increased by $144 on top of normal indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> A package of improvements to student financial assistance schemes is being announced by the relevant Ministers. This includes an increase in the personal income test threshold and a further extension of eligibility to students who undertake accredited TAFE-type courses. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, spending on training and labour market programs will increase by $260 million this year, an increase of nearly 50%. Increased training and work experience for the long-term unemployed through the JOBSKILLS program and additional funding for Technical and Further Education will also be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> An enhanced literacy training package will be detailed by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA>NATIONAL RAIL CORPORATION</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, as announced at the July Special Premiers' Conference, governments agreed to the establishment of a National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victorian and Western Australian Governments will provide equity for the Corporation. This is expected to exceed $400 million during the next six years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation will operate commercially in line with the best established practice overseas. This reform will secure an efficient interstate rail freight system. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, the Corporation will substantially reduce the losses now crippling the Australian rail system. It is expected to break even within three years and become totally self-supporting after five. </PARA>
<PARA>ENVIRONMENT</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Government's strong commitment to the environment is reinforced in this Budget by an increase in spending of almost 30% to $143 million. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that both the natural environment and the urban environment are important to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> We are meeting our commitment to establish a Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency this year at a cost of over $8 million. </PARA>
<PARA> We have decided to double funding to the Endangered Species Program to $5 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia shares responsibility with other nations for the global environment. The Government will nearly double international environmental assistance to $20 million, including making our contribution to the Global Environment Facility managed by the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER PEOPLES</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, another area of concern to all Australians is the disadvantage that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples experience. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reconciliation Process is the backdrop to the Government's programs to redress that disadvantage in the coming decade. As part of the Reconciliation Process, $2.6 million is being provided as an interim response to the Report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The Government will join with State and Territory Governments in announcing a comprehensive response in March 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, over $3 million will be provided for the operation of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Aboriginal Health Strategy will be fully funded when agreements between the Commonwealth and the States are in place. $7 million of further funding is included in the Budget for this purpose for Aboriginal Medical Services as part of the Strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> To help fight unacceptably high Aboriginal unemployment, Community Development Employment Projects will be further expanded. Under this program, Aboriginal people voluntarily forgo their entitlement to certain social security payments to work on community improvement and development projects. </PARA>
<PARA>REVENUE</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I now turn to the revenue side of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is continuing to improve the fairness of Australia's tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, some taxpayers who use tax agents are able to delay significantly their tax payments. To stop this, measures will be taken to minimise payment delays. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Tax Office will more effectively use information supplied on employment declaration forms to improve compliance with tax obligations by both employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together, these changes will increase revenue by $350 million in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> To align better the tax on fringe benefits with taxes on salaries, the Fringe Benefits Tax rate is to increase from April 1992 by 1 1/4%, the equivalent of the Medicare levy rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is announcing today broad features of new tax arrangements, to be introduced next year, to remove advantages that some Australian residents obtain through investments in foreign investment funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is also releasing further detailed information about the new self assessment arrangements for taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>SUPERANNUATION AND RETIREMENT INCOME</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Government's retirement incomes policy aims to ensure that all Australians have a secure income in retirement. Superannuation is a vital part of that policy and has been an important policy issue throughout the life of this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past eight years, major progress has been made in extending the superannuation system in Australia. In 1986, 3% superannuation was awarded by the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as part of a productivity and wage package. This award requirement has not been complied with in full. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will therefore introduce a superannuation guarantee levy, starting from July next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will legislate for a prescribed level of superannuation support to be provided by employers to all of their employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers failing to meet this level will be subject to a superannuation levy which will not be deductible for income tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> To ease the transition for small businesses, the initial level of prescribed support will be 5% of ordinary time earnings for employees of employers whose annual payrolls exceed $500,000; and 3% for other employees. </PARA>
<PARA> This level will be increased gradually over time. By the year 2000, the prescribed level of employer support will be 9% of earnings. Consideration will also be given to supplementing this level of support with employee contributions and tax cuts equivalent to 3% of earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Improvements in superannuation will be taken into account in future Accord negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> This new superannuation guarantee levy will underpin the Government's retirement incomes policy. Superannuation will be extended to many Australians for the first time. In addition, an efficient mechanism for the orderly increase in the level of superannuation support over time will be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer shall invite representatives of the ACTU, major employer groups and the superannuation industry to a meeting in September to discuss the implementation of this measure and its implications for the structure of superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with our support for superannuation, the Government intends to ensure that an adequate prudential framework applies to the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is, therefore, releasing today a statement of the Government's policy on prudential supervision of the superannuation industry. As well, there will be additional information disclosure requirements for superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA>WAGES POLICY</PARA>
<PARA> Sustainable employment growth during the recovery will require continued moderate growth in wages and salaries, and in overall labour costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The responsibility of unionised workers and the integrity of the Accord process through the 1980s were, tragically, not matched by the behaviour of others in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now recognised that wage outcomes must be more directly linked to improvements in labour productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, the Government, the ACTU and the major employer bodies are all committed to achieving more devolved wage fixation arrangements. All parties are agreed on the need for a more flexible and more decentralised wages system. This is fundamental to improving our productivity performance in this decade and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> The next step involves the forthcoming Australian Industrial Relations Commission review of wage principles and the further development of the most appropriate framework to guide the new wage fixation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>STRUCTURAL REFORM</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in March of this year the Government acted to change, for the better, Australia's tariff regime and industry policy. As we progressively expose our traded goods industries to international competition, we must also lift the efficiency of the service industries they rely on to world standards.</PARA>
<PARA> In July the Government achieved agreement with the States on the mutual recognition of regulations and standards, on roads, on rail, on electricity and on government trading enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to further reform. The Treasurer is therefore announcing today details of the Industry Commission forward work program. Future references will cover public infrastructure, manufacturing and primary industry policy, government programs and regional policy. </PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC PROSPECTS</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, looking back over the past year we have witnessed an historic break in inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia now has the opportunity to consolidate its position in the ranks of low inflation countries. The Government is determined to lock in the progress on inflation as a basis for sustainable growth in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking ahead, economic activity is expected to improve during the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA> The world economic outlook is improving but only slowly. </PARA>
<PARA> Our task now is to ensure that demand grows less quickly than output so that our current account continues to improve and inflation remains low. </PARA>
<PARA> Output is expected to grow by 1 1/2% in 1991-92-and by around 3 3/4% over the year. </PARA>
<PARA> The main expansionary forces in the economy will be a recovery in the housing sector, a gradual pick-up in consumer spending, and changes in stock levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Exports will also continue to make an important contribution to growth, as they have done for the past two years. The volume of exports is expected to grow by around 5 1/4% in 1991-92, while imports are expected to decline by around 1 1/4%. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, our trade in goods and services will move into surplus for the first time in a decade. Further gains will therefore be made in reducing the current account deficit as a proportion of GDP-almost halving it over two years. This brings the welcome prospect that we will begin to stabilise our external debt as a proportion of GDP this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation is expected to slow further to 3% in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> The recovery can be expected to contribute to a gradual lift in employment, and a slow fall in unemployment, as the economy gathers strength in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, there are early signs that an economic recovery is on the way. In recent years, both in Australia and overseas, one common mistake in economic policy has been to fail to see that a recession has passed. </PARA>
<PARA> Too often, governments have delivered a stimulus to the economy at just the wrong time-just as the economy was on the mend. </PARA>
<PARA> Growing employment as the pick-up proceeds is what we all want. To achieve this, successful industry reform needs to be integrated with the steady management of macroeconomic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> But it will always be a challenge to ride out the cycles in economic activity. It is safe to predict that the 1990s will be no different in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> As a relatively small and open trading nation dependent on commodity exports, we will always have to manage the effects of changing international economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> But we must organise ourselves to benefit from the upswings in world activity-and to respond to the inevitable downswings in a way that minimises the disruption to the Australian economy. With this in mind, this Budget affirms the Government's intention to continue to pursue sustainable longer-term policies. </PARA>
<PARA> This speech has not just been about economic policy. Government and economic management is not some remote clinical exercise. Not every political problem can be reduced to some soluble economic problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Government is about people. This Budget is about people. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporate and other excesses of the 1980s are behind us. Partly because of those excesses, the transition to sustainable growth and employment is going to be painful and longer than any of us want. </PARA>
<PARA> But we now have a firm base for sustainable growth in the period ahead. Our competitiveness has improved, our current account deficit is falling, and the gains on the inflation front will create a sound climate for investor confidence in the coming recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge is to build on this base. The Government is committed to leading Australia through this period, relying as we always do on the strength, resilience and commonsense of the Australian people. </PARA>

In Question Time today Senator Collins claimed that I had said that the remote air subsidy scheme was going to be cut and that the Government planned to cut it. Senator Collins knows that this is not the truth and that I made no statement to that effect. My statement concerning the remote air subsidy scheme was that the Government had before it a proposal to cut or scrap the scheme. There is a considerable difference between a statement that the Government had a proposal before it and a statement that the Government intended to cut the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> By leaving out this particular material fact, Senator Collins compounded the misrepresentation which he made of me today.

<PARA>THE FIRST 20 YEARS 1970-1990</PARA>
<PARA>THE SENATE LEGISLATIVE AND GENERAL PURPOSE STANDING COMMITTEES</PARA>
<PARA> The report I have tabled puts into the one document a comprehensive account of the activities of the Senate's Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees over the period 1970 to 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> Since their establishment in 1970, the standing committees have produced over 300 reports covering almost every issue of significance to Australian public policy and administration. The document contains a description of the work and details the membership of the standing committees and lists all of the reports tabled by each committee. It will complement the Register of Committee Reports tabled in April 1991 which was designed to help researchers and others to access the rich source of information about public affairs in Australia that is contained in committee reports.</PARA>
<PARA> The work of each committee is described in a thematic way to enable researchers and watchers of the Parliament to access and evaluate the contributions made by various committees over the years.</PARA>
<PARA> On reading this report, it will be apparent that each committee has been able to achieve a balanced approach to the particular areas of interest that have been covered by it. This is a credit to the members of the committees who over the years have been prepared to pursue the issues of the day in a constructive and open manner.</PARA>
<PARA> This has been one of the important reasons for the success of many committee inquiries. Another reason has been the willingness and ability of standing committees to travel around Australia in the course of their inquiries and take public evidence from a wide range of individuals and organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> The committees can now be said to be truly ``legislative and general purpose committees'', since, in May 1990, new procedures came into operation which have enabled more bills to be referred to standing committees for detailed consideration. Committees are now much more involved in legislative as well as general purpose inquiries as was envisaged by our predecessors over 20 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA> After 20 years of operation the Senate standing committees continue to stand ready to act on behalf of the Senate to take Parliament to the people, obtain their views, and thereby help shape public policy and government decision making. This process can only help to maintain and enhance the quality of Australian parliamentary democracy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now debating the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. In effect, it amends four Acts covering superannuation for Commonwealth sector employees, namely, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990, the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990 and the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988. The changes being made in this Bill do not represent any major new contributions for the reform of Commonwealth superannuation; rather, as the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) said in his second reading speech, the Bill proposes some changes to bring the 1976 Commonwealth superannuation scheme into line with the occupational superannuation standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill proposes some changes to streamline administration of the Acts and the schemes; removes some anomalies in the benefit provisions of the current legislation, thereby providing greater equity between members; and makes some drafting amendments to clarify the intention of the existing legislation. Most of the amendments are technical in nature. Most of them relate to the 1976 Commonwealth scheme, although, as I said, four separate Acts are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the establishment of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, three superannuation schemes have been introduced for Federal public servants. The first scheme, introduced in 1922, is called the 1922 superannuation scheme. The scheme under the Superannuation Act 1976 is called the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, the CSS, and the scheme under the Superannuation Act 1990 which was legislated in this place last year is called the public sector superannuation scheme, the PSS. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, of course, relates just to superannuation provisions applying to Commonwealth public servants. As I said, because the matters are essentially technical in nature and minor, I do not propose to go into details. I understand that my colleague Senator Watson, who is following me in this debate, will be taking up certain issues that are particularly relevant to those schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the circumstances of the day, I will not detain the Senate very long in the debate on this Bill, other than to point out that we have just listened to a Budget presented by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) which, quite frankly, one could only describe as pathetic. It is a Budget which has nothing at all of hope in it for the Australian economy and nothing at all of hope in it for the million plus people in this country who are now on the scrap heap of unemployment. They have been looking for some hope, some guidance and some specific policy direction in this Budget to lead this nation out of this deep and protracted recession. It is the longest recession since the 1930 recession and the deepest recession that we have had in the past 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The relevance of the Budget that we have just heard to this present Bill is that one of the proposals in the Budget is the creation of a new compulsory levy. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague says, a non-deductible levy to apply to employers who-regardless of their circumstances-do not meet the Government's fiat that there be a 5 per cent employer contribution for all superannuation schemes in the future. Far from encouraging work force growth -that is what people in this country want-this proposal within this Budget is designed, particularly through the superannuation provision, to put more and more people onto the scrap heap of unemployment and lost opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government will stand indicted on that matter for living memory. The loss of dignity and job security that this Government has wrought on the work force of Australia is the greatest possible indictment that one could make of any government. All businesses, but particularly small business, will be devastated by this Budget decision on superannuation. The decision defies economic logic: there is nothing in it which links the requirement for employers to pay this employer contribution to, if you like, increased production or productivity. It is just an additional cost on top of the already crippling cost burden that employers face. </PARA>
<PARA> The small business sector, in particular, has witnessed record growth in the level of bankruptcies in the past 12 months-and that has been a major contributor to the million plus people who are unemployed. That will continue to impact on the small business sector, firstly, because of a deal that was done behind closed doors between Bill Kelty of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the discredited former Treasurer, Paul Keating, and, latterly, because of the screws put on him last week by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It has nothing at all to do with providing the things that employees in this country want: job growth and job security. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, extended coverage of superannuation is a very desirable objective. I think that that is an objective that all parties in this place share. But to try to force it on a work force and on the providers of work, employers, at a time of extreme recession is, in my view-and, obviously, in the view of the business community and most thinking people in this country-just sheer lunacy. To use the words of our colleague on the other side of the chamber, Senator Walsh, anyone who would perpetrate this on the Australian community at this time must be either a fool or a fraud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, the Senate is debating the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. This Bill, which is occasionally affectionately referred to as the SLAB Bill, is the annual omnibus Bill which amends the various pieces of legislation which collectively regulate the superannuation of the non-military employees of the Commonwealth public sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subject of public sector superannuation is not widely regarded as particularly scintillating, largely because the situations are so complex and often obscure. Yet, to the generally small number of people affected by the so-called technical amendments with which this Bill is replete, the issues are important because they directly affect their standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of superannuation schemes are operated by the Commonwealth. The Superannuation Act 1990 and regulations provide a comprehensive occupational superannuation scheme for Commonwealth Government employees, statutory officers and employees of statutory authorities to which the Act and regulations apply. This is known as the public sector scheme, or PSS. The former scheme-known as the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, or CSS-is regulated by the Superannuation Act 1976, is the largest of the Commonwealth schemes and is now closed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Superannuation Act 1922 provides the continuing authority for the payment of pensions to, or in respect of, persons who were pensioners on 30 June 1976 and also some others with deferred benefit entitlements. This is referred to in this legislation as the superseded Act. There are also separate superannuation arrangements in respect of some former expatriate employees in Papua New Guinea, politicians, judges and the Governor-General, as well as a variety of arrangements which apply to members of the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The administration of these numerous arrangements is shared between the Minister for Finance and part of the Department of Finance; the Commissioner for Superannuation, who is the head of the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office; the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority; and the various boards of trustees attached to each scheme. The funds' management function is undertaken by Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, although its statutory monopoly in this regard will terminate in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the Senate today proposes 80 distinct amendments. Clearly, and perhaps fortunately, we do not have the time to consider each one separately-and I thank the departmental officers who provided a patient briefing to a member of my staff on all the issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The pieces of legislation to be amended are the superannuation Acts of 1976 and 1990, the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990 and the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The main proposed amendments to the 1976 Act include transferring the leave without pay and preservation functions from the Minister to the Commonwealth Superannuation Board established under the Act; extending the powers of the Commissioner for Superannuation to allocate reversionary benefits; allowing persons who have not retired from the work force to postpone payment of age retirement benefits; extending the arrangements for persons transferring to a scheme run by their employer to include deferred benefits; ceasing the issue of benefit classification certificates so that members can make their choice between staying in the CSS scheme or transferring to the PSS scheme with some certainty as to their benefits, provided that no false information has been given by fund members; removing the potential for the double payment of benefits; allowing the board of trustees to decide the appropriate treatment of the tax liability which arises in respect of certain taxable contributions; and ceasing, from 1 July 2000, payment of lump sum benefits to those who have retired involuntarily whilst aged under 55. The duration of time between the passage of this legislation and its commencement is almost nine years. This is apparently considered to be the most politically prudent date from which to alter these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1990 Act is to be amended in a variety of ways, including clarifying that certain former employees with entitlements under the 1976 scheme must rejoin the 1976 scheme before being able to exercise an option to transfer to the 1990 scheme; and providing financial and other arrangements under which members may transfer to separate schemes established by their employers. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard I wish to raise the question of the rights of the employees of government business enterprises which are to be privatised. I have received representations from an employee of Australian Airlines and would like to quote from that letter as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The recent Australian Airlines privatisation debate completely ignored the issue of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme entitlements accorded to the large number of CSS members within the airline. I joined the airline under conditions that included the promise of CSS entitlement and an indexed pension at retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>Generally, the Government has been scrupulous in protecting the rights of existing members to their own funds and, in general, superannuation arrangements in the community. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is right. Fund members are given the option of continuing with the status quo or electing to join a scheme with differing conditions applying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, it does not appear that the CSS members who are Australian Airline employees-and the letter estimates the number to be between 500 and 600-will be allowed to remain in the scheme, in contrast with other public sector employees. This is in spite of the fact that many have been contributors for over 20 years. Irrespective of the arguments relating to the privatisation of the airline, there is a genuine need to treat the employees in an equitable manner. Therefore, I ask Senator McMullan to inform the Senate of the arrangements which are to apply to these employees, who are currently unsure of their future entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the future privatisation program of the Government and the total privatisation program of the coalition, it seems very important to the Australian Democrats that the Government set a fair and equitable precedent for existing fund members. The Housing Loan Insurance Corporation is the most recent privatisation precedent and that is, without question, a total disaster. It may even have to be aborted due to the poor rating of the purchaser. I will be discussing the debacle surrounding that privatisation at a future date. But now I go back to the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The third piece of legislation to be amended is the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990. A Commonwealth agency cannot establish a superannuation scheme without the approval of the Minister. This Act allows the Minister to determine guidelines, which are disallowable instruments, for the provision of superannuation benefits to persons employed by certain Commonwealth bodies. Compliance with these guidelines entitles the agency to establish a scheme and any departure from the guidelines must also be approved by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment in the Bill is to ensure that any amendments to multi-employer guideline determinations need not be reissued to an employer who is not affected by these changes. We do not oppose this change, as it should save both time and money by restricting the provision of information to those to whom it is relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> The other piece of legislation being addressed in this so-called SLAB Bill is the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988, which provides superannuation benefits for Commonwealth employees not covered by other arrangements. The Bill proposes amendments to the Act to provide that where a person covered by the Act joins the 1990 scheme, that is, the PSS scheme, the employer is to pay the benefit and any interest to the PSS scheme. This is a technical amendment only and is not opposed by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other measures which I would like to raise at this point are the subjects of Democrats amendments to be moved in the committee stage of debate. The first is a fairly contentious matter, I expect. It concerns the rights of members of the 1976 and 1990 schemes. Currently, on the death of a fund member, certain reversionary benefits become payable to a spouse or other dependants. We believe the current definition of `spouse' is discriminatory against homosexual people living in bone fide de facto relationships. These fund members pay exactly the same contributions as heterosexual members, yet the homosexual members are not entitled to reversionary benefits in respect of their partners. Accordingly, I will circulate a series of amendments to the 1976 and 1990 superannuation Acts which propose to treat de facto homosexual couples identically with de facto heterosexual couples. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that this matter will raise genuine concerns, and I am certainly not putting it forward in a provocative way, particularly in view of the recent publicity on so-called outings. However, it is a matter of justice, and there is no doubt that the benefits available to homosexual superannuation fund members are arbitrarily lower than those available to comparable heterosexual members. I apologise to the Senate and to honourable senators for the short notice I have given of these amendments. However, the drafting is only just now being completed.</PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to once again refer to the difficulties experienced in the drafting of Democrats and, I understand, Opposition amendments for various pieces of legislation. It is certainly not the fault of the Clerks concerned who, I believe, are applying almost superhuman efforts to cope with the workload that they are facing. I think the reality is that some action must be taken to provide some additional resources to that office, or we will find that the business of this Senate will grind to a halt. Already, we have another Bill-the Copyright Amendment Bill-which may have to have its committee stage of debate deferred because amendments are not yet completed. I reiterate that this is not a criticism or a complaint directed at the Clerks office, which is pursuing the work of drafting amendments; it is simply that the workload is too large and the resources are too small. I believe it is the Government's responsibility to take action to rectify these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a second amendment that I wish to foreshadow at this stage. It is related to the question of bereavement payments available to members of the scheme under the 1922 Superannuation Act. Currently most, if not all, Commonwealth superannuation schemes provide special payments known as bereavement payments in the event of death of a fund member. The full rate of pension is payable for six fortnights after the time of death to assist with any additional costs which may arise and to postpone any administrative arrangements which must be made to alter the pension payment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment proposes to extend to the 1922 scheme the same rights as those that are available to members of the 1976 and 1990 schemes and the new military superannuation scheme. In addition, age pensioners are entitled to this payment and they receive the added bonus of a tax exemption on the extra portion of the bereavement benefit. I hope that the Opposition will see its way clear to support this measure, as it indicated earlier this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating for the second time, and obviously not the last time this year, Bills relating to superannuation. The Budget proposals announced a few moments ago introduced significant cost imposts on business but, unfortunately, none of those changes heralded in the Budget do anything to improve the efficiency of the administration of superannuation funds, particularly for casual workers. The Senate might be aware of the number of notices of motion that I have put forward outlining the problems faced by casual workers in the erosion of their benefits as a result of tax and administrative charges. There is something fundamentally wrong with many of these schemes and the way in which they apportion cost to the detriment of the non-active or casual employees who have left that particular industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Senate colleague Jim Short outlined the ambit of these Bills. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) in his second reading speech stated that the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 amends four superannuation Acts which relate to the provision of superannuation benefits for Commonwealth sector employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Basically the Bill does not address any new or major Government initiatives. Its intent is instead to bring the 1976 Commonwealth superannuation scheme into line with the occupational superannuation standards, to make some changes to streamline the administration of the Acts and the schemes, to remove some anomalies in the benefits provisions of the current legislation, thereby providing greater equity between members, and to make some drafting amendments to clarify the intention of the existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to take this opportunity to call upon the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to audit and enforce more rigorously the compliance of those funds with the occupational superannuation standards. I think it is a travesty that that lack of compliance is currently under way. I call upon the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to put more resources into this area of audit. </PARA>
<PARA> I must also express some concern that the Acts when originally debated were not sufficiently well drafted as to be clear and free of anomalies. This has no doubt caused a great deal of extra work for those administering the Acts and has required the time of the Senate again today so that those deficiencies can be rectified. At least the Senate has sufficient time to address this Bill fully whereas the guillotine was applied to the debate in the House of Representatives. The imposition of the guillotine when this Bill passed through the House resulted in the Minister giving his second reading speech and no further debate being allowed before the Bill was passed. That sort of debate is really a denigration of democratic principles and accountability, and the sovereignty of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise a couple of matters in relation to this Bill. The first is the proposed cessation of the cash-in-hand lump sum superannuation retirement benefit in the 1976 scheme from 1 July 1990. Whilst appreciating that this change has been made to bring the Commonwealth scheme into line with occupational superannuation standards, I deplore the general attitude of the Government with regard to lump superannuation arrangements. I mentioned this problem at great length when the Superannuation Bill 1990, which introduced a new Commonwealth superannuation scheme for most Commonwealth employees, was being debated in May last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government continues to be hypocritical. It introduced lump sum superannuation arrangements for its own employees but at the same time it promoted pension-type schemes for the private sector. More than three years ago, during extensive parliamentary debate on superannuation Bills, Ministers repeatedly expressed their disgust at double dipping, and rightly so. By double dipping, I am referring to the practice of lump sum payments being taken by retirees who spend their money and, at a later time, take a pension benefit from the Government. At the time, the social security review unit said that at least half of all the supportive benefits should emerge in pension form. I agree with that review unit: it is quite reasonable. But the Government has chosen another route, which is not correct. This is a major cause for concern and I would urge the Government to address this problem as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst this Bill makes some alterations to simplify and streamline administration, it has not addressed one area of concern which I have raised on each occasion that I have spoken on superannuation. I am referring to the iniquitous tax on superannuation contributions. Entry into superannuation funds, in terms of payments coming from the employer, attracts a tax of 15 per cent. If this were changed and the income of the fund were taxed, additional funds would be released for investment, which this country desperately needs. It would also release thousands of people associated with the administration and collection of this money. Superannuation administration would be more cost efficient. The direct lowering of administration costs would assist those people who work in an industry on a casual or part time basis being deprived of the 3 per cent levy that is invested by the employers for their benefit, because it is eaten up in administration costs. This is absolutely atrocious. As a parliament we must devise a simple scheme to lower those high administration costs. One mechanism for doing that is to take away the 15 per cent tax on entry. </PARA>
<PARA> What I propose here is a mechanism not to reduce the total tax collections but to make sure that this process is administratively more cost effective and efficient. This arrangement would certainly produce a simpler and fairer scheme, thus making superannuation more attractive, which in turn would increase the level of savings. That is what superannuation is all about. It is not a golden nest egg to be attacked by governments in the form of increased levels of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the anomalies dealt with in this Bill concerns invalidity pensioners. Apparently, it has been possible for a few invalidity pensioners to receive benefits based on one salary but have the earnings test applied to a much lower salary. Clause 26 amends this, and thus the salary used for benefits is also to be used for the earnings test. However, the correction of this anomaly does not address the fact that invalidity rates for Commonwealth employees are presently five to 10 times those of the private sector. In May last year, I appealed to the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, to ensure that the Commonwealth employees scheme received further attention and revision such that it would reduce the invalidity rates of the current scheme from their unacceptably high level. Most people would perceive that working in the Public Service should not lead to such high invalidity rates-five times higher than those in the private sector. That is just unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> I see no problems with the technical aspects of this Bill provided, of course, that the matters raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills have been and will be dealt with. I am referring to subclause 2(4) of the Bill requiring the Minister's confirmation that the retrospective operation of the clause is beneficial to persons other than the Commonwealth; clause 59, which refers to retrospectivity of regulations; and clause 4, paragraph (e), defining a deferred annuity which the Committee would ordinarily regard as a Henry VIII clause. I hope Senator McMullan will confirm that in his response. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Australian Business magazine of 7 August is to be believed, it would appear that there are still several problems with the new superannuation system for public servants. The article reports that only 35 per cent of public servants have chosen to change from the old scheme to the new. If this is the case and the Bill does not remedy the disadvantage of the new system, the Government obviously needs to make further amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I do not support the mechanisms put forward by the Australian Democrats. I fail to see why homosexual partners should have the same rights and entitlements as an ordinary spouse. This tends to have the effect not only of introducing a controversial issue but also of lowering the standard of the sanctity of marriage. If passed, this amendment would provide a degree of dignity to such groups which I believe is incompatible with the social attitudes and public morals of the vast majority of Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> Given this very low level of movement from the old to the new scheme, I do not think it is incumbent upon oppositions to lift benefits to make them comparable when the Government is encouraging participants to move from one scheme to another and, at the same time, it is widely acknowledged that the 1922 scheme has certain benefits over and above the latter schemes. There is no great incentive-if they continue to build up those sorts of benefits in the old scheme-for people to transfer into the newer schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition does not oppose certain transfers of functions to the new Insurance and Superannuation Commission. However, being a Tasmanian, Mr Acting Deputy President, you would sympathise with my concerns. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that there is no office of the ISC in Hobart. From the point of view of trustees, managers, employers, beneficiaries and participants in the scheme, the administration of funds will be all the more difficult because access to the ISC is to be through the Melbourne office. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had dozens of complaints of people being unable to access the Melbourne office on the telephone because the phone is always jammed; it is always engaged. I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer to ask the ISC to increase the number of lines because it is very difficult to get answers to problems when one is interstate and does not have access. There needs to be a 008 number readily accessible to the people in my State of Tasmania who do not have the availability of a local office. I appeal, firstly, in the short term, for improved telephone access and, secondly, for the establishment of an office. With the increasing importance of superannuation and because of what the Government intends to do by way of extending the Superannuation Act, it is vitally important that an office of the ISC be located in Tasmania in order to properly service the needs of all those concerned with superannuation in Tasmania. I have several other concerns but I will not take up the time of the Senate by raising them. I will put them forward at the relevant Estimates committee hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation has become a hotchpotch of rules and regulations, far too complex for the average man in the street to comprehend. It was unfortunate that last year we passed a whole series of legislative changes that had a good intent so far as deductibility was concerned but certainly made the Act much more incomprehensible. I again call upon the Government to simplify the rebate or deductibility regime to ensure that there is a lot more certainty in the Act. On so many occasions I have appealed to the Government regarding the need for simplification. The complexity of so many of these changes, particularly in the superannuation area, is inconsistent with this notion of self-assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the appointment of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, of which I am a member, and I look forward to its deliberations and recommendations. We have been given 17 different headings to address, including the possibilities for simplifying superannuation and the adequacy of prudential control arrangements applying to superannuation funds. It is my personal hope that this Committee will be able to formulate, based on the evidence from the numerous participants who will come before it in public hearings, a set of recommendations which when implemented will provide a future unchanging base on which the superannuation industry can operate with a higher level of assurance. The regular occurrence of amendment after amendment before this place has to be halted so that Australians can plan ahead for their retirement with a greater degree of certainty and surety than they have in the past eight years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Towards the end of the debate we ranged widely on the issue of superannuation beyond the limited confines of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill. It is a very important issue, and I understand that people want to take the opportunity as it arises to make some general comments. I will respond only briefly to anything that was said in that part of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation is fairly limited in its scope. The Acts that are amended by this Bill relate to the provision of superannuation benefits for Commonwealth sector employees. Even within that more limited confine the Bill does not contain any major initiatives. As was said in the second reading speech, it is proposing some changes to bring the 1976 scheme into line with the occupational superannuation standards, to streamline the administration, to remove some anomalies, and to make some drafting amendments for clarification. Most of the amendments are essentially technical in nature. Consequently, the financial impact of the amendments as a whole is minimal. Within that general framework let me deal with some of the questions that were asked of me and the amendments that are proposed and, briefly, some of the comments which were made. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler asked a specific question concerning the implications for employees of Australian Airlines of its forthcoming sale. As Senator Spindler and the Senate would know, Australian Airlines has had its own superannuation arrangements for a long time. Most of its employees would be covered by those arrangements but some employees remain covered by the Superannuation Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA> When Australian Airlines is sold it will cease to be in the public sector. As such, while its employees in its own scheme will continue to be covered by that scheme-they will continue to be employees of Australian Airlines-those employees covered by the Superannuation Act 1976 will cease to be eligible employees for the purposes of that Act. Therefore, they would no longer be able to contribute to the CSS-the 1976 Commonwealth superannuation scheme. They will be able to preserve the stake that they built up in the scheme by leaving their stake in the CSS to accumulate until retirement. They will also be able to join the airline's scheme. That would create a situation in which at retirement they would receive an indexed CSS pension, a refund of their contributions to the CSS and benefits from the airline's scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has agreed that prior to the sale these CSS members will be offered the option of transferring to the airline's scheme with appropriate credit for past CSS membership. The transfer will be made on the same terms as earlier transfers from the CSS to the airline's scheme, and ample time will be allowed for individual decisions. The Commonwealth will provide funds to meet the cost of the past service credit. Such employees could also choose to take a cash payment of their own contributions to their CSS plus interest. However, this option would mean forgoing the employer financed benefit built up from their past CSS membership, and people will need to be conscious of that in making their choices. Obviously, redundancy benefits under the CSS will remain available to any CSS member who is made redundant before the sale is concluded. The Government shares Senator Spindler's concern about the positions of those employees who are affected, and processes are under way to ensure that a reasonable range of options is available. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the specific amendments proposed by Senator Spindler. The first concerns the 1922 Act. Prior to my exposure to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme and its various ramifications, I thought the only significance of 1922 was that it was the name of the committee that ran the Conservative Party in the UK. I find that we now have this extraordinary 1922 set of provisions with which we still have to deal, notwithstanding the fact that nobody can now join that scheme. It is a comment on the history, evolution and change of superannuation schemes that we had the 1922, the 1976 and the 1990 variations. We would hope that with the 1990 scheme being in place we can now return to a more stable period of superannuation arrangement for public sector employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is opposed to the proposed amendment. There are concerns about cost. There are concerns that this would follow on from enhancements which have been made to the 1922 scheme, usually at no cost to members. Each of those arguments would therefore raise some questions on whether we ought to be proceeding in this way. However, I am particularly concerned for a third reason. The enhancements that were made to the 1976 Commonwealth superannuation scheme-that was essentially what we were dealing with in this matter and concerning the six fortnights reversionary pension-and other enhancements were paid for in full from savings arising from the tighter invalidity retirement procedures to apply to the 1976 scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we had a symmetry in that package where some changes in tightening the 1976 scheme generated savings that funded the enhancements. There were no such savings generated within the 1922 scheme. We are moving from a scheme of proper symmetry to a scheme where we are simply saying to taxpayers, `Please fund an increased benefit to this group of people'. It is not such a terrible thing to be seeking extra benefits for any group of workers, and many of the people affected would be constituents of mine, but in terms of spending $8m of taxpayers' funds, it is not a provision that we are proposing to endorse because there are no such savings from the Superannuation Act 1922. That is why in 1990 the enhancement of a higher reversionary pension was not extended to pensioners under that Act. It was not a whim or malice; it was because the symmetry did not apply, and it does not apply now. </PARA>
<PARA> The pension schemes of the 1922 and 1976 Acts were different before the enhancements. It is not as if the two schemes were in all other respects equal and the enhancements made a distinction between them. They are in many ways different. Those differences will continue and that is no cause for particular concern, but we cannot just pick at random one element of the variation that does not benefit the people in the 1922 scheme and extend that to them without looking at all the other elements where they are advantaged over all the people in other schemes. It is neither a rational nor a balanced approach to government decision making and the Government will not support the proposed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> We come then to the rather late in the day amendment concerning homosexual spouses. Senator Spindler and the Senate would be aware--</PARA>

One concern is that the issue has been raised very late in the day. I understand Senator Spindler's explanation that it was not an attempt to trick or trap but that he was caught up in the procedural processes of getting these matters before us and has been, perhaps, diverted by some other matters causing him some difficulty and with which we may all empathise. I am concerned that we have not had time to consider the implications of what he is putting forward. At first glance at least one part of the amendment does not achieve the purpose as set out by Senator Spindler.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not profess detailed expertise on every element, but my advice is that, at least in part, the proposed amendment does not achieve the purpose which it sets out to achieve. I cannot speak on behalf of the Government and I have not been able to speak with any of the responsible Ministers but personally I do not want to rule out the option of looking at some such consideration in the future. But with this sort of notice and in this sort of manner, it is not an amendment with which we can agree. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not au fait with all the details of the point Senator Watson raised about the problem with the Henry VIII clause and inappropriate delegation. I have had an opportunity to look only quickly at the point he raised. I understand it was a matter raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. There is a letter before the Minister for the matter to go back to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. It is a question the Minister takes seriously and he will be conducting discussions with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee about the matter. He is confident about the matter. With the very limited opportunity I have had to look at the matter, it seems that we are not confronted with an inappropriate delegation. Although the dialogue will continue with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, I believe it will be satisfied with the response from the Minister. That concludes the comments I want to make on the issues in the Bill before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the general remarks made by Senator Watson about the administration of the ISC. I will take those remarks on board and draw them to the Minister's attention. They are not my direct area of responsibility but I understand the concern of people if they are not able to get at least telephonic access. I do not want to have another debate with Senator Watson about the issue of tax simplification, but he would be aware that the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), put superannuation very high on the list of priorities. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(1a) In spite of subsection (1), if, on any of the 7 pension pay-days immediately following the death of a pensioner, the rate at which any pension would, apart from this subsection, be payable to the widow or widower of the pensioner is less than the rate (in this section called the `putative rate') at which any pension would be payable to the deceased pensioner on that day if he had not died, the widow or widower is entitled to a pension at a rate equal to the putative rate.''. </PARA>
<PARA>87. After section 47 of the Principal Act, the following section is inserted:</PARA>
<PARA>Set off against pension in certain circumstances</PARA>
<PARA> ``47A. Where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the widow or widower of a deceased member of the scheme who was a pensioner immediately before his or her death is entitled to a pension under subsection 47(1a); and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) there is paid into an account with a bank, credit union or building society (in this section called the  `financial institution') an amount purporting to be an instalment of pension payable to the member in respect of a period in respect of which pension is payable to the widow or widower under subsection 47(1a); and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the financial institution pays, out of that account, to the widow or widower an amount not exceeding the amount so paid into the account;</PARA>
<PARA> then, in spite of any other law:</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the financial institution is not liable to the Commonwealth, the personal representative of the deceased member or anyone else for any loss incurred because of the payment of that amount to the widow or widower; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) an amount equal to the amount so paid by the financial institution to the widow or widower must be set off against any amount of pension payable to him or her under subsection 47(1A).''.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment is really in two parts. The first part of the amendment concerns the payment of a bereavement benefit, that is, the continuation of the usual pension for six additional fortnights before the pension reverts to the lower reversionary pension level. This amendment proposes to bring the scheme under the 1922 Act into line with the 1976 and 1990 schemes. The benefits will be available to members of the military superannuation scheme, which will commence in a few months time, and is available also to age pensioners. In addition, the special bereavement payments are tax exempt when received by the pensioner. The cost of bringing these people into line with other pensioners will be between $200,000 and $500,000. It is not a lot of money to give these people equity. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the amendment to the 1922 Act is contingent on the first part of the amendment. Again, it follows the other Commonwealth schemes. Currently, after the death of a fund member, payments will continue before the necessary notification and administrative procedures have been completed. These amounts have to be repaid by the financial institution receiving the payments. A separate payment backdated to the date of death has to be made to the reversionary spouse. The amendment proposes to allow the offsetting of the payments made to the financial institution in the name of the deceased fund member against the actual liability of the fund member's remaining spouse. I urge honourable senators to support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate comes after a brief but, nevertheless, very useful inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which last week considered the Copyright Amendment Bill 1991 before the continuation of the second reading debate. It listened to the views of a number of witnesses representing publishers, authors, the industry in various forms, government officials, legal experts and others. The list of those represented appears at the appendix of the Senate Committee's report. Included amongst those I did not mention were the Australian Booksellers Association, the Australian Consumers Association, the Australian Record Industry Association and the Australian Copyright Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As you can see from that list, Mr Deputy President, there was broad range of submissions. Most of those organisations were represented before the Senate Committee and had a unique opportunity to debate the merits of this quite tricky piece of legislation. It is tricky in the sense that everyone in this place accepts the proprietary rights of the copyright holder and, on the other hand, the concern within the Australian public that books are not being made readily available at prices that are competitive with prices overseas. To some extent we have a conflict between the interests of consumers and the interests of copyright holders. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this was a unique opportunity for a Senate committee to consider these conflicting arguments and to help honourable senators formulate the positions that they will no doubt advance in the course of this second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it did also mean that issues that had not previously been considered were raised. It seems to us that a few of those issues have resulted in the obvious need for further amendments-amendments that were not raised in the debate in the other place. Draftsmen have been working on that and, because of the short time frame, although we think that by the time the second reading debate is finished this evening the Opposition's amendments will be complete, they probably will not have received the degree of refinement that would be wise. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from Senator Spindler that his draftspeople are taking a little longer and that his amendments are unlikely to be ready immediately after the completion of the second reading debate. We suggest that there be a short adjournment of the debate, perhaps until later this evening. It might turn out, from the Australian Democrats' point of view, that it might be better to proceed with the committee stage of the debate tomorrow. That is simply a fact of life arising from new matters coming out of the Committee's consideration of the Bill. I have no doubt that the Government will appreciate that reality and cooperate in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill comes to us after eight long years and two major inquiries. As I said, there is no doubt that the Australian book buying public has long been disadvantaged in terms of price and availability by the importation provisions of the Copyright Act 1968. In the world book market Australia, along with New Zealand, South Africa and other smaller countries, is regarded as an appendage to the British market. Under the importation provisions, Australian booksellers can only import non-pirate books first published overseas from the holder of an Australian copyright, which is usually a British publisher. </PARA>
<PARA> Books which are first published overseas are sent to Australia by the British publishers through their own distributors. Because there is no incentive for the British publishers to publish the book in Australia promptly, this is at times a fairly leisurely process. Often, books published in the United States of America and then in Britain are not available in Australia until months or even years later. Sometimes they are never available in Australia. When books eventually arrive in our country, the prices charged are much higher than those charged in the United Kingdom. This happens not only in the case of an American book where the copyright for Australia has been sold to a British publisher, but also where a book has been published initially in the United Kingdom or any other foreign country. Of course, it is open to booksellers in Australia to flout the law and import books which they have obtained under the counter from an overseas wholesaler who is not the copyright holder. This is something that we do not condone, and want to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 the obviously unsatisfactory situation was eventually referred to the Copyright Law Review Committee, which reported some five years later in September 1988. The Copyright Law Review Committee's inquiry related to literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, and subject matter other than works-namely, sound recordings, films, television and radio broadcasts and published editions of works. In other words, unlike this Bill, the CLRC inquiry was not just limited to books. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that copyright law provides protection and benefit for authors, although the principal beneficiaries are, of course, the multinational publishers. The CLRC was concerned about the absence of competition, inefficient practices and the overpricing of copyright material caused by the present restrictions. There was also concern that owners of copyright were being given a greater degree of protection than those dealing in other commodities. The CLRC concluded that importation of copyright articles should be allowed if the articles were not available in Australia within a reasonable time from when they were published overseas. Such a relaxation of the restrictions would benefit the Australian consumer because of decreased prices and increased availability of overseas publications. </PARA>
<PARA> Importers would be able to deal with several overseas suppliers and would be encouraged to keep their prices down, increase their variety, improve their importing and indenting services, and generally provide a much better service to the consumer. However, the Committee was not in favour of total repeal of the importation provisions. Book and record sellers and others interested in this issue generally welcomed the report and have advocated its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition was of the view that reform of the law in this area was essential, and a private member's Bill in the name of Mr Neil Brown, QC, was introduced in October 1989 in the other place which embodied the proposals of the Copyright Law Review Committee. The Bill subsequently lapsed. On 19 June 1989, one year after the CLRC report, the then Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus, referred to the Prices Surveillance Authority the question of the price of books, including the effect of the Copyright Act on the price of books. The reference did not extend to other copyright articles. </PARA>
<PARA> In direct contrast to the CLRC report, the Prices Surveillance Authority report in December 1989 recommended the complete abolition of the copyright provisions which prevent the open flow of overseas-published books to Australia. The PSA concluded that, on the evidence, publishers engaged in international price discrimination and Australian consumers were suffering as a result. For instance, publishers who operated in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia were able to set their prices lower in Canada than in the United Kingdom. They consequently set higher prices in Australia than they did in the UK. In Canada the price differential was 35c and 2.6 per cent below the UK price, whereas in Australia prices were $2.99 and 31.3 per cent-almost one-third-above the UK prices. </PARA>
<PARA> In the view of the PSA, the copyright provisions have resulted in a closed market and one which has relieved booksellers of the normal competitive pressures of responding to market demand. It believes that publishers have been hiding behind the provisions to continue to operate inefficiently. The report of the PSA was quite unequivocal in its view that the repeal of the copyright provisions would result in a fall in book prices. The PSA said that, although its recommendations related only to books, the copyright argument applied also to other areas, particularly sound recordings. It therefore asked for additional terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill currently before the chamber attempts to achieve a compromise between the recommendations of the PSA and the CLRC. In essence, it implements a modified version of the CLRC recommendations but it is only about books. It exempts the importation of non-pirate books from the operation of the importation provisions which provide that copyright is infringed by a person who imports an article for commercial purposes. The Bill in fact allows for parallel imports of books in three separate situations. The first situation-the so-called 30-day rule-concerns non-pirate books which are first published overseas after the commencement of the Bill. Such books must be published in Australia within 30 days of the original publication overseas in order to attract copyright provisions. The consequence of a book not being made available in Australia within the 30 days is that the copyright owner loses protection forever. This provision seeks to implement the PSA recommendation that new titles be published simultaneously overseas and in Australia in order to attract copyright protection. Under subsection 29 (1) of the Act, a work or book is published if reproductions or copies of the work have been supplied, whether by sale or otherwise, to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The second situation concerns non-pirate books first published in Australia either before or after commencement of the Bill, or in a foreign country before commencement of the Bill. In relation to such books, if the copyright owner fails to supply sufficient copies for the Australian market copyright protection is lost temporarily. There are detailed conditions which must be fulfilled for parallel importation to take place in these circumstances: the importer must have placed a written order with the copyright owner which has not been withdrawn, the copyright owner must have failed to advise within seven days that the orders could not be filled, or the copyright owner must have failed to satisfy the order within 90 days after the order had been placed. Protection can be restored once the copyright owner resupplies the market. The third situation is that a single copy of a non-pirate book may be imported to fill a customer's written order for a single copy of a book. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition takes the view that this Bill does not go far enough. Whilst the Government has chosen to focus on the availability of books to Australian consumers, the Opposition is also concerned about the fact that, as the PSA found, Australians are paying too much for books. In other words, we recognise that price is as much an issue as availability. We support the total deregulation approach as advocated by the PSA. The Opposition's view is that Australia should not shirk from having the first open market for books in the English speaking world. I will be moving a second reading amendment which reflects our support for that position. I also foreshadow that in the Committee of the Whole I will be moving amendments to the Bill to extend its operation to other copyright articles in line with the report of the CLRC. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Government has indicated that it intends to propose further legislation in relation to other copyright articles, the Opposition is anxious to accelerate the process of reform, given, as I said, that it has already taken eight years to reach this stage of proposed legislation in relation to books. This extension does not include computer software in view of the current inquiry by the PSA in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will also be seeking an amendment to introduce an exemption for textbooks so that copyright protection will be retained in the case of overseas-published textbooks, even when they are not published in Australia within 30 days of their first publication overseas. This is a result of our concern that the Bill could have adverse consequences on the supply of textbooks to Australian students. Our amendments will allow time for Australian adaptations to be prepared. Also, as the PSA pointed out in its report, its critical comments relating to price and availability of books do not generally apply in relation to the price and availability of textbooks. </PARA>
<PARA> Other Opposition amendments seek to allow time for industry adjustment to the new legislation by extending the commencement date so that it is three months after the date of the royal assent and to introduce a constructive knowledge requirement to subsections relating to infringement by importation for commercial purposes to reflect the fact that constructive knowledge is specified in section 132 of the Act dealing with criminal offences. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result-and, as I indicated a moment ago, as a result of the productive examination of the Bill by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee-the Opposition will be pursuing two further amendments. The first relates to the single copy exemption under which a single copy of a book may be imported to fill the written order of a customer. It is a simple commercial reality that many customers expect to be able to place such orders by telephone, and our amendment will provide for that. We do not see any particular reason why it should have to be in written form in light of today's technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the second new amendment proposed by the Opposition, booksellers would be able to import a specific number of books without infringing copyright in order to fill an order by a library for a number of books. The reason for this amendment is that Australian booksellers, under the current legislation, must treat libraries as any other customer and can import only a single copy of a book for them. Libraries have therefore formed the practice of ordering directly from large overseas suppliers. The Opposition's proposed amendment will allow libraries to order books from Australian booksellers rather than have them go offshore, and will therefore provide a much needed boost for our local trade in the current difficult economic climate. I hope that these two amendments will receive Government support. The short adjournment that I mentioned a moment ago might facilitate the Government's consideration of the obvious merit of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue which was discussed during the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee hearing was whether, if special protection were given to Australian authors, Australia would be in breach of the principle of the equal treatment of nationals contained in article 5 of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. Under article 5, works that originate in the country of another member state are to receive the same treatment that Australia accords to works of its own nationals. It is the nationality of the author, not the place of publication, which determines the application of article 5. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to bear this in mind when considering the Government's Bill as it selects the place of publication as the criterion for invoking the 30-day permanent loss of copyright rule. It is arguable that the Bill constitutes a de facto discrimination against foreign authors as the 30-day rule in the vast majority of cases would apply to foreign authors. </PARA>
<PARA> In its submission to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, the Law Council of Australia stated its views that the enactment of this Bill would place Australia in contravention of its international obligations under the Berne Convention. The departmental officer present at the hearing undertook, I think it is fair to say, to make available to the Committee the conflicting advice to the Minister; perhaps it is fairer to say that he sought to refer that back to the Minister to see whether the Minister would make available to the Committee the conflicting advice that he had received from his officials. The Committee has not received that advice, and we do not know the reconsidered view of the Government on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as the view of the Law Council obviously should not be taken lightly-and no-one would be wishing to pass legislation in breach of Australia's obligations under international treaties to which it has become a party-we would expect during this debate to hear in some detail from the Minister as to why presumably he disagrees with the opinion given by the Law Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Other international considerations are also relevant. The United States pushed for trade-related aspects of international property rights-TRAIPS-to be on the negotiating agenda for the Uruguay Round in order to produce a uniform regime for the protection of intellectual property on a multilateral basis. The primary object of such negotiations is to address counterfeiting and piracy problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In the copyright area, the Australian delegation has argued that existing international conventions, such as the Berne Convention, are sufficient to meet the GATT principles of national treatment, non-discrimination and transparency. In the TRAIPS negotiations, Australia has focused on the need to improve multilateral enforcement and dispute resolution procedures. The US has specifically pushed for raising the level of protection offered by importation provisions. The importation provisions offer a means of controlling piracy and counterfeiting. It is arguable that to remove them altogether, as recommended by the PSA, prior to any outcome of the TRAIPS negotiations being obtained, would be imprudent. We look forward to the Government's considered view on that issue as well during the debate. Whilst the Opposition prefers an open market approach, as exemplified by the Prices Surveillance Authority, we recognise that there may be international impediments which would need to be dealt with first. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading amendment which I will move calls on the Government to pursue, in the GATT Uruguay Round, the promotion of a uniform and universal regime for the protection of and trade in intellectual property rights. Further, it calls upon the Government to seek clarification of and, if necessary, amendment to the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention with respect to the application or otherwise of the provisions of those conventions to trade and distribution in intellectual property rights. In other words, whilst we advocate an open market-that is our preference; it is the direction that we believe is in the best interests of the Australian people and we would like to see it in legislative form-we recognise that the issue of the potential breach of these international conventions must be removed first, and that any conflicting provision contained in the Copyright Act must also be removed. Our second reading amendment therefore reflects that concern in the course of seeking the implementation of our preferred position, and that is, an open market for books in this country. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that the anti-competitive protection that the importation provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 give to the trade and distribution of copyright articles should be removed by the repeal of those provisions and, to this end, calls upon the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) pursue in the international negotiations by Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations the promotion of a uniform and universal regime for the protection of, and trade in, intellectual property rights; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) seek clarification of and, if necessary, amendment to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Universal Copyright Convention with respect to the application or otherwise of the provisions of those conventions to trade and distribution in intellectual property rights''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Copyright Amendment Bill is to enable unrestricted commercial importation of non-pirate copies of books, other than those first published in Australia or first published simultaneously in Australia and overseas. Secondly, it seeks to suspend a copyright owner's control over importation of non-pirate copies of books first published in Australia or first published simultaneously in Australia and overseas, when supply becomes unavailable for more than 90 days. Finally, it will allow the importation of a non-pirate copy of a book at any time to fill a documented order from a customer for his or her non-commercial use. In terms of the financial impact, it is claimed-and certainly it is hoped by the whole community-that the changes are likely to lead to some reductions in prices of books supplied to Australian consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present, the Australian Copyright Act, largely as a hangover from colonial days, allows British publishers to force Australian bookshops to buy only through their local subsidiaries or agents and they can run their Australian sales on the principle of what the market will bear. Pricing policy and supply are effectively controlled from Britain by virtue of the monopoly conditions created by the Copyright Act. From the consumer's point of view, the problems are long delays in obtaining some books, inaccessibility of others and high prices overall. Some booksellers, we are informed, covertly import books direct from America in contravention of the copyright law, but book prices have escalated rapidly in recent years and at higher rates than increases in the CPI. </PARA>
<PARA> Two reports have been published in recent years which proposed changes aimed at improving the flow to Australia of books published overseas and breaking the effective monopoly that British publishers have over the rights to many Australian books. The 1988 recommendation of the Copyright Law Review Committee report would allow any book not published in Australia within 90 days of its publication elsewhere in the world to be legally imported. In other words, it is a relaxation rather than a repeal of the current import provisions. In particular, this approach retains the concept of territorial divisibility of copyright. </PARA>
<PARA> The more recently released Prices Surveillance Authority report proposes deregulation of the imported book market with a 10-year protection period for Australian writers, if this proves legally possible, and there would be some doubt about that. The adoption of these recommendations would make Australia the first open market for books in the English-speaking world. The economics-oriented Prices Surveillance Authority concentrated on economic considerations, but obviously there are legal and cultural aspects to this issue as well. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that the Australian Democrats prefer the approach taken in this Bill on the basis of the Committee recommendations. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Bill, but we will not be supporting the second reading amendment moved by the Opposition. The reason for that is that while we believe consumers need a better go, the free-for-all that is envisaged by the second reading amendment would not be in the interests of Australia's cultural and social fabric. The clarification and, if necessary, amendment of the Berne Convention that is mentioned in the second part of the second reading amendment does not cure that defect. </PARA>
<PARA> In accepting the basic thrust of the Bill, the Democrats recognise that there are some concerns and some improvements which can be made. They lie in the area of the 30-day rule. We recognise that it is possible that delays may occur which are totally beyond the control of the person or organisation concerned. We believe that there should be exceptions created for such situations. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment refers to adaptations. Again, our approach in this area is likely to differ slightly from that of the Opposition. I would prefer, at this stage, to leave until the committee stage the debate on the details of our amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Copyright Amendment Bill 1991, I think it is reasonable to look at the history of how we have reached this particular position and to realise the length of time taken and the dalliance that has occurred in finally being presented with legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Copyright law in this country is governed by the Copyright Act 1968. This Act conferred considerable monopoly upon British publishers and their Australian subsidiaries. In spite of substantial evidence to this effect, it was not until 1983 that the Copyright Law Review Committee was given the task of examining the provisions of the Act. The Committee reported in September 1988 and, to my mind, in a rather unsatisfactory fashion. Its recommendations could not really be described as robust. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for this is partly the unfortunate inherent premise that copyright law should act as some form of industry protection, if not for publishers and distributors, then for authors. It was implicit in the recommendations of the Committee that the repeal of the importation sections of the Copyright Act would have a detrimental effect on the subsidisation of local authors. The Committee did not supply much evidence on the question of overcharging in Australia as a result of the Copyright Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1989, the Prices Surveillance Authority was charged with the task of considering an extensive economic analysis of the issues. It was not until December 1990 that the Prices Surveillance Authority handed down the final report of its investigation and that there were moves to introduce the legislation that we have before us today. As stated by the Prices Surveillance Authority:</PARA>
<PARA>The basic thrust of the Authority's proposals is to introduce more competition into the book trade, benefits to cost and allocative efficiencies and lower prices. Whenever a review of this kind is undertaken, the scaremongers always seem to come out of the woodwork. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to look at some of the predictions that have been made. There were predictions that there would be a reduction in the stockholding in Australia by publishers and distributors; that there would be a decline in the availability of books to the Australian market; that there would be a decline in advertising and promotion by publishers; that the swallowing of independent Australian publishers by multinationals would take place; that the closure of small and, especially, country book stores would take place; and that the most dire consequences for the integrity of Australian authors would be a final result. </PARA>
<PARA> I admit that I am not one who has greatly admired the work of the Prices Surveillance Authority, but I commend the Authority on the way in which it resisted these prophecies and was prepared to see at least some deregulation of the book industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill could be described perhaps as being more notable for what it does not achieve than for any impact it might have upon the market for books published overseas and sold in Australia. In spite of a formidable report of the Prices Surveillance Authority into sound recordings, and the Government's agreement in principle to legislate in this area, it remains as a conspicuous absence from this Bill. Considering the Government has, indeed, agreed in principle to follow the PSA's recommendations, and the simple comparative ease of drafting that could have taken place in accommodating sound recordings in this Bill as well, there was an opportunity for the Government to demonstrate legislative efficiency and deal with both items in the single Bill and, one could dare say, see some productivity in the way in which the Government handles its business. </PARA>
<PARA> In a Sydney Morning Herald article of 15 August 1991, Professor Fels presented a good case for reform. He indicated, in simple terms, that Australians have paid excessive prices for records for many years owing to the import restrictions. Currently, multinational companies monopolise the importation of records to Australia and record companies cannot import, or threaten to import, the same records from overseas, even though the overseas prices are significantly lower. </PARA>
<PARA> In a comment more akin to perhaps Milton Friedman or Adam Smith than any Chairman of the Prices Surveillance Authority, Professor Fels made the statement that competition is the only lasting way to achieve price restraint. For people like me, who value the role of the market, the statement is music to the ears. Indeed, one could say that it gave some respectability to the Authority and perhaps hope for the new appointment which Professor Fels has taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The opposition to the proposal that there should be deregulation of the music industry as well comes from a well-known rock star, one Peter Garrett, who has been known to show an interest in this place. Peter Garrett's suggestion was that there should be an enforced price freeze on all major record companies. Professor Fels quite rightly pointed out that not only was such a proposal likely to be a breach of the Trade Practices Act but also it was, of course, a highly undesirable proposition in itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The record industry and the publishing industry often claim that they are some sort of bastion of free enterprise. Unfortunately, the truth is that they hide behind a monopoly wall which prohibits imports and a copyright wall which restricts trade far more than any tariff ever did. Peter Garrett, when he ran for this place, ran on the basis that he had a social conscience and that he was interested in a system of social justice. It is perhaps timely to remind him that the system which he defends is in fact impacting upon those who can least afford to pay for the product which he makes. The needy simply cannot afford to pay for Mr Garrett's products owing to the system which he is advocating ought to remain in place. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context it is worth while looking at an example, and a good example would be Peter Garrett's own recording on CD of Blue Sky Mining. It is the Garrett supported system which ensures that that CD sells in New Zealand for $4 less than it does in Australia, while those in the United States can purchase the product for $10 less than we can in Australia. Price differentials for cassettes are in the vicinity of $5 and $9 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make mention of a very worthwhile article in the Australian of 19 December 1990, written by Paddy McGuinness. He pointed out that when it comes to the music industry, the consumers of pop music, who are predominantly young and low income earners, are being mercilessly ripped off. Mr McGuinness went on to say and again it is worth placing on the record:</PARA>
<PARA>Not only has the recorded music industry abused its control over imports to rip off consumers, it has also used it as a form of market power over distributors and retailers by using its powers to refuse supply as a means of debt collection, effectively appointing itself judge in its own cause. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, Professor Fels is spot on when he says that the theory that import monopolies will help exports and high Australian prices will boost overseas sales has no place in modern Australia. This has been accepted in the tariff debate and it should be the case in relation to non-tariff barriers. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to the details of the Bill before us today. This Bill implements recommendations of the Copyright Law Review Committee's report of 1988 which recommended that the importation of an overseas published book should be deregulated only in the case of a copyright owner failing to make that book available after a reasonable time. Senator Hill outlined the very specific proposals when he spoke earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the copyright owner will retain exclusive distribution rights over any books first published in Australia as well as those first published overseas but then published in Australia within 30 days. However, booksellers will be able to import directly books for commercial distribution where the copyright owner cannot supply those titles within 90 days of a written order. Parallel imports can continue until such time as the copyright owner fulfils any outstanding orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Bill may make available in Australia works published overseas much sooner, there is likely to be little effect on book prices in Australia per se. Exclusive distribution rights organised amongst British and American publishers are assured provided they make timely distributions of books to Australia. It is noteworthy that American publishers frequently sell the British rights to British publishers and that Australia and other smaller countries are added as appendages to those rights. British publishers can then price discriminate between different countries because the ban on parallel imports prevents international arbitrage on the part of booksellers. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians have a high demand for books-a demand which remains high irrespective of price. This is evidenced by the fact that we purchase more books per capita than any other country in the world. This allows British publishers to charge much higher prices for books in Australia than they do elsewhere without adversely affecting their total unit sales. Due to the provisions of the Copyright Act, there is little incentive for British publishers to make books available for the Australian market promptly at competitive prices. The net result is overpriced books arriving on Australian shores months, if not years, after the same books are made available in the United States. Evidence suggests that there is also collusion between British publishers to set roughly equivalent prices for books which are close substitutes for one another. </PARA>
<PARA> By adopting the recommendations of the Copyright Law Review Committee, the Government has ignored the criticisms levelled at that report by the Prices Surveillance Authority. Readers have lost out on the benefit of protected Australian publishers and authors. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), in his second reading speech, claimed that consumers would suffer from the decline in distinctly Australian literature in a fully deregulated import market. By the erection of protective walls around the local publishing industry, the Government considers that it has the right to establish itself as the guardian of our literary tastes, irrespective of how the market may express itself and its taste for the published article. The irony of this call for protection by the taxpayer-subsidised literary elite-and, for a large part, the left wing-is that all their efforts are ultimately directed to the preservation of British and American monopoly privileges in the publishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I may not go quite as far as some in discussing the motives for this legislation. At the time when this Bill was first mooted early last year, it was suggested that the Government was attempting to appease the local industry in the run-up to the last Federal election. It was stated in an editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald of 6 January 1990 that plainly Mr Bowen's compromise reform is designed to shut up the authors and publishers in the period before the election. If it is the wish of the Government to subsidise marginal Australian authors, the conferral of monopoly rights on foreign publishers in the hope that some of those profits will benefit Australian literature is perhaps the most inefficient way of doing so. It would be more efficient to provide direct subsidies to authors than to use this convoluted mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> As we speak of the need for tax reform, it is worth while considering that higher book prices have resulted from the provisions of the Copyright Act and they have, in fact, acted as a tax on the consumption of literature to the detriment of readers and authors alike. The concern has been expressed that there may be a possibility that overseas editions of works by Australian authors may be remaindered and then dumped on the Australian market. It is unlikely that this would be covered by anti-dumping legislation as it could not be said to result in material injury to the particular industry. Any legitimate practice that would increase the exposure of Australian authors at no cost whatsoever should be genuinely encouraged, not condemned. If such a matter were of genuine concern, the issue could properly be dealt with in the contractual relationship between authors and their publishers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will place considerable administrative costs upon importers. Importers will first have to establish a lack of availability of each title by placing a written order with the Australian copyright owner, who is allowed 90 days to fill that order. Should the copyright owner fail to fill the order, the importer will then face further costs as orders for imports will have been replaced by those with another publisher before being granted exemption from copyright infringement. The copyright owner may later be able to reassert his monopoly rights simply by supplying the market at a later date. It is noteworthy that many readers purchase their books directly from overseas for the simple reason that, in spite of shipping costs, it is both cheaper and quicker to import from an overseas supplier than to pay monopoly prices in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion of copyright law brings into serious and fundamental question the matter of precisely what the notion of a copyright is supposed to achieve. I now believe that our perception of copyright is still evolving. The Prices Surveillance Authority reminds us that copyright is not an absolute property or moral right but exists for reasons of public policy. It is with this in mind, together with the need to move towards freer trade and open markets, that we should motivate our attitude towards copyright law and, indeed, see that it is in line with what is developed as a bipartisan policy in many respects to the need to reduce tariffs. On this side of the chamber, we have a more specific and honest attitude to the reduction of tariffs. Our attitude to this degree of protectionism for the publishing industry is in line with that philosophy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly in the second reading debate on the Copyright Amendment Bill. I do so as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which had this Bill referred to it for consideration. Last Monday week, we conducted a five-hour hearing when a number of organisations came before the Committee to give evidence. Of course, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) and officers from the Attorney-General's Department were present, as were representatives from the Australian Booksellers Association, the Australian Copyright Council, the Association of American Publishers, the Australian Book Publishers Association, the Australian Society of Authors and the Prices Surveillance Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of the representatives present, other than those from the Prices Surveillance Authority, by and large supported the Government's proposal, albeit somewhat reluctantly, to say the least. It is quite clear that only public pressure has made a number of these organisations willing to support the Government's Bill; if they had their way, they would have left the position exactly as it was. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prices Surveillance Authority stuck to its original proposition and answered quite forthrightly the questions from the Committee about why it believed its report still stood. I must say that, after the five-hour hearing, I still believe that the thrust of the Prices Surveillance Authority is essentially correct in what it is trying to achieve and how it should be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The major area of concern for Australians was the impact of the legislation on Australian authors who have signed arrangements to have books published in Australia, and who also have had those same books published overseas by the same publishing company, or under licence to another publishing company. What would happen to their incomes if those books were imported into Australia under some arrangement? There were some rather florid or exaggerated claims about the impact of book remainders overseas on Australian authors. This is very hard to predict because it is all a subjective judgment about what may happen if the present law is changed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposal is for 30-days grace for Australian publishers to publish in Australia, otherwise people would be allowed to import books. But it will be noticed that, by and large, that rule is more like a 90-day arrangement by the time people put in their notice about the response from the publishing company. So we are really talking about more of a three-month arrangement. It was not clear to me that even those 90 days would be effective. It seemed to me that the bureaucratic arrangements could mean that even the 90 days could be strung out. I cannot be sure of that because I do not know the actual details of how importing works-whether books are coming in by plane or ship, the notification given by the importing booksellers and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> What seemed to be very clear is that the major concern of Australian authors about the protection of their incomes has been somewhat exaggerated. The Australian Book Publishers Association said that the industry is worth just over $1 billion a year in sales in Australia. It said that, according to its estimation, of that $1 billion about 50 per cent-or $500m-comes from the sale of books which have Australian authors. But of that $500m, around $400m comes from Australian authors publishing books in Australia which are not sold overseas-books that are peculiar to the Australian market. The example given at the hearing was Max Walker, who writes books containing humorous tales about cricket. These are very popular in Australia but, clearly, are not published overseas because there is no real market overseas for a Max Walker, who is almost an Australian living legend or a living treasure in sporting and cultural terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The part of the market that we are dealing with-where Australian authors sell books in Australia that are published in Australia and also overseas-as estimated by the Australian Book Publishers Association, amounts to about $100m. In other words, only about 10 per cent of the Australian book market involves Australian authors who publish in Australia through an arrangement with a publisher, and who also are well known enough in the world to be able to get contracts to sell those books overseas-to have them published and printed overseas and to get some return from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to keep those figures in mind. We may be trying to carry through arrangements here that protect people who do not need protection, in a sense. We do not need to protect Max Walker's market. We do not need to protect people publishing books on aspects of Australia that are not published overseas-that is, around $400m of the $500m market. Obviously, the books of other authors published overseas are imported into Australia. I cannot see why we should provide special protection to enable foreign authors to jack up prices in Australia through their book publishers. It seems to me that that is a matter they should take up with their own companies. They are probably doing very well out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the present system restricts the access of the Australian consumer to the wider range of books that should be available in a modern society such as ours. I think any of us who have had the good fortune to travel overseas and to go into any reasonable bookshop in London, New York, Washington, San Francisco or Los Angeles will have found a much greater range of books in particular areas than we have in Australia. For example, history is one of my personal interests and I always find that in bookshops in, say, London or Washington-when I have the opportunity to visit them-the reference sections are much bigger and the range of books is astonishing compared to what is available in Australia. There is no doubt that the present system discourages publishers from taking the trouble to allow those books to be imported and I think the Australian consumer is being affected. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Parliament we always talk about human rights and political freedoms and I would have thought that access to books and ideas is a very basic freedom that this country should nurture, demand and protect in absolute terms. One way that any society can control or curtail ideas is to limit the circulation of books. Anyone who has visited countries with authoritarian regimes will note that the free distribution and circulation of books is always more restricted than in those countries that have democracies. Because of commercial arrangements, we have an unnecessarily restricted system of book distribution in Australia-a system that a democracy cannot afford to have. </PARA>
<PARA> In making those remarks, I do not want to see Australian authors penalised here by selling overseas and facing unfair competition from people who may try to get around the copyright arrangements. I believe that it is possible, even without the so-called 30-day limit, to allow the importation of books by Australian authors which are printed in overseas countries so long as we have a customs regime that ensures that when the books come through Customs the royalty rate paid in Australia on the same books will be placed on the books being imported-whether it is the mechanical copyright or any other copyright or commercial arrangement. I have not had a chance to discuss this with officials in the Australian Customs Service, but I am told unofficially that it is not impossible for such a system to work. In effect, the rate paid on imported books could be topped up and they could not be distributed in a way that gets around copyright. </PARA>
<PARA> I think many of the fears raised by the industry claiming that if we change anything in this area we are going to allow pirated books in-books without copyright-to wreck the Australian market are greatly exaggerated. Of course, there will always be some pirated books coming in. Some may get through Customs with an Australian returning from overseas with a suitcase full of books, but a suitcase full of books is not going wreck the book market in Australia for major publishers. </PARA>
<PARA> After hearing this evidence, I have come to the view that even the 30-day limit may not be necessary. I notice that in the legislation a three-year review period is proposed. That is clearly necessary because I suspect-and I hope I am proven wrong-that even this present Bill, which is a major step forward, in practice may not see the reduction in book prices that Australian consumers want and that the PSA says we should have, and would still see the restriction on access by Australians to the wider range of books that are available in other Western and comparable countries. </PARA>
<PARA> While in the Copyright Amendment Bill we are dealing with books, the Government has before it the whole question of copyright as it concerns importations in the area of records, compact discs and tapes. In my view, the book publishing industry has been much more flexible and realistic about accepting these changes than the Australian Record Industry Association, which has been conducting what I can only call a wicked campaign of misinformation about what would happen if changes to parallel imports were allowed in the record industry, which in my view has been putting forward some demonstrably false claims. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats will be moving amendments in the committee stage of the debate tomorrow. I have not seen those amendments yet. I understand that the Opposition amendments are similar to, if not the same as, those it moved in the House of Representatives. I am certainly interested to see what the Democrats put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) that, if those amendments enable us to ensure that books can be imported into this country with no risk to Australian authors' copyright and incomes being affected, and if at the same time we can ensure that there is a wider range of books available and more competition in the book market, it is in accordance with this Government's micro-economic reform policies that those amendments be looked at. I therefore encourage the Minister to look at those amendments when they are circulated. I look forward to hearing the debate in the committee stage. I hope that some of my fears about this Bill not going far enough to allow effective competition will be proved wrong; however, I suspect they are right. Certainly the review process will be needed. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the Minister that the three-year review process is too far away. Maybe within 18 months to two years we could get a pretty good grip on what is happening if this Bill is carried as is, or even with the amendments proposed. Any government's first priority should be to ensure that the Australian public has access to the widest range of books, because it is in books that there are ideas that overwhelmingly improve the cultural, social and political life of a community. It is ideas that make a democracy vibrant, and books are one of the major ways to spread those ideas. Any government must ensure that there is the widest opportunity for books to be available at reasonable prices to the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators who have contributed to the second reading debate on the important Copyright Amendment Bill 1991. This Bill is the Government's response to the widespread complaints throughout the Australian community that consumers have a right to access, as Senator Schacht so eloquently put it, the widest range of world literature, covering matters of important endeavours of the human mind and spirit, and works published for the enjoyment and entertainment of those who read them-not that those are necessarily mutually exclusive categories. Nevertheless, there is a whole range of material available in the form of books published overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a general understanding in the Australian community that we have had our access to that wonderful world restricted so that the availability of imported books has been less than it ought to be, and that this is because of the right of copyright owners to control the commercial importation of those books. There is also the question of whether prices have been inflated as a result of this control. </PARA>
<PARA> For my own part-and I think in harmony with much of the sentiment that has been expressed in the chamber-the question of the effect that the legislation before us will have on prices is perhaps more problematic than the effect that we hope to see in relation to availability. Most Australians who have an interest in reading would demand that the question of access to and availability of books be remedied by this Bill, and would feel that, if prices can be brought down, for example, through the availability of paperbacks, that will be a good thing too. Perhaps once again, to take up some of Senator Schacht's themes, it is the cultural impact of having access to the world of books that is so important for our development as a democratic society and a literate society. This proposal by the Government certainly provides a remedy to the perceived evil that I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the Prices Surveillance Authority put forward what for many was a very attractive proposal; that cannot be denied. It recommended the total repeal of the copyright owners' right of control over the importation of books, with two exceptions, namely, Australian authored books published separately in Australia and pirated copies. As one would expect, many consumer groups, media commentators and booksellers supported this proposal most vehemently. However, some authors and publishers and even other booksellers put up an argument that the wholesale repeal of copyright owners' control over imports would seriously damage authors' incomes and Australian publishers' viability. This particular plea was listened to by the Government. The Government concluded that complete repeal of the importation provisions would pose too great a risk to Australian literature in general and to Australian authors and Australian publishers in particular. Therefore we looked for a solution short of complete repeal. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the reforms are well understood by those who attended the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. They are quite clearly well understood by all contributors to the debate this afternoon, and I do not feel any compulsion to go into great detail in relation to those reforms.</PARA>
<PARA> Basically, if the Australian copyright holder of a new overseas title wishes to maintain his or her exclusive right to supply the Australian market, he or she will be required to publish simultaneously in Australia and to maintain adequate stocks of copies, including paperbacks. Otherwise, there will be an open market for the book, either generally after 30 days from overseas publication-if there is no publication in Australia within that time-or for those booksellers whose orders the copyright owner has been unable to fill for more than 90 days, until supply from that source is restored. We believe that this requirement meets the legitimate needs of publishers, booksellers and the readers of books in Australia. This will be very important for the cultural and democratic reasons which have been so well outlined by speakers, particularly Senator Schacht, this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that, after three years from commencement of the provisions of this Bill, an appropriate reference will be given to the Prices Surveillance Authority to determine the impact of the amendments on book prices, which is certainly one of the original concerns underlying the Government's proposals in this area. But this must not be highlighted and given overwhelming weight for perhaps being the prime motivation of the Government in putting forward this proposal. I believe that lies more in the question of accessibility to world literature in its various forms. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Senator Hill raised some matters during the second reading contribution that he made as Leader of the Opposition in this chamber. I will comment firstly on whether this Bill is consistent with the question of Australia's compliance with the Berne Convention. Senator Hill may know-and I think officers indicated at the meeting of the Committee-that when the idea emerged of limiting control over parallel imports to books first published in Australia, regardless of the author's nationality, the Office of International Law was consulted and it advised that to do so would be consistent with our Berne obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> When the draft Bill was first published for public exposure, commentary and consultation, the Intellectual Property Law Committee addressed the question of its conformity with Berne and concluded that there was no problem. That was the initial reaction of the Committee. Therefore, the submission that Senator Hill adverted to at the Committee hearings was certainly a complete surprise to us and to the officers. I understood that the officer indicated to Senator Hill that he would be placing the matter before me. </PARA>
<PARA> We immediately referred the Intellectual Property Law Committee's submission to the Office of International Law for an opinion. In an advice dated 14 August, Mr Burmester, principal adviser in the Office of International Law, confirmed his earlier advice that the Bill was in conformity with Australia's Berne obligations. He has rejected both grounds on which the IPLC reached its conclusion, which were to do with national treatment and formality. It may be convenient for the chamber if I tabled that opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has also proposed a second reading amendment to the Bill: firstly, asking Australia to promote a uniform regime in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; and, secondly, asking Australia to seek clarification or amendment of the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention concerning trade and distribution in intellectual property rights. I inform the chamber that Australia has been and will continue to be substantially involved in both these international matters. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Uruguay Round negotiations on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights-TRAIPS-Australia has been strongly pushing for a uniform regime on both standards and enforcement of intellectual property rights. However, Australia, along with many other countries, has not been advocating the inclusion of importation rights as part of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the international copyright conventions, Australia has traditionally been a very active participant in international meetings and will be attending a meeting on a possible protocol to the Berne Convention later this year. It is likely that the possible inclusion of importation rights in the convention will be raised and discussed as an issue at the meeting. As Australia has already taken a strong stance on these two matters, there is no need or reason for the proposed second reading amendment and the Government will not be supporting its passage. However, the Government does seek the early passage of the second reading of this Bill, which I commend to the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment negatived. </PARA>
<PARA> Original question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian National University Bill 1991 and the University of Canberra Amendment Bill 1991 are likely to have only a brief debate in the Senate. However, this is in huge contrast with their consideration in the House of Representatives where the legislation was guillotined through without one word being spoken and without the amendment that the Government moved even being understood by that chamber because it was not referred to. On behalf of the Opposition, I indicate that we will be supporting the two Bills before us, especially as they contain the late amendment that the Opposition had urged and which the Government has itself now moved. We will not be moving any additional amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not outline all the purposes of the two Bills as these were addressed in part by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) in the second reading speeches. However, I will refer to some purposes of the legislation which, remarkably, have not been addressed by the Minister. I will also make a few observations about the Government's attitude to these two important higher education institutions-the Australian National University and the University of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANU Bill has the particular purpose of providing for the amalgamation of the ANU with the Canberra Institute of the Arts from 1 January 1992. Amalgamations have been a big part of the disruptive and centralist Dawkins agenda for higher education and the Opposition has opposed the idea of amalgamations being forced by the Government rather than being by independent decision of the institutions concerned. However, in this case-and it is one of the rare cases-the Opposition raises no objection to the amalgamation. It is a sensible amalgamation-it is not a shotgun marriage-which was requested and supported by both the ANU and the institute. </PARA>
<PARA> Many months ago when discussion about the amalgamation first began, I was able to visit both the ANU and the fine arts and the music part of the Canberra Institute of the Arts. In every conversation I found real support for the principle of this amalgamation. All the Government needed to do was to ensure that some of the existing broad purposes of the Institute, particularly extending tuition beyond matriculated students or enrolled undergraduates, continued. These quite practical concerns have been sensibly considered and are taken into account in the terms of the amalgamation which we now support. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes without saying that both the ANU, a very important national university, and the institute, one of the finest arts institutions in Australia, are highly commendable higher education institutions in this country. We wish them well in this new amalgamation as the enhanced Australian National University. Mr Deputy President, I am very aware that you are a member of the Council of the ANU and that the purposes of that university are close to your heart and mind. I will talk about this Parliament's representatives a little later in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that much of the Minister's second reading speech was not about the Bill at all; it was a rather defensive statement about the Government's approach to funding for the Institute of Advanced Studies at the ANU. This was an enormous distraction because it is not the Institute of the Arts but the already long-existing research institution within the ANU-the Institute of Advanced Studies. I do not need to repeat my criticism of the way the evaluation of this research institute was handled and the way in which this Government responded in trying to subvert the proper responsibilities of the university in its own conduct of the research work of the Institute. Honourable senators will recall that the Government wanted to force the ANU and the University of Canberra-two large universities-to merge. It was only after there was massive resistance to this by the ANU, by the community and by the Opposition in this Parliament that the Government dropped that idea. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was referring to the ANU Bill and the University of Canberra Amendment Bill. I indicated that the Opposition will support both Bills and, indeed, the Government amendment for which we called. I was speaking of the attempts by the Government to amalgamate various universities. Many of these amalgamations have been unwise and forced and ought to have been resisted by the university communities, by the public at large and in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Notoriously, the Government of the day, especially Mr Dawkins and Mr Baldwin, have had several attempts to try to amalgamate the ANU with the University of Canberra. Personally, I have resisted those amalgamations because, unlike the one involved in the Bill amending the Australian National University Act, the earlier attempts were not sensible. </PARA>
<PARA> As a second-best attempt at interference in the ANU, the Government has been considering proposals for changing the funding for the Institute of Advanced Studies at the ANU, with the Australian Research Council being given the task by Ministers Dawkins and Baldwin of advising on the Institute of Advanced Studies. This would be a unique mechanism. No other institution is subject to this. The Opposition again deplores and rejects the Government's persistent heavy-handed intervention in the internal decision making of the university. </PARA>
<PARA> With the need for a Bill to merge the ANU and the Canberra Institute of the Arts on the other hand, the opportunity has been taken by this amending Bill to completely rewrite the ANU Act, to bring it up to date and to systematically make it more readable and understandable. This is the first complete revision of the Act since it was passed in 1946. I do not criticise this; in fact, I support it. It is a useful exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> But I criticise the fact that the Minister's speech and the explanatory memorandum make no mention of this revision. The Minister has not referred to this major rewriting and updating, however admirable its purpose. It is disgraceful that such a significant purpose of the Bill is not disclosed to the Parliament by the Government. Indeed, there was no mention of it in the House of Representatives' consideration of the Bill because there was not one word of debate as a result of the Bill being guillotined. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know why the Government is so coy about omitting to describe this, since this revision is satisfactory and quite defensible. The rewording of clauses, the reordering of clauses into a more logical order and the general overhaul of the Act has been done well, and we welcome it. All I am saying is that the Government should have drawn attention to it in putting this Bill before us. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one aspect that particularly affects the Parliament and which the Government did not mention. Again, it is a surprising omission that the Minister, in introducing a Bill, did not even mention that the Bill will halve the Council of the ANU. The Council will be reduced to its smallest number in the entire history of the Australian National University. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is actually a practical and sensible reform. The Opposition supports this change in the composition of the Council of the ANU. But I cannot understand why the Minister failed to mention this. Most of the categories of persons on the Council as currently constituted will have reduced numbers. Not only is the Opposition supporting this but also it is conscious of the support given by the ANU itself to this reform of its Council. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not received any direct representations from any interested party to oppose this change. My own inclination is to support the change, which will make the Council smaller, more manageable, practical and less verbose. The Council will be all the stronger for that. I cannot see disadvantages arising from the reduced numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the entire history of the ANU, the Parliament has been represented, as you know, Mr Deputy President, by two members of the House of Representatives and two members of the Senate. You, Mr Deputy President, are one of those parliamentary representatives. In the reform, this number will be halved. One of the two members will be the nominee of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the other will be the nominee of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), and those nominees may come from either House of the Parliament. This is a significant change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should have openly consulted with the Opposition about this change. I am not aware of any discussion at all, however sensible I think the outcome is. The two senators currently on the ANU Council are yourself, Mr Deputy President, and my colleague Senator Lewis. The two senators have been elected by the Senate for terms which run until 17 July 1992. Presumably, when this Bill comes into effect, the amended ANU Act will abruptly terminate the senators' terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the House of Representatives recently reappointed its two members, Dr Catley and Mr Ruddock, whose terms had almost expired, but they were reappointed only until the commencement of this Bill as an Act. Whilst we have not had the chance of direct personal discussion about this Bill, I discussed the whole matter with my Opposition colleague Senator Lewis. He also strongly supports the reduction in the size of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's handling of these Bills in the House of Representatives was deplorable. Under the ruthless guillotine applied by the Government, there was no debate on the ANU Bill and very little on the University of Canberra Amendment Bill. That is in itself disgraceful. But I observe that for some years now a number of us have been saying that there is only one legislative chamber left in this Parliament, and that is the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the iron majority, almost by definition, of the Government of the day in the other place, there is a singular lack of any mature possibility of a Bill proposed by the Government of the day being amended. I get the impression that what passes for legislative debate has its effect perhaps six months, two or more years hence after that debate in a telling argument being put by the other side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the case in this chamber that we sit longer hours and we are not, as a norm, guillotined. It is possible for majorities against the Government to amend legislation and, indeed, to throw legislation out. I make the observation that here again is another example of the Senate as a legislative chamber that is substantial and, I think, mature in the way in which it actually examines legislation. The Government, having guillotined this Bill, in the confusion of the guillotine has proceeded to insert some amendments while offering no explanation for them. I think that is treating that part of the Parliament with contempt. </PARA>
<PARA> The University of Canberra Amendment Bill is mainly the product of a long-running dispute between the Federal Government, in particular Mr Dawkins and Mr Baldwin, and the former ACT Government about the ACT Government's representatives on the Council of the University of Canberra. The ACT Government wished to nominate two members of the ACT legislature-one from the Australian Labor Party and one from the Residents Rally. This seems to me and to the Opposition to have been a reasonable step to take if the ACT Government regarded these people as the most appropriate persons to nominate to the University of Canberra Council. </PARA>
<PARA> It is frequently the case around Australia that State legislatures have representatives on the councils of universities within their borders. Given the particular local role of the University of Canberra it makes sense for the Territory's legislature to be represented on the Council, in just the same way as in every other capital city in Australia. Yet, with extraordinary arrogance, the Federal Ministers, Mr Dawkins and Mr Baldwin, rejected those nominees and insisted that members of the ACT Parliament were not acceptable. There was a stand-off for many months, making in part the University of Canberra Council not fully operational. </PARA>
<PARA> I was particularly concerned that for some of the meetings of the Council there was in fact a majority of in-house university members on the Council. These highly responsible people were rightly on the council but were representing, as the Vice Chancellor did, the whole university, or representing the staff or other internal interests of the university. In my view, no university council should have a majority of persons who have a direct financial and other interest in the actual decisions of that council. There ought to be a majority of external representatives on any such council. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no secret that some months ago the then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canberra came to see me, amongst many in this Parliament, to say that the Council was not fully workable and to ask whether there was any way of getting through the impasse that existed between the Federal Labor Ministers and the coalition and Liberal Ministers of the ACT Legislative Assembly. I put my mind to the matter. Mr Baldwin will recall my putting a proposal to him which happened to be personally well received at the time. Now, at the end of all these many months, far too many months for this Federal Government to have not been properly responsible to the University of Canberra, there is now this quite happy outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the great delay reflects no credit on the Minister's judgment. The stalemate dragged on and this Bill as originally drafted would actually have put into law the attitude of the Federal Government Ministers, which I have described. As I say, without any explanation and at the last minute, the proposition that we had been putting forward was put in as a Government amendment. I welcome the amendment nevertheless. It does meet the proposition that I and others in the Opposition had advocated. We are glad to see the Government's stalemate, as it were, collapse. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only suppose that Mr Dawkins and Mr Baldwin adopted their partisan view up until the time it looked as though the Liberal Government in the ACT would be defeated. We now have a Labor Government in the ACT. I can say only that that is the appearance; that the Ministers' stand-off evaporated as soon as their mates were in control of the ACT Government. That is no way to run a country. It is no way to make proper arrangements to stand for years for the good government of a university. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be the first to apologise if I can be convinced by the Ministers that there was any other reason, any reason of other substance, that led to this happy outcome whereby a proposal that many of us had supported is now being incorporated in this Bill. The reason that I do know is that no explanation was given for the Government's amendment when it was introduced into the House of Representatives. We deplore the process but we welcome the eventual outcome. It does not reflect well on the Federal Labor Government. Had the amendment, as now moved by the Government, been adopted right from the beginning there would have been none of the fuss and none of the concerns about the good government of the University of Canberra Council. I repeat that the Opposition supports both Bills and supports the amendment moved by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not be opposing either the Australian National University Bill 1991 or the University of Canberra Amendment Bill 1991. The amendments moved by the Government in the lower House satisfy our concerns in that they are rather innocuous in their effect as far as the organisations are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian National University Bill provides for the amalgamation of the Australian National University and the Canberra Institute of the Arts. There has been no objection to us regarding this merger so we see every reason to endorse the amalgamation. However, it is the case that the Government originally intended to effect a three-way merger including the Canberra College of Advanced Education, now the University of Canberra. This would have raised some considerable objection from us. In fact, any mention of such a merger will continue to raise our objections. </PARA>
<PARA> Three years ago the Australian Democrats opposed the merger on the ground that it was patently absurd. We opposed the merger for many reasons, including the fact that these institutions served different and distinct purposes. Our bottom line was that there was no educational benefit which we could perceive as being achieved by such a merger. It has been most disappointing that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) in his statement of 27 March this year on higher education in the ACT refused to rule out and, in fact, contemplated, a possible merger of the ANU and the University of Canberra at some future date. I share Senator Teague's concerns about the Government's attitude towards these institutions. I endorse his description of that attitude and his concern that it is a disruptive and centralist policy. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the other function of the ANU Bill that we are considering tonight is to reduce the size of the ANU's Council from 44 to 22 members, with the Chair of the Institute finishing that appointment as a twenty-third member during 1992. The Council will include two members appointed by the Chief Minister of the ACT, although they cannot be members of the Legislative Assembly. However, the Council already does include two Commonwealth parliamentarians and the ANU's administration is satisfied with these new Council arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council will maintain a similar balance of university and non-university appointees and will go from 20 staff and student members and 24 external members to nine and 13 respectively. Its new size seems reasonable and more in keeping with other universities. I recall one letter addressed to me on this matter which supported this reduction because of the unwieldy nature of the larger Council. While we have that in mind, the Democrats wish to note that some academics fear that the smaller Council could well be more susceptible to any future government moves for an amalgamation with the University of Canberra-that size is strictly a front, and there is the possibility of using it to expand opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> There will now be only one representative of some major categories of the university population, with no provision for substitutes if the sole representative is unable to attend a Council meeting. Undergraduate students, postgraduate students, Institute academic staff, faculty academic staff and university general staff will each only have one representative of their particular points of view. Each of those groups would remain unrepresented at some meetings if the sole Council member for that category was away. It does reduce the impact of the population, but it is only a minor concern and it is only perhaps my suspicious nature that leads me to express that concern here. </PARA>
<PARA> The University of Canberra Amendment Bill 1991 provides for the Chief Minister of the ACT Legislative Assembly to appoint two persons to that university Council. When this Bill was introduced, those nominees could not be members of the ACT Legislative Assembly. I believe that that proposal was extraordinary. It would have been opposed by the Democrats. As a matter of fact, we expressed our dissatisfaction when it was first mentioned. The appointment of local politicians is standard procedure at other Australian universities, and it is reasonable and valuable for elected members to be sitting on university boards. It not only benefits the institutions to have that link, but it also allows informed debate on higher education-as we have the opportunity to hear informed debate-in this place because of the links that we have with university institutions and their representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Bill's introduction, the Federal Government has amended that suggestion, and will remove the restriction on the appointment of the local politicians to the university Council and we endorse that move. The reporting of that has been slightly colourful. I would not endorse the colourful nature of it, but suffice it to say that we are pleased to see that it has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats support the amended Bill which allows for those MLAs to be represented. We have also argued for some time-and now renew the call on the Federal Government-for the introduction of legislation to transfer control of the University of Canberra to the ACT Government. This view has been supported by the Stephen Committee for Higher Education in the ACT, the University of Canberra, the ANU and even the Federal Opposition, as I recall. </PARA>
<PARA> In his 27 March statement, Mr Baldwin backed away from the immediate threat to dismember the ANU and to merge its faculties within the University of Canberra. The threat then shifted to the research arm of the Australian National University, that being the Institute of Advanced Studies. In a letter to the Australian National University last week, Mr Baldwin confirmed these Government plans, despite strong protests from the ANU itself, and it is with great concern that we have learned of this. </PARA>
<PARA> The plans include considering the role of the Australian Research Council in reviewing and advising on funding for each of the Institute's research schools. The Government has also indicated that the John Curtin School of Medical Research will be funded through the National Health and Medical Research Council. The ANU and the University of Canberra are also expected to jointly negotiate their educational profiles with the Commonwealth as the basis for the allocation of funds. The emphasis is on the word `jointly'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Baldwin is overstepping the mark in ignoring all objections to these proposals. I would have thought that the message might have sunk through by now. His persistence in following this line is really stubborn beyond belief and ill-advised. At this stage I will mention that the ANU maintains that the different schools within the Institute of Advanced Studies-the research arm of the ANU-should not be reviewed for funding as separate entities. It is well known that the attacks against the John Curtin School represent a small and secretive source. In the words of the ANU Administrator, Ron Hohnen, in the Canberra Times dated 20 May 1991, the Stephen Committee's original recommendations to turn the funding of the John Curtin School over to the NHMRC were `quite incredible and unsubstantiated findings'. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I hope that the Minister will respond to the many valid concerns about the Government's proposals. At least there will be further consultations-and I stress the word `consultations'-with the ANU over these matters. I have taken this opportunity to endorse this legislation and also to express our concerns for the other plans that the Government has for the Australian National University because they are so immediate. However, in this case we see absolutely nothing to criticise in the plans embodied in these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating two Bills relating to the Australian National University and the University of Canberra and I will speak about these separately. The University of Canberra Amendment Bill 1991 provides for certain administrative changes. The Government finally caved in and allowed the Chief Minister of the ACT Legislative Assembly, rather than the Governor-General, to appoint ACT members directly to the Council. The Bill also provides for the membership of the University of Canberra Council to be increased from 17 to 22 members. In addition, the university is now able to appoint the Chancellor either from outside or inside the membership of its Council in line with other higher education institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition will be supporting both of these Bills, but I wish to confine the remainder of my remarks to the second Bill. The Australian National University Bill 1991 provides for the amalgamation of the ANU and the Canberra Institute of Arts from 1 January 1992. The second reading speech refers to a statement made by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) earlier this year on arrangements for higher education in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> In that statement, he endorsed new administrative arrangements which will encourage the Australian National University and the University of Canberra to coordinate their efforts and to cooperate more closely in order to provide the best possible educational opportunities for the region. He also endorses new funding arrangements for the Institute of Advanced Studies of the Australian National University which, according to the Minister, enhance the Institute's role as a national resource and result in appropriate performance evaluation and peer review process to guarantee the best use of research funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The research schools of the Institute of Advanced Studies are to be funded in future by the Australian Research Council and, in the case of the John Curtin Medical School of Research, the National Health and Medical Research Council. This proposal was opposed by the Chancellor of the ANU, Sir Geoffrey Yeend, who was appalled by this entirely new funding proposal and the fact that it had been announced without any prior consultation. At the time, Sir Geoffrey said:</PARA>
<PARA>There was a time when governments were protective of academic independence. Now we have a quite open attempt to divide the university and bring it further under the control of a government department and government agencies . . . . As long as I am Chancellor I shall resist any such attempt. </PARA>
<PARA>The second reading speech states that Mr Baldwin met with the ANU Council in May and that this meeting provided the Minister with the opportunity to clarify a number of key points with the council. This meeting did little to allay the fears of the institute. There is still concern about the new funding and reporting arrangements which are deemed to threaten the autonomy of the university. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent development in this saga is a letter from Mr Baldwin to the Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, in which he says that he is adamant that the decisions outlined in March about the future of higher education arrangements in the ACT will be implemented-that is, that the Australian Research Council will report to the Government on appropriate funding levels for the Institute of Advanced Studies, and that the Australian Research Council will review funding for the institute's seven research schools on a five-yearly basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In this letter to the Vice Chancellor the Minister indicates that he is not listening to further argument and that he has said his last words on this matter. He says that it is in `all our interests' to work cooperatively to implement these decisions. He says that he has noted the ANU concerns about the role of the Australian Research Council but believes it appropriate that the institute be assessed and that its funding be set against other potential users of research funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government might believe it is legitimate and appropriate to be able to receive expert advice from the Australian Research Council as the only body with a broad based knowledge of research activities throughout the higher education system as to the overall distribution of research funds between the Institute of Advanced Studies and the rest of the higher education system, but not so the scholars, the people who perform the valuable research at the Institute of Advanced Studies. The Baldwin pronouncements have created nothing but consternation. People at the institute are concerned that the proposal to place them under the financial control of the Australian Research Council could have very damaging consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the institute's industrial partners might wonder whether they should continue their collaborative research programs and maintain their financial commitments. In some cases, this amounts to millions of dollars in equipment and support. Multinational corporations have made investments in the ANU because they considered that this university was an Australian research flagship in higher education and would continue to hold a pre-eminent place. They are concerned that proposals that destroy or dilute the university's reputation in research, rearrange its funding or frighten away talented young graduates will do nothing to encourage interaction with foreign interests which is vital for the nation's good, especially in the high technology area. </PARA>
<PARA> But they are even more alarmed at the prospect of being at the mercy of the Australian Research Council. ANU academics believe that the ARC is heavily politicised. They have no faith in its judgment. The Research Council appears to have its own agenda with regard to the Institute of Advanced Studies. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Max Neutze, is doubtful about the rationale of the Dawkins and Baldwin higher education proposals. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the whole rationale of the higher education reforms has been to harness research to national needs and to make government and its various councils the main arbiters of what national needs are and to use the ARC to achieve it. </PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, Professor Neutze believes there is a great advantage in having a plurality of sources in decisions about research priorities. Other academics are concerned about the proposed loss of plurality in research funding. They argue that if the research agenda were determined by the same people then bio-medical research, for instance, might be subject to the same mistakes. Under the Baldwin proposals, the John Curtin School of Medical Research is threatened with subjection to the National Health and Medical Research Council funding authority. The school is justifiably perturbed by attacks on an institution which has an excellent international reputation; it has produced a Nobel prize winner and received many other prestigious international prizes and has numerous fellows of the Royal Society. </PARA>
<PARA> The head of the Division of Cell Biology, Professor Bob Blanden, says that party political motives and ideology are attempting to level research in the institute by taking away its budget and reducing the amount of research that is done in the institute without any consideration for quality. He believes that the ANU is in imminent danger of being led down the Eastern European path. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>You have a unified system and everyone has to conform. You don't have diversity any more and if someone gets out of line you kick the stuffing out of them. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Blanden predicted centralised control and planning without plurality and without freedom. Yet the whole point of basic research is that when one gets on the track of something new and exciting one goes after it, whether or not it is in the strategic plan. The most damaging aspect of the Baldwin proposal is perceived to be the proposal that funding for the Institute of Advanced Studies be the sum of the funding for the different research schools. That is seen to be taking away from the university its own responsibility for strategic planning and priority setting, which goes across all of the research schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Baldwin proposal makes each of the schools a strategic research centre, and each is to be funded as such. This is seen to be the death knell of the institute. The report of Sir Ninian Stephen's review team concerning the Institute of Advanced Studies states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in most respects the Institute has met outstandingly well its charter of engaging in research and providing advanced training to the highest international standard and in areas of national importance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition recognises that the Australian Research Council has a legitimate role to play in the overall evaluation of research in Australian universities, but it should not use grant allocation powers to run the Institute of Advanced Studies. One does not put Dracula in charge of the blood bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal policy is to ensure and enshrine the autonomy of the universities, and when we are in government we will be returning to them much greater freedom to chart their own futures without the heavy conformist constraints presently placed upon them by the Commonwealth. Above all, we will scrap the present Government's policy guidelines for the Australian Research Council and establish a system that will reduce bureaucratic interference and ensure that excellence in research is supported to the full extent of the community's ability to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's justification for this entirely iniquitous interference with the autonomy and funding arrangements of the Institute of Advanced Studies occupies two-thirds of the second reading speech on the Australian National University Bill which, in the words of the Minister, is `entirely separate from these new arrangements for higher education in the ACT'. All of this was included in the second reading speech as a political exercise and had nothing to do with the present Bill, which simply proposes to amalgamate the Canberra Institute of the Arts with the Australian National University. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National University Bill is an amalgamation Bill. It is part of the Government's new unified national system of higher education to replace the previous binary system, which differentiates between universities and colleges of advanced education. Under the unified national system there are to be fewer and larger institutions of higher education as a result of the amalgamations. The Australian National University was in the firing line to be amalgamated with the then Canberra College of Advanced Education and the Canberra Institute of the Arts. We opposed that amalgamation because there were no educational or financial benefits to be gained from a merger between the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education. But, on the other hand, there were serious disadvantages associated with industrial relations and vocational specialisation. The coalition opposes the Government's unified national system because it threatens the independence of higher education facilities all around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Government withdrew the Australian National University Bill in 1988 which, in effect, would have created a three-way merger, that does not appear to be the end of the story. Only last Friday Mr Baldwin was reported to have said that, while he acknowledges that the ANU and the University of Canberra are separate institutions at present with freedom to develop separate academic profiles, there will still be joint negotiation of those profiles and the two universities should consider a federated model of amalgamation and proceed towards that end in the future. What he was trying to achieve in 1988 seems to be coming about in another way in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the merger of the two under the current proposal between the ANU and the Canberra Institute of the Arts is a different matter. The two institutions that make up the institute-the Canberra School of Music and the Canberra School of Art-are already situated next to the ANU campus and there has been a very strong liaison between the three establishments for many years. As I indicated earlier, the coalition will be supporting this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is considering two Bills, the Australian National University Bill 1991 and the University of Canberra Amendment Bill 1991. I intend to speak almost entirely on the first, the Australian National University Bill, principally because I am one of the Senate's representatives on the Council of the Australian National University. Before considering aspects of the Bills, I would like to outline something of the history of the Australian National University because it is interesting to see where the university has come from to where it is now and to outline some of the problems that now face the university as a result of the way it has developed and the way that tertiary institutions throughout Australia have developed at the same time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian National University, or the ANU as most people refer to it, was originally established as a research and postgraduate institution under the Australian National University Act 1946. At that time the ANU was Australia's only research-oriented university. It remained a research institution only until 1960. In that year undergraduate teaching facilities were acquired through amalgamation with the Canberra University College. That college had, until then, awarded its degrees through the University of Melbourne. The original Australian National University then became the Institute of Advanced Studies. The undergraduate schools formed the School of General Studies, which later became known, and are now known, as the faculties. This gave the Australian National University two distinct but related parts-the Institute of Advanced Studies, the institute as it is called, and the faculties. There are now several research schools which carry out research and graduate training in the biological, medical, physical, chemical, earth and social sciences as well as in the important area of Pacific studies. </PARA>
<PARA> The teaching departments or faculties are in the Faculties of Arts, Asian Studies, Economics and Commerce, Law and Science. There is considerable interaction between the two parts of the university and this is increasing. The statutory functions of the university, as specified in the Australian National University Act 1946, are:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) the encouragement and provision of facilities for graduate research and study, both generally and in relation to subjects of national importance to Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) the provision of facilities for university education for persons who elect to avail themselves of those facilities and who are eligible to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>The first of these two functions broadly describes what occurs in the Institute of Advanced Studies. The second describes one of the main functions of the faculties. The faculties, however, have a commitment to research and graduate training in a similar way to other Australian universities. The institute constitutes about two-thirds of the academic life of the university and the faculties the other third. </PARA>
<PARA> The four original schools of the Institute of Advanced Studies were the Research Schools of Pacific Studies, Physical Sciences and Social Sciences and the John Curtin School of Medical Research. It was not until 1967 that two more research schools were added. These were Biological Sciences and Chemistry. In 1973 the Research School of Earth Sciences was added to the institute. These particular fields of research were chosen because of their importance to Australia or because they could be studied to advantage in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it consists of two separate but interacting parts, the university operates under a single administration, headed by the Vice-Chancellor, and governed by a council composed of 44 members. Members of the council are elected representatives of academic and general staff, graduate and undergraduate bodies and the Convocation of the University. Four representatives are elected by the Federal Parliament, two from the Senate and two from the House of Representatives, and some are appointed by the Governor-General. The council meets about eight times a year under the chairmanship of the Chancellor. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National University Bill makes what I consider to be two major changes. The Bill provides for the amalgamation of the Australian National University and the Canberra Institute of the Arts as from 1 January next year. The Australian National University and the Canberra Institute of the Arts actually finalised an affiliation agreement to amalgamate by 1 January this year. Legislation to give effect to that amalgamation has therefore been long awaited both by the ANU and the Institute of the Arts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill abolishes the Institute of the Arts as a separate institution and adds to the functions of the university the requirement that it provide facilities for courses at higher education and other levels in the visual and performing arts. The Bill also provides for students and staff of the Institute of the Arts to be transferred to the university on terms and conditions no less favourable than they enjoy at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, has said that the amalgamation can be expected to enhance the national and international roles of the university through the addition of the visual and performing arts to its range of disciplines, while at the same time allowing the Institute of the Arts to become a member of the unified national system. It would not have been possible for the institute with its small student load to become a member of the unified national system of higher education in its own right. Mr Baldwin, in his second reading speech in relation to this amalgamation, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The amalgamation will permit students from both institutions to benefit from a wider range of course options. The development of higher degree courses at the Institute of the Arts will benefit from the university's greater experience in graduate education. In addition, the consolidation of adjacent campuses under one administration will lead to cost efficiencies and the rationalisation of shared services and amenities. The local community can expect to enjoy greater benefits from an expansion of university extension programs with the addition of more musical, art, and gallery activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major change is that the Bill also provides for changes to the composition of the council. This matter was mentioned earlier by previous speakers and Senator Teague went into it in a fair amount of detail. Most of those who have been members of the council would agree that a 44-member council is far too large. The new council will comprise about half that number and, because of that, the representation from the Federal Parliament will be reduced to two members from the current four members. As a long time representative of the Senate on the university council, I consider that having fewer members on the council will streamline the council's operations. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention some of those who will be members of the council. Honourable senators will be able to see that some of these members will be from within the university and some will be external. The internal members include the Chancellor, the Pro-Chancellor, the Vice-Chancellor, the chairperson of the board of the institute and the chairperson of the board of the faculties. People from outside the university include four persons appointed by the Governor-General-I imagine that the appointment of those four persons by the Governor-General will be on the advice of the Government of the day-one person being a senator or member of the House of Representatives, appointed by the Governor-General on the nomination of the Prime Minister; and one person being a senator or a member of the House of Representatives appointed by the Governor-General on the nomination of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives. It is likely, from those two positions, that we would have one person from the Government and one person from the Opposition-unless, of course, the Australian Democrats were interested in obtaining a place on the council and convinced the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition to nominate one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Two persons are to be appointed by the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory. These positions are new. No persons were appointed to the former council at the recommendation of the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory. As Senator Teague outlined, these persons are not to be members of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian Capital Territory. Other persons-some from within the university, including staff and student representatives, and also people from outside the university-will be appointed to the council. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it is not particularly pertinent to the Bill under discussion, I would like to make a brief comment about the future role of the university. When the Institute of Advanced Studies was established, there was little major research work being carried out in universities in Australia. The present situation, however, is far different. There are many major universities in the Commonwealth and some of these carry out excellent research work. Without denigrating other universities in Queensland, I consider research undertaken at the University of Queensland and at the Queensland University of Technology to be world-class. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators would be able to give examples of similar research being carried out in the States they represent. This does not mean that the Institute of Advanced Studies is no longer relevant, but it does mean that the institute has to compete with other higher education institutions for the research money made available by the Federal Government. This has created some difficulties because, for a long time, any review of research activities in the institute has been by peer review. With other institutions vying for research funds, however, some form of external review of the institute's activities is essential. Neither the university as a whole nor the institute has fully come to grips with this new development. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANU was once the only university in Canberra. There are, however, university facilities at the University of Canberra and at the military establishments in the city. Canberra can probably accommodate two universities, but in some areas it would be best if significant cooperation could take place between the ANU and the University of Canberra. I cannot speak with authority about the University of Canberra in this regard, but the ANU has not yet come to terms with this particular development. For the benefit of students in the Canberra region, as well as those who come from more far-flung areas, and for the benefit of academic excellence, this factor will have to be addressed in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> Before concluding, I would like to comment on a matter that Senator Teague mentioned. He implied-a little tongue-in-cheek, I think-that perhaps the amendment in relation to the Bill for the University of Canberra came about because the Federal Government saw that there was about to be a change of government in the ACT and decided to acquiesce and introduce the Bill in its current form. I think that that is probably incorrect. I have not checked with Mr Baldwin, and I am not quite sure that I will either. However, I do not think it is correct. I saw the Bill very early in the year when it was ready to go and, if my recollection is correct, it was in its current form. I note that the Bill to amend the University of Canberra Act was sent from the House of Representatives to the Senate on 30 May 1991. About seven days after that there was a change of government in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill had been in the House of Representatives for some time. I would agree with Senator Teague that it was not debated very well in the House of Representatives, but it had been there for some time. When the Bill came to us there had not been a change of government in the ACT. I think it is probably coincidental that the two events occurred fairly close together, rather than there being any specific plan to put the Bill forward because there was a change of government in the ACT, or one was impending. Like the Minister, I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was quoted in the Australian newspaper of 13 March 1991 as observing that securing the future of Australia involves being, like Japan and Germany, `a clever country' and that `the foundation of a clever country is its education system'. I do not think there would be any Australians who would argue with those sentiments, but the reality is a long way from it. Any hope of Australia's becoming a clever country has, I believe, been shattered by the insensitivity and destructive power of the Dawkins approach to education and, ultimately, the irresponsibility of the Government's handling of higher education in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This evening we are debating the University of Canberra Amendment Bill 1991 and the Australian National University Bill 1991. The University of Canberra Amendment Bill provides for a variation in the audit requirements of the University of Canberra and a change in the qualifications and method of appointment of members of the council from the ACT, including an amendment to permit the Chief Minister of the ACT to appoint members of the Legislative Assembly to the council of the University of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> This aspect of the legislation has been touched upon by others in this debate, and I see little purpose in going over it again, except to marvel at the way the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) seeks to say that the ACT Government should be able to appoint someone to the council but that it should not be one of its own number. The Minister knows full well that this chamber and the House of Representatives appoint people to the council of the Australian National University and appoint from their own number. The Minister sought to take it upon himself to decide that those elected by the people of the ACT were not sufficiently worthy to be appointed to the council of the University of Canberra. He held out for a very long time against permitting the ACT Government to be able to appoint one of its own number to the council of the University of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANU Bill effects the amalgamation of the Canberra Institute of the Arts and the Australian National University. Unlike many other amalgamations, and proposed amalgamations, this one has been an amiable resolution between the two institutions. In fact, the Bill has been long awaited by both parties. The Bill was introduced before Christmas last year and people were hoping that it would be passed then; they were certainly hoping that it would be passed in the autumn session this year. However, over the months the Bill has been caught up with the Government's other agenda for universities and amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA> The two Bills before us tonight are not opposed by the Opposition, but there are things that need to be said about tertiary education, lest allowing them to pass without comment were to be taken as our generally agreeing to the line that the Australian Labor Party has pursued with respect to tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken on this matter previously. The list of failures of the Government is still the same: the increasing interference and interventionist policies which are being pursued; the policy of forced amalgamations; the failure to make inroads into the level of unmet demand; the reduced funding per tertiary student; and the question of staff salaries. Of course, there has been a new salary package for academics but, when we think of how far they have been behind, I suspect that the academics are still out of pocket. In many institutions where there are significant over-enrolments, it can only be the staff who are carrying the burden of over-enrolments. If the Government is not paying and the students are not paying, it can only be a burden that is being borne by the staff of those institutions. The list of failures continues: the failure to provide tertiary institutions with the freedom and flexibility needed to address the impending shortage of academic staff; the neglect of the fundamental issue of quality in education; and the disruption and continuing insecurity as a result of the Government's policy over these recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the matter of the increasing interference and interventionist policies of this Government, the whole higher education system is being brought under increasing and direct political control from Canberra. This has inevitably led to an undermining of institutional autonomy. The whole concept of a unified system and the intrusive educational profiles process continues to be an administrative nightmare and smacks of undue central control. I should like to quote from somebody whose credentials in tertiary education would not be denied. I refer to Mr Frank Hambly, the Executive Director of the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee. On 28 September 1990 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is little doubt that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training is attempting to achieve a uniform system of tertiary education and not just a unified system. This whole policy is more about central control than national standards. </PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that everybody ought to listen to the words and comments of Mr Hambly. </PARA>
<PARA> We have, too, the argument of Professor Peter Karmel in August 1989 that the Dawkins reforms meant that the Federal Government was intervening more in tertiary institutions and he warned that the bureaucratic tendency to coordinate-which really means control-must be watched closely. Then on 28 May this year, when introducing a statement in the other place, Mr Baldwin indicated that the Government would transfer funding from the John Curtin School of Medical Research to the National Health and Medical Research Council, and that separate reviews would be conducted of each of the research schools and centres of the Institute of Advanced Studies on a five-yearly basis. These reviews were to recommend directly to the Minister the levels of funding for each school and centre. In other words, the John Curtin School of Medical Research would no longer be the institution that it had been, that is, it would not be able to obtain its funding and to decide on the research which should be undertaken. It would virtually be under the direct control of the Minister following the changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The implication of these decisions is unmistakable. They are aimed at breaking up the Institute of Advanced Studies and removing effective control of the institute from the university. I do not doubt that anybody who has followed this debate has any doubt at all that that is the aim of the Minister as far as the Institute of Advanced Studies is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the decision to place the institute under the control of the Australian Research Council is directly contrary to the recommendations of the Stephen Committee which reviewed the institute and made a specific and clear recommendation that this should not happen. The Stephen Review for higher education in the ACT emphasised and endorsed the most important principle that research funding in this country should not be under monopolistic control but should come from a variety of sources so that a different perspective could be brought to bear on the merits of different areas of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Understandably, the Australian National University Council has objected most strongly to this review process because of the threat it poses to the university's autonomy and to freedom of inquiry. The ANU, I suggest to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, faces a far greater level of control than that of any other university in Australia and it is, therefore, easier for the Minister to attempt to do this at this university. These quite legitimate concerns about unnecessarily intrusive controls are reflected nationally and internationally.</PARA>
<PARA> The review arrangements will mean, in effect, that the Institute of Advanced Studies will be managed not by the ANU Council but by government research councils. The ANU will become a university that no longer sets its own research agenda or allocates its own resources. Support for the ANU Council's efforts to preserve the university's integrity and autonomy is widespread. I quote from Professor Peter Karmel who said in the ANU Reporter:</PARA>
<PARA> The ANU is an outstanding institution and is recognised as such internationally . . .</PARA>
<PARA> It contains a great concentration of distinguished scholars and scientists, as can be testified objectively by an examination of the membership of the learned academies of Australia, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, and by its output of research and publications. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think there is any doubt that the Government is attempting to destroy the Australian National University. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing in the debate over the months and years that it has now gone on, apart from its very disruptive nature, has been that never once have I heard the Minister talking about benefits to students. It has always been something else. It would be my view that the universities are there to benefit the students of this country, to see that they get the sort of education needed, and that there be some hope of fulfilling the idea that we should become a clever country. But never once has the Minister talked about a benefit to students. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed to make any inroads into a level of unmet demand in tertiary institutions. They are being squeezed with declining funding and a sharp rise in the number of students at universities, and this is causing a deepening crisis. The Government is very keen to boast about retention rates of students continuing to year 12 in secondary schools. The inevitable consequence of this, if there is any success at all in the education systems of this country, is that students will then wish to proceed to tertiary education. Yet the opportunity for them to do so is limited. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that some of those students proceeding to year 12 would have been better, at perhaps year 10, to have gone into other courses whereby they may have been able to obtain employment rather than to have been misled into thinking that there was something magical about year 12 following which they could not proceed with their education. It is time that somebody had a think about that if there is to be no effort to make the places available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed to recognise that increased participation rates raise the expectation of children leaving school. I understand that at the University of Canberra at present there are about 23 per cent more students than the funding provided for. Some measures will need to be taken by the university to introduce controlled admissions for 1992 so that this does not happen again. I have heard a number of explanations as to why there have been such massive over-enrolments. I find none of them terribly convincing, and I do not understand how it could reach massive proportions. Some over-enrolments I can understand but, as I said earlier, if the Government is not paying by giving funds to the universities and if the students are not paying, it is definitely members of the staff who are bearing the unfair burden of these additional student numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the question of the failure to provide institutions with the freedom and flexibility needed to address the impending shortage of academic staff. It has been suggested that there will be a shortage of up to 25,000 staff by the year 2000. What is going to be done to correct that imbalance? Again, it is all very well to be encouraging students to complete year 12 and have the expectation that they can proceed to a tertiary course. If there are no staff to teach them, we are not doing them much of a favour at all. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a neglect of the fundamental issue of quality in education. I turn to the remarks of Senator Aulich, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, who acknowledged that the Minister is so absorbed in financial and structural change that he has neglected the fundamental issue of quality in tertiary education. Uniformity does not automatically produce quality in tertiary education, and I think it is time that the Minister thought about that. The Government may well boast a 50 per cent increase in tertiary enrolments since Labor came into Government, but funding has declined by 11 per cent. As a proportion of our gross domestic product, Commonwealth expenditure on higher education was 1.05 per cent in 1980-81. In 1989-90 it was 0.85 per cent. There is, as a consequence, continuing disruption and insecurity in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1988 the proposal to amalgamate the ANU with the then Canberra College of Advanced Education was first put forward as part of the Dawkins plan for higher education. It was evident that the Minister was more concerned with administrative neatness and control than with increasing educational standards. He was more concerned about administration than he was about the benefit to students. </PARA>
<PARA> At the relatively early stage of August 1989 in this ongoing and disruptive saga, the Minister was quoted in a press article as being sympathetic to the concerns raised by the university and the CCAE about the damage that would be done to their academic programs if there were to be continuing, drawn-out uncertainty about their future status and mission, yet from August 1989 he has not worried in the slightest about the impact of the disruptive path which he has been determined to follow. In September 1989 the proposed amalgamation of the ANU, the CCAE and the Canberra Institute of the Arts was called off after the ANU Council voted against the merger. The Canberra Times reported the following on 13 September 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>There will definitely be no amalgamation between the ANU and the CCAE, according to the Minister for Education, John Dawkins. </PARA>
<PARA>What are we to think about that statement and the Minister's motives when he said it? I really cannot comment on that, but it certainly was not the end of the matter. In January 1990 he was back at it again. The report of the Stephen committee was presented in November 1990. He obviously did not like what he found in that report, so what did he do? He employed Professor Ian Chubb to review the Stephen report and, purportedly, to tell him how the Stephen report should be implemented. Anybody who has read both reports would know that there is very little in common between the two and, I would say, absolutely no relation between them. I am not quite sure how that came about, but it was very clear to me from reading those reports that the implementation of the Stephen report was not in any way associated with the recommendations of the Chubb report. The Chubb report has been opposed very strongly within the ANU. Many would be aware of the number of petitions that have been presented in this place, urging the Government not to proceed with the merger, not to proceed to destroy the institutions that have served this community and Australia so well. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point that I have already made about the Government having a go again at the Institute of Advanced Studies by interfering with the funding of the John Curtin School of Medical Research. It is interesting to reflect on what Minister Dawkins said on 15 June 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this Government has explicitly stated that it will support only mergers which have the support of the institutions concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>He seems to say one thing but do another. We can only laugh at that comment when we review what in fact has happened with the institutions in the Australian Capital Territory. But the Government's plan to amalgamate the ANU and the University of Canberra is not dead even now. When we look at the statements of Mr Baldwin in the other place on 28 May 1991, we see that he invited the councils of the ANU and the University of Canberra to consider a federated model of amalgamation of the two institutions `with progress to full integration'. It is quite clear that the Government is absolutely determined to have its way in this matter, no matter the evidence before it, no matter the disruption to the institutions and the students and staff of those institutions. The continuing uncertainty about the future of the ANU has caused enormous morale problems within the ANU and has significantly damaged the university's ability to attract and keep top quality staff and students. I refer to a Canberra Times article of 23 May 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Osmond warned that though the world-wide chorus of derision would soon abate, the humiliation of Australian academe, and denial of its autonomy, would drive the ``highest fliers away in droves''. </PARA>
<PARA>What a fine outcome for the policies of this Minister. I hope that he is not proud of what he has achieved. There is evidence now that there is to be a national campaign against the Government over its handling of higher education. A recent article in the ANU Reporter talks of the steps some academics are planning to take to let people know what is happening. I believe that it is important that Australians understand and fully appreciate the attack on tertiary education by looking at the microcosm of the ACT and what in fact has happened with the Australian National University and the University of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be a tragedy if these two institutions are destroyed by whatever it is that drives this Minister towards his particular brand of socialism in the area of tertiary education. I support the two Bills that we are discussing this evening, but I think it is important that we keep in mind exactly what we are facing in this very important area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1991 as far as it provides wildlife protection. This Bill amends the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 which regulates the export and import of flora and fauna. Australia is a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna and cooperates with the Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce, known as TRAFFIC. As well as increasing penalties for illegal actions, the Bill contains changes aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of legitimate trade in wildlife and wildlife products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I deal with the main elements of the Bill, I point out that this Bill and its method of presentation is an example of the sort of messy management we tend to get from the Government. It rushes legislation into the other place and then finds that it has made a mess of it and has to go back and correct it. Honourable senators will no doubt be intrigued to note that in the House of Representatives Hansard of 21 June 1991 on pages 5298 and 5299 a whole host of amendments had to be made to the Bill before it even got out of that chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of protest from the Opposition I might say that we are getting pretty sick and tired of slapdash, half-baked legislation, no matter how well intentioned, coming into the House of Representatives and being rushed through without proper debate and proper preparation, and then being subject to substantial amendment. That does not detract from the fact that we support the thrust of this legislation. We just wish that this process could be done more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> The main provisions of the Bill increase custodial penalties from five to 10 years for wildlife smuggling; tighten a definition in the Act to prevent importers using Australia as a holding area while they arrange markets in other countries; restrict to six the maximum number of household pets people may take with them when leaving Australia; and give the Minister greater flexibility in determining whether to allow trade in certain common species without the need for a management plan. </PARA>
<PARA> We support this Bill because the coalition's environment policy which substantially predates this Bill-it was released in February 1990-strongly supports all the things that the Bill is setting out to do. In particular, the coalition's environment policy at that time specifically called for stronger penalties. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 will be kept up to date, the penalties under it increased and more resources devoted to its enforcement. The States will be encouraged to introduce complementary legislation to support this regime. </PARA>
<PARA>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) will be supported fully and Australia will play a more active role in its further development. </PARA>
<PARA>We will continue to co-operate with the excellent work done by TRAFFIC (Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce).</PARA>
<PARA>We are very glad to see that the Government has followed the policy statement that was put out by the Opposition before the 1990 election. It is in fact following the Opposition's lead. I commend the Government for having the humility and the good sense to do what the Opposition has recommended. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention that in New South Wales, the Minister for Environment, Mr Tim Moore, announced three years ago that the Greiner Government would double penalties for smuggling to 10 years gaol. That has since been done. Mr Moore also called on the Commonwealth to step up its enforcement efforts. So I stress that basically what the Government is doing with this legislation is what the coalition Opposition in the Federal arena has been pressing for and what the Liberal-National State Government in New South Wales had been urging it to do. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second reading speech in the other place, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) referred to a recent court action in which the judge specifically remarked on the desirability of a heavier penalty. Discussions that the shadow Minister for environment, Mr Chaney, has had with one prominent private operator in the nature conservation field and with the head of a State government authority have confirmed his view about growing interest in alternative means of protecting native Australian wildlife. For example, the development of commercial breeding and controlled trade has benefited wildlife populations in parts of Africa and elsewhere and merits further investigation, given that blanket prohibition guarantees very high prices on the illegal market. In other words, a little bit of lateral thinking in this area could well be fairly useful in resolving what is becoming a problem of some magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not yet in a position to pursue this matter by making any formal recommendations or proposed amendments to this legislation, but I do think that it is a matter that the Government could look at. After all, it has taken advice from the Opposition in all the other elements of this Bill. Perhaps it could start taking some advice from us on adopting a more rational approach to this problem, as we recommend. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, the coalition will not delay the House on this matter, apart from asking the Government to look at the general proposition that I have raised about alternative methods of dealing with the problem. I commend the Bill-heavily amended and heavily corrected-to the chamber. I thank the Government for having taken our very good advice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1991. I support my colleague Senator Michael Baume who has spoken today to this Bill. The purpose of this Bill, as has already been pointed out, is to allow the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to exempt the export and import of certain plant and animal specimens and to allow for an increase in the maximum term of imprisonment for offences against this Act from five years to 10 years, with or without a fine. It also allows the Minister to make certain declarations concerning management programs, including transport of such animals that are legalised for transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a vast number of successful prosecutions for offences against this Act. During 1988-89 there were at least 10 successful prosecutions by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and I understand that another 12 prosecutions are outstanding. This Bill seeks to apply a 10-year gaol sentence to this type of offence. Ten years in gaol is the sentence for serious offences and I think this will deter would-be illegal traffickers in native wildlife. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill there is no provision for legalising any export trade in live birds or animals. After giving the reasons for increasing penalties, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) in his second reading speech said:</PARA>
<PARA> Nor will these changes alter the current ban on private and commercial export of live native fauna. The arguments of those in favour of allowing commercial export of live native birds have been well documented in the media. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Michael Baume alluded to a moment ago, there could be an untapped trade out there, especially when a lot of this wildlife is in plague proportions and is also not protected from extermination by farmers--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right. These birds do not have the legal protection which endangered species have. The Government could look at the idea of exporting these birds under certain regulations, although the regulations would have to be very tight. Most of the native birds which are abundant and cause damage to crops are parrots or cockatoos. These birds are collectively referred to as psitticines. I am going to discuss this group of birds and suggest that the Government look at another export industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it does. The removal of the bans on the export of native birds has been suggested for a number of reasons: establishing an export industry; funding control of pest bird species; and making bird smuggling less economic. Of course, while birds are going out illegally, there is a black market with higher prices. Between $2,000 and $3,000 is available for a single bird so I suppose it is quite tempting to try to get some of that money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other reasons for removing the bans on export are: animal welfare improvements vis-a-vis smuggling; increased funding for policing of smuggling from revenue earned from exports; and, of course, reducing crop damage. I believe that most honourable senators have no idea about the amount of damage that parrots, wild ducks, et cetera, can do to a crop. Crops and dams near the crops provide both the water supply and the feed for the birds and they are naturally attracted to the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Who wants to slaughter the birds? I do not believe in slaughtering them but I have not found any other way of exterminating them- `exterminating' is not the right word; I mean keeping them away. I believe that a reasonable solution would be to trap some of these birds, breed from them in the environment and export the natural offspring, or export a certain number that have been captured. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, of course. Establishing an export industry based on the sale of live native birds would undoubtedly assist Australia by earning export dollars. The question is what sort of industry should be established. The industry could be based on trapping native birds in the wild, raising hatchlings from eggs taken in the wild, breeding captive birds or a combination of all those things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give the Senate a few figures to illustrate my point. In 1987, 700,000 birds were imported into the United States, with 580,000 being released onto the market. An estimated 40 per cent of these birds would have been the parrot species. The parrots are the birds in demand. At present, the United States is not getting parrots from Australia, so it is obviously getting them from somewhere else. I believe that the prime quota comes from Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example is that, in 1981, 110,000 parrots were imported into Japan, although the importing of birds appears to have dropped since then. The EEC is the other principal market for birds. Some of the recent bird prices in the United States and United Kingdom are: a little corella costs $900 to $1,250; a galah costs $2,500 to $3,000 so we might find some use for some galahs here, because they are worth a bit of money; a sulphur crested cockatoo costs $2,250 to $3,500; and a Major Mitchell costs $6,000 to $12,500. So there is a market out there willing to pay for these birds. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, birds bred in captivity as pets right from the beginning would attract double those prices as the mortality rate would be far less because they have been domesticated right from the beginning. A United States magazine recently advertised a hand reared Moluccan cockatoo for $2,400 while a wild one could be bought for only $500. I have quoted enough figures to show that an export industry could be set up. We have these native birds which are not protected because they are in plague proportions and the export of them would lessen the problems around the crops, virtually cut out illegal smuggling and could earn up to $4m a year for Australia. It would not be a big industry right from the word go but it could grow. The Minister at the table, Senator Collins, is looking rather doubtful about this but the figures I have quoted are correct. I would like to argue this matter in some other forum at another time. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition supports this Bill. Animal welfare is a significant aspect in this Bill because, if the illegal trade is cut out, the mortality rate of exported birds goes down. From the figures quoted and the prosecutions, 90 per cent of illegally smuggled birds die in transit whereas, with controlled exports into the United States from other countries, the death rate in transport is 3 to 4 per cent, which is quite minimal. That is certainly lower than the mortality rate in the live sheep trade and I suppose it could even be lower than the mortality rate in human transport, depending on which airline one uses. Also, a certain number of deaths occur in quarantine in the importing country but pets or other animals can die even if they are transported from one end of the country to the other. </PARA>
<PARA> I went through these figures to give the Senate an idea about what we could be doing with the birds that are in plague proportions and do nothing but damage Australian agriculture. It may seem to the Senate, and especially to the Minister sitting over there, that this idea is a few years ahead of its time. However, with careful research, study into the trade, and securing the right outlets, I believe that such an industry could be set up for the benefit of whoever takes on the project, for the benefit of Australia and, of course, for the benefit of the farmers whose crops are damaged. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not delay the Senate any longer. The Opposition supports the Bill as it stands. I, too, must comment on the number of amendments made to the Bill even before it left the other House. The Opposition looks forward to the day when legislation of this sort is properly drafted and thought out before it arrives here, let alone in the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support my colleagues in the debate on the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1991. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, more than anybody, as Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, would be aware of the effect that imported feral animals have had on this country, but I will refer to that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since Australia was first settled by Europeans a little over 200 years ago, 27 species of mammals and birds, along with around 100 species of plants, have become extinct. In addition, 59 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs and fish, along with many hundreds of species of invertebrates, are considered endangered and will most likely become extinct within 10 or 20 years unless action is taken. It is in these circumstances that the coalition welcomes the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1991, although we have a number of reservations about some failings of the Bill, which I shall detail later. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Bill increases the penalty from five to 10 years for wildlife smuggling. It also attempts to prevent importers using Australia as a holding area whilst they arrange for markets to be found overseas. Under the Bill's provisions, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) will be allowed greater flexibility in determining whether to allow the trade of certain common species without a management plan. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth mentioning that this Bill has been inexplicably delayed since it was first introduced into the other place on 22 August 1990. This means that it has now taken a year for the Bill to move from the other place to the Senate. Quite frankly, given that the loss of a species cannot be replaced, I consider this to be most unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> In bringing forward this Bill, the Government has essentially followed the Opposition's lead. In our environment policy, which was released in February 1990, we called for a beefing up of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act. We believed that the Act required tougher penalties. I quote from a certain section of our policy, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act of 1982 will be kept up-to-date and penalties under it increased and more resources devoted to its enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition has always believed that endangered species should be protected. We support fully the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which is called CITES. We also support the excellent work which has been done by the Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce, commonly known as TRAFFIC. </PARA>
<PARA> Illegal trade in native flora and fauna has existed for many years. In some sections of the community this trade is referred to as the fauna mafia-I have no questions about why Senator Panizza spoke on this tonight! There have been highly publicised cases of individuals who have been apprehended in the process of smuggling out of this country some of our endangered species. I remember when, not that long ago-others may have seen this-I saw an article in one of the newspapers about a number of drugged parrots stuffed down a tube, which first brought to my attention what has been going on around the place. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many other publicised cases and they are referred to in the annual report of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Its most recent report indicates seizures and surrenders of some 127 live birds, 125 live reptiles, 81 live fish, six live crabs, 708 plants, 401 turtle products and 375 butterfly specimens. That is what has been identified-goodness knows how many have slipped through the net. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1988-89 eight successful prosecutions were completed, including that of a West German citizen arrested at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport who was later charged with the illegal export of 27 Australian native birds and 11 Australian native reptiles. Unfortunately, a European tourist smuggling a few parrots out of the country is not a major problem. The major problem confronting our wildlife authorities is the international dealers who control networks involving tree climbers, trappers, middle men, bird breeders, dealers, pilots and boat owners. It is a complicated operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian fauna attracts a premium price on the international black market. This, together with our relative geographic isolation, makes illegal smuggling a very attractive proposition for the dishonest. A recent British publication called Animal Smugglers included an advertisement for a bird dealer in America who would supply any 10 pairs of Australian parrots delivered to your door for $100,000. Reports occasionally reach authorities of high powered speed boats which meet Indonesian vessels off the southern New South Wales coast in an effort to take fauna out of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this illegal trade has been catastrophic. It is documented that one well known Australian collector amassed the largest illegal collection of Australian native eggs, which included 25,000 clutches. In areas of the Iron Range, which is frequented by smugglers, the eclectus parrot population has dropped by 80 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce-TRAFFIC-has figures which indicate that a pair of Australian glossy black cockatoos can bring $50,000 on the international market, palm cockatoos fetch $25,000 a pair and golden shoulder parrots up to $10,000 a pair. The Major Mitchell, which is found in the Australian interior, can fetch $20,000 a pair, whilst kookaburras have been seen advertised in the United Kingdom recently for up to $1,600 each. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this context that tougher measures are needed. It is also worth mentioning that in many cases the authorities simply do not have the manpower to appropriately police our vast continent. Modern fauna smugglers are equipped with expensive speed boats and light aircraft. Those caught at our airports represent only a very minor percentage. It seems to me that this trade is set up similarly to what we expect our illegal drug trade to be. In that context it is essential that all State governments receive the support of the Federal Government, beefing up the numbers of the authorities involved in trying to catch these illegal smugglers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides the Minister with greater discretion in relation to the export of some of our fauna species which are not endangered. In this context, the coalition would urge most strongly that consideration be given to allowing the export of native birds which are not threatened but which in some cases have bred in plague proportions. In particular, I refer to the great sulphur-crested cockatoo, the galah, the little corella and the long-billed corella. </PARA>
<PARA> In some parts of our country farmers are unable to sow their summer crops and may have difficulty in sowing winter crops because of the problems which these birds cause. They are notorious for taking the seed off the ground before it has germinated. In some areas they defoliate and ring-bark native trees to the extent that they kill them. I am sure my colleague Senator Panizza would attest seriously to the effect that some of these native birds, in plague proportions, would have on his wheat sowing. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation at present is that farmers must resort to a variety of less than successful methods to control the effect these birds have on crops. Explosive scare guns, the carbide or gas operated scare guns, high pitched sounds, scarecrows and various mechanical devices have all been used with little or no success. Although I know that in my own State one of our talkback radio personalities who has since retired, Sue Becker, was used in a vineyard quite effectively to scare off birds that were attacking some of the wine grapes down there. Nevertheless, it seems that one--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can think of a few people in here who would be pretty effective!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is probably right. However, one method which appears to be successful in controlling the effect that these native birds can have is poison, but I am sure that we would all agree that it is a very distasteful method by which to control the birds. There is no doubt that many of these birds exist in plague proportions. However, poison is one of those methods which is unable to discriminate between species.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another method which is used by farmers is netting. Under this system a decoy bird and some grain is used to attract, in some cases, many thousands of birds. When the net is triggered it folds over the top of the birds and traps them. The question then is what to do with the birds. Unfortunately, at this stage the options are pretty limited. They can be clubbed to death, stamped on or gassed. I think we would all agree that that is a wanton waste of a natural resource. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition believes, and surely commonsense dictates, that it would be far better for these birds, which are in demand overseas, to be sold in a regulatory fashion. This would provide those in the rural community with a much needed boost to their income and would, at the same time, significantly detract from the markets available to the illegal operators. I guess in some ways it is a bit like the proposition put from time to time that drug addicts should be provided with drugs free of charge to reduce the scarcity of a particular item. Obviously, the release of these birds on the world market would have an effect on the price obtained for them overseas, but it is likely that this industry could generate many millions of dollars in overseas earnings. If such an industry were taxed, the Government and the general Australian community would also be winners. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely it is ludicrous that farmers are allowed to kill certain species of native birds but are not allowed to sell them for profit. The Minister has argued that ultimately research will provide a way of controlling the bird menace, but to date this has been less than effective. Procedures already exist whereby these birds could be exported because we are already allowed to export non-native birds from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The export regulations involved in this industry are very rigid. Exporters must be certified for quarantine purposes. Importers also must be certified. The exporter must have a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora licence issued by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service at a cost of $40. All birds exported by this method are inspected at several stages during transport and the cages and feeding requirements are all very strictly regulated. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be far more pleasant for birds to be taken out of their country in this manner than to be injected with a tranquilliser, bound with tape and placed in a narrow tube, as is often the practice of smugglers as I mentioned earlier. It is difficult to obtain figures, but the most generally accepted one is that 90 per cent of birds smuggled out of the country are dead before they arrive at their destination. I guess that is one of the reasons why they become so expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 an all-party committee made up of members of the House of Representatives recommended a relaxation of the total export controls on the type of native fauna to which I have referred. I should stress once again that we are not talking about endangered species but, rather, those species that can be found in abundance and which would be far better off in the control of wealthy overseas owners than being gassed or clubbed to death. The proposal to allow the export of these types of birds is also in agreement with the ideals of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, something about which I am sure Senator Coulter will have something to say in his contribution. More than 100 countries, including Australia, are signatories to this agreement which operates under the auspices of the United Nations environment program. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, such a proposal would arouse some criticism from animal welfare groups. I understand that the RSPCA is currently opposed to the export of live birds and animals unless it is a direct transfer between public utilities such as zoos. The RSPCA believes that the most humane method of control is by gas. Surely even the RSPCA can see that it would be far preferable to export these birds alive than to have them gassed to death. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the protestations of the Minister, it is clear that the problems faced by our primary producers certainly will not go away. I am sure we are all too aware of the problems that face our beleaguered wheat growers. To allow these birds to be trapped by licensed collectors would certainly provide a new source of income to our farmers. In this respect the Bill obviously has its failings. I know that we on this side of the House are disappointed that the Government has not been prepared to be more proactive on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The next major area which I wish to address concerns the disastrous effect which the introduction of some overseas species of flora and fauna has had on our own local ecology. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, I have recently been associated with a report on the effect of large feral animals on parts of the Northern Territory-in particular, sensitive areas such as Kakadu. It is a pity that Senator Burns, who was in the chair earlier and who is Chairman of our Committee, will not be participating in this debate because I think he would agree with me that we have seen plenty of evidence of the effects of the introduction of overseas species into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just mention some of the feral animals that have been introduced into Australia over the last couple of hundred years and the effect they have had not just on agriculture but also on our whole way of life. In particular, I refer to the effect that buffaloes introduced from Indonesia have had on the Kakadu area. I guess that Senator Collins has tracked plenty of them around there in his time. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right. They have had the effect of spreading brucellosis and tuberculosis among local cattle in the Top End. Quite frankly, I was amazed to see the effect they have had on the area, but since they have been shot out and reduced in numbers that area has recovered. I think it shows that mother nature is quite prepared to regenerate areas of land that have been affected in this way. I just hope that the Government will continue to fund the BTEC program in the Top End because I think that, from the tourism aspect and also that of local Aboriginals who have their own protected areas and disease free buffaloes which provide them with meat, it is essential that the program be continued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not have to tell you, Mr Deputy President, what effect the introduction of rabbits had in Australia. I think it is there for everybody to see. They have probably been the biggest curse on this country that we have ever known. I must say that the methods we have used to try to eradicate rabbits with poison and myxomatosis are distasteful even to me as a primary producer. I do not think anybody feels very comfortable with the methods we have used to try to eradicate rabbits. I must say that they are a pretty hardy species because they still survive in huge numbers. I think that a former Whip in the Senate, Bernie Kilgariff, would attest to the effect that rabbits are having on his station south of Alice Springs. When we were up there the evidence we heard was that there were something like 90,000 rabbits in his area. The effect they have on our land through erosion is quite immense. </PARA>
<PARA> I also do not have to remind the Senate of the effect of the importation of starlings. They are often referred to as the rats of the sky. People like myself-originally I was a fruit grower-and the wine producers of this country would attest to the huge cost of starlings even today. The cost that they bring to primary industry is certainly something we can do without. </PARA>
<PARA> During the evidence we had on the effect of large feral animals in northern Australia, it was quite interesting to note the effect of brumbies, or whalers as they are sometimes called, on the native flora and fauna of central Australia. In fact, evidence showed that since brumbies have increased in numbers in central Australia they have been responsible for wiping out 50 species of native flora and fauna over the last couple of decades. This evidence was given to us by a conservation group with good credentials in Alice Springs. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention briefly some other well known animal imports into Australia that we could do without. I do not think I have to tell you, Mr Deputy President, of the effect of cane toads. Their numbers are still increasing. Even though they were introduced into this country legally, it just shows what can happen when the authorities do not look ahead and do their homework on the effect that some of these introduced species can have on our country. Camels, donkeys, goats, foxes and carp are just a few others that, without going into any great detail, have all affected Australia to a great extent one way or another. In fact, when we were taking evidence on the effect of large feral animals in the Northern Territory, one of the conclusions that we came to, and I quote from the report, was:</PARA>
<PARA>On the basis of evidence presented during the inquiry, the Committee is left in no doubt that feral animals pose a major problem. In particular, horses, buffalo and other large feral animals have a significant adverse effect on the environment of the Northern Territory. This manifests itself in degradation of the landscape and destruction of vulnerable Australian species of flora and fauna. Feral animals also have the potential to exacerbate problems arising from the introduction of exotic diseases. </PARA>
<PARA>We made quite a few recommendations on this point. I am not going to go into them because that is a story for another day. I will give some idea of the population of these animals that came into Australia quite innocently. In the early days, camels were brought in to transport goods through central Australia when no other form of transport was available. Donkeys were also brought in for that reason. Goats were introduced into Australia by the mariners of the early days as a food source. They are now in plague proportions. God knows why foxes were introduced into Australia. I guess they were for the landed gentry to go chasing with their hounds. </PARA>

The introduction of carp into our waterways is another disaster that we can look back on with little pride. Interestingly enough, when we talk about the culling of feral animals in the Northern Territory-and I know that Senator Collins is terribly interested in this-even considering the millions of dollars that have been spent and the vast amount of work that has gone into eradicating buffalo in the Top End, there is still estimated in Arnhem Land, Darwin, Katherine and Tennant Creek to be a population of some 108,000 buffalo. In Tennant Creek, Alice Springs and the Simpson Desert, camels have risen to the reasonable figure of 11,000. We have something like 80,000 donkeys in the Top End. I remember hearing evidence given to us by a landowner in the Victoria River district who said that station owners had eradicated 80,000 donkeys but within two years they still had 80,000 donkeys. So they are quite prolific breeders. The population of feral horses is estimated at something like 150,000, even though many of them are being shot and processed at Peterborough in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might have gone on a little too long about this, but I am trying to make the point that we have to be very careful about the introduction of certain species into Australia. Whilst I have quoted plenty of examples of what has happened and the many millions of dollars that it has cost the producers of livestock and agricultural products in this country, which they could do without, one wonders what would happen in future if we had the introduction of wolves, for instance. They could bring rabies into Australia, which would be a horrendous problem. One also wonders what effect foot and mouth disease or swine fever would have on the feral pig population. </PARA>

Goldfish have been banned from importation into Tasmania. It just shows that the most innocent of imports could have a disastrous effect on Australia unless we are vigilant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that the Government, after quite some delay, has introduced this Bill into the Senate to increase the penalties for those illegal exporters of our native animals and to increase the fines and sentences on those people wishing to introduce imported species into this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this relatively trivial Bill-the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1991. I will make some more remarks about that in a moment. Firstly, I wish to pick up on a few remarks by Senator Calvert. I am reminded of the remarks about motes in eyes and not noticing the logs in eyes. That is the context in which I will be speaking about the trivial nature of this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Calvert seems to be suggesting to us that we should somehow exploit the exportation of our native wildlife for profit, yet most of his speech was devoted to the dangers of importing exotic species into this country. I remind him that many of our parrot species, to which he drew our attention, carry psittacosis. I am sure that many other countries would not like to have psittacosis spread through their wildlife by the export of our parrots. I remind him that we have exported species of eucalypts to many countries and these have been extremely damaging on the native flora of those countries. The leaf litter under eucalypts has been extremely damaging throughout the Middle East and parts of Africa. I would certainly be extremely careful about the suggestion that we should export our wildlife, either flora or fauna, simply for profit without considering very carefully that we may be doing to other countries what some of our forebears did to Australia by introducing exotic species here. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the mote and the log; to the point that this legislation, while it is entirely acceptable to the Australian Democrats, is really addressing a minuscule problem in relation to wildlife protection. The Democrats are of the view that this legislation simply does not address the fundamental problems facing our wildlife. Hopefully, in the next few weeks we will be introducing a much more comprehensive private member's Bill to address those very serious problems. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), in her second reading speech stated that we are:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . wearing away the fabric of the intricate biological web that sustains life on this planet. The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 is part of a global network of legislation, with the ultimate objective to ensure that our utilisation of wildlife and ecosystems is ecologically sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA>Without wishing to understate the importance of this legislation, I simply state that the Minister must be kidding if she thinks that the Wildlife Protection Bill shows that the Government is ensuring:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that our utilisation of wildlife and ecosystems is ecologically sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia, like nearly every continent on earth, is suffering a major crisis in the loss of biological diversity. This current Australian Government, instead of trying to deal seriously with this most fundamental and irreversible of problems, is underfunding conservation programs in this country to a laughable extent; proposing to introduce resource security legislation which will almost certainly push many hundreds of species closer to extinction; continuing to support the destruction of the world's tropical rainforests by allowing the importation of tropical timber into Australia; and refusing to accept its constitutional responsibilities to protect our natural environment through threatened species and native vegetation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Just this afternoon with the introduction of the Budget we have seen a trifling amount of money allocated in the area of wildlife protection. Controlling the import and export of wildlife is an important issue, but this legislation does not address the fundamental problems with the management of our wildlife and our natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The world is being progressively impoverished by the loss and degradation of its most fundamental living resources: its genes, species, habitats and ecosystems. This loss of the planet's living richness is both wrong and dangerous. It is wrong because we should accept that all species have a right to exist, as the United Nations General Assembly stated when it adopted the World Charter for Nature in 1982. It is dangerous because the world's environmental systems are humanity's life support mechanisms and we do not know which components are key to maintaining their essential integrity. Professor Michael Archer from the University of New South Wales describes humanity's destruction of its life support systems most graphically. He argues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have to book ourselves into the same league as the comet that may have struck the earth and obliterated half of the vertebrates from the world 65 million years ago. We are that sort of catastrophe. We are an extincting force, the like of which the world has never seen before. </PARA>
<PARA>A British ecologist has put it just as graphically when, in relation to man's destruction of nature, he said that it was the:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . greatest setback to life's abundance and diversity since the first flickerings of life almost 4 billion years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>It is incredibly arrogant for homo sapiens in 1991 to think that they know enough about the operation of the natural world that, in any sense, it will work better or even as well with more and more species being removed through humanity's uncaring exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA> Some scientists predict that if present trends continue up to 25 per cent of the world's species will be lost in the next several decades, accompanied by an equally alarming degradation of habitats and ecosystems. Of course, a large part of that will be through the clearing of tropical rainforests-something with which we will be dealing legislatively on Thursday and upon which this Government has so far failed to take any action. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of species extinction is not restricted to overseas countries. Indeed, European Australia has one of the worst records of species extinction of any country. Our extinction rates are still unacceptably high even today. In the past 200 years, since the settlement of this continent by Europeans, Australia is known to have lost 30 large and visible animals and 100 plants. Professor Harry Recher from the University of New England notes:</PARA>
<PARA>Recognition of the impact of European settlement on the Australian landscape and its flora and fauna has been slow to emerge. Most Australians view the continent as vast, unspoiled and underpopulated. Yet in historical times, no other continent has experienced the massive changes in the distribution and abundance of such a large proportion of its vertebrate fauna as has Australia. In 200 years Europeans have recast the evolutionary biogeography of the continent. </PARA>
<PARA>And this appalling record is continuing. Australia has an estimated 111 animals and nearly 1,000 plants that are currently threatened with extinction. It is against that sort of record that we are dealing this evening with what I described earlier as a trivial piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> But unlike other nations the great tragedy is that most Australians do not even know about the wildlife we are destroying. Australians know more about the plight of the African elephant or the Bengal tiger than they do about the thylacine, the bilby, or the quoll. That indeed is a great tragedy which we must redress urgently if we are to gain community support in saving our wildlife. </PARA>
<PARA> I interpolate here, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it is a peculiar anomaly that in Australia one needs no legal permission whatsoever to own an exotic animal-a cat, dog, donkey or many of those animals which you mentioned in your speech earlier-yet one requires permission to own a native animal. In 1990, Recher and Lee noted:</PARA>
<PARA>Of the 1600 species of terrestrial vertebrates, nearly 300 are considered endangered. Seventeen mammals, three birds, and one species of lizard are known to have become extinct since European settlement in 1788. </PARA>
<PARA>In just over 200 years we have destroyed forever 20 mammals that occurred nowhere else on earth. That represents a loss, on average, of one mammal every 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people think that the great mammal extinctions occurred in the late 1800s and that by the early 1900s most of the extinctions had already occurred. This is not so. Species extinctions have been occurring since then and are more than likely to continue to occur because of the inaction of the current Government. Again, I interpolate that very often the seeds of species extinction are sown many years-sometimes decades-before the last animal actually disappears simply because of the change to the habitat of those animals. </PARA>
<PARA> We only need to lose one mammal in the next 10 years for us to retain the extinction rate that has in the past given us by far the worst mammal extinction record of any society in the history of humans on this earth. It is an outrage that a nation whose high standard of living is dependent almost entirely on the natural environmental assets of this continent can have such little regard to its continued health and show such indifference to the plight of many unique native species who share this continent with us. These extinctions have not occurred as a result of trade in wildlife, as the Minister's second reading speech might have us believe. They have occurred because of far greater problems with the way in which we have managed, and to a large extent still manage, our natural environment and the resources contained within it. </PARA>
<PARA> To address the real causes of extinction satisfactorily, it is necessary to turn to the principles of population ecology and to the historical record. On past debates in this chamber, it would not be misplaced to dwell a little on some of these. Three factors affect the extinction of species. Firstly, extinction is a complex process which occurs over many years; it is not simply the death of the last individual of a species. As I indicated a moment ago, the processes which lead to the final loss of that last individual are very often irrevocably put in place decades before that last animal dies. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there are two cause and effect factors which determine the process of extinction-the deterministic and the random. Deterministic factors are those which have predictable effects on a population, such as habitat loss. Random factors, such as drought, fire or floods are unpredictable in occurrence and consequence. Both affect the extinction process. The smaller the population size, the more susceptible it is to extinction from chance events. This bears fairly and squarely on the issue of resource security legislation, which we are told will be introduced in this place and which will see many of our remnant forests divided into small areas, making them extremely susceptible to those random events which will see the total extinction of the species contained in them. </PARA>
<PARA> The third factor in the extinction process occurs at the level of populations and not at the level of species. Because of this, conservation strategies must focus on managing for population viability and not simply on just saving a few animals in zoos. Recher and Lee note:</PARA>
<PARA>The impact of European settlement (on terrestrial fauna) has been greatest on mammals and birds. In the 200 years since the colony was established in 1788 at Port Jackson, 17 species of terrestrial mammals, three taxa of birds and the Adelaide blue-tongue lizard are known to have become extinct. </PARA>
<PARA> Eight species of mammals formerly occurring on the mainland survive only on isolated, small offshore islands. </PARA>
<PARA>Many people think that the great extinctions of our wildlife and their habitats occurred in the very early days of European settlement and that the damage has largely already been done. This view is simply untrue. The rates of extinction on this continent are as rapid now as they were at any time in the past. Recher and Lee state:</PARA>
<PARA>In describing the decline and extinction of the Australian terrestrial vertebrate fauna, we are not describing changes over 200 years of settlement. Instead, most events occurred within 20 or 30 years of an area being settled. For most of the continent the changes described occurred within this century. The impact of Europeans on the Australian environment is not measured in centuries, but in decades. This pattern is now being repeated in the south-west and north-west of the continent as settlement of these regions intensifies. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the ground-dwelling mammals in the size range of 35 grams to 5,000 grams which have been most affected by European settlement. In the arid and semi-arid regions few mammals in this critical size range survive. The record from our forests is a little better, but predictions are that extinctions in these areas are likely in the near future. Apart from the thylacine and the eastern quoll, no mammals have as yet been lost from forest habitats. However, many species have declined in abundance and there are many regional extinctions because about 50 per cent of our forests have been cleared and populations are now fragmented. That, as I indicated earlier, bears very much on the question of resource security legislation. Destroying species and destroying habitats for short term economic gain is about as sensible as burning a Picasso to cook dinner. As quoted previously, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 is part of a global network of legislation, with the ultimate objective to ensure that our utilisation of wildlife and ecosystems is ecologically sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the magnitude of the problem and how this Government's record stands up to this rhetoric from the Minister. Half of Australia's soils are affected by erosion and/or salination. That is a very significant factor in the extinction of species-habitat change. Over four million hectares of pastoral inland are on the verge of becoming perpetual desert. Australia's soils have been mined of their nutrients and organic matter. The scale of the disaster is unprecedented. Viewed in this context, the decline of the continent's vertebrate fauna is almost meaningless; the extinction of species becomes a symptom of far more pervasive changes to the land. We have no idea of the number of species-the small species, the bacteria and the other less obvious species-that live in the soil and upon which the integrity of the soil's ecology is based. </PARA>
<PARA> As ecologists we would view the decline of Australia's fauna as a symptom of more serious events and seek to remedy the problem by correcting the underlying causes and not by treating the symptoms. It is not simply the large and obvious animals; it is the underlying change in the infrastructure which supports the whole ecology. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government proudly boasts an endangered species program of $2m per annum, which we have just seen increased to $5m in today's Budget. That $2m represents 0.002 per cent of the Federal Budget. This Government is prepared to commit only 0.002 per cent of its Budget to saving Australia's endangered heritage. A spokesman for the World Wide Fund for Nature has described this level of funding as laughable. It has stated that this level of funding is perhaps one-thousandth of what we need in the coming decades. The cash required is enormous. To find an appropriate control for things such as the fox might take 10 years, and it might take tens of millions of dollars for that control to be applied. Unless we as Australians make a commitment now to start to fix the fundamental problems with the management of our natural environment, we will never solve the problem and our extinctions will continue to occur. Michael Kennedy from the World Wide Fund for Nature in Australia has stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the amount of $2 million per year for the first two years of the Endangered Species Program is laughable and a disgrace, and it won't save species. It will not serve to stop the growing list of species under threat, and it will simply serve to watch the list grow longer; it's just not enough. </PARA>
<PARA>He is referring there to the fact that that amount of money is just about enough to catalogue and report to the Australian population what is going on, but not to address the underlying problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's funding level represents less than 13c a year for each Australian to save our irreplaceable heritage. This Government spent more on landscaping the grounds around this Parliament House than it has spent on saving species in Australia in the past three years. The funding level and the Government's Budget spending priorities are shameful, and it will stand condemned by future generations if it lets one more species slip into extinction because it did not care enough. There is a desperate need for government policy to reflect a holistic approach to the protection of biodiversity through maintenance of habitat and sustainable land use practices, rather than relying on the ecologically simplistic notion of trying to save this species or that one, or trying to stop the export of 10 gang gang cockatoos, as was mentioned in the Minister's speech. </PARA>
<PARA> A major problem with the funding of environmental programs in Australia is the lack of certainty and continuity of funding. This leads to programs being devised which do not take a long term perspective and, instead, rely on achieving quantifiable results in the short term. As a nation we were able to plan a 25-year Snowy Mountains scheme to help improve our economic well-being, but it appears that a far simpler task of providing funding certainty to repair our natural environment cannot be done. That, of course, is a nonsense. The problem is not the inability to provide certainty; it is the lack of political will to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of funding programs year by year is that designing research programs is easier and likely to be more favourably treated than actual on-the-ground recovery work, because after a one- or two-year program something physical, such as a paper or a study, can be produced to justify the expenditure. This is not to denigrate research as a valuable component of endangered species programs- indeed, much more needs to be spent in this area alone-but it does highlight the desperate need to design longer term conservation and recovery strategies, and the only way this will occur is if long term funding is guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats call on the Government to consider seriously, in consultation with the community, conservation, industry, farm, fishing and forestry groups, a 200-year Australian conservation plan which contains aims, objectives, goals and action plans and funding targets for at least 10 years in advance for this plan. </PARA>

<TITLE>Opposition Delegation to Latin America</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For three weeks in July and August, I was a member of an Opposition delegation that very happily visited seven countries in Latin America. Tonight, I wish briefly to refer to our observations and the very high success of our visit. I have prepared a rather brief summary of the various meetings and other events that occurred during our visit to these seven countries. I will refer to it a little later in my speech. I assure the Senate that I will confine my remarks to a relatively short compass because we are on the adjournment debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were three Liberal members of Parliament who composed the delegation: Senator Hill, the Opposition foreign affairs spokesman; Mr Moore MP, a former Liberal Government Minister for business; and myself, as the Chairman of the Opposition's international relations task force or, in other terms, the Chairman of the foreign affairs and defence committee of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We visited Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico. Why did we go to Latin America and why at this time? I have, for example, visited Asia perhaps 20 times-10 times before I came to the Senate and 10 times since I have been in the Senate. It is well known that Australia's major trading partners are in Asia. Many of us have travelled in Europe; many of us have travelled in North America; some, such as the President of the Senate, have a very close personal knowledge of Africa. But I do not know anybody in the Senate or in the House of Representatives who has a careful knowledge of Latin America. I speak of all the countries from Mexico through Central America and the whole South American continent. </PARA>
<PARA> I must be honest and say that in all my 46 years very few Australians have spoken to me about their visits to any of the Latin American countries. I do not know anyone in Parliament who has expounded at any length about our economic opportunities in Latin America. I know of individual honourable senators including you, Mr Deputy President, who have made particular visits to some countries-in your case, to observe the Chilean elections, in the case of a few other members of Parliament to be part of an IPU delegation and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> This was the first time for a long period that there had been a conscious, well prepared, deliberate reconnaissance by a political party to explore and to come up with its own first-hand evaluations of the opportunities for Australia-especially in economic terms, but in the broader foreign affairs agenda as well-with the republics of Latin America. In part, the same reasons that led us to go led Senator Loosley, me and our colleagues on the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, to recommend to the Senate that the Committee take on a reference-which it is currently in the midst of-of looking at Australia's relations with the Latin American countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three particular reasons why this comes together in 1991. We have really only just woken up to the political events of the last two years that have seen a broad return of democracy to all of the countries of the region. Of course, in most countries there had been long traditions of democracy but-notoriously in Chile until last year, and in other countries-there had been dictatorships of the Right, military coups or even populist and quite counter-productive regimes of the Left. </PARA>
<PARA> The first alerting situation was the return of democracy to Latin America. Had there not been the election in Chile that led to the new democratic government from March of last year, we might not have undertaken this visit. Secondly, there has been a quite remarkable conversion of the governments of Latin America to market economics; a rejection of the Left; a rejection of socialism and a full embracing of what we in Australia would call an attempt to be internationally competitive. There has been a real attempt to get inflation down to manageable levels, to cut tariffs to become more and more involved in free trade, and actually to have the substance of international competitiveness as the basis for increased trade and increased economic prosperity for each of the countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Mexico comes to mind with President Salinas's quite abrupt turning around of his own party in this direction. Also, there was the wholehearted way in which the governments of Chile and Uruguay have embraced market economics, the quite dramatic election of the Fujimori Government last year in Peru and the whole new wave of market orientated economic policies that have swept that country in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The second broad reason for our being interested is that we perceive the Latin American economies to be open to the world and increasingly able to have an economic partnership with Australia. In fact, whilst many talk about Australia being in danger, through bad economic policies, of going down the `Argentine road', I came back from Latin America thinking about the very real danger-Senator Michael Baume will appreciate this-that the Latin American countries may, if we do not get on a little more quickly with economic reform, both macro-economic and micro-economic, be saying, `Beware, lest we in Latin America go down the Australian road'. I hope there will never be any real substance to such an anecdote because in this country we desperately need to go down the path of freer trade, market economics and genuine macro-economic and micro-economic reform ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The third, and perhaps minor, matter is that we now have a transport link between Australia and Latin America-especially the very serviceable flight from Sydney through Auckland, on the South Pole route, to Buenos Aires. This is an arrangement between Aero Lingus and Qantas which, I believe, ought to be expanded. There is also a link through Los Angles with the middle American States, and a link directly with San Diego and Chile which flies through French Polynesia and Easter Island. The links exist and Australians-politicians and businessmen alike-can get on the flights and be there before the night falls. It is possible for Australians to include Latin America in a convenient transport link. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons why I was a member of the delegation was the Senate inquiry. The Committee has had its first hearing and has already received some 90 submissions from a wide variety of Australian and Latin American interests. We hope to conclude that inquiry by the end of this year with a full report and a full set of recommendations leading on from the evaluations we make of Australia's opportunities in relation to the Latin American republics. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, as I say, this area of the world has been largely neglected by Australia. There is one exception. In 1961 when McEwen was trade Minister he urged Senator Gorton, as he then was, to lead a delegation of parliamentarians to Latin America. That delegation came back with its report. In 1962, a very large group-I think it comprised about 50 members of every type of industry, bank and business in Australia-went there for three or four months toting contracts, coming back with concluded deals built upon the foundations that had been opened up by the politicians, and trying to give meaning to some of the emerging shipping links with ports on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the continent. This flourished for some years. Unfortunately, even before the end of the 1960s, these activities had not amounted to much. We then had the political and economic turmoil that distracted all of us until this past year or two. </PARA>
<PARA> We have more than economic relations to consider as matters of mutual interest between Australia and the Latin American republics. We have a very genuine concern on disarmament and arms control. Mexico is not the only country that shares Australia's interests in this area. In terms of the environment, there is a major international environment conference in Brazil next year. We have shared interests in Antarctica. We also have a common interest to eliminate narcotic trafficking in the world in terms of both demand and supply. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noted the seven countries that we visited. Of course, I should mention why we did not visit Brazil on this occasion. Brazil is Australia's largest trading partner. It has by far the largest population-about 150 million people-has by far the largest land area in Latin America, and has an enormously developed infrastructure around Sao Paulo, the former capital of Rio de Janeiro and the new capital of Brazilia, which are all important decision making points not only for Brazil but for the whole continent. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that we had only three weeks and that we intended to visit seven countries in a very hardworking way, we felt that to visit for just a few days would not do service to our relationship with Brazil, and we are intent upon seeing a second Liberal and National Party group of parliamentarians travel to Brazil and perhaps Paraguay and Bolivia next year so that there can be a proper concentration on our coming to grips with opportunities in Brazil. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to about half a dozen particular recommendations. I note that our current level of trade with the Latin American region is 1 per cent; more precisely, it represents 1.0 per cent of Australia's export trade and 1.4 per cent of Australia's imports. I believe that the opportunity exists for this trade to multiply to between 3 per cent and 5 per cent of Australia's total trade by the end of this decade. That is a rather bold statement and it means that there will be a substantial increase in the economic relations between Australia and these republics. I may be underestimating the potential or what will actually be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> I still hold the view that the majority of our trade and economic relations will be with Asia. However, we must follow up this capacity for increased economic relations with Latin America. I believe that we should map out this increased capacity for growing economic relations by spelling out the items of export appropriate to be pursued in each country. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should have an annually revised economic relations strategy with each country in Latin America. It should be openly determined in consultation with the countries themselves, not a secret or conspiratorial plan, with an open set of goals that is objective about the needs of those economies and about the strengths and potential exports from Australia. This set of strategies should involve at least 10 or 12 of the most developed countries of the region. </PARA>
<PARA> I was admirably impressed by Ambassador Baker, our Ambassador in Mexico, giving priority-it appeared, his first priority-in a very practical way to improving Mexican-Australian economic relations. In many countries that I have visited it seems that our representatives, our ambassadors and our other staff in embassies, are mostly intent upon the full range of what we would call the foreign affairs agenda. It is refreshing to see an Australian embassy and an ambassador single-mindedly giving priority to Australia's economic relations and, indeed, to an explicit Australian national interest. I make no apology for talking about an Australian national interest. It must be pursued openly and in conjunction with the mutual interests of the other countries which are in a bilateral relationship with us. </PARA>
<PARA> I sometimes gained the impression during my recent visit that economic relations are left to the Austrade officer, a person who is generally rather junior in the array of staff, even if very experienced and highly skilled to do the work involved. It is usually left to an officer rather than being fully embraced by the whole team in our Australian embassy in a particular country. That is not the case in Mexico and I wish it were not the case in every other country in the region. Each ambassador should have an annually revised economic relations brief to pursue Australia's interest in the mutual economic cooperation that Australia has with each of those host countries. I speak not only of trade but also of investment and of airline and shipping links. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three countries, in particular, that offer the most substantial potential for Australia's renewed economic relations: Mexico, Chile and Columbia. I say this, aware of the fact that currently our largest trading partnership is with Brazil and that Argentina is, in its own way, bursting with opportunities for Australia's investment requiring in-country management by Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> But why Mexico, Chile and Columbia? They are all highly developed economies with impressive recent years of growth. They have open economies, market oriented and ready to cement freer trade relationships with Australia. They are disciplined economies in reasonably good order. They are economies directed to flourish with international competition. They are not inward looking, but genuinely outward looking to the world. </PARA>
<PARA> All three-Mexico, Columbia and Chile-have Pacific coasts. They have ports that are just across the water from our eastern coast. They are very aware of their own Pacific orientation and they want to develop their economic relations with Australia and beyond Australia to Asia. They are interested to join the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and other Pacific and Asian associations in which Australia has a major part. By highlighting these countries, I do not wish to underestimate Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, or even Peru. They each have their own specific opportunities. As I outlined earlier, we should develop our expanded economic relations with all of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me address Mexico, in particular. I put it to the Australian Government and to Senator Gareth Evans and Dr Blewett in particular, that we urgently negotiate with Mexico a free trade bilateral agreement of the type that Mexico has already concluded with Chile, and that this Australia-Mexico agreement be in place before the North America free trade agreement is concluded by March 1992, and certainly before it is ratified by the two congresses by September 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with this development, we should in turn sponsor Mexico to be admitted as a member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, process. I believe that Mexico should be a member of APEC. Already the United States and Canada are members. These countries will be in a free trade agreement very shortly. I believe that Mexico should be as well. Yes, I am suggesting that we conclude this this year, and that we do it urgently. Our embassies in Canberra and in Mexico City are well equipped to map this out, and the Deputy Foreign Minister, Rozental, is coming here in October. I believe that a trade agreement can be achieved this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian trade prospects with Mexico are enormous in the areas of coal, uranium, dairy products, agricultural equipment, food processing, mining and so on. They are all very real prospects. If we do not take up such opportunities this year, we may find that, against Mexico's intention, the North American free trade agreement somehow cuts us out. I greatly envy Chile's already established free trade agreement with Mexico. Australia can have the same agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to Chile. Australia has already invested up to $US2 billion in Chile. We have already begun to invest in that country in a significant way, but much more can be done. There are actually many active Australians pursuing these opportunities, but they need to be encouraged. One of the gains or consolations of the Pinochet period-and I reject the Pinochet period entirely: its rightist dogma, its rejection of democracy, its military methods and all of the abuses of that period, which have been highlighted in the report given to the President early this year-was that by some good chance that regime implemented the economic policies of the so-called Chicago boys. They were, in fact, open, well-disciplined economic policies, and they have left Chile in very good economic shape. </PARA>
<PARA> Chile and Australia understand each other. Chile has high economic objectives, and Australia should establish a strong partnership across the Pacific with Chile. I also believe that Chile's admission to APEC should be fully explored as our own bilateral economic relations increase. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry; I will try to summarise what I have to say. I now refer to Colombia. Colombia has enormous natural resources but, more than that, Colombia also has a high educational attainment, good management skills and entrepreneurship. I am struck by this entrepreneurship because, not only in Colombia but even in Venezuela, there are many Colombian managers of industry and other businesses. I believe that, as soon as Colombia can rid itself of the evil of drug trafficking and the small remaining amount of political terrorism in the hinterland, the sky will be the limit for Columbia. It will be a most prosperous country. Already it has phenomenal economic growth and very well-based economic policies. Colombia is crying out for Australian partnership in shared technology and direct investment, particularly in oil and gas but also in coal, cut flower production, petrochemicals and a very wide range of other products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also urge, and recommend to the Australian Government, that Australia establish a full embassy in Bogota as soon as the narcotic drug and terrorist violence is more reasonably under control. Great progress has been made in recent years. In fact, in Catagena on the Caribbean coast we were able to walk around everywhere without any protection whatsoever. In Bogota it is a different matter and in Medellin it is still a major problem. I believe that, given the economic capacity of Colombia, it should be the location of our next embassy in Latin America. In fact, we should probably establish that embassy next year. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, in Bogota I have urged the establishment of an Australian-Colombian chamber of commerce, a process which should involve our Ambassador de Stoop; the honorary consul Cardenas; and Colombia's former Ambassador and my good friend, Dr Puerto. It ought to be led directly by young enterprising businessmen such as Mr Alberto Vargas, who has been regularly travelling to Australia for the last nine years and whose company sells half of all Australia's carpet backing in a country that sells more carpet per capita than any other in the world and a country that produces the wool that goes into those carpets. There are many other business interests in such a positive development. </PARA>
<PARA> I hasten to add that Australia's embassy in Venezuela should be retained. After all, Venezuela is the most affluent country per capita in the region and many economic opportunities exist for us, let alone the full foreign affairs agenda. However, I believe the embassy there should develop an explicit strategy with an economic interest as priority and then, quarter by quarter, monitor progress with that plan. Our experience since unhappily closing our embassy in Lima back in 1986 may prove to have been very short-sighted. It is too early to say yet whether the Fujimori reforms will bring some prosperity to the country, because the whole economy is still very fragile. If that prosperity does come, I think in a few years we will regret that we removed the embassy in Peru. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the airlines. Qantas used to fly to Mexico City. I genuinely hope for and urge Qantas's return to Mexico City. Also I believe that Australia ought to get directly involved in the route to Santiago and Buenos Aires and an on-flight for Uruguayan businessmen from Buenos Aires to Montevideo. I believe that airlines can be expanded, and Australia has to take some initiatives in this area. I also think it is possible for some of these flights to go on to North America and Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I cannot fail to mention the importance of continuing cooperation between Australia and the Latin American countries, particularly those that are members of the Cairns group in the present GATT round. Uruguay is our strongest ally in taking a hard line right to the bitter end in the negotiations that are yet to be concluded and in trying to bring some sense to Europe and North America in allowing free trade and fairness for our products to be sold on the world market. We have very close emotional and political ties because of our alliances in the GATT round, and we should build on that. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other areas of evaluation and recommendation that I wish to refer to, but I will seek to incorporate those thoughts in the report of the Senate inquiry, which is still to be written. I conclude my speech by seeking leave to incorporate the remaining pages that I have prepared to save my speaking again tomorrow evening. </PARA>

<PARA>VISIT TO LATIN AMERICA, JULY-AUGUST 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Argentine, Uruguay, Chile, Peru</PARA>
<PARA>Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico</PARA>
<PARA>This summary list describes our meetings and other activities in the seven Latin American countries visited in the three weeks 24 July to 13 August which is set out under the following five headings:</PARA>
<PARA> 1 Government representatives</PARA>
<PARA> 2 Parliaments and parliamentarians</PARA>
<PARA> 3 Business leaders and Industry</PARA>
<PARA> 4 Cultural activities</PARA>
<PARA> 5 Other activities of interest</PARA>
<PARA>1 Government representatives</PARA>
<PARA> In Argentina, we met President Carlos Saul Menem who has led Peronism positively into market economics away from the Left and away from ``the Argentine road''; his Agriculture Minster Dr Marcelo Regunaga who is working closely with Australia in the Cairns Group; the very professional Economics Minister Domingo Cavallo; the Foreign Minister Guido di Tella with his quiet, intelligent and patrician manner. </PARA>
<PARA> In Uruguay, we met President Luis Lacalle whose directness and enthusiasm is infectious-our closest GATT ally in ``the Uruguay round'' who will share our hard line to the end of this year's negotiations; his political ally from the Colorado Party, Industry and Energy Minister Dr Augusto Montesdeoca; the Planning and Budget Minister and Blanco Party campaigner Mr Conrado Hughes; the friendly Deputy Foreign Minister Mezzera and his senior Department colleagues and the Agriculture Ministry Secretary and senior officers. </PARA>
<PARA> In Chile, we were unable to meet President Patricio Aylwin as he was visiting Argentina to resolve longstanding border problems, but we gained enormously by our discussions with Minister for Planning and Cooperation, Mr Sergio Molina who did so very much to rebuild democracy in Chile; the politically eminent Minister of Agriculture, Mr Juan-Augustin Figueroa; the young previously socialist now market economist Minister for Economy, Dr Carlos Ominami; the comprehensive and professional Director-General for International Economic Affairs, Ambassador Augusto Aninat; the Foreign Affairs Under-Secretary, Sr Edmundo Vargas who hosted a splendid welcoming luncheon for us; and the Foreign Affairs Policy Director Mr Carlos Portales who I now count as a good friend; and another personal friend, the Mayor of Santiago and rising political star, Mr Jaime Ravinet who hosted us to a luncheon in the City Hall and whom I had first met in Canberra earlier this year in my capacity as Secretary of the Australia-Chile Parliamentary Friendship Group. </PARA>
<PARA> In Peru, we did not meet the now 12-months serving and radically new President Alberto Fujimori but we met his principal colleagues: the Vice President Senator Maximo San Roman, the very determined and very Peruvian leader of small business associations who has been this past year also President of the Senate; the clearheaded market economist Minister of Finance Mr Carlos Bolona, the equally professional and inspiring Minister for Industry, Commerce, Tourism and Integration Dr Joy Way, the former socialist and now practical development Minister for Energy and Mining Mr Fernando Sanchez; and the urbane and very experienced Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Alejandro Gordillo who met us in the magnificent building, Palacio de Torre Tagle. </PARA>
<PARA> In Venezuela, we had a one-hour engaging meeting with President Carlos Andres Perez at the Miraflores Palace who undertook to positively support the forthcoming Venezuelan parliamentarian delegation visit to Australia and whose long political experience places him in a strong position to influence regional politics towards free trade and sounder economics; his Minister for Economic Planning and Coordination, Dr Miguel Rodriguez who especially met us on a Sunday morning and impressed us with his intelligent embrace of market-directed economic reform; and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Rosaria Orellana-she struck me as a sophisticated practitioner who would happily build a growing relationship with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In Colombia unfortunately we missed meeting President Gaviria who I as a fellow Liberal had wanted to congratulate for his positive pursuit of economic reform and industrial development and for his skilful and successful progress to eliminate the cancer of narcotic drug trafficking and the violence of the now small minority of political terrorists. However, we met the politically astute and rising Liberal Minister for Economic Development, Dr Ernesto Samper who the next day was to be interlocutor with Ambassador Carla Hills in her visit to Bogota. We met Minister for Mines and Energy, Dr Luis-Fernando Vergara busy with vast prospects in oil, coal, minerals and gas and in energy infrastructure developments in all of which Australia could be an important partner. We were well received by Deputy Foreign Minister, the young Dr Rodrigo Pardo whose Ministry made excellent arrangements for our three-day visit through former Colombian Ambassador to Australia Dr Antonio Puerto and his soon successor and Colombia's most experienced diplomat, Mr Fernando Navas. </PARA>
<PARA> In Mexico we missed meeting President Carlos Salinas who had so successfully visited Australia a year ago. He was of course engaged in the last week of the Congressional election campaign, the ballot being 18 August, and in his regular Friday visits to the poor and remote villages of Mexico implementing his Solidarity program. However, we met his PRI party colleague Lic Roberta Lajous, who represented PRI President, Senator Colosio, and who is a dynamic and intelligent activist of the ``1988 generation'' that has supported the sweeping Salinas reforms of the past two years and for which the momentum is still growing. We met Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr Andres Rozental, whose comprehensive and authoritative grasp of detail is impressive and who will visit Australia in October. I hope he may be accompanied by Deputy Secretary, Ambassador Sandra Fuentes who admirably oversees our growing bilateral relations. Finally, I was delighted to meet for two hours with Attorney-General Ignacio Morales to discuss legal aspects of Mexico-Australia cooperation but much more profoundly some conceptual aspects of the nature of law, the human bases of legal relationships and his own personal appreciation of Mexican art and cultural roots especially in his own much loved Vera Cruz region. </PARA>
<PARA>2 Parliaments and parliamentarians</PARA>
<PARA> In all seven countries I was able to visit the Parliament buildings and in particular the two Chambers of each Congress, that is seven Senate Chambers and seven House of Representative Chambers. There is a charming and at times even beautiful distinctiveness about the rather baroque palatial Congress buildings that are among the most architecturally significant buildings in Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Santiago, Lima, Caracas, Bogota and Mexico City. I make an exception for the new Congress building remotely and rectangularly placed at Valparaiso by a previous regime. The Congress buildings are still alive with the inspirational memories of such independence heroes as Artigas, San Martine, Bolivar and Santander. In some countries parliamentary democracy has a long history but in most there have been during this century unfortunate suspensions under military regimes of the Right and populist but self-serving and deluded regimes of the Left. Today in every country Parliamentary Democracy is flourishing. Had this not been so then our inclination to make this visit would not have arisen. Of course, constitutionally, Parliaments in Latin America are more of the Washington than Westminster model with directly elected Executive Governments and a quite separately elected Congress as Legislature. Nevertheless parliamentarians both here and there have a great deal in common and we understood each other. </PARA>
<PARA> In Argentina, we attended a House of Representatives session and I was surprised to find the practice of remaining seated to give a speech. Senator Eduardo Menem, Peronist and brother of the President met us in his capacity as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He enthusiastically defended the economic reform policies of the Government and Argentina's international bid for freer trade. We also met former President Alfonsin, cheerful but ageing, at the Radical Party headquarters. </PARA>
<PARA> In Uruguay, our tour of the Parliament building was a real highlight of Montevideo. The two chambers, especially the Senate are architecturally quite dramatic and the marble intricacies of the central assembly hall, the external frescoes and the uniquely elaborated classical pillars and statuary on the roof of the Congress are all very striking. Senator Abreu of the government Blanco Party, an intelligent and relaxed man, hosted a dinner for us, as he is Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. Earlier we had met two Opposition Senators of his committee, one from the Colarado Party and the other Communist. </PARA>
<PARA> In Chile, one of our most memorable and positive conversations was our meeting with the Chairman of the House of Representatives, Mr Jose-Antonio Viera Gallo, a lawyer, formerly of the left and a leading member of the minority People's Democracy Movement which forms the coalition government with the Christian Democrats. Also we were admirably received by the enormously experienced President of the Senate, a Christian Democrat, Senator Gabriel Valdes and we discussed reconciliation in Chile's current political process. Senator Arturo Alessandri, an independent involved with the mining industry in the northern areas of Chile invited us to his own legal firm where he was enthusiastic about the Australian partnership with his country. In Valparaiso we met Vice President of the Senate, Beltran Urenda and former Minister and now appointed Senator Ronald McIntyre, both from the Right. </PARA>
<PARA> In Peru we visited both Chambers approached through elegant corridors decorated with the portraits of two centuries of Chairmen of the Representatives on the left side and Presidents of the Senate on the right side. Parliament was in recess but we met informally with elected Senator Belaunde, a young businessman whose father, as a former President of the Republic, held a Senate seat also. </PARA>
<PARA> In Venezuela the Parliament is adjacent to a busy shopping centre in Caracas. We met parliamentarians Dip. Julio Camino of the Government Party and Dip. Jose Martinez, an independent-the former I had earlier met in Canada, and the latter travelled by plane with us to the Leoni Dam beyond the Orinocco River. I was very interested to meet Sr Miguel A del Pozo, a Christian Democrat secretary of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In Colombia when I visited the Congress, the adjacent square was filled with schoolchildren, bands and soldiers departing on a celebration march through the city to inaugurate the day renaming the capital city ``Santa Fe de Bogota'', its original founding name. The Senate Chamber displayed a prominent painting of Bolivar and Santander after whom two provinces also are named. Interestingly the Standing Committees of the Senate have permanent meeting rooms which give the appearance of being used equally as much as the plenary Chamber itself. We attended a press conference in the Senate and visited the House of Representatives Chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> In Mexico for the seventh time in successive countries I sat in the Presiding Chair of the Senate, this time under the carved national emblem of eagle and snake. We were graciously received by the Grand Commission of the Senate (an executive which has Senate powers in between sessions) and on another evening the Grand Commission of the Chamber of Deputies. Parliamentarians of all parties were represented in our discussions, many of whom were keen to join the delegation to visit Australia later this year. In Mexico parliamentarians must retire at the end of their first term, although some go on to contest seats in the alternative Chamber. On one afternoon we attended a Congressional election meeting at the town of Zumpango. </PARA>
<PARA>3 Business leaders and Industry</PARA>
<PARA> In Argentina, the Australia-Argentine Chamber of Commerce met with us over breakfast at the Alvear Hotel and I was impressed with the President Carlos Bunge and his enthusiasm for Australian trade and joint ventures. Other business representatives including pasturalists, bankers, journalists and traders attended a splendid dinner hosted by the Australian Ambassador Bob Robertson. The Austrade officer, Mr Cesar Fernandez also advised us. </PARA>
<PARA> In Uruguay, our Friday evening dinner included Mr Pedro Nicolas Baridon, President of the Chamber of Industry and Mr Ernesto Carran, President of the Chamber of Commerce-both successful entrepreneurs with wide interests. Mr Baridon urged an improved airlink with Sydney including dedicated on-flights to Montevideo. On two successive days we happily met with Mr Daniel Supervielle, Board member of the Wool Secretariat and our guide to a prosperous estancia. At ``La Rabida'' we inspected dairy, beef, sheep and lucerne cropping where the pastures ended abruptly on the edge of the Rio de la Plata. We met members of the Charolais Society and noted that Mr Rodrigo Artagoveita and others will attend a Charolais meeting in Sydney next year. </PARA>
<PARA> In Chile a wide range of businessmen attended our welcoming lunch including the Australia-Chile Chamber of Commerce President from the forestry industry together with lawyers bankers and especially the mining industry. At the Australian reception at Hotel Plaza San Francisco we met representatives of BHP, Mr Isa Mines, Coca Cola, the Spanish Bank Banco Santander, the ANZ Bank and Comalco. We were happy to be advised by Austrade officer, Mr Guillermo Garcia whom I invited to tennis when he visits Australia later this year. In Vino del Mar we discussed shipping routes and capacities with ship agents, Ian Taylor and John Gray. We also were able to call on think-tank economists, Mr Christian Larroulet (one of the ``Chicago boys'') at the Institute of Liberty and Development, and Mr Joaquin Vial at the Centre for Economic Research in Latin America. </PARA>
<PARA> In Peru, no Australian businesses were brought to our attention although the opportunities for Australian involvement could be significant- in mining and energy, in food processing and in agricultural technology. Currently our largest export to Peru, by far, is barley. </PARA>
<PARA> In Venezuela, no Australian businesses were brought to our attention but Australian trade has doubled to A$40m in the last two years. There are prospects for Australia exporting mining equipment, food processing technology, agriculture technology (seeds and cattle) and telecommunications equipment as Venezuela's already prospering economy extends the development of abundant natural resources. We were able to fly beyond the Orinocco River one Saturday to tour the huge hydroelectric dam at Guri; current capacity 10,000 megawatts but becoming 18,000 megawatts when two subsidiary dams are completed by the end of the century. We also visited a pine plantation on the sandy plain north of Puerto Ordaz at Uverito. </PARA>
<PARA> In Colombia, I was greatly impressed by that country's magnificent prospects for natural resource development and industrial development. Already Colombia is the only Latin American country to have had positive real economic growth in all of the last twenty years. The economy is prosperous, broadly based and strengthened by comparatively high education standards and distinctively good local entrepreneurial and management skills. Coffee the traditional mainstay is now being overtaken by the wealth generated from oil, gas, coal, gold, emeralds, cut flowers, textiles and the products of the petrochemical industry. For example, most of Australia's carpet backing is imported from Colombia and about half of the cut-flower trade in the USA and Europe is based on Colombian exports. We visited glasshouses near Bogota to examine rose and carnation production and packaging; and in Cartagena and Bogota we visited polypropylene, PVC, plastic bioriented film, vinyl flooring, vinyl wallpaper, textiles, carpet backing and other related production plants. These industries have state of the art equipment with computer controls. We also visited in the seaside lowlands of the Magdalena River a new enterprise in shrimp farming currently producing about twenty million six-inch prawns each 3-month cycle. This development is building its own research technology in a specialised food market to serve the European and North American markets. At an evening reception in Bogota and on several other occasions we met the business entrepreneurs of Colombia. I gained the impression that as sound investors and managers they could teach many Australians a great deal about how to be internationally competitive and win overseas trade. The Colombian Government and the great majority of the Colombian people are determined to rid their country of the twin cancers of narcotic drug traders and minority political terrorists. In recent years great improvements have been won on both fronts. As soon as these evils may be eliminated Colombia will be a significant economic force not only in the region but internationally. (Finally, I add a footnote about the myth that Colombia's prosperity may be based n the 1980's drug trade. This myth is false. The drug trade based in remote areas of Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia was estimated last year to generate US$4B annually. One quarter of this amount finds its way back to the local economies. However, the security costs alone needed to resist drug violence and other social and economic dislocations carry a cost and penalty of much more than $1B annually. Colombia's GNP exceeds US$40B. Australia is cooperating with the Colombian Government in its war against the drug trade.)</PARA>
<PARA> In Mexico City, the largest city in the world (18m), the volume of prosperity appears greater than anywhere else in Latin America with Sao Paulo perhaps as an exception. However, a large proportion of the city's population are very poor as are the village people generally in rural areas throughout the whole country. We were impressed with the relative prosperity of Mexican business and banking interests, especially in the last four years of increasing investment and the last two years of economic reform that has strengthened Mexico as a market economy and one poised to enter the North America Free Trade Agreement with the USA and Canada. President Salinas himself has been the driving force in these recent successes. We met the President of the Business Coordinating Council of Mexico, Lic. Rolanda Vega and his Council colleagues and secretariat officers. They gave us a comprehensive briefing about Mexican business prospects including the importance of wharf and shipping reform (currently, for cost and security reasons, Houston in Texas is Mexico's largest port!) Future prospects for Australian coal and uranium are good and there are wide-open opportunities for Australian trade and joint venture enterprises. Mexico is looking to build stronger economic relations with Australia and through Australia to Asia. Mexico is this year opening embassies in New Zealand and in South East Asia. Also the Banamex bank is opening a branch in Sydney in October 1991. We called at Banamex Headquarters in a splendidly restored colonial building where this very significant private bank has been at the heart of Mexican commerce for more than a century. At several receptions we met other Mexican businessmen and lawyers. In addition we discussed NAFTA and the protection of Australia's free trade access with both the USA Ambassador, H E John Negroponte and Canadian acting Ambassador David Adam. With the Cuban Ambassador we discussed Cuba's interest to gain Australian CSIRO expertise and training about sugar production : sugar is the principal export of Cuba. </PARA>
<PARA>4 Cultural activities</PARA>
<PARA> In Buenos Aires, I was struck by the superb European architecture which flourished a century ago-the period which continued until about 1930 as the Argentine's years of flourishing prosperity. I am glad Peron was unable to demolish the French Embassy which stands today in a small region of splendid buildings at the end of the broad 9 July Avenue. Secondly, I was impressed by the relaxed ambience of Alvear Park and the nearby historic cemetery. In the park beside the pavement restaurant tables and enormous spreading fig trees were lawns on which pet dogs paraded. One pet-handler I saw was walking a dozen dogs of all shapes and sizes all on their individual leads and, in addition, slung on his hip was a monkey. Thirdly, the Congress is a splendid focal building of European style and Washington structure with fully Argentine historical artworks and historical meaning. Finally, the antique shops would equally grace London, Paris or Rome with a wide variety of expensive and elegant turn-of-the century items. </PARA>
<PARA> In Uruguay, the architecture that we saw falls into four flourishing periods: (1) the eighteen century Portuguese and Spanish port fortifications at Colonia on the Rio de la Plata, (2) the late nineteenth century buildings of Montevideo, especially the quite unique and splendid Congress building with its luxuriant chambers and eyecatching super-edifice of portals and statuary, (3) the 1950's attractive estancias with spanish home, thatched roofs, large practical agricultural and dairy buildings, stylish wrought-iron gateways and grids, and park style avenues and wooded dams, and (4) the 1980's international jet-set city and summer resort of Punte Del Este with its Atlantic and River Plate coasts, high rise apartments, millionaire suburban residences, restaurants and sporting facilities. At Colonia we were especially interested to see for ourselves the memorial to Captain Arthur Philip, first Governor of New South Wales, who had for about ten years prior to 1778 served as an officer in the Portuguese garrison at Colonia. </PARA>
<PARA> In Chile, our visit was confined to Santiago, Valparaiso and Vina del Mar. The Plaza de Armas or central park of the capital city is the historic centre of the original fortified settlement established 450 years ago. This Plaza is alive with people selling and singing and preaching, sitting in the sunshine or visiting the Cathedral on one side or the City Hall on the other. A service was in progress in the Cathedral church when we attended and nearby the Mayor of Santiago, Sr Jaime Ravinet, welcomed us to a splendid luncheon in elegant rooms. We also visited the PreColumban Museum. </PARA>
<PARA> In Lima again we visited the Plaza de Armas with exemplary colonial edifices, notably the Cathedral and the stately Presidential Palace. The old part of the city retains many wonderful buildings of the Spanish ascendancy when Lima was the capital of the whole continent-buildings such as Palacio de Torre Tagle and the Church San Francisco. Secondly, we visited the Miraflores, commercial and embassy area before going on to the century-old centre of art and affluence, Barranco. We dined here at the Manas Negros restaurant with an exclusively Peruvian menu and where a very popular rhythm singer, a lively mestizo woman, and combo band enthralled a packed house. However, the unforgettable experience for us was our visit to the National Museum of Peru which admirably displays the many pre-Columban cultures the most recent of which was the Inca civilisation centred in the Andean mountains near Cuzco. This very instructive museum whet our appetites to return to Macha Picchu, the Nazca Lines and to Lake Titicaca. </PARA>
<PARA> In Caracas we saw the city to which the poetic memories of the hero Bolivar were with most affection directed. Our own experience however was of a highrise congested city squeezed into a valley between high mountain ranges, thirty miles from the Caribbean coast. We heard commending stories about the coral reefs and beautiful beaches of some islands in the east towards Trinidad and Tobago. </PARA>
<PARA> In Bogota we attended a welcoming luncheon at the University of Bogota hosted by the Chancellor, Dr Juan Hernandez Saenz, Vice Chancellor Dr Evaristo Obregon Garces and Councillors. The University is one of nine in the city. It specialises in marine biology, agriculture, marketing and management, and international relations. Requests were made for Australian exchanges at the postgraduate and staff levels in these areas. We also visited the well equipped Luis Angel Arrango Library, the Religious Art Museum the Colonial Art Museum, with its magnificent emerald bejewelled crucifixes, and the exquisite Gold Museum with an invaluable array of original preHispanic gold and gold-copper artefacts. </PARA>
<PARA> In Cartagena we ``discovered'' the best preserved and historically most strategic colonial naval fortifications in all Latin America. The old city retains its city wall completely surrounding an unspoiled array of spanish colonial buildings, plazas and streets as they have been for three hundred years. The old multistoried and balconied villas are being restored with modern lighting, swimming pools in indoor courtyards and unusually structured rooms repolished to their former glory. At the mouth of the Cartagena bay, Boca-Chica, the cannon emplacements, chain barrier and other fortifications are well preserved from the era when they were designed to keep out marauding English seamen like Drake and Raleigh. Of course, Cartagena with its tropical beaches, first class hotels, discotheques and shops is a tourist and holiday paradise. Also, in contrast with Bogota, we needed no security precautions at Cartagena, armed or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> In Mexico, we visited the central park and the vantage point to view the city from Emperor Maximillian's lofty palace balustrades. Also in this park is the magnificent Museum of Anthropology, surely one of the half dozen most valuable museums anywhere in the world. Exhibited there are the treasures of some scores of civilisations which flourished in MesoAmerica over the last four thousand years. The last inheritor of all these cultures was the Aztec which flourished in the several centuries preceding the Spanish conquest. Cortes' victory in 1521 over Tlateloco however is not seen as a ``defeat'' of the preceding cultures. Rather, Mexicans today describe the MesoAmerican-Spanish marriage of cultures as a positive merger which needs to be appreciated to understand contemporary Mexican sovereignty and self-awareness. This fall of Tlateloco ``was neither a triumph nor a defeat. It was the painful birth of the Mestizo People which is Mexico today.'' So stands the inscription today in the midst of the Aztec ruins, the active Cathedral church and the political memories of the student martyrs of 1968. The Museum was superbly illuminated for us by our guide, Dr Cosafino Cabrera. Also she guided us in our visit to the murals of the Presidential Palace and in the nearby Museum of Templo Mayor. I am still excited by the man-sized clay statues from the House of the Eagle-Knights. The MesoAmerican cultures are another world still to be discovered by most Australians. Australian tourist visits to Mexico currently stand at about 1000 per annum but the level could well be twenty times that number. Mexico City's special treasure in my mind is the Museum of Anthropology and the cultural heritage it represents. That this culture is very much alive and being extended in contemporary Mexican art is illustrated for me by my long conversation with Mexico's Attorney General, Ignacio Morales Lechuga. In addition to the Museum we were able to visit the Pyramids of Tenochtitlan, fifty kilometres north of the city, a large complex in a broad rural valley. We also visited the Buenavista Handicrafts Market which in retail terms is very well managed. </PARA>
<PARA>5 Other activities of interest</PARA>
<PARA> In Buenos Aires, we were guided one evening by the Australian journalist, Mr Stuart Heather, contracted to ABC Radio and actively evaluating contemporary developments in South America. We enjoyed a walk to a popular Mall near the memorial marking the four hundredth anniversary of the foundation of Buenos Aires in 1536. In the mall we found a happily crowded restaurant specialising in BBQ Argentine steaks. </PARA>
<PARA> In Montevideo I pondered the enormous statue of Artigas mounted on his horse which stands in the central square, the Victoria Plaza. Also we visited the dozen antiques shops nearby. I was struck in all the cities of Uruguay that about a quarter of all the cars on the roads were from the 1920's and 1930's-all makes and models restored and actually used for practical transport. It was also interesting to visit near Colonia an abandoned bullring made of steel and brick, resembling Eiffel Tower engineering, but which was only used for two years about 1911 before bullfighting was banned as it still is in the south of the continent. </PARA>
<PARA> At Valparaiso we saw the naval and merchant ships of Chile in the harbour there and contemplated that ninety years ago, before the Panama canal was built, one third of all ships departing Australia indicated they were Valparaiso-bound. Before setting out from Australia I was determined to touch the water of the Pacific on the Chile side of this ocean that joins our continents together. I did so at an adjacent beach in the seaside resort of Vino del Mar. </PARA>
<PARA> The Andes Mountains may be a theoretical concept until physically seen. As it happened for us, our aircraft took the South Pole route and so we first saw the South American continent near its southern tip. For several hours we flew along the Andes mountain chain, enormous mountains covered in snow and which present an almost impenetrable barrier between the western and eastern sides of the continent, between Chile and Argentina. </PARA>
<PARA> In Lima there are two groups of political terrorists, the larger being a Maoist or Khmer Rouge style group intent on guerrilla violence in some rural localities and assassination and theft to disrupt order in the cities. Accordingly, all buildings, offices, factories and strategic infrastructure have permanent armed guards. For the entire length of our visit, both day and night, we were escorted by armed guards. In moving about there were ten altogether, two outriders on motorbikes, a preceding car of four uniformed army personnel toting revolvers and a machine-gun out of the car windows, and a following car with four plain-clothes armed police. We felt safe. Actually the passers by seemed to accept our cavalcade as quite normal and these security measures did not impede or intrude upon our busy agenda of meetings. Also, in Lima we observed that half of all the cars were Volkswagon beetles-there is an assembly plant in Peru and clearly it has been flourishing. They seem all to be the 1960's style model. Beetle taxis have the front passenger seat removed and only carry two passengers. </PARA>
<PARA> In Venezuela we flew one Saturday to the Leoni Dam at Guri beyond the Orinocco River and near to Puerto Ordaz. We were flying in a two- pilot chartered King 200 aircraft. On our return towards Caracas we could see storm clouds around the mountains. The plane diverted to the coast to land at the large international airport. Flying low over the Caribbean Sea we saw a Lufthansa jumbo jet a kilometre away begin its descent to land. Our aircraft turned to follow the jet as the next in line. Suddenly and without warning our aircraft fell sharply as we hit the wake of the jet. With great force two of us hit our heads on the cabin roof. I did especially as without any seatbelt I was kneeling at the shoulders of the pilots watching the other air traffic and the Caribbean coast. The mild concussion lasted a day and the abrasion lasted a week. The moral of the story is to wear a hat when flying over the Caribbean!</PARA>
<PARA> In Bogota we passed an eye clinic surrounded by four international hotels. The hotels are for patients of the clinic who come to have unique operations. The skilled Colombian doctors adjust the patients' eyeballs to remove short-sightedness, long-sightedness or astigmatism in typically half-hour procedures under local anaesthetic. Even an Australian woman has flown to Colombia for this operation. Also, on the streets of Bogota outside the Agriculture Ministry where the pavement is unusually broad there were a dozen or twenty men standing around with little white bags. We were told this was the main international emerald market-about 80% of the world emerald production is in Colombia. In the city and suburbs we were impressed by large groups of schoolchildren coming and going from school in a variety of neat colourful uniforms. Also in the library hundreds of secondary students seemed diligent and industrious aided by computer files and hands-on books maps and documents. The Liberal Party in Government has made Education a priority-this is an investment for the future which will assist Colombia to excel. </PARA>
<PARA> In Mexico City I was struck by the pivotal position Mexico has geographically in the cockpit of the Americas. In the North, having a long border shared with the USA, the majority of Mexico's trade is in this direction. In the South, Guatemala, El Salvador and the other Central American Republics look to Mexico as their biggest neighbour, and Mexico maintains strong political links with the Republics of the South American Continent. Mexico has a ``group of three'' energy agreement with Venezuela and Colombia. Mexico has recently completed a free-trade bilateral agreement with Chile which will stand alongside NAFTA. In the East, the Atlantic orientation is towards Europe, the destination of some major Mexican exports and a source of investment in Mexico. In the West, the fourth direction for Mexico, the Pacific orientation is towards Australia and Asia. Mexican leaders assured me that they wished to maintain all four relationships and that they were taking steps to see the Asia-Pacific relationship grow stronger. In particular we were assured that the terms of NAFTA would not limit Mexico's economic relations with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my speech by thanking all of the eminent people in all seven countries whom I have already mentioned-Presidents, Vice Presidents, Ministers, Senators and Representatives in all seven Congresses, officials, businessmen, academics, cultural guides and all the others whom we met and who received us so well. </PARA>
<PARA> Especially, I thank my own parliamentary colleagues, Senator Robert Hill, Opposition Foreign Affairs Spokesman and Hon. John Moore MP, former Minister for Business in the Liberal and National Government: they are excellent travelling companions. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to thank the Latin American Ambassadors in Canberra with whom I have enjoyed an increasingly active dialogue over the past twelve months and by whose own personal efforts we had such excellent arrangements in each country:</PARA>
<PARA>Juan Carlos Beltramino, Ambassador of Argentina</PARA>
<PARA>Julio Giambruno, Charge D'Affaires of Uruguay</PARA>
<PARA>Juan Salazar, Ambassador of Chile</PARA>
<PARA>Gonzalo Bedoya, Ambassador of Peru</PARA>
<PARA>Eduardo Morreo, Ambassador of Venezuela</PARA>
<PARA>Antonio Puerto, Ambassador of Colombia</PARA>
<PARA>Alejandro Morales, Ambassador of Mexico. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to thank our diplomatically very experienced Ambassador Bob Robertson, our head of mission for Argentina and Uruguay and his wife, Isobel for their kindness and assistance in Buenos Aires and Montevideo. Also I thank Consul Marcello Scavuzzo for his friendly efforts on our behalf in Uruguay. In Chile, our Charge D'Affaires, Noel Campbell assisted us confidently and well and we were impressed by his grasp of the Spanish language and his affection for Chile. I make a special mention of our new friend, the Head of Protocol in Chile's Foreign Ministry, Ambassador Mariano Fontecilla De Santiago Concha whose enthusiasm and assistance in our visit was much appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> In Peru we unfortunately received no assistance from our credentialled Ambassador and his staff who are located on the other side of the continent in Brazilia. However, the Foreign Ministry of Peru made some fine arrangements for us and, especially, we are indebted to a member of the National Parliament of Peru and my friend from earlier this year, Dip. Eduardo Calmell del Solar whose two staff members, Mr Francis Butters and Mr Luis Echeandia marvellously supported us in all the arrangements for our stay and we are very grateful to them. </PARA>
<PARA> We thank sincerely Ambassador Dominique De Stoop, our Ambassador in Caracas and his wife Jane for their generous hospitality: Also, the Embassy staff, Brent Knevett and Margaret Pinsent who assisted us both in Venezuela and in Colombia. </PARA>
<PARA> Our visit to Colombia, if not to Latin America altogether, would not have been possible without the friendship, sound advice and enthusiastic planning of Dr Antonio Puerto, first Colombian Ambassador to Australia whose term concluded in Canberra a few weeks before our visit to his homeland. We thank him for travelling with us in Bogota and Cartagena, for his and his wife Diana's evening reception for us at their home and his excellent arrangements for us everywhere. Equally we thank the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Dr Puerto's successor in Canberra, Mr Fernando Navas who often met with us and who we already count as a valued friend. He arrives in Canberra next month. We were happy to share a meal with Australia's honorary consul, Dr Dario Cardenas. </PARA>
<PARA> In Mexico, Ambassador Keith Baker who knows Mexico so very well was comprehensively professional and an excellent adviser and host who accompanied us in all our major engagements. We thank him, his wife, Marlee and the staff of our Embassy who assisted us so cheerfully and so very well. Also, we thank the foreign Ministry of Mexico and the Parliament for all the excellent arrangements they made for us. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I should add that my own evaluations of this very successful visit to Latin America will be incorporated in the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade current inquiry into ``Australia's Relations with the Republics of Latin America''. Our full Report and recommendations should be published towards the end of this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Yes. The Munno Para Child Care Centre received a $16,000 grant as part of a management assistance package aimed at restoring the centre's viability. The centre was in financial difficulty and fees could not be increased to a level that would allow them to trade out of difficulty because of the adverse impact the increase would have on utilisation. The centre was assessed against program Guidelines and paid a one-off grant to see it through this difficult period and prevent its closure. The grant was conditional on the implementation of a management plan to restructure the centre's administration. The service provided is considered necessary in the area and with the removal of the accumulated debt and restructuring of the administration was considered to be a viable service.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The grant was made under the Services for Families with Children Program.</PARA>

<PARA>  With reference to Question on Notice No. 567 of 20 March 1991, has the National Health and Medical Research Council and/or the Department of Community Services and Health advised the chemical manufacturer, Velsicol, to stop using propylene oxide in heptachlor and chlordane; if so, why was this advice given, when was it given and has the company implemented the advice; if so, when.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The evaluation of Technical Grade Active Constituents for use in agricultural and veterinary chemical products is the responsibility of the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council (AAVCC), which receives advice on public health matters from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).</PARA>
<PARA>  The NHMRC advised AAVCC of concerns about propylene oxide in technical grade active chlordane in July 1990 and heptachlor in August 1990 and requested AAVCC to raise the matter with Velsicol. In addition, the NHMRC, in September 1990, rescheduled propylene oxide from Schedule 6 to Schedule 7 on the basis of adverse effects seen in chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity studies. The effect of this decision is to recommend to States and Territories that the use of propylene oxide be restricted to authorised or licensed persons only, for either approved research purposes or for approved industrial or manufacturing purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>  I understand that the company has responded to the concerns of NHMRC and since late 1990, technical heptachlor entering Australia has been free of propylene oxide. Technical chlordane which is free of propylene oxide has been more difficult to achieve because of batch production methods but Velsicol has advised that, before the end of 1991, imported technical chlordane will be free of propylene oxide.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) (a) The estimate of 28,000 new child care places is the anticipated response by the private sector (both commercial and employer sponsored) and previously unfunded non-profit organisations to fee relief initiatives and tax concessions announced in March 1990. The places have not been split between these categories of service providers. All 28,000 places will be in long day care centres.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) Fee relief was extended to families using approved commercial and employer sponsored and other previously unfunded centres from 1 January 1991. Exemption from fringe benefits tax for employers making payments to reserve child care places in centres was extended to commercial and employer sponsored centres as of 1 January 1991. Employers may claim many expenses incurred in providing child care for employees' children as deductions against assessable income including most operating costs of running a child care centre. Employers and private operators are also able to write off, for taxation purposes, the capital cost of constructing a centre. It is anticipated that these measures will act as an incentive to ensure that the target is achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) None. The commitment to provide 50,000 additional places under the 1990 extension of the National Child Care Strategy (NCCS) is subject to cost-sharing agreements with each State Government. Negotiations with the States have commenced but, to date, no agreement has been finalised, therefore, no expenditure has been incurred. There will be no taxation revenue foregone in respect of any of these 50,000 places.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) In the first weeks of January 1991, 645 child care centres in the commercial, employer sponsored and previously unfunded non-profit sectors began offering fee relief. By 30 June 1991, this number had increased to 1030 centres. At this stage, the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services has no information about which of these centres has commenced operations since either the March 1990 commitments or the 1 January 1991 changes, but a census of these centres to be conducted later this year will provide that information.</PARA>

<PARA>    occasional care centres--4,600</PARA>
<PARA>    outside school hours care services--1,600.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) In 1989-90, the cost to revenue of fee relief for employer sponsored child care was nil. For 1990-91 the cost is not able to be separated from the total fee relief paid to commercial and previously unfunded non-profit centres. The total fee relief figure for this group was approximately $28.5m in 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) Prior to January 1991, fee relief was available only to employers who entered into arrangements with the Commonwealth under the Industry Initiative. Under this initiative, employers were required to provide the capital facility. Recurrent costs were to be shared between users, the Commonwealth and employers with the Commonwealth contribution taking the form of fee relief up to a ceiling of $70 per week (compared to the $90 ceiling then current in community-based centres). Changes introduced in the August 1990 Budget superseded the Industry Initiative. They included more flexibility in the requirements for employer contributions and extending fully the fee relief system to any commercial and employer funded centres which are approved for eligibility to participate. The fee relief available under these arrangements, like that available in other long day care services, is paid against a maximum of $100 for 50 hours of care. The Government has also given a commitment to index annually the key parameters of the fee relief system.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) The following operating subsidies were paid to:</PARA>

<PARA>Hours Care  8.7  10.1  6.7</PARA>
<PARA>  * In 1990-91 the payment cycle was changed so that advances were paid in the `current quarter' rather than the `previous quarter'. This brought the Child Care Program into line with all other Commonwealth programs. As a result, 1990-91 figures only include payments for three quarters.</PARA>
