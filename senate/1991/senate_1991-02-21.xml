<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Senate adjourned last night I was speaking on the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill 1991, which is to amend the Wool Marketing Act 1987 to provide for a wool industry supplementary payments scheme and to suspend the reserve price scheme. As I was saying before the adjournment, the world wool price has little effect on the demand for wool. It did not in the late 1960s or in the early 1970s before the reserve price scheme began when wool prices fluctuated wildly. Buyers never minded the price of wool as long as it was relative to the price of other fibres. The only conclusion one can draw from that is that the approach of the academic economists to the current wool industry battle is badly flawed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no good talking all the time about a free market in a world where a free market does not exist and does not operate. We should be ever vigilant against allowing ideology on economic issues and crass politics to misplace the needs of people. This is what is happening in many industries today, and it is at the expense of many important sections of our community. Currently it is the economic survival of the Australian wool industry which is at stake. Today we have to take action to correct the bad decisions made by the Government when it started speculating about and then subsequently reducing the floor price of wool. In yesterday's edition of the Queensland Courier-Mail there appeared a very interesting letter from a wool producer from Winton. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Federal Government forced the lowering of the wool reserve price from 870c to 700c. </PARA>
<PARA> Federal Primary Industries Minister John Kerin subsequently promised that price would be ``immutable'', and appealed to all to give his decision a chance to work. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Government did the very thing Mr Kerin asked people not to do. It set up the Vines inquiry, which by its very title and terms fuelled rather than reduced industry uncertainty and instability. </PARA>
<PARA> Buyers predictably held back for months with a wary return to the market towards the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> Gradually a higher percentage was being bought until the market hit rock bottom with sales suspended. </PARA>
<PARA> Ordinary growers had no idea of the reason. </PARA>
<PARA> Is this really the Government's idea of promoting a climate of stability to get the wool industry back on its feet?</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Government thought that it would be able to get those millions of bales of wool in Australia to the markets if it reduced the price. Where are those bales now? They are stored in sheds throughout Australia. It is to correct this problem that we are debating this Bill today. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the farm cash operating surplus of the woolgrowers has been estimated to fall to negative $5,700 in 1991-92, according to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) and will remain around these levels for at least two years. The increased debt that must be financed will require increased levies as a direct result of the limit placed on the Government's contribution to the supplementary payments scheme. As the ABARE figure indicates, this will be very difficult to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> Woolgrowers are facing a future of enormous depressed financial circumstances and they want and need financial assistance now before they are irrevocably destroyed. What we have to remember is that the financial position of woolgrowers affects the rural communities in which they live throughout Australia. The Government has an obligation to help them. It has a particular obligation because the whole collapse of the reserve price scheme is the result of irresponsible speculation on the part of the Government and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin. We have to remember in particular that it was Mr Kerin who originally said that he would consider lowering the floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> When the reserve price of 870c was originally set, it was during a period of high prices for wool. In fact, the price of 870c was conservative at the time, with wool fetching about 1200c. It was the Minister who then decided to start to speculate that the reserve price would drop. So, naturally, buyers stayed away from the markets in anticipation of that drop. Of course, if the Minister was forced by the economic blow-out of the Budget to drop the price once, can we blame any businessman for suspecting that if times got tough enough the Minister would, despite his many assurances throughout the world that he would not, again drop the reserve price?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ND4">Senator BJELKE-PETERSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Boswell that it was. Mr Kerin went around the world promising that the wool price would stay at 700c. His word was immutable, he said that the floor price would be maintained until June 1992. The Japanese Government, the Italian Government and the British Government all took Mr Kerin at his word. In fact, I saw an article in the Sydney Morning Herald the other day stating that the Japanese are seeking wool payment from the Australian Government in compensation to cover losses arising from the wool industry chaos. This article went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Japanese importers, collectively the biggest customers for Australian wool, are furious over losses of up to $50 million that they will suffer as a result of misleading advice from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, last November. </PARA>
<PARA>What about the loss of $500m that Australian woolgrowers are going to suffer? I was interested to see that Mr Yasui, general manager of the wool division at Nippon Keori-one of the biggest Japanese importers-is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>When we met Mr Kerin in Osaka, we believed his comment . . . We were wrong to accept Mr Kerin's statement.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that does Mr Kerin or the Government very much good at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that we can believe that, actually. That is what this has proved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Kerin further compounded the sabotage by giving his support to members of the Vines committee which travelled Europe supposedly seeking information on the wool industry, but asking buyers whether they would buy the wool if it dropped to 500c. All of this was done with the general authorisation of the Minister, who has even foolishly defended the action. Does the Government not have enough sense to realise that this was the green light for buyers to stay away in anticipation of that drop to 500c or lower?</PARA>
<PARA> One of my main concerns with this current legislation is that we act to maintain the mechanism for a floor price. This should be especially important until we see the results of the Vines report and its recommendations. It is for this reason that I will not be supporting the amendment moved yesterday by Senator Tambling to terminate permanently the reserve price scheme. I ask my coalition colleagues just what they will suggest we do when we have to consider this issue later this year if the Vines committee recommends that some sort of similar scheme be retained. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, prior to this round of destruction of the industry by the Minister, Mr Kerin, and the Government, a reserve price scheme had been the basis of a successful wool industry since 1972. I really cannot agree with the proposition that the wool reserve price should be abolished today. The Government says it should be suspended at the moment, and I certainly do not agree that it should be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I believe that the Government should also make good its compensation to the industry in light of the damage it has caused. After all, the Government is good at giving money to rescue other industries which have failed. It has given guarantees to the South Australian State Bank and it gave assistance to both Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd and the car industry. I believe that it should also do so for what was Australia's most productive industry. The Government also owes the industry more compensation than it is currently proposing to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government pushed the floor price down last autumn, the Australian Wool Corporation had to buy the stocks of wool at 870c and sell them at 700c. This cost the industry not $300m but $500m and, as such, the Government owes the industry and the growers this money. This is not a generous hand-out; rather, it is what it owes to the growers because of its irresponsible actions in destroying Australia's wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly agree with amendment No. 1 to be moved by Senator Tambling on behalf of the Opposition in the Committee of the Whole to provide a limit or a cap of $200m on the borrowings of the Wool Corporation. If the borrowings continue to blow out, the woolgrowers could be up for a wool tax of 41 per cent and that, of course, is a very good way to go broke. At the moment, there seems to be much talk of loans that have to be paid back and increasing costs to the woolgrowers. The President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr John Allwright, said that the Government should reduce costs to farmers-and that of course includes woolgrowers-such as sales taxes and fuel charges. He also said that there is much the Government can do to reduce the uncompetitive level of domestic costs imposed on farmers and other exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the Government does give $1 billion in overseas aid. I believe increased assistance should be available for our wool industry which is, and has been, our biggest earner of overseas trade balance and, as such, has contributed so much to the living standard of all who live in urban Australia. There is no doubt in my mind that the Government should increase assistance to what was once the most productive sector of the Australian economy. In conclusion, I want to remind honourable senators that there is a future for wool and the wool industry of Australia. It is a top quality product and, given a fair chance, it will compete successfully. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to speak to the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill. I have already listened to and read many excellent speeches that must be close to the heart of every Australian and certainly every honourable senator and honourable member who has spoken. What a disaster the wool growing industry has become.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question before us all must be: how long will it take to re-establish the industry? I hope that in the weeks, months or years ahead the major effort will be given not to raking over the recrimination of the past and where to lay blame, but to looking at a new, vigorous, competitive and fully integrated wool industry for the future. Since January 1990, when I was first acquainted of the impending disaster, I have been amazed at the way the industry has lurched from post to post, making no progress whatsoever. I have been equally amazed that the growers have no idea of how the industry operates; even the Wool Council of Australia complains about its problems of getting information from the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). One grower recently said to me that any grower under 45 years of age really does not remember what woolgrowing and marketing was like pre-Corporation. During their careers, they have been totally insulated from the realities of the market and the performance of the growers organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The enormity of the situation is escaping many people and leading to all sorts of totally unrealistic comments, suggestions, requests and even demands. We are talking about an industry, initially involving 76,000 producers, which grows to about 400,000 with the various multipliers in the town and country areas. There is a grower investment in the stockpile of $1,800m. That in itself is a huge amount of money; but they also have a debt of $2,800m. This is a real debt and every one of those 76,000 growers has a liability in it, averaging $40,000, with interest growing daily. Interest is currently accruing at the rate of, say, $400m a year, or in excess of $1m a day. The assets of the Corporation comprise the stockpile, which is plus or minus five million bales, plus its buildings, plant and equipment valued at somewhere between $500m and $1,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, I have been told many times of all the virtues of the Corporation and all the good things it has done and how well it operates. But I find that I must question that. It may have made the woolgrower's life easier, but has it really assisted him in the long term? For instance, figures produced recently indicate that the price received is less, in comparative terms, than it would have been without a floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> A short time ago, wool enjoyed about 10 per cent of the world fibre market. If our promotion is so good and our plans so sound, why does wool now enjoy less than 4 per cent of the world fibre market-and falling? Recently, a delegation to China of which I was a member was told by the Chinese that wool was just another fibre, and that they do not like our floor price scheme or our auction system. We must take what they say very seriously because they are customers. That comes from a country which could, under a better arrangement, be our biggest customer for wools which we produce in abundance and which are very hard to sell, so it is very important.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of that comment, we must also compare wool with cotton. The cotton industry is not having this fuss. It is increasing its sales. It runs a very low cost system and it is increasing its prices. It has no stockpile and no huge bureaucracy. So we must also ask: is it out of step, or is wool? I just pose that question. </PARA>
<PARA> When I came to this Parliament, I found it the done thing to kick the processing sector of the industry-the industry being, I believe, a broad union of growers, processors and users alike. When I expressed my views in the Parliament, I received an invitation to attend the headquarters of the Corporation for lunch-which was lunch and a very stiff rebuke, based on the fact that processing and manufacturing in Australia was undesirable and that I would be better off by not supporting the industry but supporting the Corporation's point of view. I would have to add that, apart from the fact that it made me more determined than ever to pursue the value adding, broader industry view, the view that the Corporation expressed that day still seems to persist. As a result of this, I got to know Mr Kevin Perrott and his successor, Louise Jamson, of the Wool Textile Manufacturers of Australia very well, and I commend to the Parliament and to the producer section of the whole industry not only that the type of proposals that Kevin Perrott produced several years ago should be acted upon, but that that should be done properly and quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> So much concentration has been placed on the development of the exclusive image of wool, and the miracle fibre promotion, that the concept of wool being the popular and universal product has been lost. The concentration of the Corporation has been on all of the ways of buying wool in, not on getting wool sold and in use. Wool that is on customers' backs and wool in and out of shops around the world must take the place of wool in AWC wool stores. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, has quoted $220 per bale per year as the cost of keeping a bale in store. With five million bales, the total cost runs to approximately $1 billion per year. How long can we even contemplate watching an asset disappear? Growers of wool must come to grips with that, particularly as I note that some commentators, such as David Barnett, are saying that the total value of the stockpile on realisation may be only about $2 billion, or there- abouts, in the first place. We are losing forever 60c per bale per day-$1 billion per year-and most growers would have no idea of how much money that is. That is a huge amount and it is their asset that is disappearing. </PARA>
<PARA> We are much better to be selling and loss cutting by getting wool popularised than we are to be pretending that 700c can be supported as a reasonable figure. If wool is so good at 700c, why do we have five million unsold bales eating their heads off? Certainly, price is not the only factor: promotion, quality and reliability also influence buyers. But all things being equal, the greatest single determining factor in any goods is price. We must get the sales going and we must recognise that, for whatever reason, there is no credibility left for the 700c price. Much as I and every woolgrower in Australia would like to feel that that can be attained, that is not the case. Prosperity, or the industry's return to it, can come only from a stimulation of sales. We must concentrate on the buyers. I have always said that I do not care what one grows, breeds, produces or makes-it is worthless unless there is a buyer prepared to buy. And currently buyers are unhappy and are not buying. </PARA>
<PARA> The funding is gone-it is all spent-and returning to the past is not an option. Large increases in the debt are simply not possible. I would like to quote the Chairman of the Corporation in the Australian Woolgrower letter of February 1991. On the front page he says that the realities of life must be faced. That is what the industry now has before it. He further states on the third page of that letter:</PARA>
<PARA>Every bale of wool bought from now on must certainly cost more than its eventual value in interest and storage costs. This is not commercially rational. </PARA>
<PARA> To continue to operate the 700 cent floor would almost inevitably lead to a stockpile of more than six million bales and a debt above $4 billion. Such a level of debt covered by Government guarantee is politically unacceptable. The burden of funding and servicing such a debt would be intolerable for the wool growing industry and too great to ask the taxpayer to subsidise for long. </PARA>
<PARA>It is just not possible. The floor price must cease. The sales must proceed urgently. The obligation to growers to the end of the 1990-91 season must be attended to. The existing stocks must be quarantined. The stockpile management and disposal program must be handled with greater care. The assets of the Corporation will need to be realised to whatever amount is necessary to meet to pay-out obligations on the suppliers and/or interest, and not by further increasing the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is the world leader in wool production and has 180 million sheep or thereabouts. New Zealand has 65 million sheep, South Africa 30 million and Uruguay 26 million, and Australia must give the lead that this involves. The industry has had some great leaders, but time seems to have separated them from the growers who, in the main, are totally ignorant of the overall situation. Right now, added debt of high magnitude will not help and the Australian Democrats who are canvassing a more money-debt situation cannot be taken seriously. I refer back to Mr Beggs again on that, and he does not believe that it will help either. That is why the Liberal-National Party decision was taken to limit the extra funding to $300m from the Government and a $200m balance of loan with any further needs to come from the sale of assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue that must be raised is the effect of government policies generally on the market. We have the best and most efficient woolgrowing sector in the world. Its productivity is fantastic and the quality of its produce is the best in the world. So why are woolgrowers not wealthy? Well, production costs are high; interest rates are crippling; inflation exceeds that among our trading partners; shipping and transport costs are totally out of control; the trumped up value of our Australian dollar makes our produce unaffordable in many countries; and fuel costs and so on for broad acre farmers is an enormous proportion of the total cost. Why can we not attack these handicaps and get them right?</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I quote the comments of three very well-known and respected Tasmanian woolgrowers reported in this week's Tasmanian Country. Bert Farquhar, a very well-known and substantial woolgrower in Tasmania, made the comment:</PARA>
<PARA>Now is the time to aggressively market wool and to establish new markets. </PARA>
<PARA>He is looking ahead. Then there is Andrew Cameron who said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not at all shocked because I could see the industry was getting too far into debt. If we continued to buy our own wool we would not have been facing reality.</PARA>
<PARA>Then Robert Gatenby said:</PARA>
<PARA>You can never go back to a floor price scheme again because your credibility has all gone. </PARA>
<PARA>The state of affairs is a national disaster and the realities have to be faced. We could not pursue a slaughter program; we could not go along with an insupportable floor price. We must recognise that all those who are involved at any level of the industry must share the responsibility. The Government relaxed its control, the Corporation lost touch with its responsibilities and its growers, and the growers believed that they were insulated permanently from market reality. We must get together and plan for the future-a future involving ways to increase the growing and use of wool for the benefit of Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I am greatly disturbed at the present state of the woolgrowing industry, but it is well within the wit of Parliament and the industry to finalise the 1990-91 underwriting, to arrange orderly disposal of the stockpile, to go out and promote wool as the universal and popular fibre, and to get the past behind us as quickly as we can. I support the Opposition amendments, but oppose the others. I hope that we can pass the legislation without delay so that we can get started. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are once again debating wool-the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill 1991. Unfortunately, that has been the tone in the industry for the past three years-every bit of legislation has been very temporary. At the outset of my remarks let me declare my interest in the wool industry as a woolgrower.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I start where I finished in a previous debate in this chamber on this subject, namely on 15 November 1990. We were then dealing with a Bill to increase the maximum tax rate to 30 per cent and allow for an extra 20 per cent surcharge, if necessary. I concluded that speech by saying that at that time I was prepared to believe Mr Beggs for the third and final time. Unfortunately, he let me down for a third and final time. I had believed him, and did so reluctantly, twice before. The first time was when the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) lifted the floor price from 670c to 870c per kilo on 1 July 1988; it had made the decision six weeks before. That was done against the better, cooler heads of the growers around Australia, traders, merchants and processors. </PARA>
<PARA> The second time was when the maximum wool tax was increased to 20 per cent, with the Corporation assuring us that the reserve price would remain viable. That was in May-June 1990; the decision was made six months previously, but it was implemented at that time. The third time, as I have said, was in November 1990. There has been one calamity after another. We increased it to the 30 per cent and 20 per cent levy. </PARA>
<PARA> On or about 1 December 1990 Mr Beggs and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) left on their famous journey around the world, telling wool-buying nations that the ironclad figure of 700c per kilo would remain for at least two years. Some countries actually believed Mr Beggs and Mr Kerin and there was a short sharp jump in clearances. I know that during January and the latter part of December clearances were up to 64 per cent, but that did not last long. A lot of people tell us that it did not last because of the Gulf war, but I do not believe that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation knew, as buyers knew all along, including myself, that the reserve price scheme had failed. In other words, buyers bought to fill up the pipeline to supply wool to mills for a certain time. Buyers knew it was finished and that the money ran out. I believe that certain people would or should have known that the money was running out before we were told. I liken it to the position in the State Bank of South Australia in that we should have known a lot more a lot earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I used to be a supporter of the scheme and I believed that it did a certain amount of good at that time, but step by step since 1973 or thereabouts when it came in it has been wrecked step by step. There are quite a few reasons why that has happened. First, the reserve price scheme has been too high and too inflexible. The reserve price did not allow for certain things to happen, such as production. Then there was a lack of market signals to growers, and the greed and arrogance of the industry. I am part of the industry, but I believe that there is too much greed and a certain arrogance in the industry. It believed that we were back in the 1950s when wool was a pound a pound. Australia in those days was the only one with the wool and buyers had to pay the price we wanted or go without it. </PARA>
<PARA> The incompetence of the Corporation has led to some of the downfall. Then there was the gullibility of the Minister in giving in to every whim of the industry. Every time the Corporation wanted to change something, whether to increase levies or whatever, the Minister gave in. The only time when he was strong was when he reduced the floor price from 870c to 700c, which he should have done a long time before. Then there was overproduction of wool that came about because of a high guaranteed price. If one wants overproduction, just guarantee a good high price and the product will flow through. I could give plenty of good examples, but I have not time to do so now. At present we have 5.6 million bales in store and a debt of $2.8 billion. That debt was on 1 January and does not allow for any buying by the Corporation in the January sales before they were cancelled. Unfortunately, now our only option is damage control. </PARA>
<PARA> The first step is that the Corporation and its Chairman, Mr Beggs, resign, as the only honourable thing they can do. I know they are not bound by the Westminster system but I think they should take note of it and resign. If they will not, I believe the Minister should make sure that they resign by invoking section 147 (1) (b) to remove them-just as Marcus Clark was removed in South Australia-and appointing an administrator under section 147 (2) (b). </PARA>
<PARA> Sections 147 (1) (b) and 147 (2) are very strong sections. In fact, the Wool Council of Australia-a representative body of the growers-has written to everyone in this chamber, asking us to eliminate that section. In other words, it wants to build self-preservation into the legislation so that it cannot be removed. That is a ridiculous situation. Even the Prime Minister and the Government of this country can be dismissed, as happened in 1975. Here is the letter, for everyone to see, asking us to eliminate this section so that directors cannot be removed by the Minister or anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> I will carry on a little further about the Australian Wool Council. I do not know whether everyone in this place reads the West Australian, but I suppose Western Australians read it. I have a cutting here from yesterday's paper which is headed, `Wool revenge vow'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Wool Council has vowed to campaign against the Liberals and Nationals in the next Federal election after the coalition refused to block crucial wool legislation yesterday.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Agreed, but I will read the rest of it. The Opposition will move amendments which we hope will be passed for the betterment of the industry. The article continues as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Wool Council president Chip Sawers said the council would spare no effort to see that woolgrowers and others who depended on the industry understood the Opposition's lack of support. </PARA>
<PARA> This will be the first time that the Wool Council of Australia has kept the industry informed. It represents only 64 per cent of Australian woolgrowers anyhow, because it is only that many who belong to grower organisations. This will be the first time that it has done anything about informing growers. I have compared it in this chamber before with the Australian Wheat Board. If I have a criticism of the Wheat Board it is that it overloads my table with information, but one gets nothing from this crowd except when it informs the woolgrowers of what we intend to do. </PARA>
<PARA> It carries on with another ridiculous argument in the articles as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Though the Opposition wants to amend the legislation to scrap the floor price scheme, freeze the stockpile and put a $200 million limit on industry-financed supplementary payments, this would delay . . . sales until mid-March. </PARA>
<PARA>The only thing it did not tell us is why it would delay sales. If there is money there, the sales can start on Monday even if they are limited to $200m from the industry and $300m from the Government. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good. It makes these ridiculous statements and does not back them up. So much for the AWC. If the Minister is not prepared to sack the Corporation, unless it goes voluntarily, I believe the Minister should resign himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I go further I must tell the Senate what everyone knows, which is that the wool system has been wrecked by incompetence, as I have already said. It is no use suspending the reserve price, it should be eliminated, and eliminated now. I am surprised that the Government is not working that way in the first place, because otherwise there will be another postponement and another debate later in this chamber. We will get one in May, anyhow, as these measures are temporary. If we could put it to rest now we would not have to go through it again. There is probably some hope that the reserve price scheme will return after July. Worse still, wool buyers around the world might think the same thing. If they do, there will be more insecurity in buying-they have been hit a few times already-and that will prevent us from getting back to the final reality of how to sell goods in the market, with market forces. The commencement of the recovery of one of Australia's greatest industries will be slow-a recovery which is at least five years away. </PARA>
<PARA> Now I come to the biggest hurdle that will prevent the market from getting back to full strength and not distort market forces, and that is the stockpile that my colleague Senator Archer so ably mentioned. The stockpile stands at 5.6 million bales and could rise further because, as I said, January's wool has been passed in and has not been accounted for. The provision of this Bill applying to the disposal of the stockpile appears under section 146 which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Corporation must sell . . . or otherwise dispose of its stocks of wool . . . in accordance with . . . guidelines</PARA>
<PARA>Where are the guidelines? I have not seen the final draft guidelines floating around but I think we are on the third interim edition already. The Opposition will be moving an amendment later on-and I will run through it now for the sake of this argument-to hold that stockpile in suspense, or isolate it, for 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people will say that that, once again, may distort the marketplace. I certainly do not believe in that theory because there is another 5.5 million bales in the pipeline for next year. We now have 40 per cent of the clip to sell this year, which means there is another 60 per cent of the clip still growing on the sheep's back, so there will be ample wool coming through to keep the wool markets supplied.</PARA>
<PARA> If we have at least 12 months isolation, countries such as those in Eastern Europe will be coming back into the market after throwing off communism. They will be buying wool, hopefully, within 18 months and they will be buying the supply that we have in the stockpile-23, 24 and 25 micron wool. That will be a good market. They will be followed by China which, hopefully, will be buying heavily; it needs this 23 to 25 micron wool for its climate and that will ease things for the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA> There are measures in the Bill which propose supplementary payments for those growers who are not protected after 1 February when the reserve price scheme was suspended. The Government has decided, as set out in this Bill, that it will put in $300 million for equity for those growers. However, under section 142 the Government has an open-ended financial situation for the industry. If we go into the markets next week with an open-ended situation and the Corporation has to borrow with no limit to operate, there will be rorts in the market. Buyers can bid very low, the Corporation will have to make it up and, having borrowed that money, will have to add it on to the $2.8 billion already borrowed. The estimates are only about $600m, but I believe the figure could reach another $1 billion to add on, so there will be $4 billion debt in total. A $4 billion debt is exactly twice the value of the gold produced in Australia, and it will not be paid off overnight. I believe the coalition is going the right way by moving an amendment to put on a cap of $200m, giving a total amount of $500m. </PARA>
<PARA> The question then is: how are we going to make sure there is equity for those who sell between now and 30 June? As I told my party room yesterday, I think the only way to do that is to start off with what we can do without. That is, by selling the assets of the Corporation. Its Melbourne headquarters would do for a start. There is $1 billion there in fixed assets that could be used. Those growers who may not get as much from the original top up could have the first call on it. That is how it can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> How are we to pay for that stockpile. If a woolgrower sells a clip at an average price of 200c per kilo greasy-I think that would be a fairly conservative figure; I certainly hope it is not be lower-I believe that the Australian wool clip next year will be worth $2 billion. A wool tax of 20 per cent will be required to pay the interest on the current debt. If the cap is accepted at no more than $3 billion, the interest bill will be $400m per annum. So 20 per cent of $2 billion is the figure needed to meet that tax. Therefore, a grower would be left with 160c a kilo or $320 per bale. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure honourable senators that all woolgrowers will not be profiting from selling wool at that price. They certainly will not be making money, even if they meet production costs. Returning to my previous argument, if we can isolate the stockpile for at least 12 months, or maybe longer, the production after next year will go down because farmers will cut down on sheep numbers through non-mating, selling off old sheep early, swinging over to cattle production or, if the wheat industry can be sorted out, growing wheat. In that way, hopefully the farmers will survive. I believe that the traditional growers will hold on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should be carrying the stockpile or certainly part of it. I suppose that we could ask why the Government should carry it. Mr Kerin gave an undertaking that the 700c per kilo was ironclad, so arrangements were made on that figure. Buyers purchased wool on that basis. If the Government is not prepared to isolate the stockpile and take over all of the assets, it should at least be providing assistance on part of it. I believe that every step taken by the Australian Wool Corporation was agreed to by Mr Kerin. The three steps that I mentioned before were each responsible for $1 billion of debt in that stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA> One section of the industry has been forgotten in this legislation: private buyers. In Australia, private buyers make up 20 per cent of the trade. In Western Australia they make up 30 per cent of the trade. There are 14 member companies of the private trading organisations in Australia but, unfortunately, this Government treats them as overseas companies. Private buyers deal directly with woolgrowers but foreign companies do not. There is no contact with them whatsoever. Private buyers were protected when their excess stock was put back onto the floor. When whole clips were bought to fill existing orders, any wool that might be left over would be returned to the floor and it would have protection. This protection has been taken from the buyers. Furthermore, when the wool sales were suspended on 1 February, private buyers had a substantial amount of wool already in the catalogue. Those stocks were to be protected; however, those sales were suspended and now there is no protection whatsoever in this legislation. I will be mentioning this in the committee stage-that the Government probably forgot about those private buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of changes in the legislation covering this industry during the past nine or 12 months, a small firm in Western Australia lost $200,000 in November and stands to lose $120,000 with the latest drop in the floor price. A larger firm, based in the eastern States, lost $2m when the floor price changed from 870c to 700c last November, and it stands to lose a swag on the present reduction. Those Australian companies have lost all protection. If those companies were protected up until then, they should also be protected until 30 June. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the wool industry will be in the wilderness for the next five years. The traditional growers-not necessarily the fringe growers who came into the industry, such as the speculators with 30 million sheep on the public stock-routes in New South Wales and those who changed over from cattle, who will leave the industry anyway-can survive. As I mentioned earlier, if the wheat industry can be improved, which can easily be achieved if we can convince the European Community and the United States to stop the stupid trade war, that will help this wool industry get through the difficult years to come. There are other ways by which the wool industry can be helped, including off-farm investment. But it will be a long, hard slog. </PARA>
<PARA> As a woolgrower, I am prepared to stay in the industry for five years without any return. I believe that some growers cannot remain in the industry and, unfortunately, they may go into liquidation. I feel for them. Unfortunately, that is the way things are going but it could have been prevented if the system had been managed a little better. I conclude by asking the Minister, Mr Kerin, to do something about the Corporation and its Chairman. It is no good leaving someone in that position to iron out a mess that that person and the Corporation made in the first place. This was done in the South Australia bank episode. The only credit that I give to the Premier of South Australia is for doing just that, if it was his action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a dreadful mess the Government has made of handling the wool marketing scheme. Mr Kerin has continued to blame the industry, the industry blames Mr Kerin and the Wool Council of Australia blames everyone. It is no use looking at who is blaming whom because we are all aware that the buck stops with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). I am not saying this lightly. I would like to go back over the history as to why the responsibility rests with the Minister. It starts in 1960 when the heads of a few growers' organisations were seeking a method of removing the very highs and lows in their income. The then Country Party sought to put forward an orderly marketing scheme for wool to overcome the problem. At that stage, Sir Robert Menzies, the then Prime Minister, insisted on a referendum for the growers as to whether there should be such a scheme. Of course, that was thoroughly defeated by the growers who were free marketeers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The suggestion raised its head again in 1970 when the Australian Wool Board put forward a proposal for a flexible reserve price. Legislation was passed in 1972 establishing a Wool Industry Act. This was put forward by the right honourable member for New England, Mr Sinclair. We must look at this legislation. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation shall, so far as it is able to do so consistently . . . perform its function under the last preceding section for the advantage of Australian woolgrowers and the Australian economy by means directed to encouraging and facilitating the purchase of Australian wool, and at the same time in securing, in respect of the purchase of Australian wool, prices that are not subject to undue fluctuation or irregularity and are at levels appropriate-</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat, levels appropriate-</PARA>
<PARA>to the competitive position of wool in world markets. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation shall, at fortnightly intervals, make reports to the Minister and the Treasurer concerning the operation of its reserve price scheme, and shall include in the report such information as the Minister directs concerning:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the reserve price determined by the Corporation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) wool purchased and wool held by the Corporation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) sales of wool by the Corporation and proposed offerings of wool by the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister shall, from time to time, after consultation with the Treasurer, inform the Corporation in writing of the policies and principles that the Government of the Commonwealth considers should be followed and applied by the Corporation in the operation of its reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Minister may, on behalf of the Government of the Commonwealth, if he thinks it necessary to do so, give a direction in writing to the Corporation with respect to the operation of the reserve price scheme . . . and the Corporation shall comply with that direction. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation states that the Australian Wool Corporation shall provide a fortnightly report to the Minister. It went ahead very successfully, and should have been maintained. But what did this Government do when it got in? I stress that the rot started with what the Government did in 1987. It rescinded that legislation and substituted legislation which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . before the commencement of each financial year, the Corporation shall:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) determine the prices that, having regard to past wool prices and all other matters that it considers relevant, ought to be the prices for certain types of wool for that year; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) publish a price, to be known as the minimum market indicator reserve price for that year, that is the weighted average of those prices. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) The Corporation shall not publish a price under paragraph (1) (b) unless the Wool Council has agreed . . .</PARA>
<PARA>All it had to do was make the Wool Council agree. If the Corporation or the Wool Council could not agree on a price, the Minister had the ability to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not a fortnightly report. It had its own power. It did not have to take regard of any competitive prices, world prices or anything else. It was indeed a full method of giving full control to the Corporation. The Minister now wonders why things have gone wrong. We have to make sure that the Australian people and the woolgrowers remember that the buck stops with the Government and the Minister, as he changed the legislation. The Government lost full control and the Corporation got out of control. It was no longer flexible and the levels were not appropriate to the competitive position of wool in the world markets. It was a yearly, rather than a fortnightly, decision as what the market could stand. The Minister bears considerable responsibility for this. I repeat that this is where the rot started. </PARA>
<PARA> I will bring us up to date. Until July this year the levy was 8 per cent on a floor price of 870c. It then rose to 18 per cent. Mr Kerin at last intervened in October and the levy went up to 25 per cent and the floor price was reduced to 700c. The Government guaranteed a $3 billion debt-loan, if you like-to be incurred by the Corporation. That did not work. In November we got new legislation. The Government then said not only that the levy would go from 25 per cent to 30 per cent but also that on top of that there would be a 20 per cent surcharge, that money would be paid to have 20 million sheep culled, and that the Corporation would introduce a 65 to 75 per cent quota scheme but it did not get round to stating the exact figures-with all the injustices of a quota system which I spoke about in my last speech. The Opposition absolutely opposed that 20 per cent surcharge. We said that the growers could not be charged 50 per cent of their cheque with a 700c floor price, which the Government proposed should be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course we also opposed the Corporation's quota scheme. At that time we sought a commercial slaughter. We said, `Pay the growers a reasonable amount and get rid of about 47 million sheep, otherwise this oversupply will go on year after year'. The Government would not accept that and instead it made a cast iron promise to retain the floor price at 700c. As we know, Mr Kerin went overseas promising that the floor price would be retained and that there would be no move at all in this regard. To begin with, the growers and the buyers believed him. I doubt whether the Corporation believed him because it knew it was broke. Nevertheless, the Minister went overseas perpetuating this myth that the floor price would not move. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation, whether it believed him or not, sent out a questionnaire to all growers to establish their right to a quota. The injustice of this was absolutely unbelievable. Growers spent week after week trying to establish their right to a quota. It was not easy. Some of them had withheld wool from the previous sales. They had to make out their right of appeal. I do not know the cost of that to the Corporation-it must have been fairly substantial-but the cost and time to the grower was immense. All this was done prior to any legislation on quotas being passed through this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> As Mr Kerin travelled overseas he knew that his promise was now unsustainable. He now says that the 700c floor price was never going to work unless the Chinese and the Russians came into the market and unless farmers started cutting back on production. Mr Kerin said, `I knew it was a big risk'. This is what he now says and he knew this when he travelled overseas making his cast iron promise that the floor price would remain. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth has finally been told to the growers and the buyers that the floor price cannot be sustained. Suddenly-and it was sudden, Mr Kerin's excuse being, `The Treasurer does not say when the dollar will be devalued, so how could I say we were going to drop the floor price'-all sales were cancelled and the floor price is proposed to be dropped. And we are now debating this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the result of that. Of course the Japanese are screaming for compensation. They say that our credibility has gone, that they will encourage people not to buy any of our agricultural produce and that we cannot be trusted. The European buyers have lost confidence in us and our growers have no idea what the Government is on about. They did not know how much in debt we were. They did not know their Corporation was bankrupt because the Minister and the Corporation did not tell them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the new legislation, which, as the Government says, is an attempt to allow the 35 per cent to 40 per cent of growers yet to sell their wool to receive 700c-as though the floor price were still in existence. First, the floor price is to be suspended until 30 June. It will then be reviewed in light of the Vines committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Wool Corporation presently has a debt of $2.8 billion. The Government's present guarantee to the Corporation borrowing is $3 billion. It now proposes to extend that to $3.5 billion in this present legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Government will give a grant of $300m to assist the Corporation to make deficit payments to growers who receive less than the previous floor price of 700c. Next, the Minister could appoint an administrator. Also, guidelines will be set up on how the Corporation will handle the stockpile. Finally, very extensive powers are to be given to the Minister. Those are the six main points of the legislation that we are debating today. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this may sound fine. But let us have a look at the points one at a time. Firstly, the Government suspended the floor price rather than abolishing it, as we claim should be done. The Minister has said that dropping the floor price was by far the hardest decision that he had ever taken. He also has said that one of his biggest mistakes was reducing the floor price to 700c rather than dropping it altogether. If he says that that was his biggest mistake, why does this legislation continue to perpetrate the myth that the floor price could be reintroduced after 30 June?</PARA>
<PARA> For goodness sake, let us be honest with the growers, even at this late stage. We must allow the buyers and the growers to have confidence. They knew as soon as the sales were cancelled that the floor price had gone. Does the Government really think that the Japanese, Italian and German buyers will come back if we continue to say that there should be a floor price? What about China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics? Will they ever start up again if we say that the floor price should be restarted? We will lose all credibility if we continue to say this sort of thing. They know that the floor price will not be reintroduced. So, let us be honest. </PARA>
<PARA> The present debt incurred by the Corporation on behalf of the growers already is between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion. We must now face the fact that this is the growers' debt-not the Government's debt. On the basis of that $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion debt, each woolgrower's debt is $55,000. Woolgrowers have been paying a 25 per cent levy just to meet the interest payments on that debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says to the Corporation, `Between now and 30 June you can incur a further debt of $700m'. That will bring the debt up to $3.5 billion and this will mean that each woolgrower will be $69,000 in debt. I do not know how the woolgrowers who will be left in the industry after this debacle will ever keep up with the $400m interest payment on the present debt of $2.8 billion let alone the additional interest payment of $200m on a debt of $3.5 billion. Farmers will have to pay $600m in interest on this debt of $3.5 billion. As growers leave the industry there will be fewer producers to pay the debt and, therefore, those who are left will have to pay more. </PARA>
<PARA> What levy will have to be imposed after June, when the floor price ceases to exist, to service that debt? Will it be 12, 14, 20 or 22 per cent? I do not know. It all depends where the price levels out and on how many growers will be left in the industry. How can the Government continue to allow the Corporation to go on incurring more and more debt on behalf of the growers-at least, those growers who are left in the industry next season? Because we feel so strongly that this debt must be stopped, we will be moving an amendment that the Corporation cannot incur more than an additional $200m, not the $700m that the Government has encouraged and which is totally irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will also be moving an amendment which points out the need to freeze the stockpile for 12 months. The amendment, in part, states:</PARA>
<PARA>(b) in any period after that described in paragraph (a), the Corporation shall only sell, charge or otherwise dispose of its stocks of wool or wool products in a publicised, orderly and predictable manner, as prescribed in a subsequent enactment.'.''.</PARA>
<PARA>I will leave my comments on the draft guidelines that the Minister has proposed until the committee stage. Time does not permit me to do so now. I would like to take a few minutes to comment on the extraordinary situation that all of this has been allowed to develop and continue without any sincere attempt by the Government to encourage a world-class spinning industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last eight years the Government has sat back and altered the wool marketing scheme legislation. Although our economy has been going down the drain, the Government has not made any sincere attempt to go out and seek the expertise that we need for downstream processing. The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority, which is a statutory body, offers assistance of $800,000 over two years to encourage downstream processing. So this is what the Government has done in regard to the textile, clothing and footwear industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also implemented a program under the heading `Incentives for international competitiveness-raw material processing program'. Under this program, the Australian Industry Development Corporation offers one-third equity in any wool or cotton project for downstream processing. That is a very generous offer. Two proposals have been looked at but, for various reasons, they have not been taken up. But the Government has not, in terms of immigration policy, sought to attract the skills that we need. We should be going out and seeking people with the skills that we need for fine wool processing. But the Government is not doing so. As a priority, the Government must go out and seek those skills and seek international investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia exports over 80 per cent of our clip. The remaining wool is processed at various levels, from the early stage of processing-that is, scouring of carbonised wool and tops-to the late stage processing of yarn and fabric. The need for our own downstream processing is unquestionable. Growers get just $28 out of a woollen suit which retails for $1,400-just 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Many say that we should stick to what we know best and what we have done historically. Japan would still be processing silk worm fibre if it were to follow such advice. Mr Thomas, the managing director of the largest processor of tops, throws cold water on any expansion into fabric manufacture because he claims that we are too far from overseas markets, that market countries apply tariffs on imported fabrics and that Australia's present economic environment is not conducive to competitive marketing. He says that we cannot extend our downstream processing because our economic situation is so dreadful. What an indictment of the Government!</PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 the Industry Development Commission commissioned a report from Werner International to examine the potential for adding more internal value to the Australian wool clip by increased domestic downstream processing and the subsequent export of these products. </PARA>
<PARA> The report was very enthusiastic in its recommendations. I would like to quote a few of them:</PARA>
<PARA> Our investigation has shown that a significant world-wide market exists for competitively priced good quality wool products, efficiently produced in Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In intermediate wool products the available markets exceed 65,000 tonnes. A small further market of 3,000 tonnes in garments is possible. The annual revenue from achieving these targets would be of the order of A$1,000 million</PARA>
<PARA> Analysis shows that tops at 46,000 tonnes, fine wool yarn 11,000 tonnes and fabric 8,000 tonnes are the most appropriate volume products. </PARA>
<PARA> Worsted products would comprise 10,000 tonnes of the yarn total and 6,000 tonnes of the fabric. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The industry has a nucleus of good people but suffers from a shortage of skills at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government should have been bringing in those skills. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Although faced with very real problems of restrictive work practices, R.S.I.-</PARA>
<PARA>and I add, `kangaroo paw' because no other country has it-</PARA>
<PARA>and the other labour difficulties facing the industry, management is not in despair of its ability to overcome them. </PARA>
<PARA>The international company which prepared the report for this Government says that we have real problems with restrictive work practices. What an indictment of this Government. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) tells us that we must become the clever country. For his credibility's sake he has to allow industry to become clever; he has to go down the path of our industrial relations policy; he must fix our waterfronts; he must fix those restrictive trade practices; he has to fix up the unions and, if he does not, then all blame will be laid at his feet for the condition that competitiveness and our wool industry is presently in. </PARA>
<PARA> No wonder the Industry Commission has had only two expressions of interest and both fell through. This was, firstly, because of the present economic standards in this country. International investors are saying that they cannot cope with our present situation; they cannot cope with the union movement and its work practices; they cannot cope with the fact that they cannot get their goods sent internationally at competitive prices as occurs in other countries whose wharves work in an efficient and competitive manner. We note that the woolgrowers problems are not just because of the industry but because of this Government's handling of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people have come to me-I know that they have also gone to the Australian Labor Party-and said, `I had planned my expansion with ultimate conservativeness and detail but I could not cope and never foresaw the fact that the Government would deliberately, to cause a recession, double the rate of interest rates, and that is the thing that killed me. I could have coped with the doubling of interest rates for a couple of weeks, but I could not cope with it for years'. If Mr Hawke, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and Mr Kerin cannot cope and fix this situation, then they should get out now and let someone cope who can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is nothing short of a national tragedy that we are debating special legislation aimed at rescuing Australia's wool industry for the third time in less than nine months. Let there be no mistake, it is a tragedy for our farmers, a tragedy for the wool industry, and indeed a tragedy for the whole of Australia. Although technically this legislation only suspends the operations of the reserve price scheme for wool, in reality it represents the funeral service for a scheme which, until recently, has served the industry very well, but which is now buried under a mountain of wool having been killed by two groups of politicians: those in this Hawke Labor Government and those agri-politicians in positions of leadership in the Wool Council of Australia and the Australian Wool Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a farmer's son who continues to have a proprietal interest in farming and as one who has strongly supported the reserve price scheme since its inception, I find great sadness in having to pronounce the scheme dead. But the sad reality is that the mismanagement of the scheme has been so bad in recent years that any hope of its resurrection is entirely forlorn. That is why the Liberal and National parties have moved an amendment to terminate rather than to suspend the scheme. Unlike the Government, the Wool Council and the Wool Corporation, we are prepared to tell growers the truth and to face reality. It is not in their interests to be left in false hope for the future, as the Government and industry leaders have left them in the past, which may cause them to make more wrong decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly the downturn in the international textile industry reduced the demand for all fibres in recent years, including wool. Undoubtedly the political and economic changes in Russia, China, and eastern Europe had a significant and detrimental impact. But, equally undoubtedly, it was the decisions taken by this Government and the industry's leaders over the past three to four years which have, in large measure, prevented wool maintaining its market share among fibres; which have encouraged overproduction; and which have resulted in a mountainous stockpile of wool, now approaching some five million bales, leaving a massive burden of a $2.9 billion debt as a millstone around the collective necks of woolgrowers, in addition to any individual debt which they may have which is escalating in this rural recession. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the fault of average woolgrowers that this crisis has emerged-except in the extent to which they trusted this Government and trusted industry leaders. Growers were treated like mushrooms by their leaders, as indeed were the Opposition, and kept completely in the dark as to the extent of the crisis developing in the industry. Relevant facts and figures were not given to growers to enable rational decisions to be made. Furthermore, the mismanagement of the reserve price scheme in recent years muted the market signals which growers should have been receiving about supply and demand. It is therefore understandable that they are now confused and angry. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor does this responsibility for the disaster lie with the Opposition, with the Liberal and National parties. Indeed, the Opposition has behaved with utmost responsibility in seeking solutions which are in the long term interests of the industry ever since its problems began to emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> Need I remind the Senate that as long ago as August 1989 I drew the attention of the Government to the developing problems in the wool market as evidenced by the massive increases in wool purchases by the Wool Corporation during the previous three months. Minister Button at the time ignored the warning, treating my question in cavalier fashion and confidently asserting that a sellers market would soon reemerge-some sellers market that we have seen re-emerge! So much for this Government's professions of concern now-some 18 months later-about the disastrous situation for woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, the Opposition has sought to make decisions on a rational and informed basis. As the problems emerged 12 months ago, we found this difficult because it was difficult to extract much information from either the Wool Council or the Wool Corporation. Information that was forthcoming sometimes changed. Figures forwarded to us by the Corporation during that period were unconvincing in many respects and raised many questions. Time and subsequent events have proved our scepticism to be well founded. Therefore, on the basis of its recent performance, it ill becomes the Wool Council to criticise the Opposition, as it has during the last 24 to 36 hours, for our responsible attitude to the legislation now being debated. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the Wool Council's inadequate performance in looking after the interests of woolgrowers in recent years, attempts to deflect criticism by striking out at the Opposition are perhaps understandable; but its attitude is irrational and unacceptable. The threat of the Council to campaign against the coalition will not deter us from our responsible approach and our determination to act in the interests of woolgrowers by, in particular, preventing the accumulation of a debt which could bankrupt them all. It is high time the Council did likewise instead of seeking to shore up its position in agro-politics in the light of its past mistakes. There can be no doubt that the Wool Council shares a major part of the responsibility for the demise of the reserve price scheme by advocating, several years ago, a major change in its function from a safety net provision to a price setting mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> As I will detail in a few moments, the New South Wales Farmers Federation perhaps bears even more responsibility for the decisions of several years ago which have destroyed the scheme. The attitude it is now expressing towards the coalition is laughable when placed in that context. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool has long been a mainstay of Australia's export industries. There have always been ups and downs experienced in supply and demand and, consequently, in prices and profits in the industry. When the reserve price scheme for wool was first introduced in 1972, its purpose was to even out these ups and downs. Price stability and predictability were beneficial to both growers and users in an industry of cyclical production and fluctuating markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly, the reserve price was set at a conservative rate in relation to the market price for wool. The scheme was not introduced to encourage growers to produce wool excess to demand or to compensate them for their costs or for them to derive more income if that could not be justified by market demand. Its simple purpose was to even out the peaks and troughs. It should be pointed out that this was at a time of fixed and predictable exchange rates, stable markets and growing consumer demand. So the system worked well for almost 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> But in 1987 the demand for wool began to outstrip supply and prices began to rise dramatically. By the end of June 1988 the market price had soared to more than 1100c per kilogram. New South Wales growers, in particular, and quite acceptably, massively increased wool production over the three year period from 1987 by more than 40 per cent to meet this demand. It was inevitable that when supply and demand became better balanced, prices would fall to a more moderate level. Indeed, if this was not to occur, then it was equally inevitable that demand would fall because synthetics would replace wool if the price ratio of wool to synthetics remained for long at an unsustainable 5 : 1 or 6 : 1 compared with the long term average of 3 : 1. Therefore, what was not acceptable was for New South Wales wool industry leaders, through the then New South Wales Farmers Association, now the New South Wales Farmers Federation, to vocally advocate substantial rises in the reserve price and, more importantly, to succeed in that advocacy against the warnings of wiser heads, including from my own State of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more culpable, with its Australia-wide responsibility to growers, was the Wool Council for acquiescing in these demands. A reserve price as high as 900c per kilogram was demanded. In calling for such a high floor price, which was based on the sales results of a mere 35 per cent of a single year's wool clip-about 2 per cent of sales for the previous 15 years-the opportunists were, wittingly or unwittingly, changing the nature of the reserve price scheme from being a safety net for growers to being a price setter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very good analysis.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the agreement of Senator Tate to those comments. These people also ignored the warnings expressed by some economists, agricultural journalists and even the then Chairman and Director of the Australian Wool Corporation, Mr David Asimus, and Mr David Moore, respectively, of the detrimental long term consequences of such a move. Mr Moore and Mr Asimus both favoured a more conservative approach to the floor price. They feared that a sustained high price for wool would drive users away from wool and into other-cheaper-fibres. Compounding this was the problem of the floating exchange rate and the upward movement of the Australian dollar, which had the effect of increasing the real price for wool to overseas buyers, thus frightening them off even more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Countries such as the Soviet Union and China, especially, would soon find such high prices unaffordable in the circumstances of major changes in their own economies. This is exactly what happened. The major problem foreseen was that with production already growing at 3 to 4 per cent a year by then it was likely to increase more with high guaranteed prices as distinct from high market prices, attracting other players into the game. This would eventually result in supply outstripping demand, making it impossible to maintain high market prices. One prominent rural writer, Julian Cribb, wrote the following in the Australian on 28 May 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>Six weeks ago the New South Wales Farmers' Association handed the wool industry a loaded gun. The next month will reveal whether the industry uses it to blow its own brains out. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what happened. By acquiescing to the ill-informed New South Wales demands and setting the floor price for the 1988-89 selling season at 870c a kilogram, the Australian Wool Council and the Wool Corporation of Australia ensured, as Mr Cribb and others predicted, the destruction of the wool marketing scheme, a blow-out in the national debt and the ruination of thousands of woolgrowers. This decision represented a massive 70 per cent increase in the floor price in just two years and introduced a fundamental change to the nature of the scheme from a bad times insurance policy to an attempt to rig the market. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry not only blew its brains out-it nearly buried itself. Had a more moderate reserve been maintained, we would not be presiding over its demise now. Growers would still have received higher prices while demand exceeded supply. But in the absence of a continuing guarantee of high prices through an excessively high reserve, fewer new entrants would have been attracted to the industry and the situation would not have seesawed to supply exceeding demand so dramatically. It would have been much riskier for new entrants to rely on the continuation of high market prices. Hence a better balance would have been maintained between supply and demand with consequently better price stability. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me reinforce that it is not the wool industry leaders alone who bear the responsibility for the present chaos. That responsibility lies even more heavily with this Hawke-Labor Government which created the circumstances for the chaos to develop, including significant changes in 1987 to the legislation governing the scheme. Indeed, it is only since those amendments, introduced by Minister Kerin, have operated that the previously healthy scheme has gone awry. The Minister changed the requirement for consultation with Treasury, removed ministerial control over the setting of the floor price and, most importantly, removed the requirement that the comparability of wool price with that of other fibres be taken as a criterion in determining the floor price. It was these changes by Minister Kerin that paved the way for the floor price to be set at an unsustainably high level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's failure to reintroduce income equalisation deposits for a year after their reintroduction was announced encouraged some woolgrowers to initially hold their wool off the market, thereby reducing supplies in a period of high demand and contributing to the rapid rise in wool prices. When the income equalisation deposits came into operation, those growers put that wool on the market in addition to the subsequent clip, increasing supply at a time when some wool users had moved to other fibres as a result of the earlier shortage and high prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's high interest rates have detrimentally affected the production costs of woolgrowers and also kept the Australian dollar at an unjustifiably high level; hence the price of our wool has been too high in foreign currency terms. High interest rates have also dramatically increased the cost to the Wool Corporation and therefore to growers of holding the wool stockpile. The statements of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) early last year encouraged speculation about the reserve price at a time when buyers were returning to the market and hence encouraged them to sit out and wait to see what happened. Let there be no doubt that this Government has contributed significantly to the current crisis. The Government also broke its promise, made in 1987, concerning wool promotion funding when it cut its funding from the promised 1.2 per cent of the gross value of production to a flat $25m per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the litany of justifiable criticism which can be levelled at the Government, one searches in vain in the Minister's second reading speech on this legislation for any acknowledgment of his responsibility for the current situation. Yet the Minister further contributed to the climate of uncertainty by lowering the floor price to 700c, travelling the world declaring that inviolate and then suspending the reserve price until 30 June. This dithering by this incompetent Minister must cease. He should have the guts to acknowledge that the Opposition has shown true leadership by coming to grips with the problems of the industry and accept the amendments we are proposing to this legislation. The present uncertainty will continue until the end of June without any improvement in confidence if this legislation passes in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is responsible for the discrediting of the reserve price scheme. With a wool stockpile of some 4.8 million bales in the hands of the Wool Corporation and with an enormous debt of $2.9m, it simply cannot be resurrected, even in modified form. Growers will have a continuing interest burden of $400m a year from that debt alone. In the light of that and the extra borrowings that would be required to maintain the floor price, albeit at a lower level, a wool tax levy of 50 per cent would by no means be out of the question. There would also be the imposition of quotas, as previously foreshadowed, to manage supply. I am in no doubt that before too long, if not immediately on the resumption of sales, the net return to growers from market prices will be better than achievable from a quota-managed, levy-funded reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> A high levy and wool quotas would be especially unfair to South Australian woolgrowers, who have not contributed to the oversupply situation. The growth in the sheep flock and the subsequent growth in production, which has detrimentally affected the balance between supply and demand, occurred most noticeably in New South Wales and Queensland. In the 10 years from 1980-81 to 1989-90, the increase in wool production in the whole of Australia was 56.75 per cent. However, in Queensland the increase for the same period was a massive 88.82 per cent and in New South Wales it was 80.51 per cent. In Victoria it was 52 per cent; in Western Australia, 41.46 per cent; in Tasmania, 32.34 per cent; while at the bottom comes South Australia, with only a 26.07 per cent increase in production over that 10-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence South Australian growers' levies have been used to fund the purchase of wool by the Wool Corporation at the reserve price of the excess in supply created by New South Wales and Queensland woolgrowers. They were the growers who, as I mentioned earlier, were the most vocal-particularly in the case of New South Wales-and therefore most responsible for the initiation of the unsustainably high reserve price. Furthermore, because South Australian growers have only marginally increased production compared with earlier years, determining quotas on the basis of 1989-90 production, as was intended had the reserve price scheme continued and quotas been introduced, would have been grossly unfair to South Australian producers. Compared with New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, where production last year, as those percentages show, was well above earlier years, South Australians would have been treated unfairly. So long as the possibility of any attempt to revive the floor price scheme remains, the probability of continuing high levies and the associated unfairness to South Australia will remain. </PARA>
<PARA> That is another strong reason for supporting the Opposition amendment, which confirms the end rather than merely the suspension of the floor price scheme. The Opposition strongly supports the concept of a supplementary payments scheme as initiated by this legislation to provide some fairness to growers who have not yet sold their wool this season and so between now and the end of June will face the open market without the shield of a reserve price. However, an open-ended scheme funded mainly from the growers' levy is not on. Firstly, growers must have an incentive to put their own reserve on their wool, and buyers some incentive not to drive the market down, because both can act safe in the knowledge that deficiency payments will make up the difference to the former reserve price. Secondly, and as a consequence of this, growers cannot fund through their levies unlimited borrowings to meet the deficiency payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The additional interest on a further $500m to $700m in borrowings is not the only consideration. There is also the future requirement to fund that debt from the existing wool stockpile and other assets of the Corporation. That is, the additional borrowings which may be required to fund an open-ended supplementary payments scheme will not create additional assets which can later be liquidated to repay the debt in the way it is hoped the sale of the existing stockpile of wool and other assets will eventually allow repayment of the current $2.9m debt. </PARA>
<PARA> A possible call on growers to provide between them a further $500m to $700m in capital to repay this additional debt cannot be countenanced. Many growers simply do not have the financial resources to do this in the foreseeable future, if ever. The requirement to do so would bankrupt them. That is why we seek to amend this Bill to limit to $200m the amount for which growers will be liable to contribute to deficiency payments. We support the provision of $300m from Government funds to make these payments. After all, this Government has ripped at least that much from the pockets of the woolgrowing taxpayers by abandoning and then delaying the re-introduction of income equalisation deposits. However, beyond that funding, the Corporation must raise funds for deficiency payments by reducing its operating costs to free up funds or by selling some of its assets. Apart from protecting growers from debt, this will also put the Corporation's operations under some financial discipline. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important element to be considered in relation to restoring confidence in the industry is the management of the wool stockpile. With a huge stockpile of nearly five million bales of wool sitting in the warehouse, there is obviously nervousness and uncertainty among buyers about its effect on prices should it suddenly be released. The stockpile must be reduced to ease the woolgrowers' massive debt but it must be sold off in an orderly way so it does not adversely affect prices on the open market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Walters for her agreement. To ensure that there is an orderly sale of the wool stockpile, there should be a freeze on it for 12 months, with the exception of limited sales for certain contractual purposes and special categories, to give the industry time to settle down and restore confidence in the market. There should be further legislation after 12 months to ensure well-regulated and well-publicised releases of the stocks. Because correct management is so important, our amendment requires that it be controlled by legislation rather than by regulation for a period of 12 months commencing from the beginning of the sales next week. We believe that the guidelines for management of the stockpile should be set now, well before the sales start, rather than waiting for the Minister to issue them in his own time; nor should they be subject to change by the Minister whenever he feels like it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our final amendment seeks to amend the powers of the Minister in relation to this legislation. In this legislation-which the Minister himself has admitted was hastily drafted-the Minister already has regulatory power in proposed new section 148, which is standard for this type of legislation, but he seeks additional power to amend `any provisions of this Act other than this part'. This gives the Minister the power to overrule any part of the legislation, and indeed makes a mockery of the whole Bill. If the Minister wants the power to impose penalties on those who abuse the scheme, as he has claimed, the legislation should spell that out quite clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendments will vastly improve what is, in its present form, grossly inadequate legislation for offering solutions to the wool industry's present difficulties. However, more is required to restore the balance between supply and demand. As long as the national sheep flock remains at its present high level, supply will exceed demand for the foreseeable future and this will continue to depress prices. Average market demand for our wool through the 1980s was of the order of 700 kilotonnes, and that was with Russia and China in the market as significant buyers. But current production exceeds 1,000 kilo- tonnes. Abolition of the reserve price alone will not sufficiently quickly get rid of this imbalance. That is why I have been, and continue to be, a strong advocate for a commercially based flock reduction scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all the factors contributing to the demise of the reserve price scheme, if an effective flock reduction scheme had been established when I first urged it last year, the scheme may have survived. We needed to get rid of 30 to 40 million sheep at that time. The Government and the Wool Corporation both ignored this requirement. But, belatedly, the Corporation introduced a very limited scheme offering $1.80 for old sheep, and $6-and then later $5-for young sheep. As inadequate as that scheme was, it has already resulted in the slaughter of some 8 1/2 million sheep and it is expected that about 10 million will eventually disappear at an average cost of $3.70 per head. </PARA>
<PARA> If that half-baked scheme has achieved such success, I am confident that a commercially realistic scheme offering growers $8 to $10 a head would succeed in reducing the flock by another 20 to 30 million sheep. But instead of urging this necessity on the Wool Corporation, this ill-informed Government is initiating a scaling down of the existing scheme, according to the Minister's second reading speech. The Government should be seriously considering the provision of additional funds to the industry for a commercial slaughter scheme rather than initiating a scaling down of the current scheme funded by woolgrowers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The advantage of funding a slaughter scheme is that, to the extent it works, it will have a major impact on reducing supply. To the extent that it does not attract sheep for slaughter, it does not cost anything anyway. The Government must take this initiative if it is fair dinkum about assisting the industry to solve its problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Initiatives are also required to increase the demand for wool. It is not enough to sit and wait for the market to improve simply as a result of a price which is market determined. More active marketing and promotion are required. It is the Liberal and National parties which again have taken the lead in this regard. Both coalition parties sent separate delegations to China last year and I was part of the Liberal delegation there in November. That delegation covered a range of issues but, in particular, we concentrated upon ways of encouraging the Chinese back into the wool market. </PARA>
<PARA> We were ridiculed by the Government for going to China but when we got there we had the opportunity to speak with Ministers, officials, Chinese technicians, representatives of Chinese woollen mills and the like. These were initiatives which we took well in advance of the Government but they were ridiculed by the Government. However, ultimately the Government realised that it would have to follow suit. The Opposition did a great deal to try to encourage the Chinese and the Soviets to return to the market. </PARA>
<PARA> In May of last year, the Opposition called for changes to the insurance scheme for wool exporters to the Soviet Union and again, at that time, the Government ridiculed that call. Later, the Opposition proposed a range of credit arrangements and counter-trade arrangements, which we believed would help redevelop demand for Australian wool in the Soviet Union. The Government finally adopted policies similar to those which the Opposition had previously been advocating. If only the Government had acted earlier and in time, it would have done something to stimulate the demand for wool in the Soviet Union and again perhaps prevented the demise of this scheme. The Government stands condemned for sitting on its hands and doing so little when the Opposition has been calling for so much to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, to assist growers through these extremely difficult times, there must be increased funding for rural adjustment and rural counselling. The Government must also get on, as Senator Walters said earlier, with all the reforms to our economic structure in which it has thus far failed so dismally. Need I again mention the labour market, the waterfront, transport, tariffs and fiscal policy. We will await with interest the Government's much heralded industry statement in a couple of weeks time. There can be no doubt about the coalition's commitment. We have taken the lead on these general issues, as we have indeed on the wool industry's specific problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Bill 1991. In June last year when legislation to alter the wool tax was before the Senate, I stated that what the industry needed was certainty. With the disastrous collapse of the reserve price that this Bill, in effect, has to bury, the need for certainty and confidence is more vital than ever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition is firmly of the view that change is inevitable and that this Parliament has a responsibility to play its role in assisting a vital and efficient rural industry to survive the difficult transition to the free market sale of wool. More and more growers, whatever their past support for the reserve price, now realise that the scheme ceased to have a future when this year wool sales were suspended for three weeks. I strongly support them in the view that the sooner we start selling wool in the free market and discover just what price Australian wool commands, the sooner we will start back on the road to success. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential, therefore, that we remove any degree of ambiguity about the longer term fate of the reserve price by supporting the coalition's amendment to actually terminate it. Confidence in the reserve price has been shattered and the last thing that growers now need is any uncertainty or false hope that it can be revived. It is a shame that there have been a few growers who simply do not seem to be able to agree among themselves about the best option. These growers have not been able to agree with the Wool Council of Australia; the Wool Council has not been able to agree with them; and the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) has not been able to agree with either. In general, many of those things have interfered with achieving a more timely solution. </PARA>
<PARA> While I support a free market solution on the grounds of both necessity and long term viability, this Government cannot expect growers to make this transition unaided. A $300m contribution to deficiency payments until July does not begin to solve the problem of the wool stockpile. It is the view of a great many woolgrowers in my State of Western Australia that the stockpile must be quarantined for 12 months and then sold in an orderly manner. Again, this is the policy of the coalition and we do agree with the position of the growers. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be emphasised that while this Government has taken the only possible course of action in abandoning the reserve price and getting sales under way, it has not gone anywhere near solving the debt problem that continues to burden growers and threaten recovery. It is a great shame that Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) did not take a greater initiative much earlier and has allowed the woolgrowers to live a life of uncertainty for far too long. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation where the debt per bale reached $500 and where the wool tax will remain at 25 per cent for the remainder of the season. We cannot expect growers to remain viable when they are receiving a far lower, if accurate, price and paying a high level of wool tax. At the very least, if the Government is not prepared to take over the debt and the stockpile, there needs to be an assurance that the debt will not grow even larger. This, however, is exactly the prospect that faces growers when the cost of the deficiency payments for the remainder of the 1990-91 season is estimated at $800m, of which only $300m will be supplied by the Government. That means, of course, a further debt of $500m. The end result will be to drive growers out of business and it will rebound on general taxpayers in meeting the consequences of a collapsing wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition aims to arrest this prospect of as much as a further $1 billion in Australian Wool Corporation debt by limiting additional borrowings to $200 billion. This discipline, I believe, is essential to alleviate the threat of continuing, uncontrolled levels of the wool tax. There is no value today in indulging in long recriminations against the AWC. However, it must be stated that growers tell me that they do not wish to continue with this present management in its current form. Growers, in the long term, will support an organisation with responsibility for research and promotion, but see no future for the AWC as a marketing organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleagues Senator Walters and Senator Chapman have already stated quite clearly here today, if there is one thing that the industry needs, it is greater marketing and promotion. The number of people who are buying wool and buying woollen products is declining constantly and we have to turn that around. The AWC has done absolutely nothing about doing so. If, by attacking the coalition, the AWC thinks that it has had in the past and will get in the future a better deal out of the Labor Government, I suggest that it should look at history and think again, because this Government has sought the demise of the whole rural sector. Not just woolgrowers, but the whole farming sector has been on a downward slide for years now, and this is but part of that slide. If the AWC is going to run campaigns against us because we are not going to acquiesce in what it wants-and we are doing what the growers want-I suggest that it think again. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition makes absolutely no apology for a consistent opposition to quotas since they were first put forward in November. This proposal has been crucial in damaging the credibility of the AWC, of the reserve price scheme and of the Minister in entertaining the idea until reality imposed its own solution. Our only consideration in the coalition is: what is going to be best for the woolgrowers and what is going to be best for the marketplace? That is the bottom line-the be-all and end-all. The sooner the AWC understands that, the better off we will all be. Quotas posed an administrative nightmare and considerable problems of equity, particularly since Western Australian growers were not generally responsible for massive production increases that would have formed the basis for quota allocation. </PARA>
<PARA> The combination of a 60 per cent quota and a 40 per cent wool tax necessary to sustain the reserve price was a simple recipe for disaster. We would have done everything possible to prevent the passing of quota legislation, and I am glad to think that this intention has assisted in preventing its introduction.</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the course of debate on the future of the wool industry it is too easily forgotten that wool has only 5 per cent of the world fibre market. Australia must make the world want to buy and use our wool before we can demand the price we might like. It is all very well to have pipedreams and to think that this price would be wonderful or that price would be even better but, if we cannot achieve either, there is no point in crystal ball gazing and having those pipedreams. We have to achieve what is possible. The art of the impossible is just not a consideration. There is no law of necessity that will compel buyers to return if we withhold supply. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important signal that we can give the outside world is that we want to sell wool. It was not the least of the faults of the quota scheme that it would have deprived us of the signals of the marketplace, apart from creating on-farm secondary stockpiles. Australia survived a free market in wool for many decades before the reserve price was introduced. We cannot blame growers for overproduction when we insulate them from the ultimate knowledge of the world market price. As has already been stated today, the whole situation seems to have been kept under wraps for too long. There was not enough discussion about it early enough in the piece. There were no decisions made that could have turned this situation around before it got out of hand, and the blanket-pardon the pun-that has been thrown over a lot of the detail is something that the AWC, again, has much to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither is it the fault of woolgrowers that the AWC fatally compromised the reserve price by raising it to levels that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics warned were unsustainable based on demand patterns. I strongly endorse the comments made in November by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, that the AWC chose to ignore the accurate information that was available to it. That is all the more reason why today the least impediment should be placed on market signals. Now that the reserve price scheme has failed, we need to look forward to an era in which there is no central wool stockholder, for that not only encouraged overproduction against market signals, but has, through earlier stockpiles, dampened returning demand, preventing growers from getting the appropriate signals that production can be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in order for an honest market to operate in the best interests of growers and the national economy, there is a need for a far greater commitment to action than this Government has yet shown. The existing stockpile must be quarantined and then sold as soon as possible in an orderly manner-never to return. I repeat: the stockpile cannot be dismissed as a problem for the AWC or for the wool industry. This Parliament put in place the legislation that made it possible and, quite frankly, we cannot ignore the consequences. Ultimately, the only levies that woolgrowers should pay must involve wool promotion and not its withdrawal from the market at subsidised prices. Woolgrowers cannot afford to be paying out money and getting nothing in return. It is the task of the Government to move towards this situation as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> While we must avoid creating dependency cycles in rural industries that have proved their efficiency in the international marketplace, government must be prepared to play a necessary role in assisting the wool industry in its transition. We cannot afford to downplay the extent of the crisis that threatens our entire rural economy at the moment. This is very much an integral part of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Our world economy depends on a viable wool market, and let us not forget it. I state this with particular feeling, since by last November farm product prices in Western Australia had fallen by 18 per cent in 12 months, above the national average drop of 13 per cent. Prices for sheep led the fall with a 60 per cent drop. The only figures that we have to date are still the September quarter figures. They show a 7.5 per cent fall in the value of farm production and an 80 per cent fall in income from unincorporated farm enterprises-in other words, the family farm. The rise in the wool tax from 18 per cent to 25 per cent did not occur until October and does not register in the September quarter figures. One can only guess what the December quarter figures will be like. They will be absolutely horrendous. </PARA>
<PARA> We are looking at a decline in average woolgrower farm cash operating surpluses from $52,300 in 1989-90 to $9,500 in 1990-91, and a projected negative income of $3,700 in 1991-92. Sharp cycles have occurred before in rural industries, and it is inevitable that some producers will leave the industry. In the broader perspective, this country simply cannot afford those types of reductions. We have a country in a recession-if not a depression-at the moment and here we have yet another industry going to the wall. Unfortunately, in this industry it takes not only a person but the entire family history with it. We must be mindful that it affects not just the people on the land, sad as that is; it affects so many other people in a broader context. The figures that I have quoted and other indications point to something far worse than a shake-out. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians expect sensible action by this Parliament to ensure that we continue to have a wool industry, and not another huge addition to the social security bill. They expect a solution that will lead to reliance on the basic laws of supply and demand. This is what the coalition advocates in the necessary passage of this Bill and in the amendments and further action that we propose. We have not taken the decisions lightly with our amendments and we consider that they are in the best interest of the industry generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last few weeks we have seen suspension of the wool sales and of the reserve price scheme. These have been major shocks and areas of concern to the woolgrowers across Australia. In listening to contributions made by members of all parties, I find that there is much with which I can agree. However, I cannot agree with the Liberal Party's amendments and part of the National Party's amendments and final conclusions. They are offering a panacea, immediate abolition of the reserve price, but they have not followed that through to tell us what it means in real terms. Senator Knowles just alluded to it when she said that it would remove the marketing powers of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). But the big question that has to be answered is: who will be responsible for the stockpile and for future wool that will be sold when sales resume shortly? The Opposition has not answered that question and it is consequential upon the Opposition's amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Opposition members wish to remove the marketing powers, they are not saying who will be responsible for marketing, or what will happen to the staff in the AWC who are responsible for marketing. They presume that the Government will take over the debt. That is something that even Opposition members with their hard-nosed, dry market policies would not agree to take over. They want total government management of the stockpile. They allege that this Government has not outlined what will happen with the stockpile, and on that point I vehemently disagree with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has outlined what will be happening with the stockpile. The AWC has announced, with the concurrence of the Minister, that stockpile management rules will apply for the rest of the year. All sales from the stockpile in Australia will cease on 25 February. Sales from the stockpile in Europe can continue until 25 March in small quantities for inventory adjustment purposes, but at no less than 700c floor price. The only exception for contracts entered into by the AWC before 25 February is for wool to meet the technical requirements of International Wool Secretariat developmental projects. Opposition members have failed to say what they would do if the stockpile is frozen. What will they do if there is market need for a very specialist line of fleece or tops and it happens to be in the stockpile? Opposition members are saying that they would not allow that to be disposed of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition would abolish the reserve floor price immediately. Most farmers to whom I speak are opposed to abolition of the floor price, but they recognise that the supply and demand position is such that something has to be done. Traditional wool farmers I have spoken to have been critical of many people, and in particular of the Australian Wool Council. Last night I spoke with a farmer who retired about six years ago, and he said that when he left his property the price to the wool producer was about 400c a kilo. My understanding of the wool reserve price was that it was a safety net. That safety net has been removed and it became a price setter, as Senator Chapman outlined earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition amendments are designed to end the reserve price. It is interesting to note that there is some disagreement amongst the members of the National Party. The `old-style' members of the National Party, as I would call them, are the people who were supportive of the National Party's efforts in 1969 and 1970 when it fought the Liberal Party to try to get some stability into the wool industry. Honourable senators come in here and talk about how wonderful things were prior to the introduction of the wool reserve price. That is a load of rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1969, 1970 and 1971, the farmers of this country were going through problems of having absolutely no market, or no price, through a variety of causes. In 1971, we saw headlines threatening that, if the wool reserve price was not 40c a kilo, the Country Party, as it was then called, would break the coalition. What do those people have to say today? Even after the Liberals in the coalition agreed to the reserve price in 1971, a significant number of Ministers were still opposed to the reserve price and still wanted market forces to remain. In those days, I might add, the Liberal Party thought it was fine for woolgrowers to receive 36c a kilo for their wool. Fortunately, it is slightly higher than that now. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1970, the disagreements between the Liberal and National parties were referred to as `the fighting season'. It strikes me that the disagreements are still out there. Those who would support the National Party are still disagreeing most vehemently with what the Liberal Party is foisting upon the National Party. The Liberals criticised the wool selling plan; there is nothing new in that. They deferred it for two to three years. It is not a new issue for the coalition to discuss the wool reserve price and support for that market. </PARA>

It has told us that it will suspend and freeze things, but it has not told us what its proposals would in fact do. To those who have been criticised by the Australian Wool Council and the New South Wales Farmers Federation, I say: welcome to the club. That is nothing new to the Australian Labor Party: we have argued with and tried to talk economic sense to them. It is now obvious that some people in the Liberal Party are beginning to realise that they have some problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cite Mr Lloyd's comment that the advice of the Wool Council to both the coalition and the industry in the past has been poor and there is no reason to suppose that the demand to hold up this legislation was any better. I add that the Wool Council should not presume to speak for all farmers. The farmers I meet and deal with often say that they are not members of the New South Wales Farmers Federation. They do not feel that they have been ably represented by members of the Wool Council and wool industry leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> That is something which farmers will have to address. They will have to look at involving themselves in the representation on those organisations. With all unions-and I class the Federation as a union-the membership, the representation and the leadership are only as good as the input from their members or those who should be members. That goes for all unions, be they trade unions or industry unions such as the Wool Council and the New South Wales Farmers Federation. The membership of those organisations does not comprise every producer of wool in this country. Therefore, it has to be recognised that they do not represent everybody and should not presume to speak for everybody in the country who produces wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that farmers have said to me-and again it is being critical of the Wool Council and its pressure to have the price of wool increased to 870c a kilo-is that a false market signal was sent to those in farming who move around from industry to industry looking at where they will gain the maximum income. People were encouraged to go into the industry who had not traditionally been in it. The traditional wool farmers are very critical of that. They are very upset by it, and justifiably so, I would suggest. They would like to see whether there is some way of penalising those people more than others, but that would not be very fair. </PARA>
<PARA> I also hear comments that not enough is being done in research and development and that not enough is being done in the marketing of Australian wool, even though our merino wool is the best. I hasten to emphasise `our merino wool', because our other wool has to compete with and, I would suggest, is really no better than wool from other countries, but our merino wool is excellent. People are critical that it is very hard to buy in shops in this country. They are critical that the price one has to pay to purchase the finished garment in this country is exorbitant and is in no way commensurate with the costs that they, in fact, have had to outlay or with the price that they have received. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge support of the Government's legislation and proposals. This is the way forward. It gives the industry time to think; it gives the industry some guidelines; and it is important that we wait for the Vines committee report. We cannot have an inquiry going on and then, halfway through that inquiry, take the rug out from underneath it and say that it is no longer necessary. This inquiry is important. The results of the inquiry must be used and looked at in developing future plans for the wool industry. By abolishing the reserve price the Opposition would remove one of the possible planks and one of the possible recommendations of the Vines committee. Therefore, it is important that we take some breathing time and do not act hastily. That is what this Government is doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rushed into the chamber to deliver what I believe will be a reasonably brief address on this occasion. Perhaps I could take the time of the Senate to give an analogy. What I see is happening to the wool industry is something that happened to me. As it is my personal experience, I hope honourable senators do not find it boring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I left school I commenced my working life as an orchardist in Tasmania. As many people will know, the orcharding industry in Tasmania in the late 1950s was quite a substantial industry. In fact, southern Tasmania was renowned for exporting top quality fruit all over the world and, in particular, to the United Kingdom. This is where I now draw the analogy. For various reasons the industry declined. One reason was marketing problems in the European Economic Community (EEC). When the EEC formed it started flooding the United Kingdom with fruit. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason was the problems in Tasmania on the waterfront. We could guarantee every year when we were picking and packing fruit that there would be a strike in the first week we started to deliver fruit to the wharf. There would not be a strike all year but we could guarantee every time the fruit season started that we would have at least one strike. In addition, the agents were always there to hive off what they thought was a fair percentage of whatever growers got for their fruit. Finally, there were always the shipping lines there to up their prices every year. Eventually it got to the stage where all of a sudden we had surpluses of fruit. We had nowhere to sell it and, of course, we started dumping it. Later on came what was known as the tree pull scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened in Tasmania is almost the same as what has happened to the wool industry. The marketing situation fell apart. There was an oversupply because of external reasons. There were the cost problems at home with greedy agents. There were all those other things that were associated with the industry. I always remember my father telling me that the late Sir Henry Jones, who founded that great company H. Jones and Co., which had a very large operation in Hobart, was quoted as saying, `The industry will wake up one morning and find it will be ruined by a parcel of humbugs'. How true that was. That was when the industry was in full flight, when we were canning not only apples and pears but also apricots and nectarines and everything else that one could grow. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that particular expression could almost be used to describe what has happened to the wool industry. We have woken up in a very short time and found to some extent that the wool industry has been ruined by a parcel of humbugs. I do not think it is fair to try to pick out one person or one group or one particular reason, because everybody has had a hand in it.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Australian Wool Corporation has had a big hand in what has gone on. Its forecasting has been certainly below the mark. I remember very well being briefed by the Wool Corporation people at the National Agricultural Outlook Conference the year before last. I asked them then how many bales they had in stock and they said something like 2.1 million or 2.2 million. I said, `I have it on good authority that you have over three million bales in store'. They denied that, but it turned out a couple of weeks later to be true. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe the growers themselves-I think other speakers have said this, too-have been kept up to the mark about what has been going on. There, too, I think the growers themselves are a little bit to blame because they have been willing to let this go on and be pushed, not by greed but by profit. They have not queried what has happened with the floor price scheme over the years. It has been explained in far greater detail by better people than me just how that floor price got up to 800c or further and how it all fell apart.</PARA>
<PARA> I happened to be watching Graeme Campbell, the member for Kalgoorlie, speaking in quite a lively fashion the other night. I must say that, instead of spreading the load, he was sheeting all the blame home to the Australian Wool Corporation. I do not think he was fair at all about that. He mentioned Minister Kerin once. I thought it was quite unfair to single out the Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard Senator West speak about the price of wool here in Australia. I must say that I personally feel that a few years back perhaps-Senator Button may agree or disagree-a decision should have been made and encouragement should have been given for more processing of our wool here in Australia.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is what I am saying. More people are to blame for this mess we are in than just the Government or the Wool Corporation or the growers. Everybody has to share the blame. But I think the biggest problem we have now, and the major cause of what has happened, is the uncertainty that has been created. I remember very well last year-in September, I think-when Ian Sinclair and I had breakfast in Japan with the Asian manager of the Wool Secretariat. He made a quite telling point. He said, `We in Japan want your wool. In fact, we are looking at increasing our buying this year by some 20 per cent and Korea looks like increasing its buying by about 10 per cent'. But he also said, `I wish you would tell your Prime Minister, your Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and representatives of the woolgrowers in Australia to stop saying that nothing is going to happen, that the price is not going to move, because every time they open their mouths we get suspicious and people do not buy'. I think the uncertainty relating to the floor price scheme and just how much was in the stockpile has had a snowballing effect on the whole industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> And what a time in the life of Australia for this to happen. It is not just the wool industry that is in crisis. We have huge problems with our wheat. The surpluses are down 68 per cent this year with an additional 37 per cent next year. On top of that, as I said, the wool industry operating surplus is down 8.2 per cent this year, and a further 139 per cent next year. We do not need to be reminded of the position of the citrus fruit growers. They have been here demonstrating outside Parliament House and complaining about what is going to happen to them. I think the real gross value of the citrus crop will be down 20 per cent this year. The beef industry looks like being down 14 per cent, and the sugar industry is looking at a 15 per cent decline. The tale of woe for the farmers-it is predicted that net farm cash income will fall by about 40 per cent-is something that I think is of great concern to us all, whatever political party we are in. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the most telling factor in the rural sector at the moment, unfortunately, is that people have lost faith in the Government and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). On 31 May, Mr Kerin said, `My clear message to the market is that 700c is immutable. The next time the floor price is changed it will be upward'. Unfortunately, those words will probably haunt him for the rest of his life, just as the words `No child will live in poverty after 1990' will sit with Mr Hawke and `This is the recession we had to have' will sit with Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin followed those words with `The Government's commitment to the 700c per kilo is rock solid'. That is when I think uncertainty started being created. That is when the Japanese became suspicious and stopped buying. And, of course, once they stopped buying, just about everybody else around the world did. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem we have now has been well outlined by just about every speaker. The wool industry faces the bleak consequence of a minimum of $2.8 billion of internal debt and the potential exists for that to rise to about $3.5 billion. It will require half a billion dollars a year to service that debt. Currently we have 4.8 million bales of wool in the sheds and what looks like 1.5 to two million bales of annual oversupply. So we have these three problems: too much debt, too much supply and, quite frankly, too much wool. </PARA>
<PARA> I must at this stage declare an interest. I am a woolgrower myself, though not a very big one, and I know exactly what the feeling is around my area. It is important to stop uncertainty as much as we can and the main way we can do that is not by messing around talking about the reserve price scheme being suspended but by biting the bullet and completely abolishing it. That is why the coalition is supporting the legislation. The reserve price scheme must go permanently if we are going to have confidence return to the industry. As I said earlier, we are only creating more uncertainty when we say that we are going to suspend the reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The next issue is the industry debt. We have indicated that we will support the Government's proposal to pay the $300m in supplementary payments. That will make up the shortfall between what the farmers actually get-it is a good question what they will get-and the 700c that they should have got until the end of June. It is a bit of a worry that people are speculating already about what price wool is going to sell for. Some people are saying 375c, but I really do not know how they arrive at that figure. They have never been able to forecast anything before and that is why we are in the mess we are in. This continued speculation about what the price of wool is going to be when the wool sales start is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that it is in the interest of woolgrowers that we support a proposal which allows the Wool Corporation open-ended borrowing to augment those supplementary payments. Growers are so far down the tube that we will be saddling our children and our children's children with a debt that is going to take many years to get rid of. The coalition's suggestion of applying a $200m cap on extra borrowing will limit the wool industry's debt to $3 billion. We know what the annual interest rate is going to be, so capping that debt will discipline the market, encourage farmers to exercise restraint and prevent the industry from being forced into extra debt. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the arrangement, again to take that uncertainty out of the market, it is essential that the stockpile be frozen for 12 months. I wish that when all this business started someone had taken a million bales and put them down a mine shaft somewhere and forgotten about them. With the huge debt we have got now, it is an asset we have to retain but, while people have the threat hanging over their heads that that huge stockpile is going to be released, that too creates a lot of uncertainty. So I think it is most important that we spell out to the buyers in the industry that that stockpile has to be frozen. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of the coin, it is very important in this critical time when farmers are facing ruin that the Government give attention to the provision of additional finance through the rural adjustment and rural counselling schemes. It is not just the wool farmers who are going to suffer; the wheat farmers are too. Even the peanut farmers want to talk to the Government about the problems they have in their industry. </PARA>
<PARA> So it seems that, right across the board, Australia in the bush is suffering and suffering very badly. We in the coalition have said for quite some time now that one of the ways to try to improve the market is to reduce the supply. We have been very strong. Whilst it is most unfortunate that we have to reduce our flocks at this point in time-only 10 million, I believe, have been slaughtered-it is pretty evident that a reduction of 40 million sheep is what the industry requires. It is very sad. The electronic media have shown very sad pictures of farmers actually crying as they have to eliminate their sheep. It is something that people who live in the bush become accustomed to. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing more traumatic than to have to go around shooting sheep after they have been burnt in a bushfire, as I and many other farmers in Tasmania did in 1967. There is nothing more traumatic than to build up a breed of sheep by your own efforts and your own breeding and, at the end of the day, have to go around and shoot 10,000 or 20,000 of them. It takes the heart right out of you when you look at your overdraft as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I really feel for what is happening in the bush. It is not going to change very quickly. We as a nation have to come to terms with what is happening. Dr Hewson has said many times that if our agreeing with the Government on actions would make it easier for people we would give the Government bipartisan support. But today we are putting forward amendments that we believe, in this very difficult time, are in the best interests of the woolgrowers. I just hope that the Australian Democrats and the Government take notice of those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> At the other end of the scale, whilst we have that huge supply problem, we also have a lot of market deficiencies. I have been involved for many years-through my association with the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania and its shows-with wool fashion parades. I have seen how well they have been presented. In our Bicentenary, we had that wonderful fashion show at the Opera House in Sydney. It cost quite a deal of money. But really we are only trying to convince our own people here in Australia to buy wool. Whilst that is very important, the market share of wool in Australia, the amount of wool we use, is pretty small compared to what goes on around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to question the amount of money that the Government and the growers have been pumping into New York, into the International Wool Secretariat. Just how good has it been? Have we got value for money over the years in which it has been trying to promote our wool overseas? I do not think it has done a very good job at all. But whilst the price has been high and farmers have been selling their wool and getting reasonably good incomes, no-one has questioned what has been going on outside of Australia. I just hope that as a result of this crisis we look at not only the Wool Corporation but also the benefits we are getting from the quite huge amounts of money we have been spending overseas on our promotion campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that one of the reasons that the Japanese put forward for an increase in sales this year was the fact that they were following the cotton market. The cotton manufacturers in Japan were promoting a product called `new generation cotton'. They were doing huge promotions on this, almost as big as the promotions the Japanese Government was doing on `import now month' in October. The wool people in Japan were going to follow up with this new generation wool. They believed that by doing that they could increase their sales of 22- and 23-micron wool, which they had not worried about before. That just shows what can happen with a bit of innovation. But that innovation did not come from the International Wool Secretariat, nor did it come from the amount of money that we, as growers, and the Government have been putting into trying to increase our markets overseas. That came from the Japanese industry itself. So I do not believe we have been getting the sort of value for our dollar overseas that we should have. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is approaching lunchtime, I will just finish by saying that I think it would be most irresponsible of anybody to try to block the legislation. We certainly will not be doing that. We urge the Senate to support the amendments that have been put forward in good faith by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) launched the consensus revolution in 1983 we all knew we were in for a series of special relationships with favoured interest groups. But no-one could have guessed the extent to which the Government would forge a political deal with the hierarchy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to the detriment of not only the rank and file membership but ordinary non-unionised workers who have, over the last decade, voted with their feet and deserted the union movement in droves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Kemp has performed a valuable service in setting out the extent to which this Government has been prepared to fund the ACTU by a series of round robins which in any corporate sector would have called for universal political condemnation but, having raised it to the art form that it has, the Government has been able to get through largely unscathed to date. As Senator Kemp pointed out in his excellent adjournment speech of 13 February last, in the current financial year--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I have got my own contribution to make in this but Senator Button will find that if he puts the two together it is a damning indictment of the way his Government has been prepared to favour its friends. For the current financial year the ACTU has received just under $4m, which in contrast to the latest figures available, those for 1987, shows that the ACTU affiliation fees were a mere $2.5m. In all, since this Government came to office, it has contributed $11.6m to ACTU coffers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let there be no doubt: the ACTU not only has a permanent seat at the Cabinet table; it has a power of veto over the major parts of the reform process which the Government itself knows is so vital if we are to get Australia off the canvas. I am sure that Senator Button read with great anguish this morning the comments of Dr Deeley to the Sydney Institute. ICI, having been held up by this Government as a great example of award restructuring and the productivity progress that this Government has made, ought to be horrified to hear what one of Australia's leading industrialists has had to say because he, in his cry of anguish, made it clear that micro-economic reform has been mere rhetoric. The reason for that, of course, is that it has been nobbled at every opportunity by the ACTU. I do not think that any of us in the real world have any real doubt about that. I suspect Senator Button in his heart of hearts knows that full well but the political will is simply not there to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why, under this culture that operates, we have been able to see what I regard as the high-water mark of political chicanery as evidenced by a recent 16-page glossy insert in Cleo magazine. I think it deserves some careful attention because let there be no doubt that this is nothing short of a government subsidy to the ACTU to promote the virtues of union membership, whatever they may be. It is done under the guise of promoting the jobs, education and training (JET) program, which was designed to facilitate the re-entry of unemployed sole parents, mainly women, into the work force. Unfortunately, even this scheme has been very unsuccessful to date with only about 5 per cent of some 250,000 sole parents actually being interested in undertaking this program and, of those, only about 50 per cent have been in what the Government itself would regard as the high priority category. So JET has a big question mark over it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson has been good enough to tell us, in his recent defences of this outrageous exercise, that indeed the money has not come out of the JET program; it has come out of the Department of Social Security (DSS) advertising budget, which also enables it to promote such things as the JET program. I regard that as mere sophistry, because the fact of the matter is that, whatever pocket it comes out of, the money is purported to be appropriated to appeal to sole parents. However, if we look at where this advertisement has been placed, we see that some $45,000 has gone to pay for a 16-page insert in Cleo magazine. The only sensible reference that one could identify as relating to the JET scheme is a one-page black-and-white advertisement which, according to Cleo magazine itself, retails for just under $6,000 and yet the Department has contributed $45,000 towards the cost of this insert. </PARA>
<PARA> My information, and I have not had it contradicted by Senator Richardson in his furious efforts to justify this scheme, is that the total cost of the exercise is $270,000 and of that approximately one-half, or $135,000, has been contributed from the public sector-in other words, from the Department of Community Services and Health, DSS and the Commonwealth Bank. When we look at why the Commonwealth Bank, with all its problems, finds itself contributing to this worthy cause, we find Anna Booth proudly proclaiming that she was instrumental in getting the bank to kick in for this outrageous exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, Anna Booth is simply another Government token appointment to that bank. I say to Senator Reynolds that I do not mean `token' in the sense of `women'; I mean `token' in the sense of `expertise'. She happens to be a board member of the Commonwealth Bank. I would have thought Anna Booth had enough integrity to understand that there must be a million and one better ways of promoting the JET program than by contributing towards an ACTU membership drive-and that is what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> That money will also go towards the ACTU's sending out of the insert to some 500,000 female workers. So again the JET scheme is to be advertised to the wrong people, and the $45,000 simply represents a reallocation of resources from unemployed sole parents to the ACTU and middle-class employed women. Cleo magazine, as I am sure no-one doubts, caters for young, upwardly mobile working women, not disadvantaged, unemployed sole parents, almost two-thirds of whom are over the age of 30. So one could not imagine a less appropriate vehicle for meeting the proclaimed objectives. I regard it as an absolute disgrace, and I am sure the Australian community will, too. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be fascinated to hear from Senator Reynolds or anyone else just what else the Government has done by way of promoting the JET program. If this is the start of a new approach-to somehow get the message out via magazines that are unlikely to be read by unemployed sole parents-then we would like to hear about it, because I would have thought that most of them would not be able to afford the $3.50 cover charge. So, under the guise of catering for a disadvantaged group, what we really have when we strip it away is yet another sordid, grubby political deal which involves a transfer payment from the Government to the union movement so that it can somehow try to pull itself up by its bootstraps rather than addressing the real reasons people are no longer interested in unionism. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, those who are particularly not interested in joining the union movement are working women. They know that the union movement has been ferocious in defending its own privileges, in actively discouraging part time workers, the vast majority of whom are women, and indeed in ensuring that all sorts of barriers to entry and hurdles are put in the way of those who would like to engage in casual or part time activity. So women have absolutely no reason to be grateful to the ACTU, and I suspect the last thing on the mind of any sole parent wanting to enter the work force is to rush off and join the union. What these people want is a decent job, unhassled by the unions, yet they find that the ACTU is putting almost every hurdle it can in their way. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson, showing acute and exquisite sensitivity, had the temerity to write to the Age newspaper purporting to defend this little rort and in the process I thought simply made matters a lot worse. He really did not explain where the funds came from and I suggest that if he has any integrity in this area he ought to come clean, he ought to table the documents and we ought to know whether there was any written request from Martin Ferguson or whether it was just the usual telephone deal. We ought to know whether indeed there was any costing provided to the Department of Social Security before it had its arm twisted to agree to this, whether it was simply an initiative from the Minister, and what the true costs of the exercise are. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that we may well find that the ACTU, having got its hands on $135,000, got a nice discount deal from Cleo and that the end result is that the public sector is funding the vast proportion of this membership drive. Now if that is the case it is indeed a scandal of even greater proportions than we know to date. So for Senator Richardson to rail in the way that he has, and fulminate about how he has been the victim of low standards of journalism on the part of the Age, is simply a smokescreen designed to disguise the fact that he knows full well that he has been party to a deal that simply cannot see the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA> It certainly lends support to all those who might have doubted the words of the ACTU President in his new year's address when he said that the ACTU is part and parcel of the Government of Australia. We know that is a fact in terms of decision making but I do not think many of us thought that that really meant that it got carte blanche whenever it wanted to launch membership drives or any other financial activities. If this is what we are going to see, then the sooner it sees the light of day and the public can make its judgment the better. So I hope, Mr Deputy President, that we are going to have a lot more factual information put on the record, and that we are not simply going to be subjected to Senator Richardson throwing tantrums and trying to discourage journalists from pursuing the matter. I hope what we will see is a proper examination of the cost-benefits analysis of this exercise and I suspect that they are absolutely minimal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will resist the temptation to take up the issue Senator Alston has raised in this place today, but I can assure him that on another occasion I would like to answer some of the things he has said about the Government's commitment to women in the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to speak this afternoon about an issue affecting Queensland Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. I would like to take the opportunity to commend the announcement by the Queensland Premier, Wayne Goss, that the State Government will legislate for Aboriginal land rights before the end of the year. I think it is appropriate, especially for someone like myself who has been waiting for this announcement for over 25 years, that I should take a short time this afternoon to comment on a few issues related to this announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> Many senators will welcome this decision, which highlights the Goss Government's commitment to giving recognition to Aboriginal land claims. In his announcement yesterday Mr Goss emphasised:</PARA>
<PARA>They-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Aborigines and Islanders-</PARA>
<PARA>don't want the whole box and dice but they want a share. Ultimately that's our best chance as a community to heal this problem and to allow the communities to become self sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA>I certainly welcome Mr Goss's statement and I think the emphasis should certainly be on that quote of Aborigines and Islanders wanting a share. They are not making a land grab as is consistently claimed by certain sections of the media and indeed by certain sections of the political and general community. It is predictable, unfortunately, that both the National Party and Liberal Party leaders in Queensland have reacted against this proposal which fails to replicate the new spirit of bipartisanship that has been fostered here in the Federal Parliament by the Minister, Robert Tickner, and indeed the Opposition spokesperson, Michael Wooldridge. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to commend both of those key spokespersons on trying to get away from the rancour and the level of debate about Aboriginal affairs that were so prevalent when Minister Hand had responsibility, and from that attempt to always blame the victim by blaming Aborigines and Islanders when anything at all went wrong in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It is so good to see that that rancour seems to have gone from the debate here in Federal Parliament. It is a pity that now-on the first occasion that at State level we have the opportunity to see whether that bipartisanship has extended generally throughout the country-it appears that it has not reached Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me examine particularly the arguments of both Russell Cooper and Denver Beanland, the respective leaders of the National and Liberal parties in that State. Russell Cooper said that the legislation would result in a `land grab' and indicated that `no minority group has a right to make massive claims with the majority of Queenslanders disadvantaged'. I would just like to bring to the Senate's attention the fact that Mr Cooper does not seem to have the same conviction about his own National Party leader, Don McDonald, who has extensive land ownership that extends over huge tracts of the State of Queensland. In fact, the Australian Magazine of 26 January lists the McDonald family as No. 7 of Australia's top 10 land holders, owning 29,000 square kilometres, valued at an estimated $55m and including Rutland Plains and Dunbar on Cape York. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not arguing against the members of the McDonald family owning that amount of land-that is entirely their business. They have built it up over a period of time. But I find it a little extraordinary that when the McDonald family owns 29,000 square kilometres, or 1.7 per cent of Queensland, Mr Cooper can worry about Aborigines and Islanders, who after all constitute 2 per cent of the population. He will not even keep an open mind about Aboriginal and Islander land rights. We do not know yet what the claims will be. But he will not even keep an open mind about what it might be reasonable for 2 per cent of Queenslanders-that is, Aboriginal and Islander Queenslanders-to have entitlement to after all these years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy for him to accept the land holdings of McDonald, but it is not so easy for him to apply the same fundamental principle to Aborigines and Islanders. It seems to me to be a clear case of double standards that it is okay for the National Party President to own 1.7 per cent of Queensland when he-apart from his representation of the National Party-represents just one family, yet Mr Cooper rejects a just share of entitlement for Aborigines and Islanders constituting not one family but 2 per cent of the population. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just Mr Cooper; it is also Mr Beanland. He has reacted aggressively, accusing Mr Goss of `selling out the State'. I am sure Michael Wooldridge will be most disappointed that his colleague in Queensland has reacted with the typically hysterical attitude that it is a `land grab' and Aborigines and Islanders want your backyard and mine. That is the level of the debate of the past. We thought that we had got through that very simplistic level of argument. We thought that political leaders could be a little bit mature about debating this issue, but apparently they cannot when it comes to Mr Cooper and Mr Beanland. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that both Mr Cooper and Mr Beanland show a little consistency by studying the amount of rural land owned by single families or companies, and start giving more temperate leadership by accepting rational debate and negotiation on the proposed land rights legislation. We do not yet know what the claims will be. We do not know what is reasonable and what is realistic, or what impact the legislation will have on Queenslanders. It is a question of restoring some justice to the State's Aborigines and Islanders, and that has to be negotiated in a realistic and rational manner. </PARA>
<PARA> Sections of the media also could moderate their response and try to contribute some factual analysis to the debate. For example, this morning's Courier-Mail headline screamed, `Cape Claims of 60m Hectares by Aborigines'. I have checked with both the Minister, Anne Warner, and the Queensland Premier's Department. There are no claims; this is completely inaccurate. Aborigines have not claimed 60 million hectares. What they have done is talk about their concern to have included in negotiations-and I emphasise `negotiations'-areas around Temple Bay and Port Stewart on Cape York. The only thing I could find that gave a very clear indication of the amount of land we might be talking about was a quote in the Cairns Post of 6 December last year:</PARA>
<PARA>The State Government may hand over about 2160 hectares of land inside the controversial Cape York property, Silver Plains, to Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA>That is rather different, I am sure all honourable senators would agree, from this morning's headline which mentions claims on 60 million hectares. No specific claims have been made in writing. Clearly, it is important that land claims be sensitively negotiated. This process will not be assisted by exaggeration and hysteria and I would certainly hope that in the coming months Michael Wooldridge can prevail upon his counterpart in Queensland to return to some form of bipartisanship and some rational debate on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly timely that Mr Goss has made this announcement because the tradition of native title faces its final test some time this year, according to an article by David Solomon in the Australian of 23 November last year:</PARA>
<PARA>The way has been cleared for the High Court to make fundamental decisions next year-</PARA>
<PARA>that is this year-</PARA>
<PARA>about the force and effect of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander claims to land under the common law. </PARA>
<PARA>The court will determine whether and to what extent traditional native title was extinguished by British colonisation and subsequent legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The question has already been described by three members of the High Court as ``of the greatest importance''. </PARA>
<PARA>The issue has to be determined to settle a claim by Mr Eddie Mabo and other leaders of the Murray Island peoples to land on several islands in the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not know what the outcome of that particular case will be, but I think it is rather interesting, and I said so at the time, that in 1985 the Queensland Government attempted to solve the dispute by passing legislation declaring, in effect, that any rights Mr Mabo and other islanders might have enjoyed were abolished with effect from the time the islands were annexed to Queensland in the late nineteenth century. So it would seem that as recently as 1985 there were very clear doubts in terms of the legal issues and I look forward to those legal issues being clarified by the High Court later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I commend the initiative of Mr Goss and I urge all political leaders and sections of the media to demonstrate some leadership and to show a little bipartisanship, a little preparedness to debate and consider these issues rather than rushing in to make accusations of land grabs. </PARA>

<PARA> I would imagine that the same sorts of sensible rules would apply to redundancy on the waterfront-not that it has been specifically written into any agreement-as would apply in the Public Service or, indeed, in many other employment areas; that is, after a reasonable period of time elapses, and it is two years, I know, in some places, people, if they are able to go back to work, can do so. The wet tropics would not have any particular relationship to the waterfront. If this is true, there would be nothing to stop people displaced from the waterfront going to seek employment, if they wanted to, in other jobs. I do not see what is wrong with that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is seriously concerned about allegations of human rights abuses occurring in the course of the armed conflict between the Sri Lankan Government forces and the Tamil Tigers, including in particular reports of the disappearances which have been referred to by Senator Jones. I cannot verify in any detail the specific reports to which the question refers but there are a considerable number of allegations which follow the common theme of abductions of Tamil youths and young men. Nor do I have detailed reports on where these young men, if surviving, are held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While it is certainly true that the LTTE, the Tamil Tigers organisation, itself has been responsible for major outrages and systematic human rights abuses, there is little doubt that the Sri Lankan Government forces have also committed serious violations. The Australian Government has urged the Sri Lankan Government in the past, and it does so again now, to take more effective steps to restrain the excesses of its own forces and to curb abusive practices. I can assure Senator Jones that the Government has conveyed its concerns on the human rights situation in the country to the Government in Colombo on a number of occasions, most recently during the current session of the Commission of Human Rights (CHR) in Geneva. Australian statements to the CHR forty-seventh general session will also underline our continued concerns in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA> There is growing concern among the people in Sri Lanka at these disappearances. An organisation called Mother's Front is emerging as a major grassroots organisation with the objective of tracing the disappeared of all communities and seeking financial relief for their families. The High Commission attended in an observer status the inaugural national convention of this organisation in Sri Lanka a couple of days ago.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government welcomes measures which have recently been taken by the Sri Lankan Government to improve respect for internationally accepted human rights standards, including the recent establishment of a high level task force on human rights which is assisting in providing responses to individual cases raised by foreign missions, including ourselves, in Colombo and by continuing to cooperate with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the Red Cross.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government does believe, and has always believed, that the only viable solution to this conflict is a peaceful one. Regrettably, it is not possible at the moment to say what shape that peaceful solution might take and whether it will include provisions for reparations. We are doing our best to continue promoting the idea of some mediated solution along the lines that have been the subject of discussion in this chamber in times past. We simply hope that sooner rather than later some sanity will prevail and a peaceful reconciliation will be possible.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to those two questions is yes and yes. The information that supports those answers is found in the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Economic Outlook publication for the December quarter 1990. That lists, in a table form, OECD estimates, which show that Australian unit labour costs in the business sector are estimated by the OECD as being below the average of other OECD countries for 1991. The Australian estimate is for an increase in money terms-I must make the distinction; this is different from the real terms change because our unit labour costs are falling-of 4.4 per cent for Australia compared with an OECD average for the year 1991 of 4.6 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To look at some of the countries that we do better than, according to this OECD tabulation, is instructive. For example, we do better than the United States of America, which is listed at 4.9 per cent. We do better than the United Kingdom, which-and the Thatcher-now-Major model is often cited by senators opposite as the ideal from their point of view-is estimated at 8.3 per cent. As I said, we are at 4.4 per cent. We do better than Italy at 6.3 per cent, Austria at 5 per cent, Finland at 6.9 per cent, Greece at 14.6 per cent, Portugal at 9.4 per cent, Spain at 5.7 per cent and Switzerland at 4.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> That tabulation shows a very heartening improvement for Australia. As well, in the face of what we have seen this week as a fairly irrelevant call, but nonetheless a call, made by the shadow spokesman for industrial relations, Mr Howard, on the 40-hour week, it puts to flight some of his fantasies about what unit labour cost performance in Australia is. The burden of his remarks is that it is not a good performance. Australia's performance, compared to other countries in the OECD, is reasonable.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Industrial Relations Commission, in a hearing on 12 February, ratified a new classification structure for the metal industry award. The operative date for that structure was Tuesday of this week, 21 February, when the orders were formally agreed. It is, I think, an historic agreement. I congratulate the metal industry unions and the metal industry employers for significantly improving the flexibilities of the work forces in the metal industry and the 450,000 Australian metal industry workers who are affected by the changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulties that the parties, in reaching this agreement, have overcome cannot in any sense be underestimated. The agreement marks the culmination of some three years of negotiations to develop an award framework for fundamental changes in the industry and, of course, at enterprise level. The 350 task-based classifications in the award will now be replaced by 14 levels of classification structures, with wage rates based on the skills exercised by the worker. This means that the demarcation disputes between different tasks, which characterised a lot of activity in the industry in the past, will now be done away with. I think that will add a significant efficiency and a significant improvement in industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA> Workers will also now be able to undertake all of the tasks at their skill level which are necessary to do the job. For example, a welder, who in the past might have done only welding, will now be able to do all the work associated with that occupation, including the rigging work that is necessary, the driving of forklifts that is necessary and so on. Workers in the future will have the opportunity to progress up through a career path by gaining relevant skills and experience. They will also have access to better and more interesting jobs, with higher rates of pay.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the changes for employers are also significant. They will have access to a better trained work force, with far more flexibility in the deployment of their labour. Individual enterprises will be able to put in place work arrangements which better suit their needs and assist them to achieve higher productivity. A procedure has been agreed for the orderly transfer of the work force, as it now is, to the new structures. The award framework is supported by revised training arrangements, skills standards and competencies. Skill structures are to be finalised in March by the parties.</PARA>
<PARA> These changes in the workplace are complemented and enhanced by the ability for workers and employers, in accordance with the enterprise flexibility clauses of the award, to agree on changes in their workplace which will enable them to work more flexibly and more efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA> I again congratulate the parties. I say that it is a triumph for them. But it is also a triumph for this Government in the sense that it could occur only in the cooperative and consensual climate that we have engendered in industrial relations in this country. If we were to try to achieve these changes by consent in a confrontationist climate, which is the philosophy of the Opposition, these vast improvements would not have been able to be achieved at all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the Soviet peace proposal, I answered a question on that very fully in this place yesterday in Senator Vallentine's absence, as I recall. I have nothing to add to that. It is simply a matter of waiting now to see what the Iraqi's response is to that proposal and then seeing how things pan out thereafter. As I made clear yesterday, the United States is not to be taken as having rejected the proposal, only to have identified a number of shortcomings in it. Those shortcomings are, in our judgment, capable of modification and remedy. We all hope that one way or another it will be possible to avoid, in a principled way, and consistently with the achievement of the UN resolutions and nothing else, the avoidance of further bloodshed. So I have nothing to add in that respect to what Mr Alatas or anybody else might have said about that particular proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the recurring suggestions that the UN Secretary-General, Mr Perez de Cueller, somehow is seeking to claim that this is not a United Nations war, what he has said on a number of occasions when asked is that it is a war taking place under the authority of the United Nations Security Council within the United Nations framework, but is not being actually conducted by the United Nations or its Military Staff Committee-or any of the other particular pieces of specific machinery potentially available under article 7 of the UN Charter-which has never, of course, been strictly implemented. But Mr Perez de Cueller has made it abundantly clear on innumerable occasions that he is not seeking to argue that this is taking place in any way at odds with the principles or procedures of the United Nations. As I have just said, it is unquestionably taking place within a UN framework. In that sense it can properly be described as pursuing UN objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> It is of course a matter for continuing debate and discussion, in which Australia will be very much involved, as to what the UN's role institutionally should be in conflict avoidance and conflict resolution in the future. One of the things that will have to be addressed is whether or not it is possible to develop some standing military arrangements within the terms of the UN Charter to make possible an institutional UN response to these situations in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> There are competing views as to the practicality of that and it may be, given the complexity and scale of military conflict in this technological age, that there are problems in going down that particular track, but it is an open question and one that very much deserves to be followed up in the kind of new international order that we all hope will exist and be consolidated as a result of this particular conflict.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have nothing to add to the previous answer in that respect. The United Nations Secretary-General has made it perfectly clear that he supports a peaceful resolution to this conflict if that is at all possible. He made it clear in his own representations prior to 15 January, both directly to the Iraqis and publicly, what he understood the requirements of a peaceful resolution to be. They had to be built upon the unconditional and immediate acceptance by Iraq of its obligation to withdraw from Kuwait. The Secretary-General has constantly made it clear ever since that that has to be the basis on which a cease-fire or a peaceful resolution is achieved; that there is no other basis upon which it can be achieved. I do not believe it is likely that any role that he perceives himself capable of playing at the moment is not being equally capably played under the authority of the UN and the Security Council by the great powers most immediately currently involved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Small Business and Customs. Given the present appalling economic climate when bankruptcies in the last quarter alone rose in Western Australia by 89.4 per cent, Victoria by 69.4 per cent, New South Wales by 60.5 per cent, Queensland by over 50 per cent and Australia as a whole by some 56.8 per cent and where small business is struggling to survive, does the Government intend to continue with its original timetable for phasing in the system of an earlier collection of company tax? Is the Government also aware that, if it continues with this timetable, additional financial strain will be placed on the small business sector at a time when it is already reeling under the effects of this Government's engineered recession? Can the Minister give an assurance that it will not proceed with the original timetable and give small business a break?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we are all aware of the statistics which Senator Boswell prefaces his question with. I do not know whether they are precisely accurate but for the purpose of answering the question I assume that they are. In so far as the economic recession bears on small business, I am very mindful of the fact that it is probably small business that has suffered most in the current downturn in the Australian economy. As far as the question of the revised timetable for collection of taxes announced last year is concerned, Senator Boswell will be aware, I hope, that the Treasurer announced some alleviation of that timetable in the latter part of last year. As I understand it, that was generally welcomed by small business organisations and by business generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Boswell's question relates to the small business sector as a whole. When he talks about bankruptcies he is not talking about incorporated business, so it is rather odd that he prefaced his question with figures about bankruptcies and then went on to ask a question about company tax, which relates to a relatively small part of small business because a very significant proportion of them are not incorporated businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> I will certainly listen to any request from Senator Boswell which would provide for a more sensible alleviation of corporate tax arrangements, but it seems to me that his question is in part misconceived.</PARA>
<PARA> I should conclude by saying that I am not sure that this is the worst problem which small businesses are facing at present by any manner of means. I have no doubt that a favourable response to Senator Boswell's question might help a very small proportion of small businesses, but I am not convinced that it would help the vast majority with whom we have to be concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health. I refer the Minister to the newly released national health strategy background paper by John Deeble and I ask: could the Minister tell the Senate whether any factors in this report indicate the need to fine tune Medicare when the Australian Government has kept the cost of health care down to a considerably lower proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) than most other western countries since its introduction?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Crowley, who was a distinguished medical practitioner before entering this chamber, for her question concerning Dr Deeble's paper. Whilst it very clearly sets out the fundamental strengths of Medicare-the medical service which is approved of by seven out of 10 Australians-there are certain problems in relation to supply and demand for medical services which the paper quite clearly identifies and which will need attention and consideration by the national health strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be of interest for honourable senators to know that the medical service use per person increased by 23 per cent in the five years to 1989-90, but the largest increases were in the areas of pathology and other diagnostic services. In other words, the paper documents an underlying growth in the use of medical services but mainly in those areas where the use of those services is dictated by referrals-in other words by doctors-rather than by patients themselves presenting for a particular service. The doctors numbers problem is the result of training decisions made in the 1970s and there is a continuing underlying growth in the numbers of doctors and the use of medical services. It is a real problem which needs to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley pointed out that the cost of private medical services has remained a stable proportion of GDP over the last six years and that is a notable achievement within the Medicare framework. But when one looks at the question of alternatives, it is quite clear that the voucher system, which has been touted and flirted with by the Opposition, is something which ought to be rejected by all Australians and, of course, by the Opposition very early in the piece.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the shadow Minister for health (Dr Bob Woods) has been retreating on this issue over the last several days. As I understand it, the proposal is that the Government would provide vouchers towards the cost of private insurance to Australians; I do not know whether to all Australians, but to a considerable number of Australians. The voucher would be used to purchase private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA> The only comparable country with a great dependence on private health insurance is, of course, the United States. There the higher costs, both in service delivery and administration, are quite horrific. The amount spent on health in the United States is 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product, while in Australia it is 8.1 per cent. To put it another way, in the United States $2,769 was spent on health costs per person compared to $1,294 per person in Australia-in other words, the United States spent more than double the amount on providing health care to each person compared to Australia. I think that is why Australians will reject the idea that Medicare should be displaced and a system of vouchers for the purchase of private insurance should be substituted.</PARA>
<PARA> I am quite sure that my colleague Senator Graham Richardson would be most concerned that it would be a terribly troubling thing for elderly and frail Social Security client beneficiaries to have to make choices between private health insurance, whereas at the moment they have the certainty of the universal Medicare scheme, which I am sure is one of the reasons that has led to its receiving such ringing endorsement election after election over the last several years.</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Crowley pointed out, there is some need for fine-tuning of Medicare. I am quite sure that Miss Jenny Macklin, who is conducting the national health strategy review, will give these issues her close attention. I believe the Minister, Mr Brian Howe, is looking forward to the receipt of her review of these matters in order to ensure that Medicare is strengthened in order to continue to well serve the Australian people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read Mr Fraser's speech given earlier in the week and I thought it was a very lucid speech. I hope people like Senator Archer have read it and not just taken a quote from a newspaper out of that speech. It is not quite fair of the honourable senator to take a quotation from Mr Fraser's speech out of the context in which it was put and put it in another context. Mr Fraser was saying that a variety of factors have to be taken into account in any consideration of loosening monetary policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two points he was making and would continue to make: that monetary policy has already been relaxed by some 6 per cent in the last 10 months or so and that it takes time for that sort of relaxation of monetary policy to work through the system, and that any additional relaxation of monetary policy at the present time would have no impact on the present circumstances of the Australian economy for some months to come. As I recall the speech, that was his first point.</PARA>
<PARA> The second point Mr Fraser was trying to make in that speech on this issue was that, in the light of world economic conditions, particularly conditions in the Anglo-Saxon countries-if I can so describe them-where recessions are taking place, it might be foolish to hastily reduce monetary policy because governments have to be very careful to look not just to the next few months, but to the longer term and try to determine policies which will influence the way this country comes out of the recession and which will influence, very much, the shape of the Australian economy in the years to come.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that is what Mr Fraser was saying about sitting tight. It is not at all palatable for governments to have to sit tight, but we do not want to get ourselves in the same situation as the Fraser Government did which, when confronted with recession, panicked, took all sorts of silly steps to try to get itself out of that difficult situation, and failed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of media reports on Radio National that Mr Pinto, an East Timorese teacher, has allegedly been mistreated while under arrest for assisting an Australian journalist, Robert Domm, to gain an interview with the Fretelin leader, Xanana, last year. I can confirm that Mr Pinto was arrested in mid-January and has since been released. As for the allegations of torture, the Australian Embassy in Jakarta is currently making inquiries, including independent sources, to find out whether this is true. If the Embassy's inquiries confirm that Mr Pinto was seriously mistreated, I will certainly instruct the Embassy to raise the matter with the Indonesian authorities. Such action would be consistent with the Government's very firm policy of raising these human rights cases where we have reasonably specific details of what occurred and where these allegations are backed up by reliable sources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not agree, however, that the arrest of Mr Pinto is indicative of what Senator Bourne describes as an increase in repression of the East Timor people. The human rights situation in East Timor in the past year did improve over that of 1989, although it is clear that there was an increase in security problems and a resultant deterioration in that situation in East Timor over the particular period of September to November last year-a deterioration which resulted in the Australian Government registering its concern at very senior levels with the Indonesian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation appears very much to have calmed down again over the past two or three months. Independent sources indicate to us that release of people detained as a result of that unrest late last year has been under way since early December.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a rather extraordinary statement attributed to Senator Powell in the past couple of days suggesting that because the United Nations has not handled the Gulf war in accordance with the prescriptions of the Australian Democrats, it should be reformed, and in particular democratised. Senator Powell claims that the United Nations abrogated its responsibilities by leaving the decision to join the war to each individual nation and ceding control of the military action to the United States of America. She said that the Security Council should immediately take back control and that when that is done the whole organisation must be turned upside down and thoroughly democratised to ensure that this sort of thing does not happen again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we ought to return to some basics and an understanding of what the UN's role is in all of this. The Security Council's 12 resolutions on the war clearly establish what must happen if there is to be a resolution of the conflict. It was the Security Council of the United Nations which ordered an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and it was the Security Council of the United Nations which adopted resolution 678 to enforce that order and requested all individual States to provide appropriate support to that end. Of course, that is precisely what the coalition is doing in the Gulf at this time-operating within resolution 678 to secure Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA> The crucial point that Senator Powell fails either to comprehend or accept is that it is Iraq's failure to comply with the Security Council's resolutions which has brought about this war, and until there is irrefutable evidence that Iraq is complying with those resolutions there can be no question of the withdrawal of coalition forces. As for what she says about the democratisation of the United Nations, the Security Council has not acted alone in the Gulf crisis. I remind her that 144 nations joined in the United Nations General Assembly condemnation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure how quickly the UN will respond to Senator Powell's blandishments as far as the reform of its own house is in order. We will be respectfully suggesting that it does not act too quickly in this respect. We believe that a very dangerous principle would be set if it did. No institution-international or domestic-would henceforth be safe if it did not operate in accordance with those principles of naive, breathless muddle which the Australian Democrats have made peculiarly their own.</PARA>

During its term of office, that Government made no effort to reform the industrial relations system. It was content to accept the status quo without any attempt to fundamentally overhaul the system. If the coalition were to introduce legislation or to take charge of the system, one can ask these questions. What does it mean?

At present I cannot give a precise timetable as to where those discussions are. I will find out and give Senator Macdonald an answer as quickly as I can.</PARA>

I refer to the Minister's most recent statement on child-care payments, which speaks of child-care benefits being available for working families and working parents. I ask: are we to assume that the Government considers that the 890,000 mothers not in the paid work force and who are caring for their children do not in fact work?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refute any notion that the Commonwealth Government in its provision of access to child-care is constructing that access on a basis which discriminates in the way suggested by Senator Harradine. In fact, I think there is now a general community recognition of the worth of the contribution of women, or indeed whichever spouse or parent is in charge of a particular household, to the servicing of that household. The fact that the person is not in the paid work force does not mean that that person should not have the benefit, in relation to children of the household, of the child-care centres and, indeed, the extension of fee relief to commercial centres, which was ratified by this Senate just before Christmas and came into operation on 1 January. It is an example of the further increase of the provision of child-care into the community by this Government. We are very committed to that. The fact that those in the paid work force or those performing home duties are able to take advantage of these child-care places is a matter of great pride for this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> DECLARATIONS IN RELATION TO PROTOCOL I</PARA>
<PARA>It is Australia's understanding that in relation to Article 5, with regard to the issue whether, and in what measure, Protecting Powers may have to exercise any functions within the combat zone (such as may be implied by provisions in-Parts III and IV of the Protocol), the role of the Protecting Power will be of a like character to that specified in the First and Second Conventions and Part II of the Fourth Convention, which apply mainly to the battlefield and its immediate surroundings.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the understanding of the Government of Australia that in relation to Article 44 of Protocol I, the situation described in the second sentence of paragraph 3 can exist only in occupied territory or in armed conflicts covered by paragraph 4 of Article 1. The Government of Australia will interpret the word ``deployment'' in paragraph 3(b) of the Article as meaning any movement towards a place from which an attack is to be launched. It will interpret the words ``visible to the adversary'' in the same paragraph as including visible with the aid of binoculars, or by infra-red or image intensification devices.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to Articles 51 to 58 inclusive it is the understanding of Australia that military commanders and others responsible for planning, deciding upon, or executing attacks, necessarily have to reach their decisions on the basis of their assessment of the information from all sources, which is available to them at the relevant time.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to paragraph 5 (b) of Article 51 and to paragraph 2 (a) (iii) of Article 57, it is the understanding of Australia that references to the ``military advantage'' are intended to mean the advantage anticipated from the military attack considered as a whole and not only from isolated or particular parts of that attack and that the term ``military advantage'' involves a variety of considerations including the security of attacking forces. It is further the understanding of Australia that the term ``concrete and direct military advantage anticipated'', used in Articles 51 and 57, means a bona fide expectation that the attack will make a relevant and proportional contribution to the objective of the military attack involved.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the understanding of Australia that the first sentence of Article 52 is not intended to, nor does it deal with, the question of incidental or collateral damage resulting from an attack directed against a military objective.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Will the Minister seek to have the results of television aggregation in Queensland monitored?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Will the Minister urge the Department of Transport and Communications to take action to ensure that rural viewers are not further disadvantaged by the continual decline in their television services?</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is committed to the provision of three commercial television services to majority of regional Australia. I believe there is some confusion about recent changes to commercial television services in Queensland, and the role of the Commonwealth Government in those changes. I regret this is so, and I hope this answer will assist you to understand the situation.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, there was a last minute change to the program supply arrangements to two of the three services, and this is what has caused much of the public confusion. The purchase of programs by television stations, and the affiliation agreements they make with national networks, are entirely commercial matters between the parties concerned. I am sure you would agree that it would be entirely improper for the Minister for Transport and Communications or the Government to interfere in such contractual negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The second issue you have raised is that of the programs available on the remote commercial television service (RCTS) in the outback areas of Queensland. As it happens, the licensee of this service, Queensland Television (QTV), is also one of the three regional licensees. As you point out, it no longer takes the majority of its programs from the NINE network, but from TEN. Although QTV's 1991 programming schedule has not been fully decided, I am informed that it is likely that it will take programs from the TEN network as well as special programs from other networks.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Today there has been discussion of the fact that the Deeble report has identified a link between overuse of medical services and the national capacity to pay, and that it has indicated that under Medicare there has been a substantial increase in utilisation. This flies in the face of continued claims by the Government that Medicare had not led to any over-utilisation of health services. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is significant in the light of this that the Medicare levy does not go anywhere near paying for overall health expenditure. I believe that it is important for the Australian people to know the reason for the inability of the Medicare levy to pay for the spiralling health growth in service volume and, in fact, to know whether the underfunding by the Medicare levy has contributed to this spiralling growth, because there is clearly no relationship between the cost of Medicare and the levy itself. The reason that those matters are of such significance is that the Australian Institute of Health, among its activities, has to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . contribute to the improvement of the health of Australians and to the efficient use of resources in the provision of health services . . . to . . . undertake studies into the provision and effectiveness of health services and technologies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I note that there has been a major analysis, drawing on national health insurance data, comparing the use and costs of private medical services in 1976 to those in 1986 undertaken by the Australian Institute of Health. I further note that the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the Institute's work, emphasis shifting from the development of health statistics to management and use of data bases that have been put in place. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> As the various data bases are put in place, there will be a shift in emphasis towards undertaking value-added analysis of statistics that have become available . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is particularly relevant at the moment because of this Deeble report. I would be interested to know the extent to which the Institute of Health has been involved in providing information which would not otherwise have been available to the Deeble report. It is important for us to find that out because this is an expensive Institute. The activities, we argued at the time, could well have been conducted in other specialist areas, for example, the Bureau of Statistics. I think it is important for us to find out whether the Institute of Health is contributing to such major findings as the Deeble one about over-utilisation of health services under Medicare. The reason I ask is that the Health Economics and Expenditure Unit of the Institute, which is responsible for collating information on expenditure on health services by governments, through private insurance and by individuals, published an information booklet some time ago. It says that the unit also provides advice on health economic analysis and evaluation. It says that major tasks carried out during the year include provision of economic consultancy to the screening evaluation coordination unit and so on, and estimating the economic and health aspects of increasing taxes on tobacco and modelling the effects of Commonwealth Grants Commission recommendations on health financing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> What I want to know is: does it have its eyes on the big game? I suppose the 1976-86 report shows a readiness to do so but I believe that this Institute which, as I said, is costly and has taken some time to report for the year to 30 June-in February 1991-has to establish that it really does have a place in the sun. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak to the corrigenda to the annual report of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. It is interesting to note just how extensive that corrigenda is, indicating considerable changes in terms of both the structure and the report into the research program. Having said that, it is worthwhile looking at the report of which this now forms a part. The report itself has a number of interesting photographs on the cover, one of which is a photograph of `benthick sampling during experimental testing into the habitat choice of juvenile banana prawns'. It is clearly a photograph of a rich mangrove area. The report itself also expresses the following hope:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to generate a constant flow of new knowledge; to stimulate the development of high value new uses, services, processes and technologies; and to contribute to the knowledge base required for the sustainable use of existing and new marine biological resources and for conservation issues. </PARA>
<PARA>It says that concern about the impact of terrestrial practices on the quality of coastal waters has attained high political priority in the last two or three years. Then it goes on and talks about the extreme importance of mangrove areas. The reason I raise this is that at this very time we have around Port Adelaide an area which is recognised by the Department of Fisheries of South Australia-a mangrove area which is responsible for most of the commercial fishing, worth about $5m a year, and most of the recreational fishing involving some 300,000 residents of Adelaide who spend some $130m per year on their fishing activities. Half of the mangrove areas of Port Adelaide have already disappeared and the other half are now under serious threat from the multifunction polis (MFP) proposal, which has been pushed very vigorously by Senator Button in this chamber and also by Mr Bannon, the Premier of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of concern to me that at a time when we are spending a great deal of money on research to identify the important environmental attributes of our coastal areas-and we have identified mangroves as one of the richest and most productive areas-we have both the Federal Government and State government in South Australia moving to damage those various areas. There is little point in identifying these areas if, in fact, the governments takes no notice of the scientific results. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically in the case of Port Adelaide we have an area of mangroves currently in an aquatic reserve. These mangroves are prevented from migrating inland as a consequence of sea-level rise, and the sea will rise there both as a consequence of slow subsidence of the surrounding land and also as a consequence of greenhouse. Those mangroves can go nowhere because they are currently backed by saltpans. There is no plan within the MFP proposals for those saltpans to be removed and turned back to swamp into which the mangroves could migrate. There has already been extensive clearing of mangrove areas to the south of the aquatic reserve and that area could also be returned to mangroves with a great deal of benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, only a couple of weeks ago, the South Australian Government launched what it called its status report on the development of the MFP proposal. At that launch, which was in the form of a press conference, Mr Rod Keller who now heads the Government committee was asked about the mangroves. Clearly he had not been properly briefed on the subject because he said, `We will get rid of those rubbish areas. You don't have to worry about that'. This indicates what little concern the South Australian Government and, by implication, this Government represented in this chamber by Senator Button have for these very important areas. It is absolutely vital that we recognise the importance of mangrove areas and do everything we possibly can to protect them and certainly, if possible, extend them where that can also be done. The MFP proposal is simply inconsistent with that protection. </PARA>

No matter what one thinks about the terrible state of the Australian economy at the moment, one hopes it will not always be in such a state, and this is a project which should not be killed off, particularly as it involves using the old Parliament House. I would think that Mr Keating's objection to the National Museum extends, no doubt, to preserving the old Parliament House, which for some incredible reason he would like to see bulldozed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that sanctimonious nonsense. The report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Council drew to the Minister's attention problems arising from the continuing absence of approved criteria and guidelines for the national historical collection. As a consequence much of the collection lacks statutory protection and the Council is unable to de-accession material not considered appropriate for inclusion in the collection. </PARA>
<PARA>Council also asked the Government to update the monetary limits on contract approvals which have remained unchanged since 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is setting out to kill this project. There is no doubt. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>While much has been achieved through community consultation, restoration of acquisition funds and augmentation of curatorial staff are essential for balanced development of the collection. </PARA>
<PARA>It reveals what I believe is a scandalous situation: the number of researchers and students who have been able to get access to material in the collection has been reduced from 140 in 1988-89 to only 11. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The number of researchers/students given direct access to the collection was reduced due to competing accommodation needs of consultant cataloguers. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the lack of resources given to this Museum is destroying its capacity to service researchers and students. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Of greatest concern is the recent discovery of the loss of four items from the collection . . .  en-route to the Stockman's Hall of Fame, Longreach. Following exhaustive searches the Minister was formally advised of their loss.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . inadequate supervision of routine conservation following use of Australia II for bicentennial celebrations may have resulted in increased conservation costs in preparing the vessel for display at the Australian National Maritime Museum. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, this is a sorry story. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite these efficiencies the acute shortage of collection accommodation and adjacent working space was apparent during the year. The Museum at present has only 1000 square metres of controlled environment space which falls far short of its requirement. An additional 1300 square metres of warehouse space was leased adjoining premises occupied by the Museum at Wollongong Street, Fyshwick. This is at best a temporary solution and will be used immediately for the storage of the large Aboriginal Arts Board collection. </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. The failure of this Government to provide any serious backing to this is a disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> When it was introduced in 1947, the Social Security Act 1947 (the Act) brought together separate legislation dealing with age, invalid and widows' pensions, maternity allowances, child endowment and unemployment and sickness benefits. Commonwealth legislation in the area of social security dates back to 1908 with the enactment of the Invalid and Old-Age Pensions Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1947 the Act has been subject to over 100 amending Acts. At the outset, the Act depicted a passive payment mechanism, providing benefits in the form of direct cash payments to clients. It has now become more attuned, because of the many recent amendments, to the changing social and economic environment through its development into a more active piece of legislation that targets individuals and families in genuine need while positively encouraging them toward independence of the welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments have involved increasing complexity and diversification within one of the most important pieces of Commonwealth legislation. A large proportion of the Australian population is affected by the Act. The volume of recent amendments, the increased complexity of certain areas of the Act and changes in drafting styles since 1947 are some of the factors that have contributed to reduced comprehensibility of the Act as well as a hodgepodge of styles and presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> A legislation review was instituted by the then Minister for Social Security and carried out by the Department of Social Security with the cooperation of representatives of the welfare sector. This Bill is the result of that process. In February this year copies of an exposure draft of the Bill were released for public comment. Public seminars were held in each capital city to explain the background to the review of the legislation and to examine the structure, format and style of the draft legislation. Those attending were invited to suggest changes or improvements to the exposure draft. The response to these consultations was both constructive and positive. </PARA>
<PARA> The object of this Bill is to overcome the problem of readability by using a clear English drafting style and format. That style and format should make it a more accessible piece of legislation that ordinary Australians can reasonably be expected to understand. In many instances, traditionally used legislative words such as ``notwithstanding'' have been dropped or replaced by non-technical words such as ``despite'' or ``even if''. In some places ``cease'' has been replaced by ``stop'' and ``request'' by ``ask''. These are just a few examples of one aspect of clear English drafting. </PARA>
<PARA> Two main aims have been pursued in redrafting the Social Security Act. The first has been the aim of making each individual provision as simple and easy to read as possible. The second has been the aim of making the arrangement of the provisions in the Act logical and easy to follow. As a result, this Bill contains many new features at both the individual provision level and at the overall organisational level. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 1 of the Bill is of fundamental importance because it provides the basic interpretative tool for the reader. It sets out in one place the definitions of principal terms used in the Bill. Definitions may:</PARA>
<PARA> settle the meaning of a word or phrase that might otherwise be of doubtful meaning;</PARA>
<PARA> extend the ordinary meaning of a word to achieve a broader effect;</PARA>
<PARA> narrow the ordinary meaning of a word to achieve a restrictive effect; or</PARA>
<PARA> allow a shortened reference to a complicated concept or a long name. </PARA>
<PARA> Two innovations of note in the definitional part of Chapter 1 are:</PARA>
<PARA> an index of defined words and phrases; and</PARA>
<PARA> groups of definitions according to subject matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The main advantage of grouping is that it reduces the ambit of the search area for a reader. The index will improve accessibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 1 includes a part concerned with determinations having an interpretative effect. Some definitions in the current Act confer powers. For example, an organisation cannot be a ``benevolent home'' for the purposes of receiving a portion of a social security payment under the Act unless the organisation has been approved as such by the Secretary. The use of definitions in this way is inconsistent with the purpose of definitions and puts the reader to unnecessary trouble. Hence, such provisions, where they remain essential, have been reworked and grouped together in a separate part of the interpretational Chapter. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 2 sets out the modules for each of the 20 types of social security payment. Each payment module is almost totally self-contained so that a reader will find out everything he or she needs to know about a particular pension, benefit or allowance without referring to a multitude of provisions outside that module. Special or less frequently used provisions that affect qualification or payability, such as the effect of compensation payments, are located outside the payment modules for cost and space-efficiency reasons but they are signposted at appropriate points in payment modules. Rate calculators are also located outside the payment modules for similar reasons. The provisions of each payment module deal with matters in a procedural order covering in turn qualification criteria, how to claim, determination of claim, how to assess rate, how payment is made, recipient obligations, continuation, variation and termination of benefit, bereavement payments and fringe benefits provisions. Equivalent provisions to these are currently found scattered throughout the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 3 of the Bill contains general provisions which relate to rates of benefit and to means testing. This Chapter contains the rate calculators for the social security payments covered in Chapter 2. The generic rate calculators are probably the most effective innovation of the rewrite exercise. This is because they have transformed an incomprehensible set of rules into more useful tools that, while still complex, are set out in steps to assist social security clients and their advisers to check rate calculations. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 3 also includes general provisions relating to the ordinary income test, the maintenance income test, the assets test, the effect of the receipt of compensation payments and indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 4 provides for payment of certain pensions outside Australia and sets down the rules regulating the rate payable to people who can take their pensions overseas. The Chapter also covers bilateral social security agreements between Australia and other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 5 consolidates provisions dealing with the identification of debts arising under the Bill and with the recovery, waiver or write-off of those debts. Currently, these provisions are found in different parts of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 6 mirrors Part XIX of the present Act that deals with the review of decisions by:</PARA>
<PARA> officers of the Department of Social Security;</PARA>
<PARA> the Social Security Appeals Tribunal; and</PARA>
<PARA> the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Part XIX was an early piece of clear English legislation to emerge from the legislation review and was introduced into the Social Security Act 1947 by the Social Security (Review of Decisions) Act 1988. Hence, it is one of the few areas of the Bill that did not need substantial revision. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 7 of the Bill sets out the Secretary's responsibilities regarding general administration and information gathering. There is a separate division dealing with confidentiality and the protection and use of personal information. Chapter 7 also provides for the establishment, membership and organisation of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 8 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains notes following some provisions. These are designed to assist readers in locating definitions and other relevant provisions. Examples showing the operation of provisions have been incorporated in the text to explain how some provisions work-especially those involving complex calculations. At the front of the Bill is a ``Reader's Guide'' which explains how the Bill is structured and how it can be used. </PARA>
<PARA> The rewrite of the Act does not involve any major policy initiatives and it does not have any financial impact. The new legislation is intended to reflect existing policy which is, in turn, reflected by the existing legislation. The primary purpose of the rewrite is to overcome readability problems that had developed mainly as a result of the volume of changes made to the current Act since 1947. Another important object of the rewrite is to make the Act easier to change in the future as the need arises. Those purposes would be fulfilled by this Bill. Furthermore, it is expected that this will pave the way for other large pieces of federal legislation to be written or rewritten in a similar clear English style and format. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has already begun working on the clear English rewrite of Part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill does not include any amendments to the Act introduced during these Sittings. These changes will be introduced as amendments in Autumn Sittings next year. A Bill covering the transitional arrangements and consequential amendments will follow this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation working party of the Social Security Advisory Council played a major part in the preparation and discussion of research papers and other less tangible ways in the development of this Bill. The members of the working party, especially its chairman, Professor Terry Carney, deserve special thanks for their enthusiastic and important contributions. That working party did an extraordinary amount of work for very limited compensation-well beyond the call of duty. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of this legislation, we owe a great debt to Monash University and the law school, headed up by Terry Carney and Peter Hanks, who co-authored one of the important texts on social security legislation in Australia. I would like to say also that in the Department of Social Security Michael Sassella and other members of his team in the legislation division of the Department worked very closely with the Parliamentary Counsel and his staff. Again, a great deal of forbearance and patience was necessary on the part of our external advisers. In the Department itself, people can imagine that some of the battles were, if not quite bitter, at times very heated. Those in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel were working with a very different approach. I place on record a tribute to all those people. I think this legislation will, hopefully, be a precedent for rewriting much more Commonwealth legislation in a way that is accessible. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in conclusion that, if there is one Act of a Federal Parliament that ought to belong to the people of Australia, it is the Social Security Act. In this case, this Act is much more the people's Act as a result of these clarifying amendments, albeit on the basis of existing policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee annual report, I congratulate the Committee on its report and the work it does in promoting soil conservation activities across Australia. In recent years we have often heard of several pressing issues in environmental matters which have been competing for the public's attention, including energy, pollution and the greenhouse effect, but soil degradation would be our most basic issue. Often in the media it is forgotten and there do not seem to be many votes in this issue when politicians parade before the public their concerns about the environment. Yet, as I have said, soil degradation would be Australia's number one environmental issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nothing is more important to a nation's environment than its soil and the preservation of the quality of its land. The loss of our thin and fragile soil, the progressive degradation of our land and the expansion of the desert and arid areas of the Australian continent are our number one environmental challenges. Left unmet, the result will be a disaster on a massive scale for Australia. By 1983 about 66 per cent of all our lands were in need of some conservation measures. Significant long term problems have also arisen as a result of the progressive breaking down of the structure of Australian soils. </PARA>
<PARA> Soil conservation is of particular importance not only to the greenies to whom this Government and the media are often pandering, but it is of vital importance to those Australians who often have much more to do with the environment, and that is the man and woman on the land. </PARA>
<PARA> Only in the past few years has soil degradation come a little into focus. This is partly because, during the past few years, Australia has experienced a series of storms, droughts and floods which were directly or indirectly related to the problem. I was very interested to read in our Queensland newspaper, the Courier-Mail, this morning a letter by Mrs Patsy Bell from Boonah telling about how Boonah had recently had eight inches of rain in five hours and, regrettably, much of its topsoil had been washed away. Also, the nation's stocktaking during the Bicentenary brought a reawakening of concern for what has been happening to Australia's land. It is estimated that about half of Australia's rural land requires treatment for land degradation. Human activity has been responsible for about half of that degradation. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is certainly quite lengthy. There is just one thing that I want to talk about in relation to the Landcare program. The report says the objectives of the community Landcare support sub-program are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>- - to increase the development and adoption of sustainable land use practices at a local or district level by assisting with extension, planning, research and training projects by landholder-based community groups, with support from State and local government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>In the South Burnett district where I live, one person who has been active in this field is Kingaroy Anglican priest, Reverend Stuart James. Last year he was named the Landcare individual of the year at an awards ceremony in Brisbane. The Reverend James said, `We pray for our daily bread, but if we don't look after the land our prayers won't be answered. There is no such thing as a free cut lunch'. In other words, he has gone from saving soil to saving souls as far as being a priest is concerned because he was involved in soil conservation in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy at Kingaroy before he retired and became a priest at Wondai. I would like to congratulate Reverend James on achieving this award and on his activities which are recognised throughout my own State of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also the group from Pittsworth on the Darling Downs which took out the community award at the ceremony. This group, which was formed only about 19 months ago, has 90 members and is actively encouraging land restoration through seminars, field days and farm walks, while Winton graziers Charlie and Ann Phillott are Queensland nominees for the national Landcare producer award. I want to say congratulations to these people who have really done so well in looking after the land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments on one particular aspect of the annual report of the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee and, that is, the allocation of funding to the Northern Territory. It is interesting to note also that the national soil conservation program received an allocation of $23.184m in 1989-90 which, the report says, brings the total level of funding since the program's introduction in 1983 to $54.97m. It is quite obvious to me, using a little quick arithmetic, that from 1983 to 1989, $31.786m was spent on national soil conservation, but for the year 1989-90 almost $23.2m was spent. So there was quite a significant increase in that program's funding last year which, I think, shows that the Government is, at last, realising the importance of this national problem and, as my colleague Senator Bjelke-Petersen said, how serious it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to point out a concern I have. The Select Committee on Animal Welfare held hearings in the Northern Territory and I know that money has been set aside for the programs up there; in particular, a total of $38,000 for land conservation at the Victoria River Downs range. I believe most of that problem would have been caused by feral donkeys of which there are some 66,000 roaming that area. </PARA>

<PARA> Soil conservation is a national problem. In that particular part of Australia-the Northern Territory-one of the things that is putting great pressure on the fragile soil is the vast number of feral animals which are ranging the Top End. They are many and varied from buffaloes to pigs, goats, horses, one-humped camels and Bali cattle. As I said, feral pigs and cats between them are causing severe problems not just to the soil, I might add, but to the native animals that already exist there. </PARA>
<PARA> It was quite a shock to us to note that in the Top End there were something like 283,000 buffalo prior to 1985. The mess they made was something else. There was a total of 83,000 donkeys; 200,000 wild horses; something like 20 million rabbits-one can imagine the soil conservation problems they were causing; 25,000 camels; and 1.7 million cattle. </PARA>
<PARA> The fragile environment in northern Australia is certainly under pressure from the soil conservation point of view particularly, as I said earlier, from feral animals. Those feral animals, at the same time, have caused some 50 species of native animals to become extinct and I think that in itself is a tragedy. Animals and mammals like the lesser bilby, the central hare-wallaby, the short-tailed hopping mouse and the crescent nailtail wallaby have all become extinct in the period of time that these feral animals have been roaming the Top End. I fully support the Government's feral animal control in the Top End and I congratulate it, although it has acted a bit too late, on increasing the funding for soil conservation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the report of the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee to the Senate, but there are just a couple of points that I would like to take up in it. The establishment of the national soil conservation program fund is referred to in the report as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Act establishes a trust fund from which payments for projects, other than State and Commonwealth projects, are made. Provision is also made for bequests or gifts to the National Soil Conservation Program to be paid into this trust fund. </PARA>
<PARA>I just hope that money is forthcoming for the national soil conservation program and for soil conservation generally around Australia. I believe that soil is a very easily erodable and degradable resource and, whilst maintaining and achieving the maximum return for it in our lifetime, we must improve and protect it for future generations. That was a saying of George Knowles, who was the soil conservation commissioner in New South Wales many years ago. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know he was a great New South Wales soil conservationist and we appreciated what he did in New South Wales. I notice, also, the aims and objectives of the national soil conservation program. The program has five major goals. One of those is that all lands in Australia be used within their capability. I make the point to the Senate that the pressure that is being put on land resources in Australia at the moment because of the policies of this Government, because of the high interest rates, because of the fact that the land-holder is really having to work his land to the nth degree to try to get just a living out of it, will cause big problems for soil conservation and for the degradation of land in the future. It is something that the Government has to take in hand, and realise that more money will have to be forthcoming to allow people not to mine their country. That will have to happen soon because of the downturn in prices and the input costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another point in the report that I would like to take up relates to the general principles of the structure of the national soil conservation program which are to encourage self-help by locally-based community landcare groups. There are a few problems associated with the money getting through to the soil conservation programs in the States. The money is not flowing as quickly as it should. There is a problem in that sometimes plans are put in for landcare group programs and there is a delay between the State reviewing the program and approval by the Federal Government. I hope that Senator Bolkus, the Minister at the table, takes that back to the Minister responsible and tells him that there is a big problem at the moment. What happens if the money does not get through? If enthusiasm for the program is not kept going, there will be a loss of eagerness and gradually people will drift away. That is something that I have been talking about for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to tell the Senate of the horrific problems associated with heavy rains in the north in the last little while. There were seven inches of rain in one area: the Berambil, Big Jacks Creek, Millers Creek, Yarrambar Creek and Warrah Creek catchments, which all converge onto Pine Ridge on the Liverpool Plains. That is one of the richest areas in Australia as far as soil is concerned. I recently toured that area and, if money is not forthcoming and this Government does not realise that it must look at these bigger projects, bigger catchment groups-by the way, New South Wales has led the way in total catchment management-we will lose some of our beautiful resources. When representatives from areas such as that come to the Government asking for big national soil conservation programs to be put into those areas, this Government should take on hand what is being put to it, look sympathetically at those people and look to the future of Australia by making sure those areas are protected for future generations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the annual report of the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee on the national soil conservation program, I must say, first of all, that I am pleased to see the progress that has been made. I also make a couple of brief comments about Western Australia where 75 per cent of all agricultural areas and about 80 per cent of pastoral areas are now covered by landcare districts. This constitutes about 75 per cent to 80 per cent of all the landcare districts in Australia. I am particularly pleased to see Senator Panizza sitting here. His district was the third one established in Western Australia. That is where it all began.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but you were a bit slower than the rest of us. I want to talk about a couple of things in the broader context. The first is that, with the downturn in the wheat industry, and the wool industry in particular, which are the two big land users in Australia, both agricultural and pastoral-I hope that Senator Bolkus, the Minister at the table, is listening to what I have to say-at this stage it is very important that the national soil conservation program be resourced properly and the funding be used very carefully. With the downturn in income, the resources available to individual farmers will be eroded significantly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the Minister's attention to the fact-and I raised this matter in Estimates-that we still do not have in place an effective mechanism for approving farm plans. One of the contingencies of qualifying for the assistance given in the last Budget was that there had to be an approved farm plan. Until that mechanism is put in place, those farmers who involve themselves will not have the incentives to assist them in putting the program in place. In addition to raising this matter in Estimates I have raised it with Minister Kerin and Senator Cook, as the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of paramount importance that the issue be addressed. It is an indictment of the Government that this situation has continued since the August Budget last year and we still have not had an answer. I re-emphasise the importance of the total funding structure and the mechanisms that are available being used with the utmost efficiency. The resources in farmers' hands are very limited at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that I draw to the attention of the Minister-I hope that he takes it back to his colleagues who are responsible-is the situation with the landcare program and the national soil conservation program. Quite clearly, now that the political advantages from having a landcare program have gone, it is time to unite these two programs. If we examine the two reports which I have here, we find that the function of the landcare program last year was virtually to transfer $23.4m to the national soil conservation program. If ever we had an instance of duplication of two programs, this is it. There are two boards, two infrastructures and two bureaucracies behind these programs. There is no need whatsoever to continue with the wastage that occurs in the administrative side of these two programs. I am not decrying the programs; I am just saying that it is time to think about utilising them better, getting the resources out into the field where they will be more effective and not tying them into two programs. There is little point in continuing one government landcare program whose function it is to transfer funds to another program. </PARA>
<PARA> In the remaining few seconds available to me, I draw the Senate's attention to one point concerning the national soil conservation program. It is very pleasing to see that soil structure decline, invasion of productive land by native woody shrubs and water repellency are being looked at. These three things are not obvious in terms of soil conservation yet they are problems. They are very important in terms of the impact of wind erosion. It is very important to broaden our horizons when looking at these problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The intriguing thing about the annual report of the Canberra Institute of the Arts is that it is the annual report for 1988 and we are dealing with it in 1991. I concede that it came forward towards the end of last year but it is not a terribly zappy way of reporting to the Parliament. The body no longer exists. This does indicate some of the problems that this Government is having with its arts bodies. The supreme arts body is the Australia Council, which is in charge of spending the largest amount of money that the Government invests in the arts. I must say that generally I believe it is a sound investment. My criticisms are only at the margin, although there are some pretty substantial margins. I do have some criticism about the way it is managed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When looking at the management of the arts and, hopefully, early and sound reporting of the management of the arts, it is important to note that there is a chairman of the reporting body. I remind the Senate that there is still no chairman of the Australia Council, as I mentioned the other day in the Senate. I have been assured by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) that an appointment will be made shortly. In fact, today's Australian reveals that that person is to be Rodney Hall. This follows the rejection of the job by Miss Noni Hazelhurst when she was told that she could not have an extra $80,000 a year on top of what Professor Donald Horne had received. </PARA>
<PARA> That raises some interesting points. Apart from the fact that it is quite clear that Mr Rodney Hall will be only the second choice, this job has been hawked around considerably for some time. The ill feeling that has developed is evident from a letter that Professor Horne wrote to Miss Hazelhurst when he became aware that Noni Hazelhurst had asked for this extra money to lift her salary from that which Professor Horne was paid of $21,000 for working one day a week to $100,000 for a full time position. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``I wonder if anyone informed you of the possible consequences of the chairman becoming full-time earning $100,000 a year?'' he wrote in his December 21 letter, the day after Ms Hazelhurst issued her public statement. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The difference between that and the $21,000 I received is the equivalent of two positions on the Australia Council staff. </PARA>
<PARA> ``In other words, in a staff already debilitated by economies, there would have to be a further reduction of two places. </PARA>
<PARA> ``In addition to this I should imagine that, due to your lack of administrative experience, you would have required one or perhaps two staff to assist you. So that means a total reduction in staff of three or four people. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I was also wondering whether you had been counselled as to possible reactions from the public if you had been appointed as a full-time chairman . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> ``It would have been, to my mind, an extraordinary misallocation of scarce resources to have both a chairman on $100,000 and a general manager on $100,000.''</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Professor Horne apparently wrote to Ms Hazelhurst. According to the media reports Mr Hall is prepared to take that post on a part time basis but we do not know whether he will get $21,000, as Professor Horne got, or something in between that figure and the $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened to the Australia Council clearly shows a lack of real concern by the Government for the Council and for the arts in general. Its delay in getting around to appointing a chairman-the second, third, fourth, fifth or sixth choice; who knows-is far worse than the delay of the Canberra Institute of the Arts producing its annual report for 1988. Both indicate a pretty poor approach to the requirement, first, to report and, secondly, to the bodies that they represent. I only hope that Mr Hall gets better support as chairman of the Australia Council than the position received from this Government in its failure to appoint a chairman for so long after it was evident that Professor Horne was retiring. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few comments about the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal report entitled TV Violence in Australia. This subject has had wide community concern. It is encouraging to note that the interest of the public in the inquiry was overwhelming, with 1,114 individuals and organisations making submissions. This only emphasises the degree of concern about the issue in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Next to the family, television is probably the most important influence on child development in our society. Indeed, these days when children watch so much television, we might say it has even more influence, and I do not know whether it is always for the good. Children view an average of three to five hours of television daily. By the time they graduate from high school, the average adolescent will have spent more time in front of the television than in the classroom. The popularity of television is easy to understand. It informs us, it entertains us and it can keep us company. Television, to use its own cliche, brings the world into our living rooms. People can now have the opportunity to watch the Senate and the House of Representatives on television. I do not know quite how many people watch it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sometimes it is, but I want to deal with the effects on children of extensive television exposure. That should concern us. Television viewing may be linked with: violent or aggressive behaviour; obesity, because some people eat while they sit and watch television by the hour; poor academic performance; active sexual behaviour; and the use of drugs or alcohol. I know that such programs have such a critical influence that the Chairman in the preface wrote that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The evidence which emerged provides compelling reasons for considering the recommendations in relation to other areas of the media: for example, Pay Television, if and when it begins in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus it is essential that television be used as a positive, creative force and to avoid its negative influences. Until now television stations have been feeding the Australian community a steady and constant diet of violence and tasteless entertainment. This is not only in their normal programming but also in their so-called news and current affairs programs. When watching the night-time news, especially since the Gulf war started, we certainly get plenty of stories about violence. I am sure that this would play upon the minds of children watching these programs. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that by current standards an average viewer will see some 45,000 murders or attempted murders on television by the age of 21 years. This standard diet of violence is not only de-sensitising the community and young people in particular to violence but also encouraging an acceptance of violence as a norm of behaviour. Indeed, I sometimes wonder whether that is the reason why violent crimes seem to be increasing. I could talk about many of the programs on television in which violence takes place and which seem to be typical of this. </PARA>
<PARA> The standard of television stations should improve. Perhaps following aggregation, people in rural outback areas will have more choice of programs and will be able to turn to something else. I have always believed that parents have a great responsibility when their children watch television. These days many parents can never say no to their children. They never say, `That is not suitable. Turn it off'. I often feel rather sad about this. The report maintains that the best response to the acknowledged community concern about violence on television is by way of supervised self-regulation by television licensees. In the preface the Chairman wrote that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . until the release of our research and the conduct of public conferences, the commercial television industry had not fully addressed or even accepted that the public was concerned by the portrayal of violence on television. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Robert Ray is here. I refer to a strict undertaking given to me by Mr Duffy, the then Minister, and by Mr Hawke. I am waiting for that undertaking to be honoured. In fact, I assume that it will be honoured after the current review has taken place and that the undertakings given will find expression in the amendments to the Broadcasting legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I am ruled out of order, I relate what I have said to the report entitled TV Violence in Australia. One of the problems with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is that it does not have a statutory obligation to consult, other than with licensees. In this exercise clearly it did consult, and consulted broadly. The submission received showed the extent of concern in the community about the level of violent programs on Australian television. It must be recognised that broadcasting and television help to shape personal values and mass culture. </PARA>
<PARA> This report urges that action be taken to lessen the level of violence that is currently on television. But I think the recommendation that there be a self-regulatory code is inadequate. There are several problems with that. One is how the code is to be established. There are certain recommendations about that-about the Minister being involved; about the industry being involved; about the Tribunal being involved; and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I might point out that under the existing legislation there is provision which envisages the exclusion of programs which are blasphemous, indecent or obscene. From memory, I think this comes under section 119. It is important to remember that section when establishing the code. The undertaking given to me included an acceptance that there was a need to establish and maintain program standards relating to violence, sex and drugs, which appropriately reflected the community's standards for television. I am not talking about theatre; I am talking about television. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point was that the Tribunal should have greater powers to take disciplinary action in between hearings of licence renewals. At present, the Tribunal can exercise either a feather duster power or the sledge hammer power-the denial of license renewal. In some circumstances the latter punishment is too severe and the former too light. There should be something in between. This was a subject for consideration and agreement at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter concerns the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). I am talking about something that happened some four years ago-I cannot remember the actual date but I will get it for the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), if he wants it. Even then it was agreed that the ABC was a law unto itself in respect of program standards and, of course, some other arenas as well. It was considered that there ought to be some independent body to which complaints should be made about the program standards of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought it might be appropriate to remind the Minister and the Government of these things. Mr Duffy knows what I am talking about and so does the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the second annual report of the Privacy Commissioner on the operation of the Privacy Act. It is of concern to me that no senator has spoken to date in the chamber on this report. I do not want the opportunity to pass without raising issues that the Privacy Commissioner addressed in his report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1989 the Privacy Commissioner claimed that increased delegation, multiskilling and computers meant that the possibility for corruption-that is, for the providing of private information about citizens to other organisations such as banks and financial institutions-was increasing. He also claimed that it was incumbent upon departments to implement monitoring and security practices to minimise the likely occurrence of the problem and to ascertain how it occurred when it does occur. He also claimed that the receivers and those who benefit from this information must also be deterred. He said that to meet these ends the criminal law should be changed so that parties to this information, including the principals, could be effectively prosecuted. </PARA>
<PARA> He suggested too that the Privacy Act be amended so that he could investigate such occurrences and impose damages on procurers of such information. Having looked at what the Privacy Commissioner has said in the previous annual report, I was concerned to find on page 14 that he refers to the problem of corrupt disclosure, and says:</PARA>
<PARA>Last year's annual report referred to the problem of corrupt disclosure by officers of Commonwealth agencies; and noted that an agency may have done all it could to avert breach of security by an employee, only to find that information has been released to outsiders for a price. There were press reports in the early part of 1989 (which have continued during this year) referring to the activities of private investigators, who pay for information held in government agencies. It was recommended in the Privacy Commissioner's last annual report that the Government should consider amending:</PARA>
<PARA>1. If necessary, the criminal law, to enable those that are parties to these transactions to be prosecuted and possibly to place some direct liability on the principals. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The Privacy Act, to allow the Privacy Commissioner to investigate the entire circumstances in which these events occur. </PARA>
<PARA>3. The Privacy Act, so as to impose on those that procure the improper disclosure of personal information liability in damages. </PARA>
<PARA>He is repeating the same things that he said in 1989. The Privacy Commissioner continues:</PARA>
<PARA> No action has yet been taken on proposals 2 and 3. As to proposal 1, there has been a limited but important response. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Act has been amended to incorporate a new offence provision which makes it an offence for a person either directly or through an agent or employee, to solicit, receive, use or disclose information concerning a client without lawful excuse or authority.

<PARA> As requested by your office, we are now enclosing particulars of inquiries and searches we are currently using in an effort to locate missing persons. We hope we may be of assistance to you in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>We find that we can have a check done, a search of motor transport records. It is $8 for New South Wales searches and between $20 and $40 for interstate checks. A search of the social security records will ascertain whether the debtor is receiving a pension or unemployment benefits. It will give the latest address on record and the date of last payment. This can be carried out in all States for $20. For another $20 one can get a search of Medicare records or a search of Immigration Department records or ascertain whether the debtor has left the country. The records show the flight number and date of departure. They also show whether the debtor has arrived in the country and give the flight number and date of arrival. This search does not give a destination. Bits of information are not given. </PARA>
<PARA> A full check of some of these items would be $30. There are phone checks, post box checks, criminal history checks and all sorts of other services. It is claimed that there are 44 agents Australia-wide. It ought to be of great concern to honourable senators in this chamber that that practice still continues. The Privacy Commissioner addressed this issue last year and is readdressing it this year. In his report, he states:</PARA>
<PARA>As the Privacy Act stands at present, personal information held by a Commonwealth agency can be corruptly disclosed by a Commonwealth officer to an outsider, and nothing can be done about it under the Privacy Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He says that remedies should be taken to ensure this is not so and that he has some power or that other measures are taken. I put on notice that I will be moving a motion at a later date that the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs addresses the issues that the Privacy Commissioner raises. Obviously, if the Government is not going to raise these matters, a Senate committee ought to do so. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that the Fishing Industry Research and Development Council (FIRDC), which operates under the Fishing Industry Research and Development Act, first met in October 1988. This annual report is the first full year of operation of the Council, so we are dealing with the early stages of development of this particular body and its research. In the Executive Summary, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Council has the responsibility to fund research and development (R&amp; ) in Australia for the benefit of the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA>It further defines its function during the year as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the development of two important proactive projects: A national seafood consumption study and a compilation of available national fisheries statistics. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Council's objectives it states:</PARA>
<PARA>In broad terms Council's objective is to fund research and development (R &amp;D) which will improve the economic position of the fishing industry consistent with the general needs of the community-</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the following point-</PARA>
<PARA>and within the limits of sustainable economic production. </PARA>
<PARA>One could not agree more with that. It is a very desirable aim. I return to the theme which I was dealing with in an earlier paper this afternoon: the destruction of over half of the mangrove areas around Port Adelaide and the imminent imposition on that area of the multifunction polis (MFP) which will effectively prevent any reconstruction of those mangrove areas and over the next 40 to 50 years will progressively mean the loss of the remaining half of the mangroves. </PARA>
<PARA> As sea levels rise, the area subsides. It has been established that the area is subsiding at about one to two millimetres a year, and that additionally leads to the drowning of the mangroves in the aquatic reserve areas around Barker Reach. Under the Council's objectives, the report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>conserve existing viable fisheries, in particular where species are vulnerable or habitats are under threat;</PARA>
<PARA>I simply point yet again to the way in which this Government, and specifically Senator Button-he is hell bent on imposing this MFP on the Port Adelaide region-and his Australian Labor Party colleague, Mr Bannon, the Premier of South Australia, are proceeding to impose a major habitat destruction on Port Adelaide which will result in the loss of both commercial and recreational fishing at Port Adelaide. </PARA>

<PARA> Inquiries as to the cause of that reveal that there is no viral cause, no bacterial cause and no pollutional cause; but the waters in St Vincent's Gulf at that depth are the warmest that they have ever been. The implication quite clearly is that this may-although there is no proof of it-be an early effect of greenhouse warming. Adelaide has certainly had some very high temperatures during this summer. So, we have imposed this environmentally destructive MFP project on an area which is already under severe threat. I note, therefore, that in the amount of money which this--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion to take note of the document. In glancing at the document, with its list of statistics, it is impressive. However, the figures that are presented in this report really are not surprising. In fact, the 1993 allocations essentially represent a continuation of the 1992 allocations. There are the normal adjustments for inflation and some programs shift ground a little, such as the Aboriginal initiatives program, which is now incorporated in the base operating grant. The rolling triennium does give institutions some financial security. But when we look at the entire document, all it does is demonstrate that policy changes are needed and that the allocations in the current triennium will require substantial supplementation to avert what will be a disaster in Australia's higher education system unless something is done about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are, and there have been for some time, considerable and growing resource demands in higher education; to ignore those would be a crime. A report which should be read in conjunction with this Department of Employment, Education and Training higher education funding report is the recently released Blandy report on the academic labour market. It confirms the worst predictions of a crisis in academic staff shortages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Blandy report was commissioned by the Federal Government. It predicts a national shortage of up to 19,000 academic staff by the end of the decade. We must read the Blandy report in conjunction with this report; this report really cannot stand alone. It does not make sense unless we take that into account. As soon as we take that into account, what is needed is greater contribution from the Government towards the funding for higher education. The Blandy report also finds that poor academic salaries and conditions are in fact a major cause of the failure to attract suitably qualified academic staff, in Australia and from overseas. It foresees an inevitable decline in teaching and research standards. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we have a huge unmet demand for tertiary places. That demand continues to outstrip the student load. This report, which we wish the Senate to take note of, gives insufficient attention to those findings. Action must be taken immediately to encourage students to attain higher education degrees to make that academic career more attractive. Of course, the tertiary fees that are applic- able at the moment do not do a thing to make that academic career more attractive. The higher education contribution scheme really is working against the solutions which are suggested for higher education staffing. </PARA>
<PARA> As a first step, we could extend the exemption to the higher education contribution scheme to everybody doing masters degrees, PhDs, or higher degrees of any description, especially including those who are involved in part time studies. They should not be penalised for having a part time job while they are doing it. Unless we take the projected acute shortage of academics seriously, we really cannot make any sense of this now often dismissed description of the `clever country' phrase. It is mere rhetoric. To encourage postgraduate studies really requires a commitment beyond producing the report that has the statistics but not the answers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the cutting edge of the Government's failure in economic policy are the young people of Australia. The Senate is well aware of the cruel statistics of unemployment among young Australians. I want to dramatise today not the facts that the Senate is aware of but some hidden facts about unemployment of young Australians that show an even more severe and depressing consequence of this Government's incompetence than the raw statistics show. The raw statistics are bad enough. For January, for example, they showed something like a 25.8 per cent unemployment rate among young people aged between 15 and 19 years. That compares with the January 1982 figure of 21.3 per cent. It also compares with the 25.9 per cent figure for December 1990. As the Senate is well aware, that was something like the worst December figure for seven years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation is far worse than that. The situation is being hidden by Government spending on arrangements that massively reduce the number of young people coming onto the job market. We would have no complaint with that if the money were being spent on improving the prospects of young people in getting jobs. I believe that there is some question over the extent to which the device the Government is using, which is Austudy, is in fact providing to a large degree any increase in the ability of the young people returning to school only as a result of Austudy to better their way of life and to get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us face it-this Government is spending an amount well over $300m on secondary school Austudy, which is benefiting something like 160,000 to 170,000 young Australians. They are basically the people who may well have left school had there not been Austudy for secondary students and have come flooding on to the job market, the way so many have, thus worsening the situation and simply not being able to get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that in my area of Illawarra, for example, the unemployment rate among young people aged under 20 and looking for full time work is 36 to 37 per cent. It is interesting to see what the consequences for these unemployment rates are of the Government's extension of Austudy a few years ago to secondary students. I quote from the Budget Papers:</PARA>
<PARA> AUSTUDY is available, subject to certain academic criteria, to full-time secondary and tertiary students aged 16 years and over undertaking either an approved secondary or accredited tertiary course . . . Assistance is targeted to low income groups through income and assets tests applying to the student and, for dependent students, to parents as well. </PARA>
<PARA>As I mentioned, the 1990 projected figure for those who will be receiving this benefit is 164,000. This benefit, by the way, was not available in the last recession, in 1982-83. There is no doubt that the groups being funded-the targeted area is low income groups-would be more prone to unemployment than those in higher income groups who do not receive the benefit of Austudy. So there is no doubt that Austudy itself is diminishing the number of people coming onto the job market-that is, secondary school Austudy-and in particular diminishing the number of people coming on to the job market who would probably have a worse chance of getting a job than the average of those who have failed to get jobs. Even if we adopt the average figure of about one in four-that is, that one in four of Australians coming onto the job market cannot get full time jobs-if we applied that to the 164,000 young people receiving Austudy in secondary schools, we would get an increase of something like 41,000 in the number of young Australians unemployed. When we look at the December figure, which was 138,700 young Australians unemployed, we should probably add 41,000 or so to that to get up to around 180,000 young Australians who are in fact unemployed even though 41,000 of them have decided to go back to school because there is no point in their trying to get work. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is, of course, that something like 80,000 of those people getting Austudy would have had difficulty finding jobs and as a result are going back to school. In other words, the hidden level of unemployment that has emerged from the Government's extension of Austudy into secondary education pushes the figures for those young people who are seeking jobs, or would want jobs if they were available, to well over the recession figures of 1982-83. Honourable senators will remember that that recession was drought induced-the worst drought for 50 years in Australia-backed by deteriorating world economic conditions. This recession is one that the Treasurer says we had to have, that he engineered and has nothing to do, basically, with the world economy. So these figures dramatise the serious problem of hidden unemployment, making the position even worse than the horrendous figures for youth unemployment that are coming out now from the Australian Statistician. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is even further evidenced by the fact that young people are staying on at school because they cannot get jobs. This has meant a substantial increase, almost a doubling in fact, of the retention rates in secondary schools from something like a third of those entering school to about two-thirds. As I say, to the extent that improves their training, their background and their capacity to earn, obviously there is a net benefit. But I wonder whether in fact this is really taking place in all instances or whether to some extent Austudy has to turned the schools into a young Australians' minding operation to keep young Australians out of a super-saturated job market where they could not get jobs. Something like 36 per cent-a little over one third-of secondary students aged 16 and over are being assisted by Austudy this year. That accounts for the doubling of the retention rate in secondary schools-that is, if all those people had not been prepared to continue at school without Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have here, I believe, a tragic situation which looks as though it can only get worse, with about 200,000 or maybe more young Australians out of work and not likely to get work. Let us recognise that these figures of genuine unemployment are being hidden at massive cost to the Australian taxpayer. As I said, well over $320m is being spent on secondary Austudy, and on top of that there is the enormous pressure on the State governments to increase the facilities in secondary schools to cope with the enormous increase in retention rates. With hidden unemployment and the facts of unemployment as they are, it reinforces what the Opposition has been saying: that the young people of Australia are at the cutting edge, are the major sufferers from the Keating recession that we had to have. I hope that the young people of Australia recognise that they deserve more in terms of the government they get than the sort of government that the Hawke Administration has given them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the proposition that stands in the name of Senator Short and to defend the Government's record and its policy prescription. In joining a debate it is always instructive for any speaker to look initially very carefully at the proposal that has been outlined. I find the proposal that originates with the Opposition very disappointing in the four points it seeks to make because it is an extraordinarily negative document. The four-point proposition is critical of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and then moves on to condemn the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final point urges the Government to pursue policies advocated for so long by the coalition to restore sustainable private sector growth and employment. But where is the policy prescription? Where is the positive agenda? There is not one word specified below the policy initiative in the document. There is not one word by way of the outlining of an alternative policy mix. It indicates quite simply and beyond doubt that the long period of opposition has engendered sterility. Just prior to coming into the chamber I was talking with Mr Fred Daly in Senator Jones's office. Mr Daly made the point when he looked at this proposition from the Opposition that it was reminiscent of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in the 1950s, when something was put on paper just to be put on paper. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only one advantage in the proposal that we are debating this afternoon. The sole element is that it does enable the Senate to choose between two alternatives: the Labor Government that is endeavouring to come to grips with problems in a policy framework that has an agenda, and an Opposition that simply runs slogans. For too long the Labor Party in its long period of opposition did that, not only to our cost but also to the cost of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does lack a coherent response. I listened to almost all the debate a week or so ago when the motion first came before the Senate. I waited to hear a single Opposition initiative by way of breaking ground on policy, but not one was put forward by any of the Opposition speakers. This does suggest that the Opposition simply cannot construct a policy mix beyond running off some 17-second television grabs. </PARA>
<PARA> For a start, there is no evidence of a wages policy anywhere, and no initiatives in fiscal policy beyond a slogan, `We will slash $3 billion off current expenditures'. The Opposition has to come close to political lunacy to pursue that in a time of current recession. Slashing $3 billion off Federal expenditures, as every senator knows, would simply mean greater contraction and greater hardship, particularly amongst working men and women and their families. It would also mean a considerably greater number of jobless and a total elimination of confidence. And, of course, those cuts in expenditure, given the measures that have been adopted by the Labor Government over the last seven years to eliminate waste, would be concentrated in the areas of social security, health and education. That cannot be an excuse for a policy. It is little bit like the old song about Quinn the Eskimo. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has had a phenomenal record in terms of employment growth, which is first class by comparison with any other country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). But that is not to say that the most recent unemployment figures are troubling. There is no question about that. That has to be said immediately. We have the highest employment, in fact, since the coalition was in power. But we might pause momentarily to look at the circumstances when the coalition was in power and when there was a conservative majority not only in the House of Representatives but also in this chamber until the middle of 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition engendered double digit achievements in both unemployment and inflation. Many policy changes have had to be introduced since that time during the life of this Government. Many of the policy changes have been introduced after careful negotiation with the Australian community as represented by interest groups, and opinion has been carried across the board. Senator Cook repeatedly makes that valid point in this chamber in terms of dealing with industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> We should compare and contrast the policy changes of this Government with the slogans that we hear from the other side of the chamber. For example, we continually hear that Australia needs reform in transport and telecommunications. Senator Knowles specialises in this kind of sloganeering. But how? Where are the hard decisions going to be made that have not yet been taken? Where are the difficult decisions going to be taken? What is being proposed by the Liberal and National parties? What is the coalition's agenda? We also hear repeatedly that we must have a simpler tax system. How? What less tax is going to be raised?</PARA>

There is no agenda beyond that. </PARA>

<PARA> In terms of reform of government operations, what are we dealing with by way of a coalition alternative? We are told to `shake up GBEs' but, again, there is no detail at all. I heard Opposition senators talking about reform of the immigration program but not once was there an indication of changes to be made, of a new direction or of policy initiatives. Indeed, there was no suggestion of which categories of potential immigrants would be placed under greater scrutiny. We have got to remember that over one million people apply to come to Australia every year but less than 10 per cent are accepted. So if there are going to be changes, as the coalition appears to be demanding, where would the greater scrutiny be placed and where would the liberalisation occur? Where would the tightening occur? There is no policy again; a total intellectual void. We have in this debate a string of cliches from the Opposition tending to be delivered these days by professionals. </PARA>
<PARA> We also hear endlessly from the Opposition about what needs to be done with Qantas. People are calling for 100 per cent sale. The Government has opted, sensibly in my view, for a sale of up to 49 per cent of equity. If the Qantas issue was so pressing during the period 1975 through to 1983, why on earth did the Fraser government not act then? Let me remind everybody that Malcolm Fraser was a Prime Minister in the style of Billy Hughes. When Mr Fraser put pen to paper the law of the Commonwealth of Australia could be written because he had a comfortable majority in both Houses. Why on earth was no action taken at the time?</PARA>
<PARA> We hear that the accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions should be scrapped and this, apparently, passes for policy from those opposite. But replace it with what-the record of 1982 when we had stagflation where interest rates were rising; where there was the remains of a wages explosion; where inflation was up; where unemployment was up; and where the only elements in Australian economic indicators that were receding were business and consumer confidence, and both of those elements approaching bedrock?</PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague Senator Maguire made clear last week in an excellent contribution to this debate, the consumption tax is perhaps the greatest nonsense that we have seen from the other side in very recent times, because a consumption tax would be both discriminatory and regressive. Since the period of 1985 and the National Tax Summit, the Labor Government has systematically and comprehensively reformed Australian taxation rules. The record speaks for itself in terms of not only making the taxation laws better and fairer but also introducing equity in the methods of collection. Overall income tax scales have been reduced and there is no question about that. </PARA>

He cannot get around the undeniable fact that income tax scales are down, corporate tax scales are down and there is more efficient collection of taxes which, for the first time in the country's history, is based on a system of honour. Most of the rorts over which the Fraser government presided like Pontius Pilate have been eliminated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Capital gains tax has been introduced, fringe benefits taxes have been introduced, and the bottom of the harbour scheme has disappeared. And in response to that record of achievement we have the nonsense of a consumption tax. I am always staggered by the fact that the conservative parties in Australia trumpet ideological obsessions. Fundamentally, those obsessions are unfair and regressive. Not only are those obsessions trumpeted; they are embraced, highlighted and illustrated by the Liberal and National parties. Those are options that we on the Government side reject outright, just as the Australian people will reject the coalition on the next occasion as they have on the previous four occasions. </PARA>

For the first time in the current political circumstance and in current political debate, we have condensed what the Opposition manifesto actually has come to be. The subject of vouchers was raised by the Australian Democrats earlier. That is a nonsense which clearly has not been thought through. It is inapplic- able in an Australian context. We will see that rejected in a very short while, just as we saw floated ideas quickly disappear when Andrew Peacock was the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the current Opposition manifesto, as far as we can tell? We know that the manifesto includes double taxation, with State and Federal income taxes. That has been revived from the Fraser period. We remember that vividly. That is another reason that the conservative parties will be rejected. We know that it includes a consumption tax on all goods. We know that it includes vouchers for health and education and we know, of course, that the absolute chasm in policy is that there is no wages policy existing anywhere within the Opposition at any level. So how on earth would costs be kept under control?</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Cook made clear in the Senate this afternoon in answer to a question that I placed before him, the latest OECD economic outlook for the December quarter in 1990 demonstrates conclusively that Australian unit labour costs in the business sector are well below the OECD average. Some of the information that Senator Cook put to the Senate is worth not only repeating, but emphasising. The Australian estimate is for an increase of 4.4 per cent, against an OECD average of 4.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short will have every opportunity in reply to challenge the facts that Government senators have put before the Senate-including the OECD statistics from which Senator Cook quoted in Question Time earlier this afternoon. Look at the Australian record in terms of an estimate for an increase of 4.4 per cent against the United States figure of 4.9 per cent; against the United Kingdom figure of 8.3 per cent-and its trade union movement has been crushed by anti-union laws; against Italy's figure of 6.3 per cent; and against figures for countries which have, by all accounts, first-class competing economies: Austria at 5 per cent, Finland at 6.9 per cent, and the like. The Australian outlook is very promising and we can afford to take some pride in that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has produced those figures? It is the prices and incomes accord between the Australian Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. There is no wages policy from the Opposition that may stand in competition with that or be contrasted with that record of achievement. Again, we have from the Opposition an absolutely ludicrous notion that we should turn back the clock and move from a 35- or 38-hour working week to a 40-hour working week. Senator Cook or Senator Jones may correct me if I am wrong on this, but this is the first time in Australian history since the period in the 1920s at the onset of the Great Depression that the conservative parties have tried to increase the working week after there have been decisions by the Industrial Relations Commission to grant shorter working weeks; in other words, it has not happened in 50 or 60 years. People claim that this--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Jones" NAMEID="LH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator Jones</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jones is right. It shows how far behind the times the National and Liberal parties are. They are three generations behind the times. I look forward to Senator Crane coming into the debate and defending the lengthening of the working week. We have seen great progress under the prices and incomes accord, not only in containing costs but also in cutting working hours, in guaranteeing real wage increases and in underlining the social wage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is there anything from the Opposition that ought to be highlighted? For the purposes of this debate and for the information of the Australian people, the coalition is proposing two brand new taxes-State income tax and a consumption tax. Education will cease to be a public responsibility-so far as we can tell by an analysis of what has been said by the coalition-being transferred from the Government to individuals. In health, the first result of the coalition's agenda being implemented would be an income blowout for the medical profession, simply letting the medical profession determine what it could charge for services through this nonsensical voucher system. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to my conclusion. Mr Keating described Dr Hewson aptly and accurately as a visiting professor of politics-visiting the issues without saying what the Liberal and National parties really stand for-and all on a pretence of not being a politician, like the rest of us, but being some sort of commentator rather than someone who has clear responsibilities to articulate a policy: a one-dimensional person. We have seen the suggestions of privatisation of social security, the re-establishment of the soup kitchens for people on welfare. That is another nonsense that will be rejected. It is a simple fact of political life that much of the bravado we have heard from the Liberal and National parties of recent times, we heard from the coalition prior to the 1987 and 1990 general elections. It turned out to be bravado only. In 1992-93 the Australian people will reject the Liberal and National parties, as they have on the previous four occasions, for the reasons that Government senators have outlined in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here today debating Senator Short's motion on the recession, a debate which commenced last week. Senator Spindler has already spoken on the motion to put forward the Australian Democrats' view and I want to take the opportunity today to expand on his remarks of last week. The motion notes, first of all, the damning admission on 8 February of policy failure by the Treasurer, Mr Keating, that the Government did not want a recession, it wanted a slow down, and that it is a slow down, not a recession, that Australia requires. The second point of the motion notes the equally stunning admission by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, on the Sunday program on 10 February 1991:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . we obviously got wrong a proposition that said there would not be a recession. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to condemn the Government for the massive hardship that its disastrous miscalculations and mismanagement have wrought on all Australians. Finally, the motion urges the Government to pursue the policies advocated by the coalition, which, it claims, would restore sustainable private sector growth and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats say that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were wrong in their economic policies and their predicted outcomes. As those policies have been expounded and put in place, we have continued for many years to stress our view that they are not the policies for this country. They have caused massive hardship, especially in my State of Victoria. So the Democrats agree with that part of the motion that points this out. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of high interest rates, Australia is in recession, as the Prime Minister admitted. In effect, the Government is trying to buy lower inflation by increasing unemployment. Unemployment has increased by almost 300,000 since October 1989. Yet last week's figure shows that inflation has dropped from 8 per cent to just under 7 per cent. That is not much gain for a great deal of pain. Indeed, since Senator Short gave notice of this motion we have seen the economic indicators get even worse. The horrendous December 1990 inflation figure of 1.9 per cent delivered us an inflation rate of nearly 7 per cent. Retail sales again went down in December by 0.9 per cent. Private new capital expenditure, which is an excellent indicator of whether we will create any new jobs, for the September 1990 quarter was 4 per cent below the September 1989 figure, and this is expected to worsen. </PARA>
<PARA> The really bad news of last week was the January unemployment figures. There are now 767,000 people unemployed-up by more than 60,000 in one month. Even the seasonally adjusted figures show a rise of 27,000 to nearly 720,000 unemployed. This equates to a 9.1 per cent unemployment rate or 8.4 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis. The recession does exist and is getting worse. In recessions the disparities in the distribution of wealth get greater. Unemployment impacts most heavily on lower income occupations and on people on fixed incomes, and then we see the effects in the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important in this climate of increasing unemployment and therefore increasing deprivation to have a look at some of the evidence that is already out there about the way in which many Australians are living-evidence which supports the part of the motion which talks about the consequences, the massive hardship of the disastrous economic policies under which Australians labour. We had a lot of that evidence brought to us in the recent report from the Catholic Bishops' Conference called Common Wealth Common Good resulting from their inquiry into wealth distribution in Australia. That was an inquiry which this Government has not yet been prepared to undertake and which the Australian Democrats continue to believe should be undertaken at Government level. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the evidence from that inquiry has been put into this debate by my colleague Senator Spindler, but it is important to add to that. The Catholic bishops had something to say about financial deregulation, which the Democrats have condemned throughout the life of this Hawke Government. That financial deregulation is supported by the Opposition. I do not think we can ignore the significant direct hardship that this policy has caused many Australians when we are discussing the Government's miscalculations and mismanagement. Financial deregulation by this Government would have to rank as one of the biggest miscalculations of all times. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote from the Bishops' report because it not only succinctly sets out our recent history, but also puts forward a view that is shared by many Australians. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA>Following deregulation of the loans market in Australia, virtually unlimited finance became available to those who were regarded (wrongly in a number of widely publicised cases) as the best credit risks-the wealthy and ambitious entrepreneurs. Some used this opportunity responsibly, but others indulged in socially (and in the end personally) damaging speculation. Those with wealth were in a position to maximise their gains, shielding them from tax with the help of the devices like negative gearing or through the capital gain on their properties. </PARA>
<PARA>Where has this left us? It has left us with real poverty in our midst: the homeless and the increasing numbers of unemployed, the disabled, sole parents and their children, other single income families and members of some Aboriginal and migrant communities. Professor Fred Gruen from the Australian National University estimated that in 1990 between 80,000 and 100,000 Australians live in dire poverty or homelessness. The Bishops' report notes:</PARA>
<PARA>The members of this underclass may not be dying in a famine but the lives of some of them are greatly and sometimes brutally shortened as the outcome of such byproducts of extreme poverty as malnourishment, disease, drug-addiction, violence, crime and a pervading sense of hopelessness. The loss is not only theirs, but the whole society's. </PARA>
<PARA>This does not sound much like the sort of Australia that we should be proud of. I do not think that any of us would want a society-I certainly do not-that tolerates 100,000 of its members living needlessly destitute lives in extreme poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> We see increasing examples of the numbers of young families forced to live in caravan parks increasing because 200,000 Australian households are still on public housing waiting lists. Poverty in rural areas is increasing alarmingly, domestic violence is increasing and in general child poverty still exists at much too high a level. The Burdekin report on youth homelessness estimated that at least 250,000 children are either homeless or at risk of homelessness. All of this is taking place in a climate of very speedily increasing unemployment-unemployment which is part of the program of this Government's economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the people at the bottom of the pile who are being asked to pay. As I have said, in a recession which has been particularly regional in its effect my own State of Victoria has borne the brunt of that policy, in particular because of the simultaneous problems in the State's financial system and the high concentration of manufacturing industry in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> Bankruptcies have skyrocketed, with almost 3,000 occurring in the December quarter. This compares with 1,874 in the previous December quarter-a rise of 56 per cent. Credit growth has collapsed from the speculative binge of the late 1980s level of nearly 20 per cent down to 7 per cent. It appears as though the banks have over-reacted because of their massive bad debts and non-performing loans and are actually rationing credit even though interest rates have dropped considerably. Ordinary Australians are paying for the excesses which were committed by the financial deregulation put in place by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The drops in official interest rates have not been fully passed on to home owners or small businesses. The banks are now operating on historically high margins. We now have evidence of practices far worse than profiteering being undertaken by at least one of the banks, yet the Government will not do anything about it. As the Senate is well aware, my colleague Senator McLean has been trying for years to get an inquiry into the corrupt practices of banks in Australia, and even where clear evidence is available he has been denied the right to bring matters to the notice of the Parliament and thereby to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, bank deregulation has contributed to the severity of the boom and current bust. Venture capital is even more difficult to come by for fledgling businesses than usual. This will be to Australia's long term cost as businesses go offshore for that venture capital. If we cannot rely on the market to come up with the capital that Australia needs, then the Government must intervene to provide or direct that capital to the appropriate sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> All the Government's policy responses have been directed towards reducing the current account deficit. Their lack of success caused the Treasurer last year to say that reducing inflation was the top priority. As I have already outlined, in spite of increasing unemployment and interest rate drops, we have not had a relative reduction in inflation, but a figure of only about one per cent. The only equitable demand management tool is fiscal policy, and that is what the Treasurer should have tightened. The tax system works on the capacity to pay principle and through the tax system paying can be equitably distributed. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst deregulation, privatisation and cutting government expenditure are all discredited policies of the Government, the Opposition's remedies are, unbeliev- able though it may seem, even worse. To inflict Opposition policies-as the last point in the motion before us today asks the Government to do-on a community which is already reeling, as I have demonstrated, from the economic rationalism and deregulation of this Government would be an impossible thing to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the policies that the Opposition has floated since this motion was proposed by Senator Short last week-just in the last week. This is on top of its policy to sell off public assets-assets which are currently owned by all Australians which will be bought, either by the wealthy who are the few at the top of the pyramid in this country, or by overseas interests to further unbalance our economy and put an imposition on future generations. It is also on top of earlier proposals for the privatisation of welfare payments, the abolition of unemployment benefits and so the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Just in the last week, to add to that, we had the resurrection of the proposal for the voucher system for educational services-a relic of the past. A system that would have to, in the end, involve the payment of fees in State schools to have any effect, and would introduce absolutely unacceptable inequity into the education system and lead to an increasing social inequity which could not be contemplated by any society which had any concept at all of social justice, let alone of effective education for all of its citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> A similarly appalling proposal of a voucher system for health services has surfaced since we last debated this motion. That really amounts to a proposal for the destruction of the universal system of Medicare, a system which, we need to remind the Opposition, is supported by over 70 per cent of Australians which, of course, includes at least half of the supporters of the Liberal Party of Australia. It is a proposal which would, as I think Senator Loosley has pointed out, in the first instance, certainly lead to a blow-out in the incomes of medical practitioners; would in no way address any of the real problems of the costs of the provision of health care in this community; and would certainly not be in the interests of the most disadvantaged in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, it is precisely because of the prospect of this type of proposal that my colleague Senator Spindler amended the Medicare Levy Act to ensure that any alterations by any government to the Medicare levy-and, therefore, to the financing of Medicare-cannot be done under the table; they must come before the Parliament. The protection of the balance of power held by the Australian Democrats in this Senate in decades to come will be very important, and is a guarantee to ensure the survival, in the long term, of Medicare, in spite of the ridiculous and inequitable policies that are coming forward from the Opposition. It was precisely because of our fear and belief that such a policy would be promoted by the Opposition that we moved that amendment. Therefore, Medicare remains safe because that amendment was supported by the Government and is now in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Another proposal to have come forward in this past week is to give income taxation powers back to the States-or, rather, should we say, to encourage the States to use the powers of income taxing. It is a proposal that has no community support and makes no economic sense. We have often heard from the Opposition about the need to simplify the tax system and that runs counter to this proposal to increase the complexity of the system and to have State governments raising their own taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably an excuse for it comes from the fact that State governments have a range of responsibilities for the provision of services and, under the Hawke Government, the responsibilities of States and local government have increased as the buck has been passed with regard to them. The problem is that the buck, with regard to the dollars, has not also been passed down the line to the States and to local government. Therefore, there are funding problems. The Opposition proposes what I would call a cop-out system in its proposal for State taxation powers. </PARA>
<PARA> What we must have is a Federal government which is prepared to accept its responsibilities for a socially equitable community, both in the funding and in the distribution of the responsibility for the services that are needed to create such a society; we do not need the cop-out which is represented by the Opposition's proposal this week. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also had the announcement from the Opposition that it would permanently abandon a reserve price scheme for wool. In Australia's very important primary industry export sector, the Opposition this week has announced total abandonment. What the Government has done is bad enough; what the Opposition has proposed is a disaster. It is a very good illustration of the total deregulation, hands off, dog eat dog, level playing field myth that underlies the policies of this Opposition. What a week it has been!</PARA>
<PARA> To this must be added the other policies. The one which I would mention here in particular is the policy of the consumption tax to tax all goods and every service-not to implement just one new tax, but a whole range of taxes on everything that everybody buys. Of course, it will and must impact most heavily on low income earners and people on fixed incomes-people who have no discretion about whether to save or not. They simply have to spend all of their dollars to eat, to clothe themselves and their children and to be housed and educated. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the rationales for this broad-based consumption tax is that it encourages savings. There are people in our community who cannot afford to save and those who can afford to do not. This is not the way to create savings. There is also the previous announcement of an Opposition policy to cut high income earners' income tax even further; a pro- cess which is well and truly under way, of course, under the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The destruction of our manufacturing industry at an even faster rate than the Industry Commission recommends is also Opposition policy; a tariff reduction program not geared to the national interest but based on an ideological, mythical level playing field approach. In addition, the Opposition wants to fuel speculation more by abolishing capital gains tax where an asset is held for more than five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the Opposition's policies, of which these are only a few, are even worse than the Government's, and the Democrats cannot support the final paragraph of the motion before the Senate which exhorts the Government to take up these even more disastrous Opposition policies. That is why Senator Spindler has moved an amendment to the motion to remove paragraph (d). </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Australian Democrats do have policies to address the mess which the Government has created. Many of those policies were demonstrated in our alternative Budget brought forward last August, and many of them were outlined in the earlier contribution to this debate by Senator Spindler. </PARA>
<PARA> They were, in brief, the development of our public infrastructure-not selling it off in the way that the Government and the Opposition want to do; and direct import limitation taxation policies on luxury goods, such as the luxury car tax which this Government has implemented and which has worked successfully. We have campaigned very strongly during the past two Federal elections on import limitation taxation policies. We were pleased to see just one picked up by this Government; it should now do more. </PARA>
<PARA> Anti-dumping provisions must be streamlined to allow quick and effective action to be taken before it is too late, before we destroy our primary industries sector, and in particular our horticultural industry. We should take that action before imported goods reach this country. We should examine import-export matching systems which are similar to the existing export facilitation schemes which currently operate in the motor vehicle industry. We need to reorientate the tax system towards productive enterprises instead of favouring paper shuffling and speculation-which would be even more strongly favoured by the Opposition. We need to lift interest withholding tax rates from the ridiculously low 10 per cent which currently prevails, and there should be accelerated depreciation provisions for major productive investments. </PARA>
<PARA> Those have already been mentioned in this debate and I would like to add a few more urgently needed measures. We must further tighten corporate regulation. Although I acknowledge that the Government has made progress in this area, more needs to be done. Another area critical to Australia's business is our cost of capital. This is one area where we are definitely not internationally competitive. We face interest rates in excess of double those prevalent in the successful Asian and European economies. I hope that the Industry Commission can suggest some effective measures in this area in the reference that it now has before it. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to boost training massively now so that those people who have recently lost their jobs do not become long term unemployed. The Australian Council of Social Service has recently requested at least 20,000 extra training placements to be allocated by the Government in the March statement, which we are all awaiting. Even this is not an optimal solution to the problem. However, as has previously been stated by Senator Spindler on behalf of the Australian Democrats, the most important policy change which must occur is an ideological shift away from deregulation for its own sake. There is a role for government, especially in industrial development. Because of Australia's high capital costs and transport costs arising from its isolation, it needs an interventionist industrial policy. Ken Davidson's article in the Age newspaper last week refers to the success of the Asian economies which involve government planning and assistance, especially in the early stages of the development of industries. Those countries do not suffer from the constant critics claiming that they cannot pick winners. They have created winners on an awesome scale-winners with whom we now need to compete. I also refer colleagues to an article in the Age on 19 February by Tim Colebatch who, as the article states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . travelled to Germany to find out what makes a clever country. He found a wealthy society whose priorities differ greatly from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>While we are talking about picking winners I will quote from that article:</PARA>
<PARA> Like the Cain Government, German state governments pay big subsidies to attract research institutes, and have units promoting technology transfers between researchers and companies. If John Hewson went to the stronghold of German conservatism, Bavaria, and told them governments cannot pick winners, they would laugh at him. Why, they have been picking winners for years. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA> Before the war, Bavaria was the rustic hinterland of the country, where poor Catholic farmers lived amid picturesque hills and run-down textile factories. Now, thanks to aggressive use of taxpayers' funds to pick winners and build up a scientific base, it is the fastest-growing area of Germany, and the centre of its emerging high-tech industries: aerospace, semi-conductors, robotics, fibre optics and biotechnology. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend Tim Colebatch's article to my colleagues. Were they to read it to find that the award rate for a qualified metal tradesman is $32,000 a year, yet most earn more; that workers in German factories are actually missing six weeks of the year because they are on holiday; that they work 38 hours a week, five of them in their traditional lunchtime beer break, and have the shortest working hours in the world; that their governments do pick winners; that they have an industrial relations system in which the interests of labour and capital are seen as complementary-and the list goes on-we might be spared futile debates such as this in which the Opposition deludes itself that it has any answers to the improvement of the economy and, therefore, of society and the lot of individuals in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall conclude with another quote from this article in the hope that Senator Short will listen and perhaps not attempt to refute-in a way in which he probably will-the policies of the Australian Democrats, which accord so closely with all of the points that are made in this article, this analysis, of the very successful German economy. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>If big government is the road to damnation, Germany should be burning in hellfire. Its governments spend almost half the national output. They own business enterprises and shares worth $350 billion. In eight years of conservative government, little has been sold off except Volkswagen. </PARA>
<PARA> But one lesson from Germany is the irrele- vance of our passion for small government and level playing fields. Governments, like companies, can do badly or do well. </PARA>
<PARA>We agree with Senator Short: this Government has done badly. But we do not agree with Senator Short that to take up Opposition policies would be any better for this country. We have a different set of goals, a different view, a more responsible view in terms of government's role in the economy and, therefore, in the interests of our community. We support the first three parts of this motion and, as I said, will move to omit the final clause because we believe that both the Government and the Opposition are on the wrong track. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to Senator Short's motion, I shall keep my comments to about 10 minutes to allow Senator Short to wind up the debate. Before I get onto the points that I wanted to make, I must say that the Australian Democrats never cease to amaze me as they spell out their recipe for solving the Australian problem. One of the unfortunate things about what they spell out is that 99 per cent of it is about stopping or knocking and saying, `This one can't do it or that one can't do it'. The recipe that the Democrats deliver up to us each time is about what they will stop, not what they will do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a couple of things that need to be commented on. It is unfortunate that the wool situation has been brought into this debate, because it is before the Senate now. I doubt whether anybody in this place really believes that the current reserve price scheme for wool is not finished. If there is something we have to do in the future when things settle down and the industry recovers, we will deal with that then on its merits. But it is absolute and total nonsense for us to be in a position, as far as the current situation of the wool industry is concerned, where there is a potential to mislead our customers and to give false hopes to the producers in the bush. The sooner we recognise basic facts in this place, the sooner we can be a little more honest with those people whose livelihoods we are now looking at legislating for. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to make some comments about deregulation. One of the things that needs to be recognised absolutely in terms of the Australian situation is that a decision to go back to a regulated society would mean in effect that we wanted to isolate ourselves from the rest of the world. In terms of deregulation of the financial system, the big mistake that was made--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot can shout all she likes; she has had her turn. The big mistake that was made in deregulating the financial system was that it was done in isolation from manufacturing, wages policy, the waterfront and a number of other areas. It is not practical to have a partly deregulated system. That is the fundamental problem we have now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall just quickly run through some of the key areas on which I wish to comment. Some key words in Senator Short's motion are paramount in respect of Treasurer Keating's failed economic policies-and how they have failed. The national debt is out of control and growing, seven times higher in the life of this Government. The current account is equally out of control and, with the collapse of the wheat and wool industries, can only continue to deteriorate unless the Government changes direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise a couple of matters in principle because they are relevant to the current situation. They can be summed up very simply in three key words: incentive, productivity and reward. None of these three things currently apply in our taxation and industrial systems. Until we correct those simple things-incentive, productivity and reward-there will be no improvement. We will not sustain productivity without reward. The accord has screwed the work force into the ground. It has lowered the standard of living. The accord is a recipe for mediocrity. To get productivity we must revamp the taxation system; it should be overhauled. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make a few comments about a goods and services tax and the way it has been misrepresented by previous speakers in this chamber. They always talk about the benefits to the rich. There are some very important components in the various goods and services taxes and value added taxes around the world. First, there is an overall lowering of direct taxation to everybody, not just the rich. Secondly, there are adequate compensation components to assist the underprivileged. These are key and very important components. I mentioned a substantial lowering of income tax rates. It is very important to reward those who are prepared to put in the effort. </PARA>
<PARA> In moving through the taxation system we must take the burden of indirect taxes off our export industries. The Government talks about a level playing field internationally. I do not disagree with that; in fact, I support it. I also support the Cairns Group very strongly. What about making it a level playing field in Australia? We could do things in Australia to substantially level the playing field. The indirect tax system now penalises our exporters. A classic example is that, since the Hawke Government came into power, fuel excise has increased from 6.155c per litre to 24.9c per litre. Why do we not hear something about that from the Democrats? It is an absolute outrage. This is a penalty, a tax, on distance. </PARA>
<PARA> Our sales tax laws are full of anomalies and holes. One can quote all sorts of examples of how they can be abused and how they favour certain situations. But, in the short time I have left this evening, the classic example I can give is the definition under which one can use a chainsaw in a productivity based capacity. It is very simple. If one buys a chainsaw and nominates that it will be used to build sheep yards for 40 per cent of the time and that it will be used to cut fence posts for 40 per cent of the time, what happens? Because it is not used primarily and principally for one action sales tax is paid. But if two chainsaws are bought and it is nominated that for 60 per cent of the time one will be used to build sheep yards and that for 60 per cent of the time the other will be used to build fence posts, no sales tax is paid on either of them. How can a tax system be judged as being sensible and consistent when there are these anomalies? I could run through them, example after example. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now talk about the industrial system. I have emphasised the importance of the taxation system providing incentive to people to perform, thereby increasing productivity. There is nothing wrong with the Australian work force and the Australian people. They are like everyone else; they need a little reward at the end of the day. I will now give two examples that show that good results in productivity can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> First, I will talk about the Northern Territory meat award at Mudginberri. I was involved in this for some years. Looking at the result, it is interesting to note that the wages went from $600 per week to $1,100 per week. Productivity went up 450 per cent, yet the cost of killing came from $134 down to $33 per beast. If that is not rewarding all components of the equation, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I was also involved in the Newcastle continuous loading case. Just by rearranging and staggering the relief breaks, the morning tea breaks and the lunch breaks into two seven-hour shifts so that the work did not stop, and things were kept running for 14 hours a day instead of having to stop and start, output was increased by a whole 40 per cent. This did not cost anybody a cent; it was just a bit of commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention fiscal policy. I was rather interested in Senator's Loosley's comments. He said that if we were to tighten government expenditure at this time it would lead to chaos. It is worth quoting Senator Peter Walsh's thoughts on this. I am sure honourable senators have read it. In an address which he gave in America recently he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we do know that when fiscal policy was really tightened in 1986-87 and beyond, employment growth actually accelerated . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That puts an absolute lie to the myth that is peddled around this and other places when people talk about being a little bit more fiscally responsible. The greatest challenge we face regarding the debt blow-out in the wool industry is fiscal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now comment on the waterfront and why the Government has not progressed in this as much as it could have done and why we have this recession on our hands, which for many people out in the country is a depression. The Cairns agreement can be described only as a Clayton's agreement. On the waterfront, there has been a reduction from 23 men to 10. The Northern Shipping Stevedoring Co. said that it needed only five to perform the required functions. But the big problem is that there have been no corrections to the wasteful work practices. That is where the real cost lies, not in the number of people. It is not appropriate to employ people in positions in which they have nothing to do. It is far better to restructure it so that these people have something useful to do. They would at least then have some quality of life. I must emphasise that there have been no corrections of the wasteful work practices. The countdown on Senator Collins continues. I think we have 73 or 74 days to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now wind up my comments. I am sorry that there is not more time available. It is only fair that I give Senator Short ample time to round up the debate. I emphasise what I said at the beginning of my comments about policy development and the direction we must take. It is important that we provide incentive to get productivity increases, and those productivity increases must be rewarded. It is no good continually screwing people down and making life harder for them because they will not respond. A carrot has to be offered to provide incentive. The Government's current policies, particularly in the taxation and industrial arenas, provide none of these. </PARA>
<PARA> In finishing my comments I state that, if we were to provide a bit of incentive and reward in the Victorian meat situation and we were to develop an award based on the Northern Territory award, many of those problems could be overcome. This would benefit the whole of Australia. It would spill over into other States, including Western Australia. We could get killing costs in the meat industry down. We could protect the jobs of those involved and, instead of exporting and domestic abattoirs closing down, we could see a resurgence of this country's meat industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-This debate is now in its second week, having been listed for discussion last week under General Business. In winding up the debate, I would like first of all to thank those honourable senators from both sides of the chamber who have contributed. In particular, of course, I thank my own coalition colleagues who spoke last week and, in the case of Senator Baume and Senator Crane, today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate is debating a very important motion. It is a motion which draws attention to the quite damning admission-indeed, the stunning admission-on 8 February by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) of the policy failure of the Government when he stated that `the Government did not want a recession, it wanted a slowdown' and that `it is a slowdown, not a recession, that Australia requires'. The motion also notes the equally stunning admission by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the Sunday program two days later that `we obviously got wrong a proposition that said that there would not be a recession'. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion condemns the Government for the massive hardship its disastrous miscalculations and mismanagement have wrought on all Australians. Finally, the motion urges the Government to pursue the policies advocated for so long by the coalition, to restore sustainable private sector growth and employment.</PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to note that the Australian Democrats propose to support the first three clauses of the motion. I very much regret that they will not be supporting what is really the key clause of the motion, namely, the need for the Government to pursue the policies that the Liberal and National parties have been advocating for so long. Those are the only policies that will restore sustainable private sector growth and employment to a nation which is now in a state of deep recession and which, unless a major policy turnaround is not taken very soon, will find that the problems it faces will be even more intractable than they appear to be today, and that is bad enough.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me just go through some of the points of the motion in more detail and pick up some of the comments that have been made during this debate. The Government has been on again, off again, on again, off again in relation to the question of the state of the economy. On 22 March last year, which is a significant date because it was only two days before the Federal election, the Treasurer said in Adelaide in response to a question, `We won't let a recession occur'. That view was echoed the same day by the Prime Minister, who was campaigning in Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> When the national accounts figures came out eight to 10 weeks ago in December, the Treasurer was forced to admit, `It is a recession'. But he said this time that it is a recession that we had to have, whereas only nine months previously he said, `We won't let there be a recession'. </PARA>
<PARA> We again had a turnaround on 8 February when the Treasurer admitted that it was not a recession that we had to have, that we did not want a recession-that really we only wanted a slowdown but that we got it all wrong. Despite the fact that he said early in December that it was a recession that we had to have, he said that we had used the levers to pull Australia into a slowdown and now a recession. In other words, he was saying then that it was a deliberately contrived policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Eight weeks later he says, `No, we made a mistake'. Indeed, two days later his Prime Minister went on television Australia-wide and said, `Yes, we got it wrong. We are sorry'. This is despite the fact that, again, early in December, the Prime Minister told the Australian people, when it was quite obvious that every Australian was suffering from this recession, that they should not fear the recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Could a Prime Minister make a crueller statement than that at a time when unemployment was rising at a rate over the last 12 months almost unprecedented in Australian history? The number of persons who have been put out of work in this country has increased by more than 200,000. The number of recipients of the unemployment benefit has increased by over 160,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps of all the Government's fond claims which might have had any credibility and credence in terms of what they had achieved for Australia over the last eight years, one could point to the Government's job creation claim. In the last 12 months, and increasingly over the last few months, that claim has been blown out of the water with the enormous, cruel, unnecessary increase that has occurred in the level of unemployment in this country and the massive, tragic and disastrous lengthening of the dole queues that this has produced. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Loosley had the audacity to say this afternoon that ordinary working people in this country were expendable under coalition governments. What has this Government done in the last 12 months but treat ordinary working people as expendable? It has used them as fodder to fuel its disastrous economic policies-policies which are disastrous in their deliberateness but even more disastrous in terms of the miscalculations that have accompanied them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just in the areas of unemployment and employment where the Government has got it wrong. The Government has got it wrong in terms of the total national output of this country. We now have a deep-seated recession; we have negative growth in four out of the last five quarters in Australia; and it is quite obvious that that is going to continue for several quarters yet. Personally, I do not believe that there is going to be a cyclical upturn in this country during the course of calendar year 1991. But even if there is, the deep-seated problems of the economy, because of the lack of attention to those problems by the Government, will mean that any upturn will be ephemeral, will be short lived and not able to be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of bankruptcies has gone up in Australia by 56 per cent in the last 12 months. Retail sales have crashed; motor vehicle registrations are down; and dwelling approvals are down by over one-eighth. The Confederation of Australian Industry has measured this country against nine other major industrial countries in terms of our ranking in economic activity. According to that body, we rank 10 out of 10. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last six months the Budget which was introduced in August has unravelled to an extent that is unprecedented in Australia's history. The Government went for a Budget surplus estimate of $8 billion when the Treasurer introduced the Budget last August. That $8 billion is rapidly disappearing. There is now every probability that, at best, the Budget will be in balance this year. However, more likely, it will in fact go into deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that, there has been a major blow-out in State government and public sector borrowing. The public sector borrowing requirement this year is going to be not the nil that was forecast in the Budget but of the order, I estimate, of 3 per cent or thereabouts. Yet it is only six or seven months ago last June that the Treasurer said at the Premiers Conference-and, of course, he was right:</PARA>
<PARA>It is very important for Australia to be able to paint the position always, at least in this immediate period, that the public sector has not got its hands on the savings cookie jar of Australia, that it has it out of that jar. </PARA>
<PARA>He was right-he should have been right. But, indeed, what has happened is that, as a result of the mismanagement, miscalculations and wrong policies of this Government, there will be this financial year, and even more so next financial year, a massive call by the public sector on the savings of the Australian people. This will occur at a time when there will be a great need for capital by the private sector as the economy makes some attempt to recover. As I said, this will be extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, given the fact that the fundamental problems underlying the economy are unchanged because of the failure of the Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The hardship has been very strong indeed. I cannot think of a period in the last 20 years when the immediate hardships of the Australian people have been more than in recent months. I believe that the hardship occasioned by this recession is much more at this stage, and certainly will be much more than the hardship which occurred in 1982-83. That recession was triggered primarily by a world recession, whereas ours has been home grown. But the problems and the hardship facing all Australians are quite massive. It is for that reason that the Opposition has urged the Government in this motion to pursue the policies advocated by the coalition to breathe some life back into this nation and our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, far from the comments that have been made by Government and Democrat speakers in terms of lack of policies, the whole approach of the Government, and the whole approach of the Democrats, has been a reactionary approach. The Democrats have certainly put forward policies-I accept that-but they are the policies of the 1940s and the 1950s; they are the policies of big spending government, of building more rigidities into our society and into our economy, and of going right back to the road of regulation which has been shown throughout the world to be the wrong road to take. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the floating of ideas is concerned, the coalition now seems to be criticised by the Government and by the Democrats because we have the courage to take the Australian community into our confidence and to share with them some of the thoughts and some of the ideas that might possibly be developed to get this country out of the recession it is in. If the Government, the Democrats, and anyone else want to criticise that policy, be that on their heads, because the Australian community is reacting very positively to that approach. That is not to say that every policy idea that is floated is a proposal that will end up as firm policy. It will really take some doing for any honourable senator in this chamber to tell me why it is wrong to take the Australian community into one's confidence in debating and looking at these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a very full list of policies that have been out in the public arena for a long time. It is nonsensical and simply untrue to say that the coalition does not have a range of well-developed policies. On fiscal policy, we have made specific proposals of a major nature in terms of expenditure restraint, the simplification of the taxation system and the introduction of a consumption tax to get some incentive back into the Australian work force. We have major proposals for labour market reform to try to get rid of the troubles and the disasters that have been caused by the accord, which has eroded real incomes, propped up inflation and given the Australian Council of Trade Unions far too much power. </PARA>
<PARA> We have made specific proposals on infrastructure, reforms of government operations, privatisation, industry reform, better balancing of policies between the needs of the environment and the needs of development and so on. We have called for all of those proposals and we have spelt them out in great detail. For that reason we have included-because it is very clear what is involved-paragraph (d) of the motion before the Senate today. I could say much more in a debate such as this, but time is of the essence at this stage. I conclude by again thanking all contributors to this debate. I hope that this motion will achieve the support of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>In his letter, Justice Stewart draws the Committee's attention to two findings of fact in the Committee's Operation Ark Report which he asserts are incorrect. (These findings relate in particular to the status of a report prepared immediately prior to the end of Justice Stewart's term as Chairman of the National Crime Authority on 30 June 1989 which dealt with certain allegations of corruption in the South Australian Police Force following the 1989 Operation Noah in South Australia-the Stewart Report). </PARA>
<PARA>The two findings of fact which Justice Stewart asserts are incorrect are in paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Committee's Report, and are that</PARA>
<PARA>* the process of drafting the Stewart Report was completed on 4 July 1990</PARA>
<PARA>* the Stewart Report was not completed on 30 June 1990</PARA>
<PARA>(In order to avoid confusion as to the date relevant to this matter, I note that the Committee's report is incorrect in the paragraphs referred to by Justice Stewart where it mentions June and July 1990; the paragraphs should refer to June and July 1989.)</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Stewart's letter also makes a number of other comments about the Report related to those findings of fact. These further comments are as follows</PARA>
<PARA>* the Committee's Report was contradictory in that its description of the NCA Operation Ark Report did not agree with a description of the status of that report used in material before the Committee in the course of its inquiry</PARA>
<PARA>* the Committee's report neither summarises nor analyses the evidence upon which the two findings of fact were based; and</PARA>
<PARA>* the Committee's process of reasoning concerning these two findings of fact, is not exposed in the report. </PARA>
<PARA>In its Report, the Committee primarily dealt with a direct conflict of views which exist between Justice Stewart and his successor as Chairman of the NCA, Mr Faris QC, on the status of the Stewart Report. The Committee received evidence from two then members of the NCA (Messrs Leckie and Dempsey) to the effect that the Stewart Report was not a Report of the NCA and because it had not been duly authorised for transmission to the Government of South Australia prior to the end of Justice Stewart's term as Chairman of the NCA, it was incumbent upon the newly appointed membership of the NCA, following their commencement as members after 1 July 1989, to decide whether to transmit what it regarded as a draft report. </PARA>
<PARA>Messrs Leckie and Dempsey considered that the Stewart Report had not been duly authorised for transmission because there was not evidence of a minuted meeting of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>Justice Stewart's view directly conflicts with this belief, and is recorded in a letter sent to the South Australian Attorney-General, which is reproduced in the Committee's Report. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker/President, the Committee did not table Justice Stewart's letter immediately it was received at the end of the last period of sittings because Committee members believed that careful consideration should be given to Justice Stewart's assertions. </PARA>
<PARA>Having considered the evidence dealt with by the Committee in arriving at the findings in its Operation Ark Report the Committee considers that it is necessary to seek evidence from Justice Stewart in relation to the matters raised in his letter and to then, if necessary, report further to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>At this stage, the Committee considers that it would neither be constructive for it to reconsider the Operation Ark case, nor to attempt further adjudication on the conflicting claims about the status of the NCA Operation Ark Report at 30 June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Having reached that view, the Committee nevertheless recognises that several aspects of the situation that arose regarding the NCA Operation Ark Report continue to give it cause for concern. In particular, the case identifies important issues regarding the transition of the NCA from one membership to an NCA of a different membership. </PARA>
<PARA>Included amongst these matters are</PARA>
<PARA> * how disputes can be resolved between new and old members of the NCA</PARA>
<PARA> * whether a new NCA could overturn or alter a decision of a previous Authority</PARA>
<PARA> * whether it is appropriate for the expiry of the term of more than one member to coincide on or near the same date</PARA>
<PARA> * where several members of the NCA end their term on the same day, whether some mechanism should exist for clarifying the powers of a new NCA over matters put in hand by a previous NCA</PARA>
<PARA> * what mechanisms could be employed by the NCA during a change over period of its members to minimise discontinuity and uncertainty within the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has decided that, as part of its present evaluation of the NCA's constitution, role, effectiveness and powers it will specifically address the administrative problems which emerged during the transition period from the Authority under Justice Stewart's Chairmanship to the Authority under Mr Faris's in July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>To assist the Committee in such an examination, and also to allow it to discuss his letter, Justice Stewart has agreed to give evidence to the Committee on 11 March 1991 on these and other matters. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Lindsay</PARA>
<PARA>Re: Operation Ark Report</PARA>
<PARA>I have read the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on Operation Ark and wish to bring to your attention that it contains factual errors. I should note at the outset that I am writing this letter on my own behalf and on behalf of both Mr Robberds QC and Mr Le Grand. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the objects of the Committee's deliberations is stated in paragraph 28 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>``The Committee believe that it was incumbent on it to determine the merits of the competing claims of Mr Faris and Mr Justice Stewart in respect of the status of that report.''</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's report appears to make two findings of fact (both of which are incorrect) concerning this object:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) The process of drafting this report was completed on 4 July 1990 (paragraph 18); and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) The report was not completed on 30 June 1990 (paragraph 19). </PARA>
<PARA>I note that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Although the report picked up the words of Mr Faris' letter of 30 January 1990 (paragraph 28) and spoke thereafter of ``the proposed report'', the opening words of that letter quoted in paragraph 24-``Although prepared before July 1 . . . '' contradict the Committee's findings in paragraphs 18 and 19;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The Committee's report neither summarises nor analyses the evidence upon which the two findings of fact were based; and</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) The Committee's process of reasoning concerning these two findings of fact, is not exposed in the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The facts are:</PARA>
<PARA>(A) Mr Robberds QC, Mr Le Grand and myself (Mr Clark being on leave) decided on 30 June to forward the report as a report of the Authority to the South Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>(B) The report was completed by the time I signed the letter of transmittal of 30 June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>(C) There was no statutory or other requirement to minute the decision referred to in (A), above. </PARA>
<PARA>Evidence of these facts is available from me, Mr Robberds QC and Mr Le Grand. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Committee wishes to obtain this evidence it might consider it appropriate also to obtain evidence on the matters referred to in the qualifying statement published with its report. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I refer to paragraph 34 of the Committee's report and draw your attention to section 59(9) of the National Crime Authority Act which provides:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Where any information relating to the performances of the functions of-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a Department of State of the Commonwealth or of a State;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Administration of a Territory; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory, comes into the possession of the Authority in the course of any investigations conducted by it, the Authority may, if it considers it desirable to do so-</PARA>
<PARA> (d) furnish that information to the Department, the Administration or the instrumentality; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) make to the Department, the Administration or the instrumentality such recommendations (if any) relating to the performance of the functions of the Department, of the Administration or of the instrumentality as the Authority considers appropriate.''</PARA>
<PARA>In this context I also refer to section 6 (3) of the National Crime Authority (State Provisions) Act 1984 of South Australia which provides inter alia, that where the Authority is performing a special function (as in the instant case) the Authority considers that a recommendation should be made to the Minister (in this case the Attorney-General for South Australia), for reform of administrative practices (section 6 (3) (b)), the Authority may make the recommendation to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>It is refuted that the Authority had sought to comment adversely on the management of the Police Department by reaching broad generalised conclusions based on its examination of one limited aspect of police operations. The terms of paragraph 34 do not make it clear whether the concern mentioned therein was that of the Police Commissioner, the Committee, or both. In any event the Authority was exercising its statutory rights, and in this case what it saw as its obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, may I congratulate you, Senator Vanstone, on your appointment to be a Temporary Chairman of Committees. This report, of which I was delighted to be a part, has produced a useful statement on Australia-Soviet Union relations. Of course, it is an interim report-a report given midstream-because it would be a very brave person who would predict the end point to which developments in the Soviet Union may take that country. It is right to say that there is economic chaos in that country-and even social chaos. There is enormous tension on the nationalities question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent months, every week there is someone-perhaps someone extreme-who reflects on the possibility of civil war. I do not make exaggerated statements or predictions. Rather, I rest with stability with the words of this report. I think it is a measured report. It certainly was thoroughly investigated by us. We have written several chapters. We have brought down some conclusions and recommendations; and these ought not be neglected by the Australian Government, because they are appropriate and can be acted upon, I believe, whatever may develop in economic and political terms in the Soviet Union over the coming year or two. </PARA>
<PARA> I first visited the Soviet Union in 1968 when I was in transit to take up research studies in the United Kingdom. At that time I was protesting the invasion by the Soviet Union of Czechoslovakia-that happened the month before I actually visited, when my plans were already set-in August of 1968. My first understanding that there was a Soviet Union was when I was 12 years old in 1956, with the invasion of Hungary; and I recall the terror that we felt that a country could be pushed around by tanks in such an invasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in coming to this Parliament more than a dozen years ago I had a strong impulse to try to bring light and justice, to the extent that an Australian can, to the relationship between eastern European countries and their neighbour, the Soviet Union. I dreamt that we might see a just relationship develop in eastern Europe between the various nations and that there would no longer be invasions such as those of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Also, I was increasingly conscious through my teenage years of the liberty having been snatched away from Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Year by year, for more than a decade now, I have been at annual memorials of those who have suffered at the hands of the Soviet invasion of those three countries. I have never recognised the incorporation of those countries into the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> So one of the themes that is very much in our considerations of developments in these recent years in this report that we have called Perestroika-as the policies of perestroika are applied to the foreign policy of the Soviet Union-is to see whether or not there is some redress to the concerns that I have just reflected upon; and there is redress. There has been a rejection of the Brezhnev doctrine of intervention into other states. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome these developments. I believe that we have a new revolution in Hungary, Poland, in eastern Germany being incorporated with the West, and even in Czechoslovakia. I believe that we have seen only a preliminary change in Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, especially the Serbian part of it; and there will be need for a second revolution in Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania. But there is a great deal of heart to be taken with the new freedom of the eastern European nations. </PARA>
<PARA> We looked at the implications of perestroika not only for Europe but also, of course, for the Asia-Pacific region and Australia in particular. What new strategic assessments ought to be made as a result of the policies that we call perestroika, the economic and social policies that have been led by President Gorbachev in recent years? A second area of enormous concern to members of this Parliament has been the absence of solid human rights in the Soviet Union. Indeed, there was a joint parliamentary inquiry into human rights in the Soviet Union some years ago-in the days of Senator Wheeldon and even Mr Kim Beazley Senior-and, of course, Andrew Peacock and many others were involved in that report when I first entered this Parliament. That report of the Australian Parliament set out as thoroughly as anybody the enormous abuses of human rights in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concern, then, has been not only to see an end to imperialism in the Soviet empire of the Brezhnev kind and before that of the Stalinist kind but also to see such a change of domestic arrangements and a new liberty and freedom for the peoples of the Soviet Union that the abuses that they have suffered for more than 70 years will be redressed. So we looked at the policies of perestroika and glasnost with some caution after the 70-year track record of that country with awareness that economic chaos was pending as there was a transition towards a more market-oriented economy and, of course, the nationality tensions, but with enormous heart and enormous acceptance of the new foreign relations and the new liberties for the Soviet citizens. We are part-way down that track. This is an interim statement; we are yet to see the full outcomes of these developments. I am not one who is cheering now that all is going to be well for the domestic situation for the peoples in the Soviet Union or for its foreign relations until we see perhaps a number of years of consolidation of the freedoms which I have spoken about and which we are all heartened to have seen. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also aware that the Soviet Union is still one of the superpowers, with an enormous nuclear arsenal. It is still an enormous threat to world peace should it ever be used or be contemplated to be used. We welcome the end of the Cold War, and we welcome the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States-indeed, this country and many other allied countries in present international matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusions and recommendations of our report address our two terms of reference: first, the strategic implications for reassessments in our region and, secondly, new opportunities for trade. Our recommendations, of which there are some 16, address those two areas. I have not time to go over them but, as to the first recommendation about a Cabinet review of the whole relationship, I stress that we do need to look for multilateral dialogue in this whole region, not just the bilateral relations between our two countries. We need to be realistic about the short term, with perhaps even decreases in trade such as we have seen with wool and wheat, but an eventual middle term expansion that we need to be totally prepared for with new information mechanisms, joint working groups between the two countries, lines of credit such as we have seen with wool and wheat, review of the Co-ordinating Committee on Exports of Technology to Communist Countries restrictions and in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to provide for Russian studies in our universities; liberate the skills of ethnic communities that are relevant to the Soviet Union; and make sure that we offer management training, increased air flights and so on. And we should not only concentrate on the Soviet Far East. I believe that the greater preponderance of our relationship will be with Russia proper, with the main western end of the Soviet Union. I believe that this is a sound report. I concur with all the recommendations and conclusions in the report and I think we have served Australia and the relationship with the Soviet Union in a positive way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will confine myself to a couple of observations only. I must say that I agree with virtually all that Senator Teague said by way of his contribution. The report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on perestroika and its implications for Australia is one that I believe will be meeting with a favourable response from the Australian Government. The recommendations were arrived at very carefully and I am certain will be taken very seriously. There is a focus on relations with the Soviet Far East on matters of trade and investment and on matters of security. That was agreed deliberately at the level of the Committee and it has broken new ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Teague referred to economic and social chaos in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). He is absolutely right. There is also political chaos in the Soviet Union at the moment. The future of the Union itself is in question, not only in terms of the nationalities and the legitimate aspirations for people in a number of the republics for independence and greater autonomy, but also on the basis of the breakdown in the economic framework of the country and in social relations. Indeed, as Andrei Amalrik predicted in 1969 in his classic book Will the Soviet Survive Until 1984?-The Nationalities Question may be at the core of Soviet politics. Within Soviet politics at the moment we see the Soyuz group in the Soviet parliament-colonels such as Alknis and Petrushenko-who have no hesitation in talking about a military government for the future. We have seen the elimination of liberal elements within the government-people such as Yakovlev and Shevardnadze. The evidence suggests to date that Defence Minister Yazov remains loyal to the President but there is no doubt that there are elements in the military who yearn for a return to the unfettered authoritarianism of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The circumstances in the USSR at the moment are very dangerous indeed, not only with the food shortages, with the breakdown in health services, with the black marketeering and the spiralling rate of crime but also with the dangers in the kinds of populist sentiments that are given free rein by some of the more irrespon- sible elements in the Congress of the People's Deputies of the USSR. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has happened since I led the first Australian Labor Party National Executive delegation to the Soviet Union in the middle of 1989. The situation now is unrecognisable over what it was just two short years ago. To take up one of the points Senator Teague made, we have seen liberalisations in the past under Nikita Khrushchev in 1956 with the classic `secret speech' to the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. We saw it again later at the end of the Khrushchev period when Novy Mir published One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. Those liberalisations came to abrupt ends. We must do all we can in terms of developing relations with the USSR to make certain that this liberalisation becomes irreversible in political and economic terms. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill 1991 relates to the wool industry and the problems that the wool industry is experiencing. The whole wool industry is a very complex one that has engaged many hours of discussion and consideration by many different parties, including the Government, the Opposition and wool industry organisations. It is one in which there is, quite frankly, no easy solution. It is a question of trying to get some sort of resolution which might deal as well as possible with the problems that presently confront the wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It must not be forgotten that to a very large extent the crisis in which the wool industry finds itself at present can be sheeted home to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin. For many years, Mr Kerin has been running around the countryside showing himself up and purporting to be the farmers' friend, but it must not be forgotten throughout Australia that the real recession in the wool industry has occurred under Mr Kerin's leadership. There are many things, of course, for which he cannot be blamed, but there are many things which he could have done but did not do, or which he did at the wrong time, and which have exacerbated the real problem in which the wool industry finds itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin's problems with the wool industry are well known by now, and how he attempts to find a solution has also been a matter of public record. There is a decision made today and a different decision made tomorrow and, quite frankly, the Australian Labor Party (ALP) has no idea what to do in this particular instance. The lack of interest of the ALP in this particular matter is shown very clearly by the fact that, in this particular debate in the Senate, the ALP's contribution to the debate has been from one, might I say, very junior senator. </PARA>
<PARA> All that senator's contribution shows is that it is better to say nothing and let people think one is ignorant, than to speak and prove that one is ignorant. It did seem that the contribution from the ALP senator really missed the point completely. It almost seemed from listening to Senator West that she had not read the Act and she certainly had not read or understood the Opposition's proposals and amendments to the Act. It is something of a disgrace to the wool industry that the interest that the ALP takes in this matter as it comes through the Senate is left to one very junior senator. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not speak with any particular knowledge about the wool industry. I am concerned about it and I have tried to follow the ins and outs. But it is, as I mentioned initially, a very complex matter with complex problems and a complex solution. The reason why I wanted to speak on this Bill was not so much to address the tangible issues of the Bill but to talk on aspects which were raised at the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It probably does not need me to speak on the tangible matters about which the Bill relates because our side, in contrast to the ALP, has had a series of very qualified speakers who understand the wool industry and who, in fact, nearly to a man and woman have some involvement in the wool industry. They are experienced people; they understand the wool industry; they understand the problems; and they have contributed to the solutions which the Opposition has proposed. We cannot propose all the solutions because we are not in government and, were we in government, I venture to say that the problems in which the wool industry finds itself would be nowhere near as bad as they are at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to address the Senate on aspects of the Bill which were referred to in the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I do not, of course, purport to speak for the Scrutiny of Bills Committee or any other member of that Committee. The Committee will issue a report in due course but, with the way things go, that report may come well after the Bill is dealt with by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to bring to the Senate's attention, as other speakers have done, proposed section 140 of the Wool Marketing Act as it will be when amended by this Bill. The proposed section 140 gives the Minister the power by notice in the Gazette to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . issue guidelines for and in relation to the making of supplementary payments to wool producers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That power authorises the Minister to spend very large sums of money that are put under his control to deal with a particular problem. But the Minister has to account to no-one; he simply has to make his decision and publish it in the Gazette. The Parliament will have absolutely no scrutiny in relation to that matter. It really means that the Executive-the Minister-will be able to spend large amounts of money and make decisions in relation to very public matters without any scrutiny from this Parliament. That is a situation which should be highlighted, and it is something that we urge the Government to be very careful about incorporating in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I should mention that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is actually a standing committee of the Senate put into place to watch the powers of Executive Government. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee is authorised or asked to look at all Bills that come before Parliament with particular reference to scrutinise:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . whether such Bills or Acts, by express words or otherwise- . . . </PARA>
<PARA>make rights, liberties and/or obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers;</PARA>
<PARA>make such rights, liberties and/or obligations unduly dependent upon non-reviewable decisions;</PARA>
<PARA>inappropriately delegate legislative power; or insufficiently subject the exercise of legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>In the course of carrying out its charter, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee particularly looked at this Act, and drew to the attention of both the Minister and the Senate the provisions of section 140, as they relate to matters which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is asked to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, there is an even worse provision of the Act, proposed section 144, which provides that the Minister can issue guidelines in relation to reducing the indebtedness of the Australian Wool Corporation. In this instance the Minister does not even have to do as much as report it in the Gazette. At least in proposed section 140, the first instance I referred to, the Minister has to give notice in the Gazette. In this particular instance, he makes a decision in relation to a very large sum of money and does not even have to publish it, let alone submit it to the scrutiny of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter that particularly the people of Australia and the people who represent the people of Australia in this Parliament, and particularly in this Senate, have to be very careful of. I would certainly urge the Government to reconsider those two aspects of the Bill, particularly as they relate to the Minister doing things without allowing his actions to be subject to the scrutiny of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to speak on the amendment that our side of Parliament has proposed to what will be section 148 (2) (b) of the Act if it is incorporated. As has been mentioned, it gives the Minister power by regulation to amend any part of this Act, that is, any provision of this Act as amended. </PARA>
<PARA> When that sort of thing happens one might as well send parliament home because the Minister can completely rewrite the Act by regulation. Admittedly, if it is done by regulation-and at least it does have to be done by regulation-it can be referred to by the Senate and can, in due course, be disallowed by the Senate. But, as I understand the Constitution, until it is disallowed, the amendments that the Minister makes to the Act stand. He has enormous powers in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very frightening day when this Parliament abrogates its responsibilities and gives to the Executive Government the power not just to make decisions in relation to certain matters, as it has in proposed new sections 140 and 144, but in this case rewrite the whole Act by regulation. That is a matter which should be viewed very seriously by this Parliament and the people of Australia. It is for that reason that the Liberal and National parties have moved to amend the Bill-to remove that provision; to take away from the Minister the power to rewrite the Act by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Senate to seriously consider the matters addressed by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee which caused it a lot of concern and which it referred back to the Minister with a `please explain' note. I hope that the Minister will explain during this debate, either now at the second reading stage or in committee, why he needs those powers and why we as a parliament should allow him those powers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very sad week for us to be debating the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill 1991 because it highlights the appalling situation that the wool industry has fallen into, or been led into, over the last two or three years. Like my colleague Senator Macdonald, who spoke before me, I wish to draw attention to the good work done by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and, like Senator Macdonald, invite the Government to respond at some stage to the concerns raised by that Committee. The work the Committee does is just another example of the behind the scenes work that the Senate does to improve legislation brought forward by the House of Representatives which, frankly, does not pay attention to the detail of improving legislation that the Senate, through its committee system, does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a sense of deja vu about this debate because everyone is running around saying this is not their fault. It is quite amazing. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) seems to say it is not his fault-heaven knows why: he has been in charge of the portfolio for some time and is a very well-respected man. But there are many serious questions that he needs to answer about the state of his knowledge at certain times and how incompatible some of his remarks could be seen to be with the state of his knowledge. He says that he is not responsible, and the Wool Council of Australia and the Australian Wool Corporation say they are not responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> The sense of deja vu lies with the Premier in my State. We have just had some quite disastrous financial revelations about the State Bank of South Australia. Those revelations are not surprising to the business community and my State colleagues have been talking about this matter for months and months. The problem relates to a significant number of off balance-sheet companies, which means that the state of indebtedness-assets and liabilities-does not have to be reported in the annual report. If that is all the Premier bothers to look at, all he will find will be the on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. But what does the Premier say?-he is, after all, the Treasurer of that State- `I did not know; it is not my fault'. I have been amazed. My Party, the Liberal Party, is not in government; the coalition is not in government either here or in my State. But whenever anything goes wrong, either here or in my State, the relevant Minister says, `It is not my fault'. If Ministers are not prepared to take responsibility and own up to what is their fault and what they are responsible for, and if they cannot do their jobs, they should get out. There are plenty of people on this side of the chamber who are more than willing to take over their tasks. </PARA>

<PARA> I now turn to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. There are a number of what, to some, might seem technical points but there is good reason for them to be made. Under this Bill, the Minister would have the power to issue guidelines, as my colleague Senator Macdonald said, for and in relation to the making of supplementary payments to wool producers. Pursuant to a particular subsection in the legislation, he has that responsibility from the date the legislation commences until a date to be fixed by proclamation. Similarly, pursuant to proposed new section 143, from the date the legislation commences to a date to be fixed by proclamation, the Corporation is prohibited from operating the reserve price scheme. What is particularly unusual about both of those sections-that is, the power to make these particular guidelines and the prohibition on the Wool Corporation-is that there is a date at which these things commence, but there is no date at which they finish. </PARA>
<PARA> We have traditionally drawn to the attention of the Senate any legislation which does not have a clear commencement date on it. It has got to be within six months. It is not open-ended where we say, `We will pass a Bill which will come into effect some day, never, maybe, or whenever. All you poor sods out there can keep looking out to see if it is ever proclaimed'. It is totally unacceptable to have that attitude. There has to be a time limit where we say, `This Bill will come into effect not later than' and nominate some time. So if it is unacceptable to have a piece of legislation passed but not operative until some not yet nominated date in the future, and to have that in an open-ended way, surely it is unacceptable to have powers or responsibilities similarly cast in an Act. It is the same thing. We know the starting date, but we do not know when it will finish. </PARA>
<PARA> What makes this particularly unusual is the fact that proposed new section 147 would give the Minister some special powers for the purpose of amendments proposed by the Bill. However, for that particular section this would cease to have effect on 1 July 1992. The geniuses that put this legislation together have put a couple of clauses in giving rights and responsibilities in an open-ended way and not saying when they will end, but they have the capacity in relation to other rights being given under the Bill to nominate when those rights will cease. It is a fair thing for the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to draw this to the attention of honourable senators so that they can ask the Government what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the aspects of the maxim that we use-that one is presumed to know the law-is that there has to be some certainty in it. One element of certainty is not only that we use plain language and that people can understand what their rights and responsibilities are, but also that we do not set upon them the task of constantly having to check with someone whether an Act or power is still operative, or whether it has finally come into operation having been lying around in a basement somewhere for God knows how long. That is an element of uncertainty-not knowing when powers and rights and responsibilities come into effect or cease to have effect. That element of uncertainty makes it very difficult for ordinary citizens to know the law. Some might say, `Well, it doesn't matter. The Minister is not an ordinary citizen and neither is the Wool Corporation. They both know what they are doing'. I know a few wool producers who would not go along with the proposition that either the Minister or the Wool Corporation know what they are doing. In any event, it is not up to Parliament to distinguish between the capacity of one or another citizen. It is up to us to pass legislation that normal people can understand. That includes, as I say, understanding when it would begin and when it would end. </PARA>
<PARA> There are further problems drawn to the attention of the Senate by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. There is the question of the guidelines that are to be issued pursuant to proposed new section 140. Those guidelines simply have to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette; they do not have to be tabled in parliament. That means you, Madam Acting Deputy President, myself and honourable senators opposite do not get the opportunity to disallow them. We all know that frequently a disallowance motion on some regulations is put in to allow parliament to express its view about the regulations. It may not proceed to an actual disallowance, but at least the scrutiny is there and whoever is making those guidelines knows that someone is watching what he is doing. But in this case the Executive has been given the power to make these guidelines and to publish them in the Gazette, and then it is a free-for-all after that. That is simply not satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also provision in clause 144 for the Minister to issue guidelines to the Corporation as to how it should reduce its indebtedness. There is no requirement for these guidelines even to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. Some may say, `So what, that is a matter for the Corporation and the Minister and does not affect public rights and responsibilities'. Nonetheless, the Minister should explain why he believes that if the Executive is given this power Parliament should not have the capacity to scrutinise it. </PARA>
<PARA> Last, but not least, I turn to the Henry VIII clause, to clause 148(2) (b). As Senator Macdonald pointed out, this is a new provision which sets out the regulation making power attached to the legislation. This provision would, if enacted in this form, allow the making of regulations to amend any provision of this Act other than this part. That is unacceptable because it allows a piece of primary legislation which has to be debated here to be amended by subordinate legislation; that is, by regulations. If we think that the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill is worth our time debating these clauses, why do we take the view of saying to the Minister that if he wishes to change anything afterwards, that is acceptable and that the Minister can do that effectively for a substantial time without scrutiny? That is just not satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by returning to the substance of the Bill as opposed to what I refer to as the parliamentary deficiencies in the drafting of the Bill and in the granting of the powers, rights and responsibilities. Let us come back to the problem that we now face. I speak from some knowledge of the hardship that this legislation will cause as I have woolgrowers in my family in New South Wales. As Senator Chapman pointed out, the woolgrowers in New South Wales have increased their production far beyond what is produced by the woolgrowers in South Australia, and that has caused a problem for people in my State. Nonetheless, that relationship gives me a small insight into the hardship that the wool industry is now facing. </PARA>
<PARA> That hardship has come about by changes to the Act in 1987 which gave the Wool Corporation and the wool industry their head. It allowed the agro-politicians, as somebody else said, to shoot themselves in the foot; it allowed them not to keep their own industry informed; it allowed them to let their industry believe that 870c a kilogram was an acceptable price when everybody knew that it was not. Everybody was kept in the dark about what was happening until the problem was insurmountable. This Government, with the knowledge that this problem was insurmountable, has shillyshallied around for months on end, which has caused devastation to the industry greater than otherwise should have happened. For that, the Government stands condemned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the past 24 hours this chamber has heard many versions of a theme. Listening to my colleagues express their views and feelings on the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill, it occurred to me that if the rural sector of Australia had been able to hear the debate, it would have realised that not one of us on this side of the chamber has made decisions lightly or easily about this difficult legislation, and in particular the termination of the wool floor price, or without knowing that our duties as politicians to make the right decision for the long term good of the industry often mean making hard and unpopular decisions. These are decisions which we know could hurt, and hurt badly, many families across Australia in the short term. But we must have the courage of our convictions or we should not be here in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a senator from South Australia, who has lived most of his life in the country, I recognise only too clearly the pain that this legislation and my Party's amendments may inflict in the short term. I accept the inevitable backlash from some sections of the rural community which no doubt I shall receive, especially for the view that we should terminate rather than suspend the reserve price scheme. But let there be no mistake that the sickness of that reserve price scheme was indeed terminal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government, to compound its sins, after allowing its policies effectively to dismantle the wool industry infrastructure, still wanted to take what I would term the coward's way out. It wanted to leave the matter in cold storage suspension for a few months, setting the perception that it would try to resuscitate it when it had no intention of so doing. That was cruelty and cowardice rolled into one. No-one could have breathed health back into that scheme. Many in the wool industry recognised that, but the fact that it took the Opposition to act on it illustrates yet again the failure upon failure of Labor decisions on wool since 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get back to some basics. The year 1987, not 1991, was the real end of the reserve price scheme. As it was legislated in 1972, it had worked and worked successfully. It worked because the checks and balances of government control were there. It did its job of providing wool users with a greater degree of price stability and predictability, so that they were encouraged to choose wool over other fibres. It also provided price stability for growers, which was an additional but subsidiary aim. But when in 1987 John Kerin abrogated responsibility for setting the reserve price through a change to the Wool Marketing Act, in effect he signed its death warrant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) has not been blameless either. Only avarice can explain its decision to jump the minimum reserve price in 1988-89 by 35 per cent to 870c a kilogram in one season. That price covered production costs also, which was not a reserve price scheme objective. It was also far above long term wool price trends and above sustainable price ratios between wool and alternative competing fibres. And it was a price set just as the textile industry was heading for a downturn. It was out of line and, as has been proved by our massive stockpile ever since, it was priced out of sight. </PARA>
<PARA> John Kerin's 1987 abrogation of responsibility coupled with the Wool Corporation's actions are the reasons that we are making the decisions we have to make here today. There is simply no point in talking in euphemisms about a situation that is so critical. Because of bad decisions Australia produces too much wool. The maximum amount that we have ever sold to the trade is 910 million kilograms. Yet last year's production was 1,049 million kilograms and this year's production is estimated to be 1,012 million kilograms. We have a stockpile of 4.8 million bales. At the same time we have attempted to charge too much for it, and for that our rural community is now suffering. It is the fault of Government mishandling and industry mismanagement and it takes hard but well-considered decisions to fix it. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we have gone some way towards that with the carefully thought through amendment to the legislation proposed by the coalition. A return to free and open market competition is the only strategy for the survival of the wool industry in the long term. Unfortunately, but hardly, I suppose, unexpectedly, it is an issue clouded with emotion, for the country which once rode on the sheep's back is now shooting them. Nothing we do or say here today can change that in the short term. There is a crisis in rural Australia which this difficult legislation and the amendments we propose cannot, by themselves, cure. The Government's mishandling has taken us to the point of no return. </PARA>
<PARA> I, like most of my colleagues, was a supporter of what the reserve price scheme was, not what it became because of the Government's decisions. After supporting Government legislation to drop the floor price last year from 870c to 700c a kilo, in the vain hope that we could return to some degree of normality in the marketplace and provide some base for a future for our woolgrowers, all we could do was watch helplessly as the Vines committee of inquiry into wool marketing, charged with specific responsibilities and discharging those responsibilities effectively, in the process, perhaps unintentionally, effectively undermined those aims. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it was overseas researching why our wool was not selling, how to revitalise the industry and how to bring buyers back into the marketplace, the message was clear: price and quality. The revival of our wool industry is vital, yet here we had a committee, under the direction of the Government, travelling the globe and virtually saying, `At what price will you buy it? At 500c a kilo?'. No wonder the doors did not open up for us at 700c when we were sending signals like that out into the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> The long term future of our woolgrowers relies very much now on getting it right in this Parliament. Market forces must be allowed to prevail. Australian Wool Corporation borrowings must be limited if it is to survive the burden of debt, and also so that growers are not dealing with an open-ended scheme. The handling of the reduction of the stockpile must be legislated for if growers and buyers are to have any security at all, for why should they trust government after the debacles of the last few years?</PARA>
<PARA> Rural Australia-and, I suppose, many of us who live in and have small businesses in rural Australia-will understand the impact that this crisis has had, as with the grain crisis, as with the recession, as with high interest rates and as with the Government's economic policies. We need to get it right not only as it relates to this piece of legislation before the chamber now; it is also important to underscore the importance of the 12 March industry statement to this Parliament. That is a statement which will tackle, one would hope, a number of policy areas that will be crucial not only to manufacturing industry and job opportunities in that area but also to rural Australia, which has to go through our port system to access world and international markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I talk of micro-economic reform; transport; communications; our waterfront, in particular; our infrastructure; our fiscal policy-and so the list goes on. We look forward to the 12 March statement setting a signpost for the future that we are going to, for once, get some of the policy settings of Government right so that we can relieve the burden that has been on the shoulders of small business across this country now for far too long-small business that simply cannot sustain those on-costs. With this piece of legislation we have a particular component of the rural industry, primary production, that has gone through enormously difficult times not necessarily the result of the individual -the small business operator out there on the farm-but through Government mishandling and industry mis- management. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the legislative measures that we take today will at least start the return of the wool industry in the long term to its rightful place in this country as an important component of our export market potential. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill 1991. I say from the outset that it seems to me that the wider Australian community has not yet become as conscious as we would expect it to be of the devastation that will prevail in the rural sector-particularly the wool sector-in the next 12 months. It is like the recession that we are currently experiencing. We are far from the bottom. There will be an enormous economic cost to this country. We know the prognosis now is for a reduction of 67 per cent in gross income for the average farmer. We know there will be a very significant reduction in rural land prices per se, as many producers are driven out of the industry and become bankrupt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There will be enormous social implications and upheavals to so many rural families, because Australia is one of those countries whose rural industry is very much based on the family farm; farms which have been held for generations by the same families, who have acquired special skills and talents in that area but who do not necessarily have any corresponding skills in other areas. When families are removed from an area they know so well it will have enormous implications for them. As they face bankruptcy there will be enormous pressures on the fabric of those families. </PARA>
<PARA> There is provision in this Bill for a rural counselling program but that, of course, could go only part of the way to assisting in the consequences which will befall us. The economic consequences are not restricted to the various families that will be driven off their farms, but will have very significant effects in rural towns around Australia as they are beginning to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Can I say, and not in a glib way, that it was predictable that we would reach the position we are now in. It achieves no good end to have recriminations. It is unhelpful to saw sawdust in resurrecting the reasons why we are where we are, provided we understand the consequences for any industry that insulates demand from supply-the results, of course, are absolutely compelling and inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation seemed to imagine that the high was the norm. It seemed to imagine that there was no elasticity in demand. It seemed to imagine that wool was not price sensitive. It seemed to believe that Australia had a mortgage on the production of quality wool. The truth is to be found elsewhere. We all know, as we artificially held up our wool price at 870c a kilo, that our competitors were becoming more efficient and more competitive, and they are now into our markets. I note that between 1986-87 and 1988-89 the floor price went from 508c a kilo to 870c a kilo, an increase of 70 per cent in the floor price in that short time. </PARA>
<PARA> It was no longer a floor price. It was no longer a safety net. It was no longer fulfilling the function for which it was originally intended. One can say now, with 20-20 vision, that there are other ways, other mechanisms, to smooth out the highs and the lows, the peaks and the troughs. Be that as it may, we moved from a position of having a safety net to one of having a minimum price. The minimum price for the first time in 1988-89 rose above the long term average price. It was inevitable to anybody who knows the slightest thing about such matters that there had to be a downturn, and that the downturn would be significantly below the minimum price. Yet we faithfully held on to this minimum price of 870c. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences are all around us. The Wool Corporation has debts of $2.8 billion, with a $4.8m stockpile anticipated in 1991-92, to climb as high as eight million bales in the following year, and to reach 8.6 million bales, with that debt continuing to blow out to the point where the support scheme will be in deficit by $4 billion. It was inevitable that very quickly we would arrive at a position where the Corporation was technically bankrupt, technically insolvent, where no longer would the 25 per cent tax-or whatever figure was put on it-cover the cost of the purchases, the maintenance and the interest repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past when we found ourselves with an oversupply, there was a simple solution: the Government unilaterally devalued the Australian currency. That made our wool more competitive because it was cheaper for overseas purchasers. We now live in the real world. We now have a floating currency of sorts. Originally, when the dollar was first floated, it adjusted as it should have: it went down. But, thanks to this Government's economic chaos, the dollar in recent times has strengthened and stayed at the higher level because of an artificially held high interest rate. That has meant that the stockpile has become worth less and it has been a great deal more difficult to sell it on the world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> One can look back to see why in the past two years, the last 12 months in particular, the price of wool has collapsed. One has only to look at the economic chaos that is being wreaked throughout the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to understand, at least in my view, that the purchases are neither short term nor medium term and, whatever the description of long term might be, it will be some considerable time before the Soviet Union has a capacity to come back into our market at the levels that existed previously. Much of that is also true of China, although its financial circumstances are quite different. I suspect that this year there will be a worldwide reduction in demand because we will have an ever-increasing contraction in the world economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, we are living the reality of allowing an insulation of demand over price. We now have excess stock of about 185,000 sheep. I think that New South Wales increased its flock by 40 per cent in the past couple of years. The average amount of wool sold is 750 million kilograms and we are now producing in excess of 1,000 million kilograms. There is no sign that that production will retreat other than by taking the steps that have been proposed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise one matter which does not have universal support, certainly not on the Government side and I suspect in modest terms not on this side. I notice that the legislation proposes to wind down the slaughter scheme. In part it has been effective; it has taken out about 10 million sheep. That has not dramatically reduced production because the sheep that have been removed are those least likely to produce quality wool. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, we are presently producing about 1,000 million kilograms. It is suggested that abolishing the scheme will quickly reduce production. It is my view that that will not happen for at least two years. For the next two years we will have depressed prices that continue to be forced down by oversupply. To get production equivalent to demand means taking out about 250 million kilograms, or removing 40 million or 50 million sheep. The target originally set by the slaughter scheme was to take out 50 million kilograms, and I understand that that was based on a projection of slaughtering 15 million to 20 million sheep. To remove 250 million kilograms from the market requires a slaughter of between 40 million and 50 million sheep. For reasons that are not thoroughly clear to me-no doubt the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Cook) will explain it in due course-we are not proceeding with an enhanced slaughter scheme, which would have reduced production significantly. Until such time as supply comes in line with demand, prices will continue to be depressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that this is the first step in putting some order into the wool market in Australia. It will cause enormous dislocation. There is no panacea, no easy solution, no way of avoiding a crisis, no way of preventing bankruptcies, no way that we can prevent many families from being forced from the land. The sooner we can get the price up by getting production down so that wool is on the market at the right price, the sooner we will have some stability in the industry. This legislation, notwithstanding its flaws, is the first step. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliament is debating the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill 1991. On behalf of the Government I begin by thanking all honourable senators-and there have been quite a number-who have made a contribution to this debate. Clearly, not all of the views expressed are views that the Government necessarily supports. This debate has shown that, from vastly different philosophical positions and, from within parties, some different considerations and principles, there is a core view that concentrates on the passage of this Bill in the second reading. The indications are that the Government will achieve a second reading of this Bill. The Opposition has moved an amendment, which we will oppose. But I expect that the second reading will be passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of amendments are proposed to be moved during the committee stage by the spokesman for the Liberal Party of Australia, Senator Grant Tambling; the Leader of the National Party, Senator Ron Boswell, who is now just entering the chamber; and I think the spokesman for the Australian Democrats, Senator Bell, although I need to be advised on that. As I speak, there is still some toing and froing in terms of discussions about some of those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments and the totality of the debate show that there is unanimity on the point that significant change is needed here and this issue needs to be sorted out. There might be differences of degree. Nonetheless, the thrust of what we are proposing is fair enough. I say that, acknowledging the views that have been put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I begin by saying that the Government intends to oppose two of Senator Tambling's amendments when they are moved in the committee stage. There has been some discussion between the parties on amendment No. 3 on the list as circulated. As I speak, I am advised that there is agreement to a compromise outcome which would obviate the need to move amendment No. 3 on the list as circulated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's understanding of that is as follows. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has asked me to put forward the following compromise position on the understanding that it is acceptable to the Liberal and National parties-and I understand it is-and, I hope, the Democrats. This will obviate the need for the amendment to proposed section 148 (2) (b) in the name of Senator Tambling. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Kerin, notes, first, that it is his intention that proposed section 148 (2) (b) apply only to the operation of the supplementary payment scheme and that it not be included in the legislation package to be brought forward later this session, and should not be seen to create a precedent. Secondly, he reiterates his undertaking to the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Lloyd, to adequately consult the shadow Minister on the use of proposed section 148 (2) (b) should he ever contemplate using it. Further, he extends his undertaking to adequately consult on the use of proposed section 148 (2) (b) to the Democrats spokesman. It is well to have that out in front. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate entered into has covered a wide area. Many points have been raised. It is inappropriate-indeed, time is not sufficient-for me to refer to each particular speaker in this debate, isolate the points in each address and reply in each case to each one. For the convenience of the Senate, I have reduced my reply to seven significant points. The first is: what has the Government done? The Government has announced a package of measures to address the critical situation facing the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) and woolgrowers and outlined a two-stage plan to ensure that the situation is stabilised and that recovery can begin. There have been media releases which list those measures. They are well known in this chamber. I say that up front because demonstrated in this debate has been a clear understanding of the progressive development of this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has the Government suspended the minimum reserve price for wool? This question underpins many of the comments. The Government has taken action in response to the following unprecedented series of events: the continuing deterioration of the wool market; the rapidly growing stockpile of wool held by the Australian Wool Corporation, currently nearly five million bales; the burgeoning borrowings of the Australian Wool Corporation, now close to $3 billion; the ever-increasing wool levy necessary for growers to pay for the interest on the debt from 25 per cent this year to 35 per cent in 1991-92; the opposition, by a large number of growers, to the introduction of quotas in 1991-92, which is an integral part of the AWC strategy; the doubtful outlook for wool markets in the near term, especially in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and China; and the apparent lack of recognition, at least publicly, by the wool industry leaders of the enormity of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these have resulted in the need for the Government to take action to ensure that this vital industry does not bankrupt itself completely. The measures announced are directed over the next few years to lead to the recovery of the Australian wool industry. Whilst painful for all concerned in the short term, in the medium term the recovery plan will enable Australian wool to compete effectively for markets. The measures provide for confidence and stability to be returned to wool markets, which in recent times have been suffering under the uncertainty created by the public recognition that the debt level of the Australian Wool Corporation was not sustainable. In short, they are the reasons why we have suspended the move to suspend the minimum reserve price for wool.</PARA>
<PARA> In some of the comments made there was an accusation made that the Government has waited too long to act. Why has that been the case? How do I answer that? The Government has not been sitting on its hands; it has been taking actions to address this problem since the world market for wool began to collapse in November 1989, more than one year ago. Over that period a wide range of measures has been implemented by the Government and the Australian Wool Corporation to try to restore confidence in the market and put the wool industry on the road to recovery. Dropping the floor price last year, the loan guarantees, the Vines committee inquiry, the establishment of the interim wool policy council, Mr Kerin's call for a business plan and a strategic plan for the Australian Wool Corporation, the wool mission overseas, the $400m USSR credit facility-these are examples of the actions we have been taking throughout a very difficult period. </PARA>
<PARA> However, despite the adoption of this range of measures, the situation has, as we know, continued to deteriorate, largely as a result of continuing speculation that the scheme itself was unsustainable. Other influences have hit as well, such as the crisis in the USSR-who could have foretold that?-and the Gulf war. Who could have foretold the certainty of that conflict? For those reasons the Government has not acted dilatorily; waited too long. In fact, it has been tracking this matter with the most reasonable responses in the circumstances at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other criticisms raised is: what is the cost of all this? It is not possible to calculate the actual cost to the Australian taxpayer of all the measures that we have taken until we are able to see what happens to the price of wool in the absence of a floor price. The direct cost to the Government of the assistance package to alleviate the impact of changing the game mid-season, as we know from this Bill, will be $300m. </PARA>
<PARA> A question that has underpinned the debate is: why should the wealthy growers be given any assistance? Of course, not all woolgrowers are wealthy. In fact, many have relatively low net incomes. In the absence of any assistance, growers yet to sell their wool in the current season would suffer the full impact of price falls. This would place them at a severe disadvantage in comparison with growers who sold their wool in the earlier part of the season with the support of the reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics estimates that sheep specialist farmers yet to sell their wool will face an average farm-cash operating surplus of minus $19,500 for the year compared with the same surplus of $15,100 that they could have expected with the continuation of the scheme. A means test based approach would be impossible administratively and would not work. Many growers receiving large payments have, of course, low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to reply to two other points. The first is: would retaining the 700c reserve price as proposed by the Australian Wool Corporation not have been better? The second is: did the Government not create this crisis by dropping the reserve price in May 1990, an allegation which has been embodied in much of the argument that we have heard in this debate?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me reply to the first of those two points. The Australian Wool Corporation's draft strategic plan incorporated the following: the retention of the 700c per kilogram floor price; the introduction of marketing quotas of 700 kilotons from 1 July 1991 for a period of two years; a 35 per cent wool tax; a flock reduction scheme; and more aggressive wool marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme has been carefully examined and not accepted as the most advantageous because it results in the Australian Wool Corporation's debt continuing to rise to nearly $4 billion, with total stocks of wool possibly growing by 8.7 million bales by 1995-96 compared with 4.8 million now. Because it relies partly on the introduction of unpalatable marketing quotas, it also presumes that if there is any further deterioration in the situation, the Government will pick up the tab. </PARA>
<PARA> These outcomes compare with a no floor price approach where the AWC stocks fall from their present level of 4.8 million bales to around 1.5 million bales by 1995-96 and debt peaks with a 12 per cent wool tax at $3.1 billion and then declines to $69m in 1995-96. In all options examined, grower incomes are very low or negative in 1991-92 and recover only slowly over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me answer the accusation: did the Government not create this crisis? No, of course we did not. The cause of the collapse has been an unprecedented combination of events. The only events that could have been foreseen, which I will now address, were that the reserve price scheme would be put under stress with a floating exchange rate; that a minimum reserve of 870c per kilogram would induce extra production; and the negative reaction to customers to the very high prices of 1987-88. These three factors were foreseen but ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> The minimum reserve price was dropped to 700c per kilogram for the following reasons: at this level it would be roughly on a par with long term price relationships with cotton and polyester without unduly hurting users who would just have experienced a rapid rise and fall in wool prices over three to four years; it would limit the cost of buying into an already excessively large stockpile, thereby helping to finance storage costs; because the 18 to 20 per cent wool levy was not considered adequate to influence growers to reduce production rapidly, it would send a price signal to growers to at least limit production. Since July 1990 the situation has deteriorated in communist countries and Western economies. The Iraq war is the culmination of a long sequence of events that, in themselves too, were unprecedented. </PARA>
<PARA> As the situation got worse, Mr Kerin asked the AWC for a business plan for the 1990-91 season and a three-year strategic plan for 1991-92 to 1993-94. Recommendations of the AWC and the WCA in October 1990 resulted in the Government agreeing to end or legislating for a 25 per cent levy for 1990-91; a possible levy up to 30 per cent and a surcharge of up to an additional 20 per cent; an open-ended borrowing guarantee by the Government but with monitoring; the minimum reserve price to be set at 700c per kilogram to June 1992; auction sales to be restricted to 140,000 bales per week; a humane flock reduction scheme; a middle market campaign; additional credit facilities for overseas customers; and the introduction of marketing quotas for the 1991-92 season. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures, except for the marketing quotas and the possibility of a large flock reduction program, are now in place. It was hoped that in the peak December-January selling period, together with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics back in the market, the Wool Corporation's business plan would work. For it to work required a buy-in rate of 28 per cent of the remainder of the current season. The buy-in rate plummeted in January to about 30 per cent but progressively returned to unacceptably high levels over the next two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> Faced with a rapidly expanding stockpile, the knowledge that the buy-in rate was far too high and the prospect that the Wool Corporation may not have the finances to continue for much longer, the Wool Corporation decided on 21 January to defer sales for three weeks to enable it and the Government to consider their positions. The result of the Government's consideration of its position is, of course, this legislation tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my second reading reply by saying that Senator Tambling has moved a motion to add certain words to the second reading motion. The Government opposes that amendment. It is an amendment which, in effect, calls for the termination of the minimum reserve price. First, I must say in relation to that amendment that we have stated the ground rules for any future minimum reserve price. Those ground rules specify that it must be self-funding and that any floor must be conservatively set well under the prevailing market price. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Vines Committee has already received submissions on minimum reserve price issues. The Committee will report at the end of March and we shall await that report. Thirdly, the Government's suspension of the scheme has provided a breathing space in which all sectors of the industry can discuss the future of the minimum reserve price. This is something that we were not able to do while the minimum reserve price was in place in an operating market. The Opposition amendment, if carried, would cut off that consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also ignores all of the complex consequential amendments that would flow from immediate termination of the minimum reserve price including, presumably, the immediate abolition of the Australian Wool Council, the sacking of staff, the Government taking over the debt, the total Government management of the stockpile and the complete derangement of promotion plans and research and development plans. For those reasons we will not be supporting the amendment to the second reading that was moved by Senator Tambling. </PARA>
<PARA> I did intend to conclude at this point. However, it has been drawn to my attention that during the second reading debate this morning Senator West of the Australian Labor Party commented that the guidelines for the management of the stockpile until 30 June have been released and that they will be included in the guidelines which will be published in a special gazette tomorrow if the Bill is passed. A number of senators opposite seemed to be unaware of those facts when Senator West was making her speech. Senator West's comments were factually correct, notwithstanding the comments that they drew in reply. I am happy to make the AWC announcement available to honourable senators opposite, if they wish. I table a copy of it for the information of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> That concludes the reply on behalf of the Government. I look forward to joining honourable senators opposite if this Bill is debated at the committee stage. I commend to the Senate the second reading of this Bill but not the amendment moved by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA> Clause 4, page 2, proposed subsection 141(2), line 23, omit ``(whatever the source of that money)'', substitute ``(whatever the source of that money, but amounts payable from so much of that money as is attributable to payments to the Corporation under paragraphs 47(1) (a) and (d) are not to exceed in the aggregate $200,000,000)''. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter was canvassed in quite some detail by a number of speakers during the second reading debate. I will not take up a lot of the time of the Senate in retracing many of those arguments. Suffice to say that the proposals that have been put forward by the Government would achieve a much higher loan facility being available to the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). It would increase the Wool Corporation's borrowing under the Government's proposals to some $3.5 billion plus to pay for an open-ended supplementary scheme which would have critically threatened the viability of the AWC. Therefore, the total potential pay-outs would have been the $300m that is separately appropriated. This gives considerable cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I argue very strongly that there needs to be a degree of discipline in this regard which is in the interests of the long term financial viability of many of the woolgrowers. It is a matter that requires our urgent attention. It is necessary to place a cap on these borrowing facilities in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition would endeavour to limit the scheme to $500m-the $300m from the Government subsidy and the remaining $200m, which I am now proposing in this amendment, from the industry. This would take the current borrowings from just over $2.8 billion to a figure slightly in excess of $3 billion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats intend not to support the amendment because the effect would be that there would only be some $500m available for the supplementary payment scheme. Because some 40 per cent of woolgrowers have yet to offer their wool for sale, the cap would mean that there would be likely to be insufficient funds available to meet these supplementary payments. Therefore, those 40 per cent of woolgrowers would be likely not to be equitably served by the wool sales which have occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The argument could be put, and I have heard this argument, that the Australian Wool Corporation could find additional funds by flogging off some of its assets or raising money in ways other than loans. The effect of that would be to emasculate that organisation to such an extent that it would not be able to fulfil its duties to guide the industry through this very perilous time. To constrict it in such a way as suggested here would be counterproductive in the extreme. We cannot see any reason for that. The producers who have contacted us in this regard have begged us not to support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I canvassed this point this afternoon in my speech in the second reading debate. I calculated that from 1 July next year the wool tax on existing woolgrowers will be roughly 20 per cent. It will work out at 20 per cent if we put a cap on it at $3 billion. In other words, if this amendment were to be successful and we were locked in at $200m out of the Corporation, giving a total debt of $3 billion, we would need approximately $400m per year in interest alone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Taking my estimation, and a lot of other people's estimation, of next year's wool clip being worth $2 billion, if we put $400m over $2 billion and multiply it by 100, it works out at 20 per cent. This applies if there is a cap on at $3 billion. There are estimates around that for sales between next week and 30 June of the stockpile that is available the bill may run up to $1 billion extra and we could finish up at $3.8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that figures of $600m to $700m have already been admitted to, but I believe that could blow out to $1 billion. If we finish up-being conservative and to make the figures easy-with a $4 billion debt, we will need a 40 per cent wool tax on the growers next year, assuming that we average 300c greasy. If it does not average 300c greasy, the 40 per cent figure will go higher. If it averages more than that, it will come down. To make it easy, I have allowed for $4 billion; but if we use $3.8 billion-because that is, in my guess and the guess of plenty of others, where it will finish up-then we will need approximately 36 per cent to cover it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am assuming that we are going to get 300c. Can the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) tell me how any grower, even if he is viable now, is going to survive on that? He will be getting 300c greasy, as I just said, and if we take 40 per cent of that, it is 120c per kilo off. That leaves 180. If we multiply that figure by 200 kilos per bale we get $360 per bale. No woolgrower will be viable. </PARA>
<PARA> So this is affecting the future of Australian woolgrowers-because we will not get out of this for the next five years-for the sake of worrying about that 40 per cent who have not sold their wool. But I am not wiping them off because, as Senator Bell admitted himself when he spoke, they could be looked after by the fixed assets of the Corporation-wool stores that they can do without because this system, if it is not finished now, will be finished after 1 July. They can be fixed up then. Those woolgrowers can be given the first lien on those assets to bring them back up. We could have that $500m cap that the Opposition will agree to under the amendment, plus what the Government is putting in. With $500m we can make advanced payments to the ones who sell between now and 1 July-a certain amount by advanced payments-and by 1 July we will know exactly what is owed and then we can use these other fixed assets or mortgage them to square up those woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> My question to the Minister, and I want him to answer it, is: how many woolgrowers will be viable with what is left after the Corporation gets almost 40 per cent, if they are lucky enough to get 300c greasy, which is 600c clean? Tell me how anyone is going to be viable?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment. If the loan is extended to $3.5 billion it will put an almost impossible burden onto the remaining growers. There will be casualties in the industry. If the loan is extended to $3.5 billion and the wool makes 300c at auction, the tax will be 41 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If that tax comes off the 300c, we will make the viable growers less viable and they will not be able to sustain their businesses. I accept the intention of the amendment and I know where it is going, but-and I say this with a fair degree of worry-the Government is trying to strengthen the weak but will end up weakening the strong. In the end all this will do is create more casualties because the Government is burdening the industry with a debt it is incapable of repaying. I support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has encouraged the Australian Wool Corporation to go even further into debt. The Government had guaranteed a $3 billion debt which it says the Corporation could take and now says that that amount should be extended to $3.5 billion. The Government is now encouraging the Corporation to take out an additional debt of $700m. Whose debt will this be? It will not be the Government's debt, nor will it be the Corporation's debt; it will be the woolgrowers' debt. The woolgrowers are already $2.8 billion in debt; that means each farmer is currently in debt for $55,000. On that $2.8 billion debt woolgrowers are paying annual interest of $400m and the levy they are paying deals only with the interest. The Government wants the woolgrowers to take an additional debt and that additional debt would put growers in debt to the tune of $69,000 each. That means that the annual interest on that $3.5 billion would increase from $400m to $600m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The woolgrowers left in the industry after the dreadful debacle the Government has created will be expected to cover the interest on that $3.5 billion debt with no floor price, because after June there will be no floor price. If the Minister and the Government are not truthful now, when are they going to start being truthful? After June there will be no floor price but the interest on the debt alone will be $600m. What has the Minister calculated if, as Senator Panizza suggested, that debt stays at $3.5 billion and does not increase to $4 billion? What will be the levy imposed on every farmer and grower left in the industry to pay the annual interest of $600m on the debt? I would like the Minister to calculate the levy payable under those circumstances; I am sure his Department has already done so. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister thinks for one minute that any grower can pay a 20 per cent levy without any floor price, he has another think coming because the whole industry will collapse around his ears; and that would be as a direct result of the Government encouraging the Corporation to take out additional debt. I do not know how growers will cope with the interest they already have, but to allow them to take out, and to encourage them to take out, that additional $700m is grossly irresponsible. I request again: what levy will growers be paying once the floor price is gone after 30 June?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two issues under this heading. Firstly, to carry on from where Senator Walters got to, in my office we have been doing quite a lot of number crunching to try to work out where these figures are heading. I do not know which figures are easier for the average farmer to understand, but on the quantity of wool we have in storage at the moment and on the costs the Minister has himself used, each bale of wool is losing value at a rate of 60c a day. The total cost of interest is now in excess of $1m a day and the cost of storage and interest on the wool we have at present is $1 billion a year. I do not know-and the Government has not said-what it would presume the recovery value of the existing stockpile to be under the circumstances it has in mind for its disposal, but in the course of my speech in the second reading debate I quoted one journalist who said that under express disposal conditions, the likes of which will probably have to happen, the whole stockpile, whatever it has cost and whatever it may technically be worth, may be struggling to bring more than, say, $2 billion. How will we fund that? Who will fund it and who will be left with that $55,000 per grower debt?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not a matter of raising money. In my previous business, before I came here, I always used to say to people borrowing money, `Money is hard to borrow; it is a lot harder to pay back'. I think we are now seeing it the way it is. A few months ago one of the arguments used was that the value of money was changing and that interest rates were coming down. I do not believe interest rates are coming down at present and I do not think they will come down for some time so we cannot bank on saying, `Oh well, if we started off at this level, it will get better'. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue is an associated one which I raised with the Minister. I asked the Minister to ensure that, as a matter of equity, private treaty wool merchants be included for consideration in the deficiency payments scheme. We all look forward to the regulations and guidelines in this instance and I will look forward to finding out how the private buyers are taken into account in the proposal. We all know that the private buyer is generally a fairly small business which does a mighty job in country areas around Australia. Recently those private buyers have continued their jobs; they have been working on the Government's and the Australian Wool Corporation's undertakings; they have been buying wool and they have been paying people, particularly people who have been short of money. Many of them had wool ready for the auction system but due to decisions outside their control those sales were cancelled and the credit of those buyers is now very tightly stretched. From a recent letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), I note that at the time the sales were stopped the buyers had stock of 40,000 bales with a value of approximately $18.7m, which is only about $400 per bale. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a particular consideration about these buyers; namely, that as from now we are going to need them with their expertise and dedication as we have never needed them before. The buyers should all have adequate records to verify their position and that all the wool that is under discussion is in first ownership after shearing: it is not wool from dealings; it is not wool that is second-hand; it is wool that has come straight from shearing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the overall level of funding under discussion, the amount is quite small-$18.7m-but the significance of the buyers in the future recovery of the woolgrowing industry is quite large. Therefore I believe that consideration of their particular case should be given and dealt with in the regulations and/or the guidelines. I look forward to having the regulations and guidelines to look at in the very near future because, as I said in the second reading debate, the growers are only one group in the overall wool industry, which includes the buyers, the brokers, the scourers, the processors, the manufacturers and, most importantly, the customers. No section of this industry can be prosperous without the co-prosperity of all the others. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just be a little bit quiet for a couple of seconds. We have heard enough from Senator Powell. The amendment before us is about putting some fiscal responsibility into the Australian Wool Corporation in terms of its expenditure and looking a little further down the track than the next four months and, in effect, minimising the mortgaging of our children's future. That is what we are doing in allowing the Corporation to have a virtual open chequebook in terms of this payout. A much better mechanism for the Government to use would be to adopt this amendment, give certain instructions to the Corporation regarding its assets and overheads and, in terms of money allowed to be borrowed, to pick up the difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Corporation does have significant assets. In addition, with the changes to the scheme it will not require the same overheads in operation, so both those things have to be looked at closely in terms of this situation. We need to make some calculations-and this is why I am looking a little further down the track-and I have made some, but it is almost impossible to do any calculations because there are two things that we do not know. However, one thing we do know is that over the next 12 months we are going to produce close to six million bales of wool-five and a half million or thereabouts. What we do know is that the average sales over the last 10 years have been just over four million bales. This year, if we are lucky, we may sell three million bales. So when we look at the debt against the possible sales we start looking at a horrendous taxation burden, and that is where the mortgaging of the future comes into it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am just going to run through some calculations which we did for the debt at its current level of about $2.8 billion. If in the next 12 months starting from 1 June we sell four million bales-which is the average for the last 10 years-at a price of 400c, the tax just to sustain the stockpile will be 22.7c. If the selling price is 375c, the tax will be 24.2c; if it is 300c, it will be 30.3c; and if it is 250c the tax will be 36c just to hold the stockpile-the holding costs. At this year's figures, if we sell 3.3 million bales at 400c, the tax will be 28.4c; at 375c, it will be 30.3c; at 300c, it will be 37.8c; and at 250c, it will be 45.4c. It does not matter which of those figures we select; by allowing the debt to blow out further we are increasing those figures and thereby creating a situation where there will be very few in the industry who can afford to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, a percentage of the wool will almost certainly be virtually unsaleable in the short term. I hope that all the wool sells and brings a reasonable price, as I think we all do, but we must be realistic. Those figures I have quoted include absolutely nothing for research and development, so that has to go on top of them. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has said that that issue will be addressed later on in the term-I understand next May. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to look not only at the short term but also at the medium short term, which is next year; the medium term, which is the year after that; and thereon in. In terms of handling this problem, I emphasise the necessity of placing some fiscal discipline on the Corporation in regard to its borrowing levels. We must have a situation whereby assets which will not be required in the future under the current arrangements are liquidated so as to meet the costs of the deficiency payment. We must also see a significant reduction in the overheads of the Corporation, because the role of the Corporation, with the sales coming up, will be significantly less than it was in the past. I just make a plea that honourable senators give consideration to what we are doing in terms of mortgaging our children's future and in making it virtually impossible for most woolgrowers to show any profit next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just briefly, there have been quite a number of figures quoted in the debate over this amendment. I would have thought it was plain that, with 40 per cent of the clip still to be offered for sale, 40 per cent of the growers would be asked to shoulder whatever deficiency there is between the $500m-which is being proposed as a total ceiling-and the potential total requirement, which could be anything up to $900m or even $1 billion. Those 40 per cent of growers will not receive the income under this proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, if the money that is needed to meet that payment were to be shared across the entire industry, then 100 per cent of the growers would then be sharing in that debt. That is far more equitable than just allowing the 60 per cent who have been able to sell their wool so far to be at a considerable advantage by sheer good luck because nobody was able to predict what this Government was about to do to them, while the other 40 per cent just go singing in the wind for what they will not get. </PARA>
<PARA> If people are concerned about the future of the children who are involved in this industry, they should be concerned more about those 40 per cent who will be saddled individually with a huge debt. I cannot see the difference between not receiving the money and owing somewhat less all round. I would have thought that would be plain to anybody. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes this amendment and does so knowing, as we have just heard from the Australian Democrats, that they too oppose it. We welcome that support in defeating this proposal. I want briefly to reply to the debate and answer some of the questions that have been posed to me by honourable senators opposite. The best way of handling the reply is firstly to deal with the substance of the motion and then go to the comments of the individual senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tambling's motion proposes limiting grower input to the supplementary payment scheme to $200m. Far from helping woolgrowers, it is the Government's view that this amendment puts the effects of the suspension right back on those growers who happen to be selling between now and the end of June. Those growers selling between now and June would not get supplementary benefits under this proposal until July at the earliest. They would get a lesser payment than currently proposed. The Opposition is effectively saying to the growers, `You agree to $500m being put aside until the end of the season, and then we will stand back and watch while some other poor blokes work out what sort of scheme costing $500m can be put together. If you don't get any supplementary payment until August or September, it's your problem-not ours'. This is being described as a fiscally responsible policy which stands on the problems of the wool industry. The Opposition is being panicked by a number of back-of-the-envelope costings of this scheme. It is a feature of some of the questions asked of me. I am being asked to answer questions based on assumptions and back-of-the-envelope costings. There are a number of these back-of-the-envelope calculations floating around at the moment. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am answering Senator Panizza's question and coming to the point. I hope Senator Panizza will not be too upset if I say, in all honesty, that he is presenting a back-of-the-envelope costing for me and one has to look at the assumptions involved in those sorts of costings. As far as the Government is concerned, a proper costing for the scheme takes account of these five elements, at least: the type of wool coming forward till June; the likely market response to those types; the provisions of the wool tax legislation; tax receipts; and cash flows. All of those elements have to be taken into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The kinds of complications that do not really exist get taken into account on back-of-the-envelope calculations. I do not think it can be fairly said that all of those have been properly weighted in the calculations that have been put forward. When these complications are considered, the picture is a little different. We estimate, after careful work, the cost of supplementing growers receiving a 375c floor price equivalent at $677m. That amount is estimated to cover the difference between what the grower is paid and what he would have received in hand under the minimum reserve price scheme. This amendment, if carried, would allow supplementation only up to about 470c, not 525c, from a 375c floor price. The difference might not sound much, but it is about $65 per bale. I do not think the amendment achieves anything other than disruption in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I will answer some of the individual questions that have been asked. I think the first honourable senator to ask questions was Senator Panizza. He claimed that a 40 per cent tax would be required to meet the costs of a $3.8 billion, as I took it down, Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then he has done them on the back of his hand or in his head. However he did them, they are trial balances arrived at on assumption. For a start, Senator Panizza uses a 300c price per kilogram greasy wool, whereas the Government has costed the scheme on a 375c price. The estimated levy to meet the cost of the borrowings up to $3.5 billion is nowhere near the 40 per cent he estimates. It is more like 12 per cent, plus the cost of promotion and research and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well as that, he has asked me how any grower is going to be viable if 40 per cent is taken out of the price he receives. This is an assumption, of course. It is not likely that anything remotely like a 40 per cent tax would be required in future years. It is likely that the tax rate would be considerably less in 1991-92 and later years than this year-1990-91. The net producer return, under suspension of the floor price, is likely to be higher than under a continuation of the 700c figure. It is under the 700c figure that very high tax rates would be required. So the assumption of 40 per cent is not accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer asked me about private buyers. Private buyers bought at discounts but then sold the wool at auction and received minimum reserve price support. In other words, private buyers received the benefits of the system, but did not pay the costs of supporting it. They did not bear commercial risk under the minimum reserve price system; the growers had to bear that risk for them. Now that that risk has come back to the growers, sales to private treaty wool merchants are eligible for grower support. Small private buyers are like all other buyers, fairing less when the market reopens. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Senator Archer ignores a few salient points. Firstly, if a private buyer is holding wool to sell on consignment for growers, the growers are eligible for support. Secondly, when the minimum reserve price was operating, private buyers were seeking a benefit that was more than 50 per cent paid for by growers. I understand the private buyers concern but find it difficult to support this argument, obviously, from what I have said. Senator Walters put a series of questions to me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may be Senator Cook's opinion, but the point is that the only discount was for freight. There was a discount on the freight that the farmer would have paid to the store and the broker would have discounted certain selling charges if the wool went to auction. That is all that was discounted. On that the growers paid their 25 per cent wool tax or whatever tax applied at that time. They processed so much wool and put back on the floor what was left over, getting the protection but without having to pay again. That was the situation under the old scheme. The fact that they had a heap of wool already catalogued in the sales that were cancelled I cannot see is any reason for leaving them out totally. They are not overseas companies. They are Australian companies that work-I will not go through all that again; I did so at the second reading stage-in this country and with farmers. They were left out without any explanation whatsoever until we questioned the Minister tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I move on to Senator Cook's figures, and I assure him that I can generally do figures in my head without having to use the back of an envelope. I presume he meant that the price the industry will be getting from now until 30 June would be 375c, and I presume he meant that that would be the price for greasy wool. I am sure that he did not mean that it would be clean wool. For ease of calculation, I took a yield of 66 per cent, which I think is a pretty reasonable figure around Australia because dry areas yield only about 62 per cent and the better areas yield up to 70 per cent. I took my figure of 66 per cent to make it easier. On the back-of-the-envelope calculation or in my head I worked that out as 560c clean. But the Minister did not specify what sort of wool he had in mind-whether it was 21-micron or the average of the clip. Would he explain that? I believe that the industry has not a hope. If we have to get 560c clean for 21-micron wool when the floor was 700c before, and 60 per cent or 70 per cent was being passed in, I believe that the Minister is just looking at the blue sky. Those are the figures he used to debunk my argument that we could be slipping towards a 40 per cent wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I presume that another assumption the Minister made was that all the wool sold would remain constant. But it will not remain constant. What is available will remain constant for one year, as Senator Crane pointed out. We are heading towards another 5.5 million or 5.6 million bales for next year but, again as Senator Crane pointed out, we are not going to sell that. I think we have only ever sold about 3.8 million bales in one year. We will sell only that amount next year. Therefore, the tax has to be worked out on that and not the total amount that we produce. Then we have to discount in the years to come. This problem will not go away tomorrow. We shall have five years of the present position at least before we get out if we are lucky, and seven years if we are unlucky. </PARA>
<PARA> The production of wool in Australia will go down. I cannot see any woolgrower in his right mind who will keep producing wool at the present rate. There will be fringe woolgrowers, especially speculators, around the place-one honourable senator mentioned what would happen in New South Wales public stock routes. They will get right out. That production of 5.5 million bales can go down quite dramatically in three or four years time. I know that the Minister will say that the price will go up. I hope it will, but I do not think it will. Argentina and South Africa and other countries are now growing quite a bit of wool, and that will keep up the production and the price will not run away. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister should think again and give the Committee an answer. He is asking us to give the industry an open cheque to run up what it needs. I have said before, and the Minister did not discount it, that that could be a billion dollars extra, as I think Senator Bell admitted. I believe that the Minister's figures are wrong because he based them on the wrong assumption. He based them on the assumption that production will stay and that the price will be 375c greasy, I presume, and I do not see that we will have a wool tax of anywhere less than 35 per cent. I hope that the Minister will give an answer on those points, especially as to what kind of wool he has in mind when he mentions a figure of 375c. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps Senator Walters could ask her question again and while she is framing it I will answer some of the other questions. Senator Panizza started his contribution on the second helping by talking again about the private treaty merchants. I say once again-and I shall continue to say this if the same questions are asked-that the purpose of the supplementary payments scheme is to benefit growers. The growers and not the private treaty merchants pay the tax. That must always be the consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second element of Senator Panizza's questions was that he believes that my figures are wrong and that his are right. Well, a question of belief is an interesting philosophical debate. My figures are based on Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics calculations, which are based on the weighted averages for the market indicator price. There will be no accounting for, in Senator Panizza's back-of-the-envelope calculations, sale by additional measurement or by weighted tax effect. In the dispute about figures at least I have the recognised Government authority to provide the basis for the calculations I have put forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) asked me to rephrase my question. What will the levy be to the growers to pay their $400m debt at 2.8 per cent and what will the levy be to pay the $600m-these are both just interest rates-in terms of the $3.5 billion once the floor price has gone or should the floor price go after June?

What is the anticipated greasy price for those bales and what is the anticipated clean price for those bales?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister partly answered the other question I asked when he said to Senator Knowles that there were no plans at this stage for sales of assets. My other question was: what plans are there for cutting overheads? Further to that I said that it now appears from what the Minister said in a previous answer that the price to the grower would be netted out and, in fact, would be taken up to 525c. I wanted to get that clarified. That being the case, it means that no tax will be charged to the grower either on what he gets for his wool or what he receives in the deficiency payment. I want that point cleared up because if there is any tax, and it is to be netted out at 525c, that will not be equitable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not press the Minister any further but I hope he realises that growers are trying to plan. They know the floor price has gone. After the first couple of sales they will have a rough idea of what their wool will bring. They will know what it will bring the following year-or have a rough idea of what it will bring the following year. They will have no idea of what levy will be placed on them and the Minister is not giving them any idea for their planning, the debts they have to pay and all the rest that goes with the running of such properties in such a terrible crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Government has to make the assessments. It has to be honest and it has to tell growers what they have to look forward to-what debt has been taken on their behalf and how they are going to be asked to pay it off. All sorts of figures and all sorts of levies have been floating round ever since the floor price went. There have been rumours in the country ever since it was suggested that the floor price be dropped. </PARA>
<PARA> Minister Kerin went overseas making this cast-iron promise that the 700c would remain and he has since said it was very risky. He knew it really could not survive unless China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics came back in. He believes it was his biggest mistake and he should have cancelled the floor price instead of lowering it. </PARA>
<PARA> Who believes the floor price will come back? The growers do not. The buyers do not. The Minister has to be able to give the growers some way of planning their future. I appeal to him and to his advisers beside him to give the growers this information, not hang back. He can give them rough old estimates and at least they would have something to go on. It is all very well for him to say that he does not conduct business that way, but he should give them some idea-will it be 12 per cent? Will it be 20 per cent? Can it be more, once the floor price goes?</PARA>

I think it is very important to answer this question because it certainly affects significantly the levels of borrowings that would be required to pay it out.

<PARA> Question resolved in the negative. </PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment is consistent with the position that has been maintained by the Australian Democrats over a number of years. That position is, and has been, that we support the reserve price scheme, not necessarily as it has become and has been administered recently, but certainly in principle. We believe that part of the role of those who administer the wool sales on behalf of the entire Australian community, not just those who produce, sell and trade in wool, but also those who are affected by our imports and exports, should be to maintain an orderly marketing system. That would be a way of ensuring that there is a fair market. I am reminded of a phrase which is particularly true. It comes from the editorial of the Canberra Times of 14 February, which pointed out that a free market is not a good aim in itself; it must be a fair market as well. That identifies with our position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe that the responsibility for making any alterations to that reserve price scheme rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of this Government, which changed the rules of the game halfway through. In support of our position we have been contacted by several of the interest groups associated with the industry. I will quote some of the information given to us by those in the industry. Recently the Victorian Farmers Federation wrote to me and said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Victorian Farmers Federation Pastoral Council today resolved that the Federal Government must meet the full costs of the supplementary payment scheme for wool growers announced by the Government last week.</PARA>
<PARA>Taking that into account, we believe that we are doing the right thing in moving this amendment. It is not only on that group that we rely for advice; I was also contacted by the Western Australian Farmers Federation Inc. I am sorry that Senator Crane is not here to hear this. The Federation wrote to me and said in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federation believes that section 142 part (1) should be amended to remove any reference to a $300m limit on the Government's contribution. This section should clearly state that the Government will meet the full costs of the supplementary payments scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>I did not rely entirely on the support given to our position by just that organisation; I also took into account a communication received from the Wool Council of Australia. The Wool Council, with which I have been in constant contact over this matter, wrote to me recently and said in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The Council views the removal of the $300m limit on the Government's contribution to the supplementary payments scheme as critical to the future viability of the woolgrowing industry. I am in a position to inform you that if the Senate is forced to reject the Bill in whole or part that such an action would have the unanimous support of all member organisations of the Wool Council of Australia. The Council is fully aware that one of the implications of such an action might be a delay in the resumption of wool sales but believes strongly that the Government's commitment to the 700c a kg reserve price should be honoured and hence all supplementary payments to the end of the season without recourse to increase in the industry's debt. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe that our position is supported, as evidenced there, not only by a maverick group, not only a Johnny-come-lately bunch who might have a few theories that it dreamed up on the way down to a meeting, but also by substantial groups and, I repeat, all grower organisations connected with the Wool Council of Australia. As a matter of fact, I have even been contacted by those who might be considered to be breakaway groups. There are a couple of those in Tasmania and one in New South Wales. They are the groups which took a different line from that adopted by the Wool Council and the Wool Corporation in earlier advice. But on this particular issue of the supplementary payments, and with this particular amendment that I have moved, that support was forthcoming from even those groups that have been described as mavericks. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is hereby given an opportunity to act according to the rhetoric we recently heard about the earlier amendment. Its rhetoric said that an additional burden upon the growers was not what was sought by the Opposition. Here is its chance. The amendment proposes to make the Government accountable for its decisions. The amendment proposes that the full cost be met by those people who changed the rules in the middle of the game. If those who spoke earlier are really concerned about removing the additional burden from the growers, let them demonstrate that concern by sheeting home the full blame to the Government. Let them not hide behind the assertion that because this is a money Bill they are too frightened to suggest to the Government that it take it back. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Archer suggests that the amount be cut off health or some other such government commitment. If what I heard before is correct; that is, that only the 40 per cent of the woolgrowers who have yet to sell their wool this year should carry the whole cost of a Government decision, I really cannot believe that the welfare of the woolgrowers is at the heart of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Opposition wishes to shelter in the assertion that it is a money Bill and should not be voted upon in the Senate or rejected or amended in any way, I remind Opposition senators that on 1 June 1989 Senator Bishop amended the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) to excise the whole of the 15 per cent tax on investment income in the hands of complying superannuation funds. On 15 June 1989 Senator Bishop also made amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1989 to raise the lump sum tax free threshold from $65,000 to $125,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I could give honourable senators other examples but these should be sufficient to show that certainly the alteration of Bills, including money Bills, is not sacrosanct and that they can be touched by the Opposition. This case is by far the best example of something which should be touched. By agreeing with the Democrats' amendment, the Opposition would truly demonstrate its support for our rural industries. </PARA>

We have the one currently standing in the name of the Australian Democrats. There is a second amendment that will follow this one if it is not carried. It is in the name of the Australian Democrats. There is a third amendment to the same clause standing in the name of Senator Boswell. In the interests of time and convenience, it would probably be fair to address comments across all three of those amendments. Perhaps other senators could do likewise. Mr Chairman, would that meet with your concurrence?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. The Australian Democrats' amendment that is currently under consideration by the Committee is very open-ended. It proposes to increase the ceiling figure for the Government subsidy funds from some $300m to `sufficient to pay wool producers the difference between prices paid to wool producers as a consequence . . . and the prices which would have been paid to wool producers if the reserve price had been maintained at 700c'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to take into account the responsibility that this Parliament has in looking at the Government's Budget and the whole ambit of economic management and the economy at the present time. Whilst I acknowledge that the wool industry is of major importance-and I said in the second reading debate that it is very significant-at the same time there are many other industries that must also impact on the Government's Budget. There are many other calls for services and for fair treatment right across the whole ambit of the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no guarantee that the Government would agree to more than $300m. In fact, the Government has consistently said that it will not and cannot give more. Therefore, this amendment, the second amendment proposed by Senator Bell, which contains a formula which lifts the Government's commitment by another $150m, and the amendment proposed by Senator Boswell to lift the ceiling to some $500m, will not be passed by the House of Representatives and, therefore, could only delay the start of the wool sales next week. </PARA>
<PARA> It would, therefore, not be in the interests of woolgrowers to delay this Bill and, as I said, there are certainly impacts on the Australian economy that must be taken into account. I think many honourable senators addressed this matter yesterday and today during the second reading debate. As I said earlier, we need to place this legislation in the perspective of our Budget responsibilities across all sectors of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to argue not just for equity for woolgrowers in a particular scheme-and comparisons have been made in this respect-but for equity between all sectors of all industries that operate in Australia at this time. Certainly, we highlighted yesterday in the second reading debate the very considerable situation that was facing woolgrowers and the extent to which the Government must accept responsibility for that. I think the Government, by providing $300m, has acknowledged that it has a responsibility in that regard. Therefore, I would indicate that the coalition will not be in a position to agree, and certainly would not agree, to either of Senator Bell's amendments to this clause or the amendment that has been proposed by Senator Boswell. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the amendment that I propose to move that will lift the ceiling of supplementary payments by $200m from $300m to $500m. I have not picked out an arbitrary figure. It was not a shot in the dark. It is a figure that I have researched and that I can justify.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is giving a $300m supplementary payment. That is commendable. But the Government cost this industry $500m. This cost can be identified. On 31 May last year the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, dropped the floor price from 870c to 700c. That incident alone cost $600m. The woolgrowers did not make that decision. It was not made by the Australian Wool Corporation, the Wool Council of Australia, the United Graziers Association, Tasmanian farmers or South Australian stock owners and farmers. It was a Government decision. Mr Kerin made that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should we inflict that loss on woolgrowers? That is why I say I am justified in moving an amendment to increase the supplementary payment from $300m to $500m. I believe very sincerely that, if this incident had not happened, the Government would not have had any responsibility. It could have walked away from the whole situation and said, `Well, it is on your head. Your industry made the decision. Your industry let the floor price go until it crashed'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin could have said, `I told you what I thought'. But he did not. He refused every piece of advice that was offered to him by the woolgrowers, the Wool Council, the wool exporters, the weavers, the spinners and the wool industry in general. Everybody involved in the industry told Mr Kerin exactly what would happen. But he did not listen to them. He listened to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Mr Keating and all of his other advisers. But he did not take one bit of notice of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> So it was not the industry's fault that Mr Kerin cost it $600m. It is the Government's fault. The Government is the culprit and it is the one that should pick up that $200m. If that happened, the industry could achieve some equity. That is why I believe that lifting the payment to $500m can be justified and supported. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that this is an immense amount of money. But the Government cost the industry an immense amount of money. Why should the farmers have to pay for Mr Kerin's mistakes? The ball is firmly in his court. Equity in the wool stockpile fell by $600m because Mr Kerin would not listen to anyone in the industry. He did not understand the market philosophy and he has now cost this industry between $500m and $600m. He is a Minister of the Crown, he is a Minister of the Government and he and the Government are responsible for his actions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) a question which relates to the three amendments, at least one of which ought to be supported by the Committee. I heartily endorse the remarks that Senator Boswell has just made in respect of where the responsibility lies for the total disruption and the potential destruction of the Australian wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the person who brought the voice of the industry into this chamber when the initial interference with the industry was perpetrated by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) on behalf of an economic rationalist free market oriented ideological government, I feel that it is essential that I ask the Minister the following question: has the Government, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics or anyone determined what it will cost if hundreds of farmers to go out of production? These farmers cannot switch to wheat because the Government stuffed that up as well just a little while before it stuffed up the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In both cases it did this, of course, in collusion with the Opposition, with the honourable exception of Senator Boswell and one or two of his colleagues. What is going to be the cost of the loss of hundreds of growers from the industry? What will be the cost in terms of the many rural industries-I do not know how many-and all that they contribute to the Australian community?</PARA>
<PARA> During the second reading debates in this place and in the other place, I heard talk from the Government side about rural adjustment, rural counselling, and helping people through this period. But this is happening in a climate of contraction of support by the Government for social welfare payments and income support payments which is, again, heartily endorsed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> What will be this social cost which will have to come out in dollars and which will have to come out in heartache, in loss and in despair? Has the Government done a costing of that? If it has, what is it? Therefore, why can it not support at least one of these amendments, all of which sheet the responsibility home to where it should be, to a government which interfered in an industry against the advice of that industry and certainly against the wishes of the Australian Democrats at the time?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly to these two amendments. I certainly cannot support Senator Bell's amendment because of the reason he has given, namely, it is open ended. I would like to speak to a point that Senator Powell made when she said that this side of politics stuffed up the wheat industry. Perhaps she can tell us the next time she rises to her feet whether we started the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade war, if she has ever heard of it. That is what stuffed up the wheat industry. I cannot support Senator Boswell's amendment either because he moved the wrong amendment for the right reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe the Government is to blame for the stockpile being so high, because the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) ran around the world telling people the price was ironclad. That added $1 billion. He did not have the gumption to bring the 870c down to 700c or get rid of the reserve price earlier. That is where we went wrong, so we built up the debt. I believe the Government is at fault. I have never criticised Mr Kerin in his portfolio before this wool debate. We have built up this stockpile because of his inaction in the first place and then his proaction in running around the world telling everyone it was viable at 700c, resulting in our having a stockpile twice as big as it should be. So it is the Government's responsibility. It uses up the assets of the Corporation and then tries to get out of it that way. I am sorry but I cannot support the amendments of Senator Boswell and Senator Bell. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the initiative of Senator Tambling in suggesting to the Committee that we debate these three amendments together. I think it has brought the Committee alive, a bit at least, and brought the coincidence of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Senator Boswell) and the Australian Democrats supporting a similar point of view against the rest of us. It is often the case that the Government enjoys the support of the Democrats on amendments. This is not one of those occasions. We regret it is not, but we are familiar with the view of the Democrats on money Bills and money responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I endorse the remarks of Senator Tambling about what it is a government must take care of in framing a Budget and meeting reasonable Budget outcomes. So, on this occasion, while I recognise the conscientiousness and sincerity of the views held by Senator Boswell and the way in which he speaks of them from the heart, and some of the views of the Democrats, despite the passion, the commitment and the emotion, nonetheless those views are wrong and cannot be supported. To accept Senator Bell's amendment would mean we would have an open cheque or a `hand in the pocket' of taxpayers to supplement beyond the $300m, whatever else was the costing. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that is a reasonable course of action for any government to embark upon. As has been said, $300m is a huge amount. It is a responsible contribution by the Government and, in the circumstances, we believe as well that growers should take some responsibility so that the price is not just driven too low and the supplementation is taken out of the pocket of the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, we cannot support the Senator Bell amendment or the Senator Boswell amendment, which is different only in degree, not in type. The changes to the legislation which brought about the Wool Marketing Act in 1987 were designed to put the Australian Wool Corporation on a more sound commercial footing and to allow it to operate without the intrusion of the Government. It was therefore responsible, with the Wool Council of Australia, for its own commercial decisions. This change in legislation, I point out, received the full support of the Opposition at the time and it is being consistent now. By asking the Government to fund the full supplementary payments scheme, the Australian taxpayers are being asked to pay for the failed consequences of decisions taken by the wool industry, were that to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question that Senator Powell has asked me about particular calculations. I think that some of the circumstances she postulates about what should give rise to those calculations are hypothetical. But I can say, given the issues and the concerns that she has raised, that the Government will provide additional funds for carry-on assistance, for debt reconstruction, for farm improvement, for household support, and for counselling for individual farmers. The details of that assistance will be settled in the Cabinet's April review of the rural adjustment scheme and the rural counselling program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I was distracted, in fact while my back was turned, an agreement was reached to debate these amendments-my first amendment, then Senator Boswell's amendment, and then my amendment which is headed `Option B', which has just been circulated. As far as I can understand it, two arguments have been put for not supporting my first amendment. The first is that it is open ended. That is patently ridiculous. There is a finite amount of wool. When it is sold, there is no further commitment so it is not open ended; it is finite in that sense. It is also finite because it commits the Government to meet up to 700c only. The people who describe it as open ended are the very people who earlier in the debate were figuring out how much it might be. Those estimates ranged from $616m to $800m or so, and we had speculatory figures given from all sorts of sources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those are the figures which would apply to this commitment. Therefore, it is finite. It is not infinite. It is not open ended. There are two limits to it. One is the amount of wool to be sold. The second is the price to be paid for that wool, which would be no more than 700c. So it is patently ludicrous to suggest that it is open ended; it is not. If that frightens either the Government or the Opposition into not supporting it, then my second amendment does have the sort of discipline and limit which is suggested by the Opposition has to be applied to this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In case anybody is incapable of understanding it, I point out that the second amendment is merely to add a dollar for dollar arrangement to apply after the Government's promised $300m. That dollar for dollar arrangement would cease after the Government had been required to find an extra $150m which, up to that point, would be met by the Australian Wool Corporation. So there is a finiteness to that at the point of $600m worth of commitment. After that, the expenses which may occur would be met by the Australian Wool Corporation as a whole. The responsibility in that one, therefore, would be a shared responsibility with a limited Government commitment. So the complaints that are addressed to the first one are met by the second one. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea that any of this holds up wool sales is unbelievably naive. The wool sales have been suspended by ministerial decree; they could start again now by similar device. I am incredulous at the suggestion that doing anything to this legislation would hold up wool sales. That is to have not paid attention even when they were suspended in the first place. So I offer that rejoinder to the criticism of my amendments and I again implore the Opposition to demonstrate its commitment to the farmers. It was demonstrated in the rhetoric of its members earlier; let us see some action now. </PARA>

<PARA>2. Clause 4, page 3, omit proposed section 146, lines 21 to 24, substitute the following section:</PARA>
<PARA> Disposing of wool stocks</PARA>
<PARA> `` `146. While guidelines are in force under section 144:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) for a period of 12 months beginning on the commencement of this Part, the Corporation must not sell, charge or otherwise dispose of its stocks of wool or wool products except in very limited circumstances as prescribed by regulation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) in any period after that described in paragraph (a), the Corporation shall sell, charge or otherwise dispose of its stocks of wool or wool products only in a publicised, orderly and predictable manner, as prescribed in a subsequent enactment.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>We certainly need to create certainty in the wool stockpile and its reduction. The coalition believes that the criteria or guidelines for the sale of wool from the stockpile of 4.8 million bales should be incorporated in legislation, rather than just regulations, in order to create confidence in the wool market. The criteria should be to freeze release from the stockpile for 12 months to allow the market to settle and growers to sell the large amount of wool still being produced. Only minimal release should be allowed for the initial period to meet contracts and in special circumstances and, after that, on a well-publicised and predictable basis. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are proposing in this amendment sets up the criteria that ensures that that is the manner in which it would be carried out. Any guidelines that are developed will have to minimise the impact of stockpile releases on the operation of the market and be transparent and flexible enough to recognise the inherently commercial nature of sales from the stockpile. We want guidelines for the management of the stockpile in the legislation package that will be brought forward later in the session. I would certainly issue a challenge to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and to the Government that the subsequent legislation to be produced for the ongoing good of the industry make some commitments in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to note the contribution today by Senator West, the only Labor Party senator prepared to participate in this debate. I commend Senator West for having the courage to come in here and put her personal views. I do not agree with many of them. In fact, her qualifications for participating in a wool debate relied on the fact that she lived on a family farm in 1969 and 1970 and her brother had to go and drive a truck. I am sure there are many other Labor Party senators who would have more identification with the wool industry and with the problems today, but not one of them had the courage to come in here and put down their views. </PARA>
<PARA> I would invite anybody to look at the rest of Senator West's speech in Hansard, because I am sure it will be seen for what it is-an historical document of one Labor Party senator who was prepared to come in here and make a contribution without prompting from the advisers' bar. In the early part of Senator West's speech she said that she had listened to the contributions made by members of all parties. I do not know how she even heard from one other member of her Party because at that stage the second reading speech of the Minister had only been formally tabled. She had not even heard it, let alone read it-very obviously, from the comments that she made. We are looking very carefully at an industry that requires careful handling and it is an issue that many of my colleagues, the 13 Liberal and National Party senators who made an excellent contribution to this debate, addressed in the second reading stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly to support what Senator Tambling has said. This is probably the most important amendment that we have had this evening; not that the others have not had a certain amount of merit. It has already been pointed out what is in the stockpile now, but we do not really know what is there because figures are available only to 1 January. Senator Tambling said that, at a present figure of 4.8 million bales, another 5.5 million bales are going to be shorn between now and this time this year. That adds up 10.3 million bales being available in the next 12 months. If one pours them onto the market without order, it is going to cause a great amount of chaos. I would also remind the Committee that we have never sold more than four million bales in one year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to touch on the point made by Senator West. She said that her brother in 1969 had to get a job as a truck driver because of the downturn in wool at the time. I sympathise with her, but I can assure honourable senators that there will be many more people doing the same thing, and this time the jobs will not be there for them with the unemployment that we have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this amendment. In doing so I would like to join with previous speakers in congratulating Senator West for coming in here and making her contribution. Earlier, in answer to a question I asked, Senator Cook said that the estimate on which the 12 per cent tax figure for the coming years was based is that 893 million kilos will be sold in the 1991-92 season. That is the equivalent of 5,016,685 bales at 178 kilos per bale, which is the figure that the Australian Wool Corporation uses. To achieve this figure, it is absolutely essential that the stockpile be frozen for at least 12 months and a very strategic plan put in place on the management for future years, whether it be one, two, three, four or five years, or whatever it might be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say this against the background of our winning back the confidence of the world users. It is worth noting in terms of that figure of five million bales that we have achieved close to that figure only once. I believe that was in the 1987-88 season, but I stand to be corrected on that. If we look through the figures we see that in 1988-89 we produced 898 million kilos of wool, which is the equivalent of 5,044,943 bales. The stockpile that year was 188,300 bales. We sold 4,823,843 bales, which I believe is the second highest on record and significantly less than the 5,000,016 bales that is anticipated by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) in the figures that Senator Cook quoted to me. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1988-89 season we produced 1,040 million kilograms, which is the equivalent of 5,842,696 bales. The stockpile grew to 3,064,600 bales and that year we sold-that is, the season just gone past-2,966,396 bales, which is, significantly, some two million bales fewer than what is anticipated for the coming season. We do know now that the stockpile stands at 4.8 million bales or thereabouts. </PARA>
<PARA> In addressing this particular amendment and emphasising the importance of proper management in the next 12 months, I hope the figures that Senator Cook has quoted to us from ABARE are correct, but I have grave doubts whether they will be. It will require a recovery of almost unparalleled belief in terms of any industry. Whether we reach that figure or not, it is very important in this total context that the signals on the management of the stockpile be made very clear. In terms of the ABARE predictions, I put on the record that ABARE was one of the advisers to Minister Kerin when the reserve price was lowered from 870c to 700c. The rationale that was given then was that we were moving back to the world trend line. I have grave doubts-and I do not want to pour cold water on this-that that figure is achievable in the next selling year. I just hope and pray that it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us be clear what section we are trying to amend and what that section says. Proposed sub-section 146 purely says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>While guidelines are in force under section 144, the Corporation must sell, charge or otherwise dispose of its stocks of wool or wool products in accordance with those guidelines and not otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>It tells us nothing. We do not have the guidelines, we do not have a clue. It tells us absolutely nothing. If the Government had the guidelines here, and those guidelines gave us some information, then that would be one thing. This gives us not a clue, nothing. I have a copy of a news release that the Australian Wool Corporation put out on 19 February. Its suggestion is that all sales of Australian wool stock held in Australia-and I emphasise `held in Australia'-will cease with the resumption of sales on 25 February. All sales of the Wool Corporation's stock held overseas will cease on 25 March in order to allow overseas processors with urgent commitments to have access to wool. Sales from overseas stock during the period up to 25 March will be allowed for inventory adjustment purposes, but will be at prices no less than the equivalent of the 700c floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither the wool stock referred to held in Australia nor the wool stock held overseas has a restarting date for sales. In both instances the Corporation says they will cease, one on 25 February and the other on 25 March, but there is no restarting date. It is fun, is it not? We do not have a clue what the Wool Corporation is suggesting-just that they will cease on those dates. Are they never to be re-opened? Will they be opened again 12 months later, five months later or a week later? The Government tells us that it will all be done according to its guidelines. Is it any wonder that the Senate cannot possibly go along with that rubbish? We have to know what the Government is suggesting. We have to have some indication, and we certainly cannot get it from either the Government or the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, our amendment is for freezing for a period of 12 months at the commencement of this part of the Act. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Corporation must not sell, charge or otherwise dispose of its stocks of wool or wool products except in very limited circumstances as prescribed by regulation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It makes it pretty clear that even though regulations are to come up with the detail, for 12 months the stock will not be sold. The amendment continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in any period after that described in paragraph (a), the Corporation shall only sell, charge or otherwise dispose of its stocks of wool or wool products in a publicised, orderly and predictable manner, as prescribed in a subsequent enactment. </PARA>
<PARA> So at least with our amendment the wool growers-who surely are the people we are meant to be helping-will know what to expect. The next wool sale starts on Monday in Sydney. The growers do not have a clue how long the stockpile will be frozen or whether it is going to be frozen at all by the Government's legislation that we are putting through at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is very keen on passing legislation without any guidelines. It refers to the guidelines that will eventually come but does not give the Senate any indication of what they are. I ask the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) whether he can now give us some indication of what period of time those stockpiles are meant to be held for without any sales taking place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the Minister was talking about something else. I heard it in my office and it may not have been about this matter that he was giving these guarantees. I say for the benefit of Senator Tambling that I too-probably along with a number of people in the Senate who are more familiar with other areas of industry than the wool industry-am perfectly well aware that the industry is facing a great crisis and there are large numbers of people going to be affected dramatically. A lot of families on farms are going to be hit, not least people with whom I have close contact. Although my knowledge of the industry is not great, I have attempted to listen to what is being said and have tried to decide what needs to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Somebody in the second reading debate raised a question about the stockpile and indicated that one of the factors that should be taken into consideration is whether the stockpile should be used to promote wool as a low cost, popular fibre. I do not know who raised that during the debate, but I think it is something we need to take into account. The same speaker was indicating that the Australian Wool Corporation had been concentrating on the elite nature of wool and suggested that we ought to get into the low cost area. Figures such as 10 per cent down to 4 per cent were the figures that were mentioned by one of the speakers. </PARA>
<PARA> As a percentage of all the clothing fibres that are used world wide, wool is now only 4 per cent as against 10 per cent maybe five or six years ago. That should be a great worry to us and it should be relevant to our consideration, I believe, of how to dispose of the stockpile. The stockpile is 4.8 million bales which is quite a lot of wool. It is more wool than has been sold per annum over the past few years. Also to be considered is what it costs the industry to keep maintaining that stockpile. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not be supporting this amendment. One of the justifications for bringing forward this amendment was given as being an opportunity to bring confidence into the wool market. This proposition will further distort what will be a very distorted version of what is described as a free market, which is in no way a free market because of the distortions that are brought to bear upon it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine mentioned one of those distortions, and that is that there will be additional costs brought to the growers by the very Party which earlier tonight hoped to remove costs from growers. The cost of storage of that stockpile while frozen, as we were informed by Senator Boswell, is of the order of $450m a year, with no chance of earning any returns while it is frozen. </PARA>
<PARA> The other distortions are brought about by the very fact that maintaining the stockpile is as much a threat to potential market prices as if it were not frozen for one year. Just the fact that it is there and that buyers are able to anticipate that after one year it will begin to dribble onto the market brings a distortion which is more than psychological; in fact, it is a true distortion. </PARA>
<PARA> The other distortions that will exist in this potential so-called free market are brought about at the moment by the knowledge on the part of buyers that 700c will be returned to growers regardless of what the market does. That distorts the buyers' input and makes it not a free market. </PARA>
<PARA> By freezing the stockpile we reduce the capacity of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) to meet its task of marketing wool with flexibility and imagination. This relates to the imagination that is required to follow some of the suggestions that were made by Senator Harradine. But the option to follow those suggestions will be removed by freezing the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity to take advantage of any unpredicted circumstance which arises during the next year is removed by this freezing. Nobody can predict what will occur. People this evening have tried to predict and suggest what-ifs, and quite rightly the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) was not prepared to answer questions on that basis. Certainly this is a great what-if, except that we are removing the option to meet some of the unpredictabilities. We are in this mess because of our inability to predict. If two years ago we had been able to predict what prices or the market would do, there would have been less chance of our now being in this mess. Our inability to predict caused this predicament. If we freeze the stockpile, we will reduce the capacity to meet unpredictable circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The absolute killer so far as I am concerned on this idea is that it comes from a group which earlier suggested that the AWC should sell some of its assets. They are now telling us to freeze the biggest asset possessed by the Corporation, and such a suggestion is ridiculous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the freezing of the stockpile. I believe that it is the right way to go. We will find 2.5 million bales of wool coming onto the market in the next three or four months. We already have in the stockpile 4.8 million bales or maybe five million bales at a cost of $4 billion. That is the rough equation. The other part of the equation is that there will not be enough supplementary payments and borrowings to cover the full 700c, as I think everyone acknowledges. If we unfreeze the stockpile or let it go, that will force down the market. It will force the wool price down to maybe 200c or less. That will then increase the tax on the reduced price of the wool. So if the wool falls now to 300c, the tax will be 41 per cent; if it goes lower, the tax must go higher.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say in reply to Senator Harradine that in January we almost get out of gaol with the floor price. Sales picked up and went up to probably 60 per cent purchases by the trade, maybe a little higher, and then some wool was released from the stockpile. That fine balancing act got out of kilter and the market then went down again. I suppose it is a balancing act in itself whether one is prepared to cop the $450m in storage and interest rates, or whether one freezes the position. But we are really talking about a $4 billion asset, and one has to look at that in the perspective of $4 billion to $450m. On balance I would come down to a freezing of the stockpile because I think that it is the only way that the market will rise. The higher the market rises, the less tax the growers have to pay. On balance, I support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add to what the two previous speakers have said about the importance of freezing the stockpile and explain some of the rationale behind it. It is really all about supply and demand. Freezing the stockpile will give the industry time to adjust its production down much closer to demand. Once again I will quote one of the figures which we got from the Minister tonight-which I am grateful for-of the anticipated sale of just over five million bales in the next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Anticipated production will be in excess of that figure. We have already seen some 10 million sheep taken out through the flock reduction scheme, and there needs to be a period of time to allow further reductions in flock numbers to get production down so that the stockpile can then be put onto the market without distorting it too much. In terms of some of the points that Senator Harradine raised, I hope I have explained the rationale behind freezing the stockpile to allow production to come down. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point concerns the amount of wool we have to put out into the market now. I believe there will be sufficient wool in those five million bales to allow us to penetrate into those types of markets that some of us mentioned during the second reading debate. I think the rationale to allow the industry to settle down, to allow the buyers to settle down and to allow production to get back in line with demand is the fundamental reason behind freezing this stockpile and then having a proper management plan to release it into the market over the next three, four or five years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Archer said earlier in this debate that there needs to be a lot of goodwill in the future for managing the situation. I agree with that. I must say, as well, that Senator Bell, in his contribution, treated the Committee to an objective analysis of the likely considerations were the stockpile to be frozen and came to an on-balance consideration of the outcomes. Certainly I adopt the analysis that he made on that point as an analysis that, I think, is right and reasonable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Opposition wants to do in amending this Bill is to provide that for a period of 12 months the stockpile will be frozen except for such exceptions as allowed by regulation. After that period the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) will be able to sell only in a manner prescribed in subsequent legislation. The Government is already operating like this. On Tuesday the AWC announced, with the concurrence of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), the stockpile management rules that will apply for the rest of the year. Perhaps I should just say what they are. </PARA>
<PARA> All sales from the stockpile in Australia will cease as from 25 February. Sales from the stockpile in Europe can continue until 25 March in small amounts for inventory adjustment purposes, but at no less than the 700c floor price. The only exceptions are for contracts entered into by the AWC before 25 February and for wool to meet the technical requirements of the International Wool Secretariat market development projects. These guidelines will be gazetted tomorrow along with the supplementary payments schedule guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has already said that the longer term stock management guidelines will be announced as part of a larger package of measures to manage the AWC's debt position, as part of the Government's response to the report of the Vines committee of inquiry into wool marketing. I can understand the Opposition's desire to nail down the stockpile management situation. However, what it is trying to do, with all due respect, is simplistic. The stockpile cannot be managed in isolation from the AWC's debt structure; neither can it be managed in isolation from promotion and marketing policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Managing the stockpile will be a difficult balancing act in itself. Many people accept that. Some want simple one-off solutions. The complex task of drawing up the long term guidelines will be done after proper investigation of the stockholdings and not on a knee jerk basis. Selling wool from the stockpile is an inherently commercial activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The longer term guidelines need some flexibility so that, within reason, the AWC can respond to the market quickly. If this amendment were to be passed, the ability to respond to market factors quickly would be removed-and in a commercial manner so that it cannot be speculated against. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to Senator Walter's question: how long will the stockpiles be held? It is a question she explicitly asked. It is a matter for further consideration in terms of debt exposure, Treasury and Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics input and, importantly, further consideration based on the findings of the Vines report. On that basis, with the goodwill that was spoken of earlier, this matter can be managed, but to oppose mechanistic solutions for short term purposes seems to me to fly in the face of rationality in much the same way as exposed by Senator Bell's contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To put Senator Harradine's mind at rest concerning the figures of 4 per cent and 5 per cent, in the past few years the biggest problem not only for Australia's woolgrowers but for woolgrowers around the world is that wool as a fibre has lost one per cent of the world market. Whereas wool used to have a 5 per cent share of the world market, it has now dropped back to 4 per cent. That has made all the difference. Earlier Senator Harradine said that we had the biggest clout in the world in the wool market. We used to have the biggest clout. I said that in my second reading contribution yesterday. But we have gone away from that, for a couple of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, Australia gave up the ban on exporting genetic merino material; however, that is another argument. So the results of that are coming through. We also have the influences of Uruguay, China and other places. Honourable senators might not know that one other country grows more wool than Australia-it is either China or Russia-but it uses its wool internally, so it does not come onto world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine is right. That is our problem. The mistake that the Australian Wool Corporation has made in three or four years has been that it did not concentrate on marketing wool as a fibre; it was marketed as high fashion material for women's clothing, or something similar, with very low micron wool being used. That is the whole point. If we are interested in the industry as a whole, we have to chase that one per cent market share. Then we will sell all the wool we want to. I believe that that is where we should concentrate our efforts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 4, pages 3 and 4, proposed section 147, line 26 (page 3) to line 22 (page 4), omit the section. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason for my requested amendments is that they propose to omit from the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill proposed section 147. This section provides for what are called special powers of the Minister. If passed, this section will reduce the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) and its directors to puppets and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will be able to sack, at will, the directors of the Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has long been a standing issue in my Party that the growers must always have control of the marketing of their products. This Party was established on that basis. I do not care to change that direction at the moment. It can be argued that the section is unnecessary because there are already extensive powers of control of the Corporation provided to the Minister under the Wool Marketing Act 1987. Under the Act, the Minister already has extensive powers of control over the Corporation and its membership. These are set out at length in divisions 3 and 4 of the Act. I will not go into them at length. But I will mention some: directors of the Corporation are appointed by the Minister; they hold office under terms and conditions of his choosing; they are appointed for between two and three years; the Minister can terminate the appointment of one or more of the appointed directors; and the Minister has extensive power and control over the selection of membership of the Corporation. To increase these controls and provide special powers for the Minister, as is proposed by this Bill, would be to undermine the whole concept of the independent professional Australian Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want the Minister to be able to appoint someone who has no philosophy, no understanding and no sympathy for the wool industry. I have moved this amendment because the Bill takes away control from the Wool Corporation and puts it in the hands of a Minister. That is not correct and I do not believe the woolgrowers believe it is correct. They pay for the Corporation. They pay for it through their taxes and their levies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the earlier amendment that Senator Boswell moved, this is rather like an ambit claim. The earlier amendment was an ambit claim for the use of $500m of taxpayers' funds, obviously on behalf of Senator Boswell's pressure groups and interested parties. The amendment as circulated is in an incorrect protocol form. It is circulated in the name of Senator Boswell, Leader of the National Party in the Senate. This is unfortunate. I regret that it has happened in that manner. Senator Boswell has obviously given a personal direction to the Clerk in that regard. This is inconsistent with coalition policy. It is a personal stance and certainly not endorsed by the Party. There was no discussion in the National Party rooms of the Senate or of the Parliament about the issues canvassed in Senator Boswell's amendment. The details raised in the amendment were not even mentioned by Senator Boswell in his speech during the second reading debate on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have carefully looked at the clause that Senator Boswell seeks to delete. We have looked at the powers that are necessary. We draw the comparison with the Wheat Marketing Act and other statutory authorities where the Minister does have and must have the power to exercise these sorts of controls. It is important to note that some of the members of the Australian Wool Corporation have been called upon to resign by speakers and many people. It is obvious that others are thinking about resigning. The fact that important interim measures are necessary, particularly in the time between now and 30 June, is important and should be properly addressed. The coalition does not support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not see anything ambit about this claim at all. In fact, the first mention of this was made by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. To pretend that that subject was not raised is really quite nasty. That is the only word to describe what has been done here. Ignoring the semantics of whose name is on what piece of paper and the petty jealousies that might arise, I will repeat what has been done to me earlier tonight in betraying a confidence. I think that Senator Tambling was posturing. The matter was discussed with me by Senator Tambling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Discussions took place about which amendments would get up and which would be put up and by whom. If the coalition was unsure about who was going to do what, perhaps that is explained by the sorts of media releases put out in the name of Mr Bruce Lloyd, Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, shadow Minister for primary industry, dated 11 February 1990, in which Mr Lloyd said in part that the coalition would now study the Government's proposal and await the legislation to see how things were handled before formulating a response. It is the very delay of that response which has occasioned this conglomeration of opinions tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the amendment because it was raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I raised it during my speech in the second reading debate. If other honourable senators were concerned about the questions raised by that Committee, they would have addressed the matter and decided their opinion much earlier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not support Senator Boswell's amendment. The situation is that the Minister cannot dismiss the board but, as has been rightly said by Senator Tambling, board members have been called upon in speeches around the country to resign. One has to be prudent in framing legislation on a sensitive issue such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the board were to resign the procedures to reappoint the board by the normal route of consultation and involvement would take up to six weeks or more to occur. That is because they have to be exhaustive and extensive. One could picture a weird situation: if the board yielded to the calls of those who call upon it to resign, there would be a six-week vacuum in the Australian Wool Corporation. That is not in anyone's interest. Therefore, the Government does not support this amendment. It believes that in circumstances such as that the Minister should be able to have the power, and this Parliament should clothe him with the power, to be able to appoint a board to mind the store while the proper consultative procedures for an ongoing permanent board are exhausted and the appointments made. We do not support the amendment for those reasons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak against this amendment. In doing so I point out a couple of things about people in the Senate and elsewhere who are involved in the woolgrowing industry, and I happen to be one of them. I have not heard one woolgrower senator stand up in this debate and speak for this amendment. That is very crucial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also refer to a point that a number of us mentioned during our speeches. I refer particularly to the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair, who highlighted what was removed from the Act in 1987. In effect, that was the ministerial powers in terms of reporting, financial controls and a number of other aspects. It is now generally concluded by most experts that that is where the reserve price scheme went wrong. That discipline in financial control and management was taken away. The accountability was taken away. </PARA>
<PARA> I would suggest respectfully that Senator Boswell should think very carefully about the words that were used in the speech of the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair because I think they provide all the answers as to why this chamber should not support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> The Federation strongly objects to Section 147 which aims to give special powers to the Minister until 1 July 1992. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I did not intend to speak again in this debate this evening. But in view of what has taken place in the chamber since the amendment was moved, I felt that I had to rise once again. I am sure that this amendment is the result of a letter from the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) that I presume was sent to all members of this chamber and the other chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said in my speech during the second reading stage that the AWC wants to build into this legislation security of tenure for its position. In other words, it wants to eliminate any clause by which it could be removed. We reckon that we should change that sort of arrangement in respect of the waterfront. I am not going to stand here and defend a system under which a body can keep its position forever and a day and not be removed by way of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment briefly on proposed section 148(2) (b). In his introductory remarks this evening during the committee stage, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) acknowledged that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, had reached an acceptable understanding with the Liberal and National parties and the Australian Democrats and it was not necessary to proceed with the amendment that I had circulated earlier with regard to proposed section 148(2) (b).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was pleased to note the comments of the Minister for Industrial Relations that the application of any regulations that will be put in place under this proposed section will apply only to the operation of supplementary payments, and also that any such changes would not be included in subsequent legislative packages to be brought in later this year. Senator Cook also acknowledged that this should not be seen to create in any way a precedent. I share the concern of many honourable senators on this side of the chamber-in particular, that of Senator Vanstone and Senator Macdonald-who alerted the Senate to issues that were raised under the Scrutiny of Bills report and the need for being very cautious with regard to the monitoring of excessive powers. But because of the fact that both Senator Cook and Mr Kerin have given firm and strong commitments in this regard, I will not proceed with the amendment circulated earlier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Tambling has already said, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has given us some sort of guarantee that, if we do not put our amendment to the clause giving the Minister the authority to override the whole Act, he will introduce regulations and therefore we should be satisfied. The thing that concerns me is that this should be seen as a precedent. It really is of great concern that, written into a piece of legislation, it could be that a Minister has the power to amend any provision of the Act under this part. Whether he is to put it in guidelines or otherwise, it seems to me quite incredible that the Government should even contemplate that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that Senator Cook, in the statement that he made to the Senate, has put in a particular provision saying that this should not be seen to create a precedent. I am pleased to see that in, and I ask the Minister the only remaining question that is of concern to me. What the Minister has promised is that Mr Kerin should adequately consult with the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the shadow Minister, on the use of that particular subsection. Could he tell me what `adequately' means? Is it a fact of saying to the shadow Minister, `This is what I am going to do.'? Or is it an agreement between him and the shadow Minister? It does not say `only after agreement'. It just says `adequately consult'. There is a very big difference between `adequately consult' and `only after agreement' with the shadow Minister. Could the Minister explain what `adequately consult' is? Seeing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, is in the chamber, I am sure it would not be a very difficult thing for him to ask. Come on, Mr Kerin. Do give him the indication--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to answer the question that has been put to me obviously, but first to acknowledge for the record the comments of Senator Tambling and to confirm again the undertaking given at the end of my second reading speech. That does include the words that he sought to add, and which we have accepted; but that it is not to set a precedent. I confirm that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walters has raised the question of what the meaning of the word `adequately' is. I think the best way of answering that is to go to the letter that was sent by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) to the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the shadow Minister, on the subject of this assurance that I have read into the second reading debate. The relevant passage in the letter to Mr Bruce Lloyd from Mr Kerin is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>My undertaking to consult on the use of the section was genuine. Consequently, should it be necessary to use the provision, I will give you adequate time to make a considered response. </PARA>
<PARA> It is on the understanding of that comment that the words were settled between the shadow Minister and the Minister as being sufficient to cover the circumstances. I think it does say one thing about the trust that operates between those two members of the House of Representatives, and I think meets the point of the Opposition, and should meet the point raised by Senator Walters. It should adequately dispose of this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Before we allow the passage of this Bill, I once more briefly implore the Opposition not to be bluffed by this Government's threat that wool sales will be disrupted; not to be bluffed by the fact that any rejection of this will require a further sitting of Parliament-after all, it is not even one o'clock on Friday morning and there are some 23 hours to go today.

<PARA> If the coalition is serious about the statement made by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the shadow Minister, on behalf of the coalition, that this wool package is irresponsible and inadequate, if the coalition seriously agrees with the statement by its spokesperson on this that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has failed to provide any leadership on wool at a time when the industry desperately needs it and if the coalition supports that statement by its spokesperson, it will join us in not supporting the passage of this Bill. I say again that it is not necessary to interrupt wool sales by defeating this particular proposition. The Democrats will not be supporting its passage. The bluff has not worked on us, and we do have the interests of the wool industry at heart and the welfare of the growers. I make that last plea to the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the comments just made by Senator Bell, it is very interesting to reflect on the history and the record of the Australian Democrats with regard to the rural sector in Australia. Probably one of the most telling situations is to reflect on the fact that the Australian Democrats have voted for every tax increase that has ever come before this Parliament and the impact that that has had on the farmers. One has only to look at the policy of the Australian Democrats with regard to capital gains tax, with regard to the environment and with regard to so many other areas that impact on the rural community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the hour, I shall not detain the Senate too long, but there are a number of matters that I wish to raise. I rise in this adjournment debate to put forward another aspect of the South Australian State Bank debacle. It gives me no joy to do so. I have always had an affinity with the State Bank of South Australia and a desire to see it grow tall in the banking arena around Australia. Now I feel let down, as do many other South Australians, for I, like them, have wanted to have a trust in that financial institution in South Australia. In fact, it was in 1962 as a teenager that I started my working career in its predecessor. In 1982, as a politician and as Leader of the Opposition-I supported the merger of the State Bank and the Savings Bank of South Australia which was to give us the bank as we know it today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In late 1988 and early 1989, as Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, I found myself in a situation where it became clear that the Premier, John Bannon, needed to be questioned in Parliament about the more aggressive business dealings of the State Bank-business dealings which were showing every indication of being as unsuccessful as they had been unwise. As Opposition Leader I was faced with a bank advertising that it had its heart in South Australia, yet with evidence growing daily on my desk that at the same time it was losing an arm and a leg both interstate and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of people have approached me in the past two weeks since the bank's financial crisis has finally become public and suggested a feeling of `I told you so'. I do not, in fact. Rather, I feel an enormous sense of frustration that factors in South Australia-predominantly the combined arrogance and well-documented inaction of the Premier-allowed the very visible smoke signals of disaster in the State Bank two years ago to go quite unheeded. He was, I admit, aided in his inaction by a strong view in South Australia that the bank was a sacred cow; it was untouchable. </PARA>
<PARA> While both the bank and the Premier were supposed to be accountable to the people of South Australia, it seemed that neither was willing to be so. As we began to inquire into the bank, the Premier's minders worked hard on many Adelaide journalists. So, as we probed and prodded for answers into the bank's dealings with companies such as the failed Equiticorp, generally we found it was ourselves, the Opposition, not the Government, which was criticised and under fire from the media. The bank's corporate public relations machine also moved quickly into top gear and soon not only were the media questioning our role and our reasons for asking such questions, but so too was the business community. </PARA>
<PARA> Some two years later, in February 1991, I find it absolutely unacceptable to listen to a Premier saying that he did not know and he had not had any warnings. Of course he had had warnings-two whole years of them. There is none so blind as he who does not want to see; and he did not. But he really has nowhere to hide on this issue. Even if the royal commission finds that he did not know of the details or the extent of the bank's problems until the end of January this year, we told him two years ago that we had reason to believe that there were concerns which he and the bank should address. </PARA>
<PARA> As the owner of the bank it was his clear duty to follow through on these concerns on behalf of the taxpayers of South Australia. Even if he thought, as his minders told anyone who would listen, that it was all the Opposition's imagination and a scare campaign in an attempt to win government, he still had a duty to investigate questions put to him in Parliament. We received no answers, only ridicule and put-downs. Perhaps he was given the wrong information by the bank, but with names such as the controversial and failed Equiticorp and valid questions about other loans, just how much does it take to get John Bannon to see that smoke means fire?</PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who has read the South Australian Hansards for 1989 has seen the warnings-question after question on investment decisions. They were not just about Equiticorp but about the National Security Council, a massive exposure to the REMM Group, and some most unusual dealings with a group called Health and Lifecare. To those of us concerned by the bank's exposures and its massive growth of 25 per cent a year, it was incomprehensible that our concerns were not being translated into any action by either the bank or the Premier. </PARA>
<PARA> My Party's questioning, labelled opportunistic by the bank at every opportunity, led to an invitation to address senior management of the bank at its annual strategic planning conference in March 1989. I took the opportunity to tell those managers that I held the view that the State Bank should act like a private sector bank. I will quote some of the comments made at the March 1989 strategic planning seminar, attended by all senior managers-30 or 40 in all-and chaired by Tim Marcus Clarke at the State Bank. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>The bank should exercise due caution with lending risks and not expose itself to unreasonable risks. Care also needs to be taken to ensure the bank is not seen to be an arm of Government which can be twisted. Or that it is prone to decisions which fit a particular government's political philosophy. Or that it is willing to fund pet Government projects which private banks would not lend to. Or fund other projects which other banks will not because of the high risk nature of the development and where to invest is foolhardy. This is the road to a VEDC or a WA Inc. The State Bank must not only be, but be seen to be, above that sort of behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>I also criticised its foray into Equiticorp, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>With Equiticorp the bank has gone not only offshore but into an entrepreneurial high risk area of lending to an organisation which it has been suggested did not have audited accounts. It assaults traditional notions of local support and commitment to the South Australian community. It does not seem to fit comfortably within the bank's charter as it is generally understood. </PARA>
<PARA> I don't believe the Bank has, or ever will have, a capital base sufficient to allow it to act on an international basis like our other major trading banks. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Bank believes it must go outside South Australia then it needs to more clearly explain itself to the South Australia public, the owners of the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>I also talked in that address about the confidentiality provisions the Premier kept hiding behind, saying:</PARA>
<PARA> With Equiticorp it is my view that once that body went into receivership the onus of the State Bank's duty transferred to the people of South Australia who guarantee the Bank's operations-that this duty overrides the duty to a client in receivership. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as private banks are accountable to their shareholders the State Bank through the Government and the Parliament must be accountable to its owners-the people of South Australia. As it is, all they know is that the most the group will lose is $60 million for this is the amount of the current provisions for losses and you have reported that the provisions will be sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA>I also spoke of the bank's reporting of bad debts, which even in 1988 had raised questions about the extent to which doubtful debts were recoverable. The previous year the bank had written bad debts of more than $6.8m and reported recoveries of only $97,000, when usual private banking practice was to recover up to 50 per cent of bad debts. I asked whether the bank's reporting of bad debts also included any interest on loans which were not repaid; that is, when a loan defaulted as a result of not being able to keep up with interest payments we saw the situation where the interest payments were capitalised and, because of that, the loan was not then in default. That is a way of disguising the true extent of bad and doubtful debts and the appropriate provisions that ought to be made. These concerns were raised back in 1989 with the strategic planning group of the State Bank. All those concerns were visible to my Party and to my research staff at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier, with many financial and economic experts surrounding him in his own department and Treasury, continued to ignore the signals. My speech at that time was reported by the media in an article on page 1 of the Adelaide Advertiser. As is the way of Adelaide, I know full well that the Premier would also have received a full text of that speech from some journalist. John Bannon, Labor Premier of South Australia, is either guilty of a huge cover-up over the State Bank or, as is perhaps likely, he has shown himself to be inept in financial matters and irresponsible in carrying out his duties as the owner of the State Bank of South Australia. In the past two weeks he has hidden behind the State Bank Act, saying it stopped him interfering. It did-in the everyday running of the bank-but nowhere in that Act is there any section which stops him inquiring of bank management, seeking information from bank management or the board or even demanding answers on behalf of the taxpayers he represents. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking back, the speech I gave in March 1989 seems quite prophetic, but it also shows just how obvious were the cracks in the facade of the South Australian State Bank two years ago. However, few would listen and even fewer people would believe. Through it all the Premier and the Managing Director of the State Bank, Tim Marcus Clarke, were scathing. Mr Clarke surpassed himself after my speech to the management group when he wrote to me as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I suspect you are regularly induced to have a go at State Bank by the other trading banks in town who we have certainly affected via our competitive edge and by political pressures on you to take an opportunistic approach in seizing upon anything which might prove useful in attacking the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I do ask that any attack on the current Labor Government in your vigorous pursuit of the Treasury benches you do insist on a more responsible approach to those matters likely to affect the extremely high regard that South Australians have for their Bank, and the complete confidence they have in its security-a reputation the Bank richly deserves. </PARA>

<PARA> It would be open to a committee to take the action I have indicated. This would not necessarily mean, however, that the committee would publish the documents. In considering whether to publish the documents, the committee should take into consideration the ruling made in the Senate. It must be remembered, however, that every committee has the power to order the publication of any documents laid before it, subject to any contrary order imposed upon the committee by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht-I should like to move that the Senate take note of the statement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) When the Department believes that a pensioner may be entitled to receive pension income from overseas because of the period of residence and/or work in another country or for other reasons, it will contact the pensioner and review the current payment of Australian pension. Overseas pension income is taken into account for the purposes of the Australian pension income test.</PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, through arrangements about to be introduced, overseas-born applicants for Australian pension payments will have this aspect checked before entitlement is confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1989-90, the Department wrote to 388,000 overseas-born pensioners, seeking information about pension income being received from other countries which had not already been disclosed. The letter also reminded them that they could be eligible for payments from overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department contacts overseas social security authorities about matters related to the payment of overseas pensions in Australia, in accordance with reciprocal agreement arrangements and for other reasons.</PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners can live and/or work in another country long enough for there to be an apparent entitlement to an overseas pension but none is recorded by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> Further checks are being made about the entitlement of pensioners in this category who were part of the 1989-90 review.</PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances the pensioner is requested to authorise the Department to contact the overseas social security organisation concerned and to make enquiries about the individual case.</PARA>
<PARA> This procedure is also being introduced for new applicants for Australian pension.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The 1989-90 review of overseas-born pensioners referred to above resulted in 24,941 pensioners having rates of payment of Australian pension varied because previously undisclosed overseas pension income was taken into account. Details are as in the Table below:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 January 1991:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) With reference to the book by Mr Fred Bennett, former Chief of Defence's Capital Procurement organisation, which is highly critical of the management of defence equipment projects, does the Minister agree with Mr Bennett's conclusions that Defence equipment procurement has suffered: ` . . . cost and schedule overruns, performance failures, and in some cases, abandonment of projects. (And that) Taxpayers have not received full value for money spent and military forces are less well equipped than they could have been.'</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is Mr Bennett's statement that in the year to June 1987 ` . . . major weapons system project managers lodged submissions seeking increases in approved project costs that in total amounted to A$650 million' correct.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Given Mr Bennett's view that cost overruns in equipment projects will continue `So long as existing costing methods, management systems, budgetary procedures and political attitudes will persist . . . ' (pages 80 and 81), what guarantees can the Minister give that current acquisition projects will be completed to specification, on time and within budget.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1124" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Major procurement processes, both overseas and in Australia, have provided and will continue to provide targets for criticism. In Australia the Defence project management system was the subject of scrutiny and comment by the Utz Review (1982) and the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts (JPCPA) Review (1984)-Report 243.</PARA>
<PARA> Since that time the creation of the Capital Procurement Organisation within Defence and the policies and operating procedures developed in support of its activities, together with subsequent Departmental actions have largely satisfied most of the recommendations in the JPCPA Report No.243. I recently provided related information to Senator Durack in answer to Question No.349 and it is pertinent to note that 56 of the 68 recommendations have been implemented with positive results. In 1988 and 1989 there were substantial reorganisations. These structural changes combined with the introduction of Program Management and Budgeting (PMB), extensive procurement reforms, and the devolvement of greater responsibility and accountability to project managers, has led to more efficient project management and cost control measures being exercised over the Defence major capital equipment program.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bennett's book on Defence equipment procurement contains references to the management of a number of major weapons systems projects in both government and the private sector, both in Australia and in several countries throughout the world (e.g. United States of America, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden and Singapore). A substantial part of his book relates to overseas experiences in this area. It is acknowledged that Australian Defence project management has experienced similar difficulties in the management of its very large, complex and often unique weapons system projects which are at the leading edge of technology. However, I would draw on Mr Bennett's qualification at page 33 of his book which should be noted when assessing these difficulties in context, viz:</PARA>
<PARA> `Weapons system procurement differs from most areas of government administration in that projects have defined cost, schedule and performance targets. At first sight it may appear that efficiency might be measured by the extent to which those targets are achieved but, as the discussion will show, these targets tend to be idealistic aspirations rather than attainable goals and it is common for projects to be subject to disruptions that change the objectives or make them unattainable.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue its efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Defence equipment acquisition process and implement measures for improved project management to ensure taxpayers are receiving value for money and that the forces are as well equipped as is possible from those Defence resources made available for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The data published by Mr Bennett appears to have been an estimate made prior to the end of the financial year. Actual increases in the costs of approved projects over the financial year 1986/87 for exchange and inflation effects were some $580m. In addition, there were real cost increases totalling some $704m related primarily to Defence-initiated changes in contract requirements including an increase in the number of Blackhawk helicopters at a project cost of $478m and a new phase of the Raven Radio project at a cost of $204m.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Given the nature of Defence major procurement projects and the limitations of original cost, schedule and specification targets as a benchmark against which to measure project management performance, I am not prepared to give guarantees that those targets will always be met. While comparison of final and original target costs, schedules and product performance provide an indication of the quality of project management, for major projects there will often be good reason to vary specifications in the light of experience during the life of the project. The most important measures of performance are whether the equipment purchased is acceptable to the user and whether it represents value for money.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The Federal Government's strategy to reform and revitalise rail focuses on the development of a national interstate rail freight organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal to establish a fully commercial National Rail Freight Corporation by 1 July 1991 received unanimous support from Heads of Government at the October 1991 Special Premiers' Conference. The Corporation will encompass all existing interstate rail freight operations and involve Commonwealth and State equity contributions.</PARA>
<PARA> A task force established by Australia's Transport Ministers is preparing detailed recommendations and proposals for consideration by Governments, and the matter will be addressed at the Special Premiers' Conference scheduled for May 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government strongly supports the concept of the National Rail Freight Corporation and as an indication of its commitment to the Corporation's establishment, I have approved the expenditure of $50 million in 1990/91 on upgrading infrastructure vital to its operations.</PARA>
<PARA> The NRFC will make use of existing lines.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) Operation of passenger rail services, except for Australian National services, is essentially a State responsibility. However, I recently established the Australian Rail Industry Advisory Council (ARIAC) to examine rail industry issues. Among other things it will look at the future of passenger services, including the possible establishment of a single rail passenger authority for interstate services.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The National Rail Freight Initiative Task Force established by Australia's Transport Ministers is preparing detailed recommendations and proposals on such matters as infrastructure and investment for consideration by Governments. It is expected to report in the near future. However, any future upgrading of rail services would ultimately be a matter for the National Rail Freight Corporation's commercial judgement.</PARA>
