<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread concern and outrage in the international community about the Salvadoran government's treatment of its returning refugee and internally displaced population. Since the signing of the San Jose Agreement on Human Rights by the Salvadoran government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front under the mediation of the United Nations, we have been hopeful for an improvement in the Salvadoran government's treatment of its civilian population, particularly those in the repatriate communities and the social movement. Every Article of the Agreement under Section 1. Respect for and Guarantee of Human Rights, has been violated by the Salvadoran government and its armed forces. The international community is aware more than ever before of the systematic intimidation and harassment including capture, torture, rape and murder of members of repatriate communities and the social movement by the Salvadoran armed forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only conclude that the Salvadoran government's lack of control of its armed forces is indicative of its own lack of real commitment to a negotiated peaceful solution to the civil war. It appears, furthermore, that the Salvadoran government is unwilling to honour Agreements to which it is signatory, including international Conventions on Human Rights, and in doing so places itself above international law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international community, including the Australian government, has a common interest in the peaceful resolution to the conflict and the initiation of a genuine free democratic process in El Salvador.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDEX `91 (The Australian International Defence Equipment Exhibition) will take place in Canberra on November 26-28. It will be the largest arms fair yet held in this region. Currently AIDEX has Australian Government approval and involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Promoting the arms trade is an immoral and short-sighted policy. Trading in arms is a constant provocation to war. Domestic oppression and international aggression are its results. Arms purchases by countries in the Asian-Pacific region divert resources from much needed peaceful development, health, education and social welfare. The Australian Government should not be seeking a short term response to the present economic crisis by involvement in this trade and should embark on a strategy to ensure that arms manufacture is confined to our legitimate defence needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to heed the lessons of the Gulf War. Without the complicity of legitimate and illicit arms traders this war could not have occurred. Ordinary citizens in Europe and North America were scandalised to find that their respectable corporations were deeply involved in arming Iraq. Australians in the future do not want to be similarly compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time when the major powers are reducing their arsenals and their arms trade, it is indefensible for the Australian Government to be expanding its involvement in the promotion, manufacture and export of weapons, arms components and support services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I conveyed to the Government that the two health insurance Bills were not ready to proceed because we were waiting for answers from the Minister. I have not yet heard whether they are ready to proceed. As for the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4), I conveyed to the Government this morning that that Bill also had had amendments produced, I think the night before last, that there were still matters being discussed by the shadow Ministry, and that we would not be able to proceed with that at present. It may well be that if the health insurance Bills are now ready to go ahead, the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 4) will be all right. It probably will not be reached today, and in fact we could make sure that it did not, if necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are very happy to see that follow the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. There are plenty of Bills on which we are ready to proceed right now. The ones on which we get late amendments from the Government make it very difficult and they should be accommodated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;It is a fairly complicated program because of various requirements. Certainly the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Bill (No. 2) 1991 has been put on first, hoping that some of these other things can get sorted out. Senator Reid asked why we are not putting the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 up the list to give us more time generally. Our preference is that, if there are amendments to these health and social security Bills, they go back to the House of Representatives today so that we can meet the various start-up dates, et cetera. There are, I concede, fairly complicated considerations. I do not know what the progress is on the information she has sought on the health Bills or how far down the pipeline that is.

However, he was quite rudely cut off in mid-sentence&mdash;this does not happen with your rulings, Mr President&mdash;and he was not allowed to proceed with the very serious matter relating to what would happen at the proceedings.

<PARA>The Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures was formed to investigate the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991, which had already attracted almost total community condemnation. This legislation seeks to ban political advertising on the electronic media during Federal, State and local government elections and by-elections, which we discovered could mean as much as a 16-week ban in a given year. This legislation seeks to introduce transparent electoral funding through disclosure of political donations as long as that protected species&mdash;and I refer to the unions&mdash;still seemed to roam free.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some witnesses were intimidated in the line of questioning. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> shows that a number of the witnesses were treated with perhaps little respect. With the aid of selective and out of context quoting of the evidence, we have the majority members of the Committee, the Labor members, painting a distorted picture of community acceptance that the amended Bill allays most of the human rights complaints against a ban on political advertising. That is absolutely untrue. The report creates an impression that the Committee heard evidence to substantiate the necessity of such a ban to halt Federal political corruption. That is absolutely untrue. No such evidence was forthcoming and no instances of Federal political corruption were presented to the Committee. Instead, what we did uncover was that countries with a political ad ban had widespread and deeply embedded political campaign corruption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is a reflection only of the Australian Labor Party's agenda on this subject. It is a transparent effort to wipe out electronic political advertising because the Government is so on the nose with the community, and so in debt from the last campaign, that there are simply no funds to pay for an electronic campaign at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly&mdash;and I think this shows the hypocrisy of the move&mdash;statistics before the Committee revealed that the Labor Party, far from actually considering electronic media advertising unnecessary, had increased its spending in this area significantly in the last Federal election campaign while other parties had spent less than they usually did or somewhere about the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a totally hypocritical exercise from beginning to end. This is again evident in the majority report's lack of resolve to tackle full, fair and equitable disclosure. Full disclosure of political donations to the Labor members of the Committee meant disclosure which kept union donations to the ALP still hidden and which protected Government donations to politically active third parties. It meant disclosure as long as the union movement and therefore the ALP retained their quite significant taxation advantages. It meant disclosure as long as the indirect electoral funding advantage of the incumbent governments through staffing, government advertising and use of equipment remained protected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My views have not been predetermined. They were never predetermined. To a large extent my views were influenced by what was said on this Committee and by some of the questions, for example, that Democrat Senator Cheryl Kernot raised. She raised a number of questions, as a third party force in a sense, which made me think about the whole question of how this potential Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill affects all parties and independents running for the Senate and the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue at hand is whether or not speech is free if one needs to pay $50,000 for a 30-second advertisement on Sydney prime time television. It is not free if political parties have to spend something like $16m to put their case before the electorate in a few weeks leading up to an election. Free speech is not free if, for example, the forest industries&mdash;as laudable as their viewpoints may be&mdash;can spend a million dollars on television before an election campaign, when their opponents, the conservation interests, can spend only about $28,000 on radio mainly because they cannot afford television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not have free speech if the people who can buy the most advertising and who can buy the most effective advertising agencies are going to dominate the agenda leading up to election day. That is not free speech and yet Senator Parer says that my views were predetermined before I sat on that Committee. My views were affected by the evidence that came before us and particularly the evidence that updated the costs of running electronic media campaigns during an election. It worried me even more when we came out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My views were also affected by what I saw in the United States and by my continuing links with United States senators and members of the House of Representatives. I know that every week the average incumbent senator in the United States has to raise $10,000 in order to run what is considered to be a moderate campaign for his or her election. In the United States Congress, the senators and House of Representatives members are most concerned about who they have to meet and what dinners they have to speak at in order to raise enough money to be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what has happened in the United States: 25 per cent of the eligible voters voted for Ronald Reagan to be President and 50 per cent of the eligible voters did not bother to vote in the presidential election campaign. That figure has been consistent in the last four American elections. Why? Because they know that their Congress has been bought. They know that money talks in the American political system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was going down that track; $30m-odd was spent on the last election campaign. Where does the money come from? It comes from people who want to buy influence. Obviously, they have not been able to do that with the Labor Party; but the danger is always there. I admit that in certain areas around Australia money has bought influence with all political parties. We now have a choice to make as a parliament. We are going to say, `Enough is enough. Those with money will not buy this Parliament and they will not buy the State parliaments around Australia'. Honourable senators can rest assured that if we do not make a decision in the next year or so about cutting the costs of Federal and State election campaigns we will make all political parties vulnerable to the persuasion of those people with money who want to stand over those parties and subtly gain influence&mdash;not only at a party level but also at an individual level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite want to come into this Parliament and say they have been bought and they want to live with the fact that they have been bought, then they should disregard this report and vote against any Bill to control the dramatic escalation of election costs in this country. Someone said to me&mdash;and it came through in the submission of the Liberal Party to this Committee&mdash;that there is no political corruption in Australia; it is not significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a royal commission in Tasmania where the then Premier of the State handled $10,000 and got his teenage son to count the $10,000 that had been given to the Premier by a political donor. In the same State, evidence was given before that royal commission that money which was gained through the silver ingoting of waste products from television and newspapers was put into football socks, translated into cash and then given to people in order to buy political favours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia we have had allegations that undue influence was brought to bear on governments by people with money. That is the other side of the political coin. I am not playing political favourites in this place. In Queensland we have had a situation where systematic corruption of the police and the political system has been proved in court and by Drummond. We have had situations in New South Wales where both political parties have agreed that political corruption has been systematic and has been sufficient to distort the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What other proof do we need that political corruption is sitting on the doorstep of most Australian parliaments? The temptation for political parties to allow themselves to be influenced by those with money&mdash;the influence peddlers and influence buyers&mdash;is there in front of us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about political corruption. Right throughout the hearings, all we heard from the people representing the Liberal Party on this Committee was, `What about the unions?'. The unions have annual reports. All of their members know what money is given to political parties because it is there in black and white in the reports. The Labor Party tables its reports publicly in every State. So the affiliation dues and donations from the union movement are tabled publicly. In all the time that I have been in politics&mdash;and that is from the age of 20; I am 46 now&mdash;I have never been in a Labor Party State council that has excluded the press from any information like that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to a couple of other issues. Why did the Liberal Party send only Senator Parer to appear before our Committee. Senator Parer is a politician. Presumably, he does not raise the funds for his party. He does not run his party's campaigns. He does not know where the money trail goes&mdash;in other words, who are the donors and so on&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am following the theory. When Senator Parer came before us we asked the question, `Where is your national director? Why isn't he here?'. We asked, `Where is your treasurer who raises the money?'. Senator Parer said, `Oh, you didn't ask them'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that this Committee wrote to all political parties and said, `Send along the people who know about political fund-raising, about running campaigns'. And what did the Liberal Party send us? It sent us Senator Parer on his own. It seems to me that, as a committee, we were not going to get the information unless we talked to the people who knew. So as a committee, we then said, `Would you send along the National Director of the Liberal Party so that we can ask him questions about the way his Party raises money, how it hides donations, how it is in fact influenced by the giving of money'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to ask a number of specific questions about how the Liberal Party paid for the massive campaigns. I wanted to ask about how it paid for the mid-term campaigns. Honourable senators will remember the incentivisation campaign. How did the Liberal Party pay for that? Where did the money come from? I wanted to ask some questions about how certain business organisations pay $100,000 or more a year for people to work in the offices of Andrew Peacock and other Liberal leaders. In other words, private companies paid the salaries of these people and then assigned them to the offices of important people in the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the question, `How do shareholders in public companies tolerate a situation in which, without letting them know, money is given in such a way to the Liberal Party?'. If I were a shareholder in those companies, I would want to know why that had happened. Who was there to tell us? It was only Senator Parer. It seems to me that this whole situation is not being taken seriously if only Senator Parer turns up to give his views when asked about the way in which the Liberal Party runs campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears from the Liberal Party statements that by putting bans on political advertising, this Government is going to distort the picture of what happens elsewhere in the world, that somehow or other we are one-out and unusual in wanting to do that. The members of the Liberal Party who were on this Committee and some others, including Senator Parer, who knows but says nothing about it, are aware that of the 19 major countries that we surveyed, only five are like Australia where it is basically a case of winner take all, spend what you like on political campaigns and money starts to count. Of the 19 countries surveyed, 14 have bans of some sort or another on electronic and, particularly, television advertising prior to election day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So political parties do not have a right to go out and buy votes. Rich private interests groups do not have the right to back political parties in a search for influence. That is not a right of free speech&mdash;that is bought speech. Honourable senators can make up their minds whether in the years to come they want parliaments to be bought or whether they will support the concept of free speech&mdash;that is, the right of all citizens and all interests groups to be represented in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party was very self-conscious about this whole exercise. It was self-conscious about the fact that we were calling for public submissions. We know that the Liberal Party wrote to every interest group in the country trying to tell them what a terrible Bill this would be. The Liberal Party wrote to every vulnerable interest group which did not know anything about the Bill and distorted the picture. The Liberal Party even helped to write the letters that were sent to us. We saw letters from various interest groups, welfare groups and other organisations that looked as if they had been written by the one person. Because of the flawed logic in those letters, I can only assume the wording came from Senator Parer. When I looked at the letters I thought, `This is extraordinary. They all seem to read the same way'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear the views of, for example, Garry Morgan. I was interested to hear the views of Rod Cameron from ANOP. I was interested to hear the views of people who have been involved in the political system and who have not been necessarily either duped or have an axe to grind. I looked at those views and said, `Yes, let us examine it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am prepared to look at some of the views that have been expressed by Senator Kernot. I think some of the suggestions she made in the minority report are positive and will give us a better Bill in the long run. This is one of the major reasons that I think there was real value in this Committee. We called together people. We focused the nation's attention on this matter. What is more, we had open and public hearings at which people could be questioned about their views. The Committee did not just receive letters that had been written by people presumably like Senator Parer on behalf of a political party. At least we had the opportunity to listen to people tell us under oath what really goes on in their organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I support the concept of the Bill. This Parliament sooner or later has to make a decision about the question of reducing the escalation of expenditure on political campaigns so that people can never say about us, `This is the best Parliament that money can buy'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As can be seen from the debate so far, it was quite an experience to serve on such a volatile committee as the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures. Committee members held passionately opposed views which, in the case of Senators Kemp and Schacht, I would categorise as two immovable forces. I do not know what stage has to be reached before something has to give.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think in many instances the views can be summarised as pro-and anti-unionism, with human rights being dragged along at the rear. I think it is fair comment to say that some witnesses would be entitled to believe that they had been subjected to some over-rigorous questioning. In the case of the last witness, Mr Sherry from Queensland, I personally believe that the word `intimidation' could be appropriately used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, in between the overt political brawling, which I do not think did the Committee any justice, we did hear evidence from expert witnesses. I found a lot of that evidence to be informative and compelling. My views were not pre-determined. These witnesses are practitioners in the field. They gave evidence which was informative as well as subjective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I should make the point that this report is a report on a piece of legislation. We will have an opportunity if and when we see the legislation next week to speak in the second reading debate about the issues which predictably have been raised so far. So I am not going to canvass all of those arguments at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of points that I have raised in my own dissenting report. These are key points for the Australian Democrats, who believe that the great majority of political electronic advertising, borne out by the evidence, is emotive, manipulative and usually seeks to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It does little to address the issues; in fact, evidence was given that it debases the political process. Having said that, in my view the report does not address adequately the issue of what will happen when money previously spent on electronic advertising is rechannelled into other forms of direct marketing. I think that was an important point. We have seen that happen and used successfully, and I personally believe that voters will have a threshold to that approach but that that threshold has not yet been reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second general point is that a great deal of questioning time was devoted by the two Opposition members on the Committee to the issue of tax advantages to the ALP via the union movement, particularly in the matter of tax deductibility of donations. I think it is fair to say that the Committee's view, expressed in paragraph 5.12, that this was not directly relevant to the inquiry is not supported by me. I think that that issue quite clearly dealt with campaign funding and third party expenditure. The body of evidence quoted in the report to illustrate this issue is sparse and does not reflect the amount of time devoted to and evidence heard on this issue. I do not share the passion of Opposition members on that issue, but I do not think that the report adequately reflects the amount of time that we as a Committee spent discussing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made a couple of recommendations of my own based on the evidence I have heard. I think it is very important that electors have a right to receive basic factual information. That is why I made my first recommendation in my own minority report. I have talked about a public register of lobby groups as well. I have talked of addressing the equalising of public funding arrangements for the Senate and the House of Representatives &mdash;not by increasing the Senate vote but perhaps by looking at the opportunity of treating the lot as a pool to be halved. I cannot subscribe to the view that what we as senators do is less onerous or less important than what is done by members of the House of Representatives as shown by the value of public funding for each vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also raised the issue of compensation to radio and television for free time which is allocated under the Committee's recommendations. I do not accept the Committee's conclusion, or the conclusion arrived at in the Opposition's dissenting report, on the matter of truth in advertising. It is always difficult to pursue such a concept, but I do not believe it is impossible. There is a distinction between trade and commerce in products and in ideas. I listened carefully to the evidence and I give notice that I intend to pursue the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the volatility of the Committee, I learned a lot about chairmanship techniques. I think that this will be an important report and I will probably be glad to have had the experience of having been a member of the Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some brief remarks on this important report by the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures. The matter that concerns me most relates to the principles that seem to be selectively applied by some of the honourable senators opposite, particularly by Senator Schacht, who was Chairman of the Committee and put his name to the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been in the Senate for only a year or so, I have on many occasions witnessed Senator Schacht, in adjournment speeches and matters relating to motions on Third World countries and other nations, speaking with great principle and passion on political freedoms and human rights in countries such as South Africa, Myanmar, Cambodia and China, to name those that immediately spring to mind. Senator Schacht has rallied for the advancement of human rights and political freedoms in those nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is a matter of some concern when somebody such as Senator Schacht, who professes to care about matters such as political freedom and human rights, puts his name to a report that in one fell swoop would reduce the level of political freedom and human rights in Australia in a way that has not even been contemplated by this Parliament in decades. This can only lead one to believe that people who would advocate such a ban as contained in this report have a problem with their principles. I think that they can only be referred to as hypocrites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that, as Senator Schacht has put his name to this report, whenever these matters of political freedoms in nations such as South Africa, Myanmar, Cambodia and China come up for debate relating to the sorts of issues that the people in Tiananmen Square died for only three years ago, he should be reminded continually by me and by my colleagues of his selective application of principles to matters of political freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To turn to a separate point, I believe that the proposal to have free time allocated at the rate of some 17 minutes a day on commercial media outlets and on the ABC&mdash;under which the Government, although opposed to advertising on the ABC, is forcing that body to advertise political parties for 17 minutes a day&mdash;is again a matter of pure hypocrisy. In relation to the tabling of this report and as we move towards this piece of stupid legislation, I believe it is important that the Australian people fully understand the hypocrisy of Labor senators. I call on the Australian people to reject this report, to reject the legislation that we will see before this chamber and to support the minority report to which my colleagues Senators Kemp and Olsen have put their names. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to Senator Campbell in a moment, and his amazing remarks about human rights. First of all, I want to deal with the procedures of the Committee. Senator Kernot made remarks about a witness&mdash;the last witness, I think it was&mdash;Mr Sherry, who may have been intimidated. I want to make it clear that I think that those remarks were addressed to me, as Chairman. I do not in any way resile from what I said to Mr Sherry and I do not resile in any way from what I said to Mr Morgan. Both of those witnesses knowingly used the privileges of Parliament to give evidence accusing individual citizens of Australia of illegal, corrupt practices that, if proven in a court, would mean that people would suffer a sentence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I did, first of all in Mr Morgan's case, was say to him that he had made extremely serious allegations under privilege against another person; they were so serious that he should go directly to the Director of Public Prosecutions and give the information. I believe that was correct. We also made sure that the person named had an opportunity to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Mr Sherry gave evidence he mentioned many names of trade unionists and others in Queensland. Again, I said to him right at the end of the hour that we were given by the Senate, because the Senate was sitting, and I stressed this point to him, that his strong accusations of intimidation&mdash;clearly criminal offences&mdash;against individuals under privilege would have much greater credibility if he went to the appropriate authorities with his information. I still urge Mr Sherry to do so. Under cross-examination earlier he had indicated that despite all these threats of intimidation he had made no effort to go to the Cooke inquiry in Queensland with his information and he had made no effort to go to the Fitzgerald inquiry or anybody else. Our Committee was the first opportunity he took. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the terms of reference of our Select Committee much of his evidence probably could have been ruled ineligible. I was quite willing to let him have his say, I did not interrupt, but right at the end&mdash;we gave everybody 10 minutes to ask questions and I had the last three minutes because some people had taken more than their 10 minutes&mdash;I made that comment to him. I believe it was only reasonable considering the extraordinary allegations made against other citizens whom we have now written to. Some of them have replied and some will have to come back through the Standing Committee of Privileges, I suspect, to put their side and respond to Mr Sherry's allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to come to the question of free speech and human rights which has been raised by some Opposition members. Senator Campbell made the point that I am a hypocrite because I am interested in human rights in a number of countries and am not interested in human rights in this Bill. It is true, and I do not deny the fact, that I have been to a number of countries privately and on parliamentary delegations&mdash;overwhelmingly privately&mdash;and raised issues of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say to Senator Campbell that his remarks are particularly offensive not to me but to the people I have spoken to in those countries. I will give him one example. In February 1989 in Rangoon I sat down with 20 students from the Rangoon university and had a private discussion about human rights in that country. I asked whether any of the students around the table had suffered imprisonment and torture. For the next hour I listened to every one of those people, ranging between 15 and 25 years of age, give horrifying accounts of how they had been treated, abused and tortured by the regime. </PARA>

For a three-week election campaign period you would not be able to have paid election advertisements on television, but you would have the right to freedom of religion, the right to free assembly, the right to free speech and the right to free trade unions?', I know what they would have said. The people raising this issue in Australia, such as Senator Campbell, do not know what human rights are all about. He is not interested. I will be very interested to hear in the future his commitment on these sorts of places, making the sorts of statements that offend these sorts of ordinary people who have been butchered. </PARA>

That is an infringement of free speech. I accept that that is a legitimate debate; I may or may not agree with it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Members of the Opposition want to affect free speech in that area, and they have got a select committee established to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence was overwhelmingly before the Committee&mdash;even the protagonists brought along to defend the Opposition's position admitted this&mdash;that free speech is not a pure position; it is qualified for good order and public morals in the community. I argue that the good order of Australia, public order, means trying to eliminate as much corruption as possible or to stop it from taking place. The witnesses, even those favouring the Opposition's position, agreed that that was not an unreasonable objective of the Parliament. They may disagree with the particular proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell is implying that free speech is at risk in human rights terms. We received some interesting evidence from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We wrote to the human rights section of the Department and asked, `Have you ever taken up any cases under the UN human rights convention against any number of western European countries who have bans on political advertising, putting that it is a breach of political rights, of human rights, an infringement of free speech within the terms of the UN convention?'. It simply said, `No, we never have because it is not an infringement of human rights and political free speech'. That is the legal position of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It is in the evidence given and set out in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked Professor Alston whether, with his great concern on this issue, he had ever arranged for issues to be taken up in the European Parliament or in the UN or with the parliaments of western Europe where all of these bans apply? These countries are set out in the appendix at the back of the report. He said no. I asked Mr Burdekin, the Human Rights Commissioner, whether he had taken up these matters. He said that he had not. In every country of western Europe there is some form of limitation on electronic advertising. No-one in western Europe or in the Human Rights Commission is complaining that this is an infringement of free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute furphy for Senator Campbell to claim that this is the equivalent of the killing of people in South Africa or Burma or China or Cambodia. Senator Campbell should go to the killing fields in Cambodia, actually stand in the Tuol Sleng interrogation centre and see the 10,000 photos of people, including Australians, who were butchered by Pol Pot. He should say to them that the three-week limitation on electronic advertising is the equivalent of this massacre. It is absurd. It is an obscenity to make that point. It is an obscenity on the victims of genocide in Cambodia that Senator Campbell, who could not find it on a map if we gave him a 10-day start, compares those two situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations we have made are overwhelmingly the best balance between the issues of free speech, access and corruption. We have recommended that the ban apply in the election period, that free time be made available during the election period to the political parties and that it be in a talking head format so that it is not distorted, so that it is proper political information. In the non-election period, people can put on advertisements as normal, in any way that they see fit. Third party groups such as the timber industry still have plenty of opportunities to put their case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I refer to disclosure. I was interested to read the minority report from the Liberal Party members.

In particular, I should like to thank Rosemary Laing, John O'Keefe, Yvonne Marsh and Rachael Kelly for their work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been very clear from the debate to this stage, it was a very difficult Committee. I suspect that few other examples could be brought to mind where there was such a bitterly divided Committee; where there were so many concerns expressed, often publicly, about the procedures that were adopted by the Committee. It put an enormous strain on such people as Rosemary Laing to make sure that all of us felt that we were properly catered for and to steer that difficult line between the various groups on the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should like to express, certainly on my own behalf, and I am sure I speak with the strong support of Senator Olsen, our great thanks to Rosemary Laing for the work that she did and to note that her job was, I suspect, particularly difficult on this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various matters have been raised by speakers on this report. At this stage, I wish to limit my remarks to a few comments to pick up some of the thoughts that have been expressed and to add a few of my own. It is clear that the Committee was very divided. There were great concerns about particular aspects of the way the Committee operated. Senator Kernot drew our attention to one incident which occurred in the Committee. That was the intimidation of a Mr Sherry, who was the final witness. It is my view also that there was an attempt to intimate Mr Sherry. That was a great pity because, although people may or may not agree with the views put by Mr Sherry, he was entitled to a fair hearing. I do not believe that he had that fair hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that, when Mr Sherry came before the Committee, he probably spoke to us&mdash;after the comments by the Chairman&mdash;for about half an hour. The meeting was then deferred and leave of the Senate was sought for the Committee to sit between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. on that day. Mr Sherry had raised a number of matters. The Chairman arrived late for the Committee hearing. The Committee did not start, in fact, until 5.10 p.m. Therefore, there was a very obvious ploy to strictly limit the ability to question Mr Sherry. It was limited because of the lateness of arrival of the Chairman. That is worth putting on the record because it demonstrates the way Senator Schacht tends to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we came to the end of the hearing. Senator Schacht, who had adopted a very loose interpretation of the starting time of the Committee, suddenly decided to have a very strict interpretation of its finishing time and launched into a vitriolic abuse of Mr Sherry. I do not plan to go through that, but people who wish to read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and look at the Chairman's final statement can see the vitriolic abuse which Senator Schacht launched against Mr Sherry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Sherry may have been under the impression that that was the view of the Committee. There was no time for other members of the Committee to comment. I believe that Senator Kernot wanted to make a comment. I wished to make a comment. But, whilst Senator Schacht had been loose on the starting time, boy, was he tough on that finishing time. He said, `This meeting is now finished. No further comments can be allowed'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht has had his chance to speak; I will have mine. In future, I would advise anyone who is asked to sit on a committee with Senator Schacht as its Chairman to seek very close assurances on how such a committee will be conducted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht drew our attention to the fact that he wrote, presumably in the name of the Committee, to two witnesses afterwards urging them to take particular action. I cannot recall Senator Schacht's seeking leave of the Committee to write to Mr Morgan. I cannot recall his seeking leave of the Committee to write to Mr Sherry. I suspect that he wrote as Chairman of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would say to Senator Schacht that there are many worries about the way this Committee was conducted. Not the least is the report which is now before this Parliament. In the year and a half for which I have been a member of this chamber, I have sat on a number of committees, the members of which have had fairly vigorously opposing views. Reports have been produced which to my mind have fairly canvassed the evidence that has been put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Kernot that the majority report which has now been presented to this Parliament does not fairly canvass all the evidence which has been put before the Committee. I think that is appalling. I do not say that the majority members are not entitled to reach their own conclusions. On balance, undoubtedly the recommendations that they have been prepared to bring down would also have been included. But those people who did not agree with the majority report were at least entitled to see the evidence, which they believed was important and which was put before the Committee, properly canvassed. In my view that did not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht showed something of a glass jaw in relation to the comments by Senator Campbell on the human rights issue. We got a long speech from Senator Schacht about his great record on human rights. I say to Senator Schacht, who has walked out of the chamber&mdash;he will presumably have a chance to read all of this in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that it is very easy to walk around the world and lecture all these other countries on their human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real test of one's commitment to human rights is how one reacts when one is put to the test; how one reacts when the interests of the Labor Party have to be weighed against wider human rights interests. I say `wider human rights interests' because this was the information that was brought before the Committee by the Human Rights Commissioner, which indicated that the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill was in serious breach of a UN convention on human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did this great man, this great advocate of human rights, do when he was faced, probably for the first time in his life, with a choice between accepting Labor Party interests and promoting the human rights interests of the wider community? There are no prizes for guessing how Senator Schacht came down. The answer is: when put to the test, Senator Schacht came down on the side of the interests of the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the Bill which this report deals with has been brought before this Parliament in order to solve the problems of political corruption which have been apparent before at least a number of royal commissions and inquiries in various States. I do not believe that this Bill effectively addresses that. I believe that there are three main reasons why this Bill has been brought before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first reason is that the Labor Party has been faced, and is being faced, with a massive public relations problem resulting from WA Inc. This Bill was born in the climate of the early exposures of WA Inc. This has been brought before the Parliament to attempt to fool the public that the Labor Party is concerned about effectively tackling political corruption in this country. The second reason that this Bill came before the Parliament and the way it is worded&mdash;I believe this is clear from the evidence before the Committee&mdash;is that it is trying to entrench a major Labor Party advantage as we go towards the next election. There is no doubt that political advertising is the most effective method of getting one's messages across, whatever people may think of the actual ads themselves. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator McMullan" NAMEID="5I4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>It is. As Secretary of the Labor Party, Senator McMullan spent more money on political advertising than on any other form of election campaigning. So, by his own decisions and activities, he indicates that political advertising is the most effective form of getting a message across to the public. He has done it for years including when he was Labor Party Secretary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party is petrified that the political ads which will be run in the next election will be very effective in recalling to the public at large these disgraceful broken promises that the Labor Party has made year after year. It will bring to attention those famous films of four men in a boat as they go out to Laurie Connell's yacht. Those are the things that the Labor Party is petrified of being recalled to the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason that this Bill has been brought before this Parliament is that the Labor Party&mdash;because of its disgraceful performance, loss of support in the community and the fact that its rich mates are no longer rich&mdash;is going to be strapped for funds. It is going to be strapped for funds in a big way. It is also an attempt to limit possible funding advantages that a Hewson-led Liberal Party might have as it sweeps towards victory in the next election. In my view, this is not concerned with human rights; it is not particularly concerned with corruption, although in some aspects it may help and in some aspects it may hinder. It is concerned about entrenching Labor Party advantages to the detriment of other parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I wish to make is the general logic on which this Bill is built. No evidence was given before the Committee that, in some way, banning political advertising would in any way limit election spending. Senator Kernot raised the point&mdash;and I agree with her&mdash;that it is likely that if political parties are limited in their rights to advertise on TV, they will divert funding into other areas. The only people who objected to this view before the Committee were the Labor Party witnesses. It defies logic and belief that money will not be diverted into such other areas as direct mail, newspaper advertising and so forth. The Labor Party decided to take this mighty step. Yet was there any evidence produced before the Committee which could have actually shown that, in all these other countries where TV advertising is, in some way, restricted in election periods, corruption is any less and election spending is not growing at the high rates that we have seen in Australia? Was there any evidence produced to the Committee?</PARA>

Both countries have been racked in the last 12 months or so by major funding scandals. So the very flimsy logic on which this Bill is built falls over. No essential or effective evidence was produced which shows the contrary case. There are some very big issues which this Senate and the public will now have to address as a result of the recommendations which the majority report has brought down. The key groups that are going to have to effectively address this are, in fact, not the major political parties. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>I believe that, as Senator Ray confirmed, the major political parties, or at least the Labor Party, have in this report attempted to look after themselves. It is okay for the Democrats, the Labor Party and indeed, by extension, the Liberal Party to advertise in election periods now. It is okay for us. Certainly, it will be very restricted. It is okay for us to do it and basically do it free. That is a major advantage then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third party, such as the AMA, the Australian Conservation Foundation or any small political group which feels it must bring a pressing message to the public arena on TV, cannot afford TV, but it can certainly afford radio ads, but these will be wiped out. They will be excluded by this Bill from bringing their views to the public arena in this critical election period. That is what is going to happen. They will be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we ponder the impact of this Bill and the consequences for our political system, I</PARA>

We have our free time on TV in the election period, but I am sorry, you have not got your free time. You cannot place ads even on radio'. That is what this Bill says as it now stands.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final comment is that, as we looked at the evidence put before the Committee, it became very clear that there were other very expensive forms of electioneering. Putting ads in major daily newspapers is very expensive. Perhaps even one of the most expensive forms of electioneering is direct mail. There are a lot of very expensive areas in which one can campaign during election periods. The Labor Party has geared itself up. We have all received another laser printer. I did not ask for another laser printer, but Senator Bolkus has written off and given us all another laser printer. So the Labor Party is gearing itself up to run the mother of all direct mail campaigns in the next election period. </PARA>

I have just checked my diary. The reason I was late is that I was chairing a private meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade&mdash;I am Chairman of that Committee&mdash;with, ironically, two members of the ANC constitutional committee, Mr Zola Skwiyiya and Professor Dular Omar. They were in Australia to seek legal advice from all sorts of people, including, I suspect, members of the Opposition, about how to draft a democratic constitution for a non-racial democratic South Africa and a commitment to a bill of rights.

As it turned out, because I was late, I was the one person who did not take 10 minutes; I had only two minutes right at the end. So I did not limit any of the other members of the Committee in asking questions. I was the only one who was limited because I was late, and I have explained the reasons for that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make just a few remarks in relation to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures, its tabling this morning and the motion moved by Senator Alston that the Senate take note of it. The first point I want to make is a very simple one and bears repeating because, as I understand the position of members of the Labor Party on this matter, they do not understand it and so it has to be repeated until they finally do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is this: members of the Labor Party cannot clean up the conduct of elections by taking away or killing the most essential element of those elections. It is a bit like throwing the baby out with the bath water. It is absolutely essential for the proper conduct of elections that we have what is sometimes called a free exchange of information, but that would more properly be described as an unrestricted exchange of information. That is the very basis of an election. It is on that basis that those who have the capacity to vote decide who they want to vote for. The whole system does not work if we cannot have an unrestricted exchange of views at election time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have Government senators saying, `We will fix up this corruption', about which they seem to know so much. They are saying, `We'll fix that up. We'll restrict the exchange of views at election time'. There is no way they can describe the proposal they are putting forward as anything other than that. It will mean that my Party, as a major party, the Australian Democrats, as a major party, and the Labor Party will be able to put their views. They will nonetheless be restricted in the amount of time they use, but they will get some time. Let us not pretend we will have unrestricted access to putting our views; it will be restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us also not pretend that it is free time. It is only free to us; we do not have to pay. The community and other advertisers will pay in the end and it will all flow through to their products. Let us not kid ourselves that Labor has found some magic way to get free time. It is the old story of no such thing as a free lunch. The simple point is: what if there is a major party issue that I feel differently about from the majority of my Party and I want to put out one radio advertisement during election time to say to people, `Look, as a senator for South Australia, I do not agree with that'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give honourable senators an example. Despite having promised that it would not introduce one and despite, its having been introduced, having promised that it would not increase it, the Labor Party decided to double the sales tax on wine. As it happens, my State produces nearly 60 per cent of Australia's wine. </PARA>

It is not worth going into the reasons why my Party chose to support it nor the reasons why I would not, partly because I think that is obvious; my State produces 60 per cent of the wine and we were going to be disadvantaged far more than any other State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What if that happened just before an election? Under this legislation I would not be able to tell the electors of South Australia that I was prepared to stand up for their position. That is absolutely outrageous. So the big voices get a say but the little voices do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the growing concerns about Australian politics today is the power of the major parties&mdash;the power of the registered and organised political parties. More and more we are seeing a swing towards what one might call fringe groups, because there is a perception that the major parties are not representing the wide variety of views of the community. In response to that, we are seeing more and more independents being elected to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what are some members of parliament doing? They are getting together in some sort of backdoor system to lock out would-be independents from being able to use electronic advertising at election time. They could not come at a more disgraceful act. How will the independents get a say?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a party holds the power, I can understand that it perhaps wants to keep it, but this is definitely not the right way to go about it. If a party wants the proper conduct of elections, it has to have an unrestricted exchange of views. The independents have to be allowed to have their say. Individuals who come from the major parties have to have a say to the extent that it is different from what the majority might think. If a party in power does not do this, it is a farce. It is just pretending that there is a free exchange of views when there is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Aulich came into the chamber and made some comments about corruption without going slightly pink in the face, which I was somewhat amazed at. Nonetheless, he made the mistake that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) made&mdash;a mistake, I might say, that was laughed at by the Human Rights Commission. He said, `This advertising on the radio and television is not free; it is paid for'. I have already established that the so-called `free time' on television is not free time. These people in the gallery will be paying for it by paying higher prices for the products that are advertised on television. Surely he does not think that the television stations will pay for it out of the goodness of their hearts, does he? Hell no! All Australians will be paying more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, the point I want to make is that the word `free' in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not understood by anyone other than Senator Aulich and Senator Bolkus to mean `that which is not paid for'. I doubt whether even Senator Schacht would be so stupid as to go along with that notion. He has a long record of understanding human rights and he must understand that that is not what `free' means in that covenant. He knows it full well. </PARA>

It does not mean that; it means unrestricted. So if I want to put a different view to yours, Mr Acting Deputy President, or if a member of the public in the gallery wants to place one advertisement to suggest that people should vote for me, Senator Olsen or Senator Schacht, they should be able to do so.

I do not call that expensive. I am amazed that we get away with it so cheaply&mdash;absolutely amazed. Let us suppose that we were to go in for something which Senator Schacht might prefer, even more than this alleged free time. If we said to the Australian Electoral Commission, `Look, we, the Liberal Party, will give you a leaflet, the Democrats will give you a leaflet and the Labor Party will give you a leaflet, could you distribute one of each of these leaflets? They will not have any propaganda in them; you will check that the content is all right.'&mdash;the thought police will be out and they will check that it is okay&mdash;`Will you send them out to each elector?', it is London to a brick on that the Electoral Commission could not do that for $3 a head.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is not simply a question of being able to advertise so that a view can be put. I am well aware of the fact that some of the advertisements, especially those run by the Australian Labor Party at the last election, do not have much in the way of substantive comment about politics. But they do&mdash;and this is important&mdash;raise the issues. If the Labor Party wants to run, as it did in the last election, some overly schmalzy environmental advertisement, pretending it would be the friend of the environment&mdash;it has been caught out now on pretending to be the friend of the environment&mdash;and if it wants to suggest that somehow the advertisement tells the public something about the Labor Party, I say it should be able to do so.

I say that for two reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the running of that advertisement will only raise the issue in the public's mind. The fact that the Labor Party runs that advertisement is a good thing. It encourages debate. Some people will say, `What a load of rubbish; Labor will never do that'. Of course, in hindsight, people know full well how much value there was in a Labor Party commitment to look after the environment. It has been caught out on that. At least the running of that advertisement with the limited information that it might have included did generate some discussion about what the Federal Parliament should be doing about the environment. It gave me the opportunity to put my views when the matter was raised. It would have given the Australian Democrats the opportunity to make some response to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, advertisements are important not only because of their substantive content&mdash;they should not be criticised for the lack thereof&mdash;but also because they play another role. This unrestricted exchange of information that I say we should have generates discussion. That is what advertisements should do at election time. I do not regard $1.80 a head, or $3 a head, as expensive at all. Sure, I will never see $30m. I will probably never have $1m or $500,000. But for the nation to spend $18m at an election&mdash;$1.80 a head&mdash;to inform people of the various views and to generate debate strikes me as being cheap, very inexpensive. </PARA>

She must have been chatting in the corner when I was speaking because she missed the point I made: the advertisements that do not necessarily have substantive content in them at least play another important role. They generate debate. They raise the issues. They make it so that when Senator Kernot, Senator Schacht or I go to a public meeting, that issue is raised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move on to the question of corruption, which, Mr Acting Deputy President, you say that your Party knows so much about. In your speech, you indicated that you have full knowledge of the level of corruption and you implied that there was some relationship between corruption and the need of the parties to have money to advertise. Perhaps, Mr Acting Deputy President, you have some special knowledge of that which I do not have. I myself do not have any knowledge of that. What I do know about corruption is this: it takes two to tango. Corruption is a function, in part, of people who want to seek influence, meeting with other people who are prepared to sell it. That is what it is. It is not just a function of money needed to advertise; it is a function of people who want to buy influence and cheapskates who are prepared to sell it when they can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Removing the opportunity for the parties to advertise as they will, and for independents, et cetera, to advertise as they will, will not get rid of those people in the community with an amount of wealth who seek to buy influence. They will still be there and they will be looking for other ways to advertise. I suggest, Mr Acting Deputy President, that if it is the case, as you seem to allege it is, that there are people in politics who will sell that influence&mdash;and you say that they will sell it to get advertising money&mdash;then they will sell that influence to get some other benefit, either for their party or for a personal benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So removing the opportunity for individuals and parties to advertise as they choose does not get rid of those who want to seek influence and does not get rid of those who are prepared to sell it. That is the fundamental question that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, need to answer about corruption before your Party suggests limiting people's rights to speak as they will during an election, the most important time to have unrestricted speech. I noticed Senator Faulkner, whose intellectual capacity sometimes astounds, on the other side of the chamber say, `People can put their view at another time'. Great! It will be a real help to members of the public who want to vote if I have put my view about something six months before an election. That will be a great help for people who want to know what I think, who will have to go back and look through what I might have said, or some advertisement I might have placed, some time ago.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned Senator Kemp's role on the Committee. Frankly, I thought his behaviour was maniacal and obsessional.

When he mentioned that, I was reminded of something I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 23 November. I read an article on page 7 entitled `Coalition kicks off 4-month soft sell'. This article was about the four-month soft sell of the coalition's GST package and it states:</PARA>

<PARA>What hypocrites those opposite are. Throughout the period that this Select Committee met, the Government's Bill came under close examination from all members of the Committee. It became clear that, regardless of the irrelevancies that were brought forward by the Opposition, not one substantial criticism could be made. There is a continuing fraud being perpetrated by the Opposition about disclosure. It claims to believe in `full, fair and equitable disclosure' but, of course, it does not believe in disclosure at all and it is going to fight tooth and nail to stop political donations in this country being disclosed. The Opposition will use any excuse and any device to try to ensure that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter of public interest which I think will concern all honourable senators and certainly will concern the public. Several weeks ago, staff at the Department of Veterans' Affairs National Computer Centre in Sydney placed bans on the use of computer facilities as a protest against proposed staff arrangements following the decision to privatise the National Computer Centre. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, in this place, in answer to a question I asked of him, said that the work bans were deplorable and that the action of the Public Sector Union was not responsible action in the circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government took the union to the Industrial Relations Commission on a number of occasions and had the bans declared illegal, and still they remained in place despite repeated attempts to dislodge them. These are the staff who, in a submission in March last year, said that one of the penalties of commercialisation of these computer facilities would be the loss of `a loyal and dedicated staff who understand what the Department and its clients need'. The actions of the Public Sector Union throughout this whole dispute show a total lack of understanding of the needs of the veterans community, a total lack of concern for those health service providers who look after the veterans, and, I now find, a total lack of concern for the taxpayers of Australia, many of whom are in difficult financial circumstances, as we all know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have criticised the Government for not being prepared to take strong enough action against this union. The people involved could well have been stood down. They could well have lost their pay for not doing the work for which they were employed. Those work bans went on for far too long, as a result of the Government's inaction and its failure to take the union head on, as it deserves to be. Single mothers, whom the Government professes to be concerned about, were going without pay while they continued to look after our veterans on their daily visits to their homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I want to take the matter further. The Department then placed advertisements in the daily newspapers advising veterans that their pensions would continue to be paid despite the continuing work bans, although many of the allowances were not paid. Those advertisements, of course, were an extra cost to revenue and a cost to the taxpayer. But, beyond that, we now find that the taxpayer has been funding the campaign. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter which was sent by Mr Robert Morrison of the Public Sector Union Delegates Committee in Brisbane to the Secretary of the Proserpine Returned Services League Club. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public Sector Union DVA Sub-Branch Delegates Committee (SDC)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Secretary</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You may be aware that Public Sector Union members in the Department of Veterans Affairs are currently taking action as a result of the Federal Government's decision to privatise the Department's National Computer Centre. All PSU actions to date have been directed at the Department and the PSU is making every effort to minimise the impact of these actions on clients, but the Government's privatisation moves will have a serious impact on DVA staff and clients alike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July the Government announced its decision to privatise the operations of the National Computer Centre. Bids from public sector agencies were rejected and two private companies were asked to make "best and final offers" in line with the Government's stated aim of promoting the Australian information technology industry. Yet according to newspaper reports one of these firms is now merging with a multi-national company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also significant community concern over the security of client information, highlighted in the "4 Corners" report of 21 October 1991. The privatisation means that client's personal and medical details will be put into unknown, unaccountable hands of an organisation whose main motivation is profit. This decision is of grave concern to the PSU generally in that Government functions, particularly records, should remain the sole responsibility of the Government and be carried out in the public sector. The significant issues are security of data, privacy provisions, enforcement of contractual penalties and protection against financial devastation. Effectively the decision to privatise the Computer Centre is the PRIVATISATION OF PENSIONS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is just one aspect of the Government's dismantling of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The transfer of Repatriation hospitals to State control, the proposal to move the Treatment Accounts area to the Health Insurance Commission, and rumours regarding the Social Security take over of Veteran's Pension payments show the general trend to wind down services to veterans. The PSU is also concerned by membership job losses in this time of rising unemployment. It is because of the likely loss of nearly 100 jobs in the National Computer Centre, without any real recompense for workers, that our members have been forced to put bans on computer systems.</PARA>

I ask the Minister: will he see that an investigation into this issue is carried out immediately? Will he come back to the Senate and advise us of how much these activities and illegal work bans have added to the already enormous cost of disruption? What has the taxpayer had to pay? How many of the State branches of the Department have had their resources pilfered&mdash;there is no other word for it&mdash;by the Public Sector Union in this way?

The realised price is calculated as a weighted average of the prices received from exports and local sale of LPG during, in this case, the six month period from 1 September 1990 until 28 February 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the excise rate effected by Clause 4 reflects the higher export prices obtained for LPG during the relevant six month period as a result of the Iraq/Kuwait conflict.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Speaking for the Opposition on these two Bills, I note that the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1991 increases the duty payable on LPG from 1 April 1991 to 1 July 1991 in accordance with the proclaimed formula which increases the duty from $5.75 per kilolitre to $35.94 per kilolitre. That was basically as a consequence of the increase in prices through the Gulf War. But from 1 July 1991, which is now past, it is replaced by the resource rent tax under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Amendment Act 1991, so there will be no requirement for any future Bill of this nature to contain such a provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part deals with a reduction in excise on aviation gasoline to compensate for the fact that firefighting provisions at secondary airports around Australia have been withdrawn. That has led to a huge decrease of 0.321c per litre from 27.395c per litre to 27.074c per litre. As a purchaser of avgas, I welcome the move, but I must say that it is so small as to not send me into paroxysms of ecstasy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one sense, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is a routine tariff Bill which comes before the chamber quite regularly, amending rates of duty; but in this case it also includes some policy issues and extends developing nation status for some new countries. The Bill, after some definitions and dates for operation of certain sections, defines the developing country rate of duty for certain goods which are presently covered by quota arrangements which end in 1993. There are some corrections in accordance with the harmonised tariff and there are some corrections of anomalies created by the introduction of the harmonised tariff. A free rate of duty is declared for parts of wheelchairs. Orange juice has been redefined to include products of oranges, regardless of methods of derivation, to restore the intended rate of assistance to the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important policy change introduced is to facilitate Australia's partial accession to the 1950 UNESCO agreement&mdash;the so-called Florence Agreement. This allows free rates of duty for educational, scientific and cultural material. Developing country status is conferred on Czechoslovakia and Namibia. The Opposition does not oppose that, but I think it is more than time for Australia to look at the concessions it gives on tariffs to developing nations. Some of those nations now arguably have a higher standard of living&mdash;or will very soon have a higher standard of living&mdash;than Australia has. The only thing in defence of the present policy is that with falling levels of tariff protection, the concessions granted to developing nations obviously become fewer year by year. Finally, the revenue component is removed from the current duty rate on the revenue collected on denatured ethyl alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few moments I have left I will make some observations on tariffs. My position on this is very clear. I came into the Senate nearly 14 years ago and in my maiden speech I talked about the dangers of a very high tariff regime. I have not changed my basic position. Obviously, over the years experience has tended to give me a slightly different view on some details, but the basic principle that I had when I came in years ago was that tariff protection really is something that should be eliminated but, from a practical point of view, if that cannot be attained, it should be kept at the very lowest level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came into the Senate the average industry rate was about 30 per cent. It is interesting to note that some of the few people here now on both sides who were in the Parliament at that time have become arch proponents of a low tariff regime, but at the time it was not a very popular position to adopt. The evils of it were quite obvious: poor productivity, poor management, strong unions and very, very low productivity in Australia. That was because, when there were any problems at all, a manufacturer would simply ask for increased tariff protection and it would be granted. We even went past tariff protection and got to the absurd stage of having quotas, which further distorted the markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that there has been a reduction in tariffs, but it is not a simple matter that can be thought about in black-and-white terms so we can say either that we will have no tariffs or that we will have a lot of them. There are very significant consequences in reducing tariff regimes. They have to be thought through and alternative strategies have to be put in place to compensate for those changes. I think the Government is doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My great concern with what is happening at present is that the matter of balance is not being addressed. General Australian industry tariff protection&mdash;and I am pleased to see that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, is in the chair for this, and can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;with the exception of two groups, is around 7 per cent&mdash;yes, the Minister confirms that. And that is a great reduction on what it was before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the question of balance, two industry groups are excluded: the textile, clothing and footwear group, and the motor industry group. Both of those have had very effective lobbies, irrespective of the politics of the government of the day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! In accordance with the undertaking I gave earlier, I will now set out for the Senate the procedural implications of the proposed resolution for a joint meeting of the two Houses to be addressed by President Bush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so I make it clear that it is a matter for decision by the Senate whether this meeting takes place and the form it takes. The proposed joint meeting can occur only if agreed to by the Senate by resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now set out the effect of the parts of the provisions of the resolution proposed by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (1)(a) of the resolution would invite the President of the United States to address the Senate at the proposed time. The reason for this provision is that it is proposed that this occasion be a formal meeting of the Senate. A person other than a senator cannot address the Senate except by express invitation of the Senate. This paragraph would also fix the time for the proposed meeting in the same way as the Senate fixes the times of its normal meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (1)(b) of the resolution accepts the invitation of the House of Representatives to meet with that House in the House of Representatives chamber. It is for the Senate to determine the place, as well as the time, of its meetings. The effect of this paragraph is that the Senate would hold a formal meeting in the House of Representatives chamber at the invitation of that House. The situation at the meeting would be that the two Houses would be holding formal meetings simultaneously in the same place, so that President Bush would be addressing a formal meeting of the two Houses together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (1)(c) of the resolution would have the effect that the Senate would adopt for itself the rules proposed by the House of Representatives for the joint meeting. This is necessary because, as the meeting would be a formal meeting of each House, it is necessary to provide some rules for the meeting. The rules proposed by the House are contained in paragraph (3) of the resolution of the House, and are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the Speaker would preside at the meeting&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I would like to make it clear that it is proposed that I be seated on the dais next to the Speaker during the meeting, as occurred with the former Speaker when she attended the last joint meeting here in the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)the only proceedings at the meeting would be an address by the President of the United States&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it is proposed that the Speaker briefly introduce President Bush, and after President Bush's address the meeting would be automatically adjourned&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)the procedures of the House would apply to the meeting so far as they are applicable. . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is necessary to make this provision to avoid any difficulty arising from any inconsistency between the procedures of the two Houses; it should not be necessary to apply any procedures because of paragraph (b).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this resolution is passed the Senate will assemble, at the time provided, in the House of Representatives chamber, for the formal meeting of the Senate at that time and place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedure proposed by the resolution is entirely new, because neither House has a practice of allowing persons other than members to address it, and neither House has procedures for joint meetings for this purpose.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not tired at all. The problem, regrettably, is that the Government did not extend us the courtesy of showing us the proposed resolution that it was going to put forthwith in this chamber. The usual procedure is that notice is given and we have a chance to consider the content. In this instance, no doubt because of the time constraints, the Government wanted to put it immediately. We would simply have appreciated an opportunity to peruse it and consider it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you have said in your statement, Mr President, what is proposed here is entirely new. Neither House has procedures for joint meetings. If we are to take a step which may well have consequences down the track, I would have thought we would have been extended the courtesy of an opportunity to consider the detail. Anyway, the Government, after we raised the matter, has given us several hours to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point that I want to make is that, as I understand it, this matter has come about because of the courtesy that was extended to Prime Minister Hawke to address a joint sitting of the US Congress. The Prime Minister accepted the invitation and addressed the joint sitting. In accordance with the usual practice in the United States, that sitting is in the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister was desirous of extending a similar courtesy, on behalf of the Parliament of Australia, to the President of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we understand it, this is very much a one-off situation. It is not the normal practice in this country. We have adopted the practice of giving a foreign dignitary who is here as a guest of government the opportunity to address parliamentarians elsewhere in the building&mdash;usually at a ceremonial dinner in the Great Hall. The distinction has been drawn here because we are repaying a courtesy that was extended by the United States Congress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are addressing this matter very much on the basis that it is not intended to set any precedent. We understand that to be the case and that is the way we have been looking at it. This occasion should not be confused with a joint sitting of the chambers&mdash;we understand the situation that is prescribed under the law in this country in this respect&mdash;which is very rare and which has nothing to do with what is proposed on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased, Mr President, that in the statement that you have just put before us, you have, in fact, used the language `proposed joint meeting of the Houses' so that that confusion will not be drawn. Unfortunately, the language of `joint sitting' has been used by others and that has confused the issue and raised questions of precedents of joint sittings, where they took place and the format for those sittings under Australian law. That is not relevant, as I understand it, in this instance. It is not a joint sitting of the chambers; it is proposed that a unique joint meeting of both Houses will be called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this unusual circumstance, the next question is, I guess, `Which is the more appropriate chamber for such a joint meeting to be held?'. However, because such a meeting is unprecedented, there is little we can turn to in that regard. As I said, we are repaying a courtesy that took place in the United States lower House. I hesitate to refer to a previous joint sitting, because I think it is probably unhelpful to do so, but the one in 1974 in this Parliament was in the House of Representatives. Openings are held in the Senate and the Monarch or the Monarch's representative attends under the terms of the Constitution. The House of Representatives is invited to attend our chamber and is addressed by the Monarch or the Monarch's representative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though it is inappropriate to look to precedents, there does not seem to be a clear message in similar examples as to what is the more appropriate measure. In this instance, the invitation was to be in the House of Representatives. So, in those terms, we believe that a precedent will definitely not be created if, in the future, another government desires to repay a courtesy that might be extended to an Australian Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I understand and I appreciate the reasons for this being held in the chamber, I think it does create some little difficulty for the future in that I am not sure that other foreign dignitaries will understand or readily accept the argument that I have just put as to why the US President should be uniquely excepted from our normal practice. It is a situation that we are, nevertheless, prepared to accept and to deal with as it might occur in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, we have on that basis had a look at the words of the motion that the Government has put before us today. The words `joint meeting' seem to us to be appropriate to what is being sought. We accept what you say, that if it is to be a joint meeting it also requires an invitation of the Senate. This is something that we have not addressed because the words of that motion were put before us only this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that we do not see it creating any precedent as to which is the more appropriate chamber for such exercises or for the way in which we should repay courtesies or offer courtesy to foreign dignitaries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have some major concerns that follow on from a lot of what Senator Hill has been saying. I will deal firstly with the issue of precedent. It will be very difficult in the future to say to other foreign dignitaries, other foreign heads of state, `No, you do not rate quite that highly'. I wonder how much of a precedent we really are setting. I would like the Government to tell the Senate where the line will be drawn in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am well aware that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) addressed the American Congress when he visited the United States. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>However, this was by no means a unique occurrence. This courtesy is extended by the United States federal parliament to numerous foreign dignitaries. That is its practice; that is its procedure. But we will be setting an entirely new procedure for our Parliament. The opinion of the Australian Democrats is that it is far more appropriate that the joint meeting be held in the Great Hall, as has been the practice in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern of the Democrats is the timing of the meeting and, therefore, the enormous cost that will be involved. My second question to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) relates to the provision of full estimates of cost, including the cost of travel. I imagine that honourable senators would not need staff but there certainly would be a travel cost for all honourable senators and probably for some spouses. There would certainly be a cost in running Parliament House in terms of attendants, security staff, catering staff, et cetera. I would like, within a week or so, to be given an estimate of the cost so that the Australian Democrats can look further at it. Even before receiving such an estimate, I suggest that it probably will be a fairly large sum. At a time when government is cutting costs everywhere and anywhere, there would be far better ways in which that money could be spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to refer to something that the President said in introducing this debate. He said that it is up to us to ask whether there has already been an exchange of letters and undertakings inviting the President of the United States of America to the joint meeting, or at least some understanding that he will be invited. If that has occurred, it will be very difficult for us to pull out now. It will be very difficult for the Senate if the House of Representatives has passed a motion and it is understood that a joint meeting will take place. If some indication has already been given, it will be extremely difficult for us to do anything now but to sit here and nod.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To resume from where we were 22 minutes ago, I was talking about the lack of balance in the Government's tariff policy which excluded two groups&mdash;the textile, clothing and footwear group and the motor group. It is not my intention to take up the time of the Senate by engaging in a lengthy discussion about tariff policy, but the Parliament has not addressed this vitally important matter. I think it reflects on the Government's management of business that we are dealing with a Bill of this nature, which does provide a legitimate vehicle for senators to express their views on a matter of great importance to Australian industry, within the constraints of a lunchtime debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to return to the point I was making about the imbalance between these two groups and the rest of Australian industry. This imbalance exists purely because of the effect of the lobby groups which represent both industries. It is very hard to determine the level of tariff protection that applies today in the textile, clothing and footwear group but estimates range between 80 to 150 per cent. For the motor industry it is said to be somewhere around 50 to 60 per cent. Again, I say it is hard to set precise figures. But one thing we can be absolutely certain of is that it is a magnitude beyond the tariff protection that general industry enjoys which, as I said before, is about 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we look at the consequences of this because everyone needs to wear clothes and everyone needs to wear shoes. The poorest families have to buy clothing and footwear. The effect of the tariff regime means that those families&mdash;in fact all of us&mdash;have to pay at least twice what we should pay for that clothing. Similarly, in the motor industry, we are paying twice the price that we would pay on the open market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side of it is to look at what benefits we get from this regime. I was browsing recently through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Farm Journal</EMPHASIS>, a journal which I would not put at the highest levels of scholarship in Australia. I doubt that it has the sort of editorial board that most scientific journals would have to review articles before they are published. But the author of an interesting article on protectionism points out that, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for 1988-89, the textile, clothing and footwear sector comprised 2,311 establishments employing 73,300 people, paid $1.3 billion in wages and generated sales worth about $4.9 billion. The article also points out that, in the same year, Australia exported less than $80m worth of clothing and footwear but imported goods worth $1.1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the farm groups had 125,708 farms in the country, employing about 372,000 people, and their gross value of production was $22.8 billion, and they exported a staggering $16 billion worth of product. The point of relevance here is that the farm sector enjoys little or no tariff protection at all. That leads me to the next point I want to comment on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of food imported into this country. Most of the stuff, with the possible exception of caviar and French champagne, can be made from Australian sources. The level of importation now runs at in excess of $2.2 billion. It is a huge input. I started expressing concern about this publicly a couple of years back and had a number of press releases, statements and articles published on the nature and extent of the importation of food into Australia. It has since been picked up by others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, one of the large papers ran a campaign to save the pineapple. It was targeted at the importation of pineapples from other Pacific countries which was undercutting the Australian product on the shelves. That was quite a worthy campaign. The trouble with it was that it got off the rails. It failed to look at what was being offered. The problem really is a marketing problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian food and agricultural producers are pretty efficient. The good ones are very good. The weakness in the whole chain comes with the marketing. The existence of statutory boards, orderly marketing systems and the rest of it have led to monopoly situations which, not in all cases but in a large number of cases, simply are not competitive and do not stay with the market. In the pineapple industry the problem is that the company that does most of the packing and presentation of the product has not moved with the times. In one case it is doing a very good job. It has introduced a new line in fruit juices which is right up to world standards. The quality of the product, the packaging and the presentation of it are absolutely first class, but that is done under a different brand name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went out and bought some tinned pineapple last weekend, just out of curiosity, knowing I was going to make this speech. The tins I bought off the supermarket shelf were actually rusty. The labelling is the same as when I was a kid, except that it now has a bar code on it. The presentation of the food is simply not competitive. That general comment can be applied to most Australian food producers. The presentation and marketing is bad. It is not competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I am going around Asian areas I always go into the supermarkets, and I go into the supermarkets in the most expensive stores because that is where one is going to get imported food. It has been my experience in Tokyo, Manila and other capital cities in Asia that it is very rare to find Australian food on supermarket shelves. One will find a great amount of American food, one will find European food from all countries, and one will find New Zealand food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand is very actively marketing into an area which is in our own backyard. Part of that problem, I think, comes from the fact that some of the larger Australian food processors are overseas owned and the owners put marketing restrictions on where the Australian companies can sell. I emphasise the point that if Australia is to counter the flood of imports, it is not necessarily a matter of calling for tariff protection. The first thing to do is to make sure that we have a competitive product coming out of our own sources before we make any complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill said something a few minutes ago, by way of interjection, about New Zealand. I do not know any more dishonest country with respect to overseas marketing than New Zealand. I will give the Senate an example.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was contacted a while ago by probably the best producer of oysters, with respect to high quality oysters, in this country. He told me the story of how he had an order from New Zealand for frozen oysters. He supplied 100 dozen oysters to New Zealand. They were frozen; they were opened on a half shell. The day before they arrived in New Zealand, the New Zealand Government, despite the CER agreement, changed the regulation to ban them. The oysters could not be sold in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night, the principal of the same company told me that he was at an oyster tasting in Sydney, and being served there&mdash;by way of comparison&mdash;were New Zealand oysters in precisely the same format as those in which his oysters had been rejected in New Zealand a couple of weeks earlier. If we are going down the path of zero tariff protection, particularly when we have agreements with countries such as New Zealand, in the CER, it is very important that we stand up to them and stop changes to regulations which operate against our interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, the final point on zero tariffs is that it does not matter how efficient we are within this country, we will always have a wage inequity. We will always have the case where we pay, in today's figures, a minimum of about $8 an hour. There are other countries in the region that pay about 80 cents an hour or 80 cents a day. That wage balance is something that has always got to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest issue in the whole of the tariff argument relates to the inefficiencies within the country itself&mdash;the problems on the wharfs, the huge problems in transport, the delay over the third runway at Sydney and all the rest of it. It is estimated that inefficiencies that are correctable within Australia add at least $50 billion to the cost of production, the cost of industrial activity in this country. That is the primary target for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More important than proceeding down the path of tariff reduction is to clean up the inefficiencies within Australia, which can be done. If you go down the path of reducing tariff protection without cleaning up those inefficiencies, you are really taking the life raft away from Australian industry before the passengers of the life raft have reached the shore. We must attend to those reforms within Australian industry and then we must proceed down the path of reducing the tariffs so that Australian industry is competitive and can sell to the markets of the world in the way we have to, to survive, and the way we can if we get efficiencies within this country. I give my support to these two Bills. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Golden Circle pineapple company in Queensland employs many people&mdash;1,300, I think. It is a growers organisation that takes fruit from 500 or 600 growers. I believe its product is absolutely A-grade. It is produced by the most modern technology in the world. It has 75 per cent of the market, and its sales are not reduced because the product is inadequate in any way. The Golden Circle product is one of the best products in Australia and is marketed in the most professional way. The problem that it faces is that much of the imported product has very heavy subsidies on it and is subsidised in a number of ways other than by direct subsidies. I put those facts on the record because, as I said earlier, I certainly would not want Senator MacGibbon's views to be considered as the views of the Opposition in the Senate overall. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In handling this Bill on behalf of the Opposition, I indicate at the outset that the Opposition will accept this legislation, which amends the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 in three principal areas. First, the legislation changes the name of the principal Act to the Financial Transaction Reports Act and the name of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, or AUSTRAC. Secondly, the legislation defines the time at which a person bringing currency into or out of Australia must make a report to a Customs officer. Thirdly, and significantly, the legislation provides for the reporting and analysis of international telegraphic transfer data.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To deal briefly with the amendments which change the Agency's name and that of the principal Act, as I said earlier, the Opposition supports this change. The change reflects reality in that the majority of the transactions involved are in fact non-cash transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second main area of amendment is introduced in clause 7. This clause amends section 15 of the Act, which presently requires a person importing or exporting more than $5,000 in currency to make a report in a prescribed form to a Customs officer. The question has arisen as to exactly when such a report must be made. It was held in a recent South Australian Supreme Court case, Schultz v. Taylor, that a report could still be filed during a Customs baggage search upon a Customs officer discovering the currency. These amendments will make it clear that where currency is being brought into Australia, the relevant time for making the report is when the person arrives at the baggage inspection counter. Where currency is being taken out of Australia, the relevant time is when the person arrives at the passport examination area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area in which this Bill amends the principal Act is in relation to the reporting of international funds transfer instructions. The reporting requirement in relation to cash transfers into and out of Australia applies to hard currency&mdash;coin and paper money&mdash;and not to telegraphic transfers. The obligation is on the person doing the transfer to report it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 9 inserts a new division 3 into the Act to deal with reports of international funds transfer instructions. Cash dealers in Australia will be required to report such instructions within 14 days of sending or receiving them, as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is the case with the legislation currently in force, provision will be made to protect cash dealers from suits arising from any action they have taken under the reporting requirements. Officers of the agency will have powers to inspect the reporting systems of cash dealers and it will be an offence to fail to comply with the reporting requirements. Cash dealers who conduct a large volume of transactions by telex and whose systems are not computerised are exempted from reporting requirements until their systems are computerised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Opposition welcome these amendments. It has become apparent that there are huge losses to taxation revenue resulting from the inability to monitor international telegraphic transfers of funds. Until 1 July 1990, a system of tax screening arrangement and foreign currency controls monitored, to some extent, the movement of funds into and out of Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1991 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration tabled a report dealing with international profit shifting arrangements. Evidence given to that Committee suggested that annual tax revenue losses as a result of the absence of a proper system for detecting tax evasion through profit shifting may be in the order of $100m to $250m. The absence of a proper system for monitoring international transactions also gives rise to $10m in lost Customs revenue and further revenue losses of $30m through the laundering of the proceeds of crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's recommendation, which this Bill implements, was that a system of monitoring international telegraphic transfers be put in place and administered by the Cash Transaction Reports Agency. They are the main aspects of this Bill, which, as I said, the coalition welcomes and supports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are dealing with this legislation, I want to raise some aspects of the principal Act which are for me a cause of concern. Inconvenience and difficulties are being caused by the requirements under the Act with regard to the identification points system for many pensioners seeking to open new bank accounts because they do not readily hold sufficient of the documents or the items on the check list to obtain the requisite 100 points and can only obtain them at considerable expense which, as pensioners, they can ill afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the Senate one example of a constituent who recently raised this issue with me. He is an elderly service pensioner who recently tried to open a savings account with a branch of the Westpac Bank in Adelaide because he already had a defence service home loan with that branch of that bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nearest branch of the Commonwealth Bank, where he currently holds his normal account, now requires him to undertake two separate bus journeys to that bank and is charging what he regards as an exorbitant amount to transfer his mortgage payments from that Commonwealth Bank account to the Westpac Bank branch where his housing loan is being held. For that reason he wished to open a new account at that Westpac Bank branch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular pensioner does not hold a current driver's licence, a birth certificate, or a credit card; nor does he have a telephone service. Therefore, he was unable to obtain the 100 points required to open a new bank account, despite the fact that he has had a housing loan with that bank for the past six years, a loan that is approved by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the Department of Veterans' Affairs nor the Department of Social Security was able&mdash;or they claimed they were unable&mdash;to provide a letter of reference of the kind which the bank required for him to gain the requisite points to open this account. Of course, for him as a pensioner to obtain a birth certificate costing $20 was something which he could ill afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst indicating that the Opposition supports the amendment to the Act, I ask the Minister to indicate in his response what consideration the Government may be prepared to give to people such as this pensioner who find themselves in circumstances where they are unable to obtain requisite points under the legislation to open a new bank account. Some special consideration needs to be given to people who find themselves in that position. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason given by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) in his second reading speech on the Australian Wool Industry Council Bill 1991 for the discharge of the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill 1991 was Opposition concerns about legislation by regulation. I am sure honourable senators will recall that, in a media release of 18 June 1991, my colleague in the other chamber the honourable member for Murray, Mr Bruce Lloyd, outlined the coalition's objections to the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill 1991, which were that various industry councils would be formed by regulation rather than by legislation through Parliament. In that press release Mr Lloyd referred to these issues and the concerns that had been expressed by the National Farmers Federation, the Cattle Council of Australia, the Grains Council of Australia and the Dairy Industry Council. That matter is now addressed by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main object of the Primary Industry Councils Bill 1991 is to provide for the establishment of industry councils to facilitate industry involvement in the policy formulation process. The functions of industry councils are contained in clause 7 and include: to keep under review, and report to the Minister on, the strategic direction of the relevant primary industry; to inquire into, and report on, matters affecting the relevant primary industry which the council thinks require investigation or action; to inquire into, and report to the Minister on, matters affecting the relevant primary industry referred to the council by the Minister; to convene industry review conferences; and to consult with other bodies as it sees fit. </PARA>

<PARA>comment briefly on the makeup of the proposed Grains Industry Council. I believe that the grain industry is represented well enough without having to set up a special industry council. However, the Government has made its decision after receiving representations from some of the industry bodies around the country, although those so-called peak bodies do not necessarily represent totally the views of growers at all times, or even some of the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this Industry Council is to be set up, and it may have a place in Australia at present because of the difficult situation that the grain industry is going through. The makeup of the Council represents a reasonable spread of the grains industry; but three members are to be appointed on the nomination of the Grains Council of Australia and I wonder how many grain growers the Grains Council of Australia really represents. Another member will be the Chairman of the Conference of Chairmen of the Australian Bulk Grain Handling Authorities. They represent all growers because they are all shareholders, but others mentioned in the schedule to the Bill do not totally represent their growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in paragraph (k) under `Constitution of the Council' that there is to be a member appointed on the nomination of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

Australia warmly welcomes the announcement made by Japan a few days ago that it will cease all high seas driftnet fishing by the end of 1992. This is a major step towards the global moratorium Australia has been trying to achieve for some time. The Japanese Government has announced that its driftnet fishing fleet will be cut back by 50 per cent before July 1992 through a reduction in the number of vessels, the length of their nets and the areas of operation. Japan will implement a complete global moratorium on the practice by 31 December 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>

These have vindicated the concerns of the international community about the impact of that fishing technique on fishery resources and marine wildlife. There is now widespread agreement that driftnetting on the high seas should cease.</PARA>

As a result of that deregulation, restrictions over the type and number of aircraft that could be imported into Australia were lifted and air fares became a matter for the industry and not for the Independent Airfares Committee. Beyond the maintenance of safety standards and the provision of traffic management, the Federal Government has no role to play in interstate air services.

According to Dr Hewson, the Opposition will allow both Qantas, our international carrier, and Air New Zealand to operate on domestic routes in Australia which will offer cheaper air fares. This is pure fantasyland. The Opposition is clearly very sensitive about what the document is called.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic point about the Department of Administrative Services over the last three years is that it has transformed enormously as a department. It has transformed in such a way, and will continue to transform, that as from July 1993, 85 per cent of its functions will be available for competition on the open market. The Department of Administrative Services will not have the tie over other departments that it has had in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gearing up to that, obviously in terms of maintaining a client base, the Department of Administrative Services has to promote itself. It does so in a way that matches the private sector and will continue to do so in such a way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Parer wants to focus his little mind on little gimmicks that may be used in promotion, so he may. But when he assesses the performance of the Department of Administrative Services he should look at the way that the Department has transformed over the last four years. We are talking about a department that has become more and more competitive and has, over recent years, reduced the level of its cost on the Budget by $260m per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As these reforms continue those reductions will increase to approximately $350m per annum. They are massive cost reductions imposed on a department and achieved through a process of reform of that department. We are also talking about a total restructuring of this department which over the past four years has meant a reduction in staffing levels from 18,600 to somewhere in the vicinity of 14,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making an assessment of the Department of Administrative Services, those opposite should keep those things in mind.

Initially I would refer Senator Bell to page 72 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. He might like to peruse that to see who has ministerial responsibility for the police. I certainly do not have it, unless a change has suddenly occurred in administrative orders. I do not have any knowledge of how many police personnel were used in AIDEX, nor should I. AIDEX is a privately run exhibition. It is not one run by the Government, in spite of a few misnomers. I have absolutely no idea how many police personnel were used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell asked me how many armed forces personnel were involved. I assume that he means inside the AIDEX exhibition. I will find out that information for him, but they would not number very many. I was then asked how many human resources from other government departments were involved. Again, I do not know. It is a privately run exhibition. Senator Bell would have to contact each department. I suspect there are none, but Senator Bell would have to ask that question of all of the other Ministers to get the answer. The answer to the question on the resources involved is the same.</PARA>

It is true to say that as a public relations exercise the demonstrations have not been terribly successful. I think that is a fact, without making judgments on AIDEX one way or the other. If he is so involved in this area, I suggest that Senator Bell does one thing: show some leadership. He should show a little leadership in the area by talking to those demonstrating outside the exhibition and perhaps trying to organise them in a more orderly and effective manner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The answer read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. The Department of Administrative Services (DAS) is implementing a progressive restructure of the fire protection maintenance contracts to allow more frequent market testing and facilitate the entry of new service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This follows the previous approach adopted in 1988 when six contract packages, covering all Commonwealth fire protection requirements in the ACT, were awarded on an open tender basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the successful contractors were traditional manufacturing based companies who effectively serviced their own equipment. This has ensured efficient and reliable servicing of fire protection equipment in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1988 contracts were let for a period of three years with a further three year option. However, after consulting clients, DAS decided to call fresh tenders after the first three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than invite open tenders for all contracts at the one time and for the same periods, DAS considered that, for the following reasons, existing contracts should be broken up into smaller packages, the letting of contracts should be staggered and a mixture of select and open tendering should be used:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the client's requirement for a particular level of service and a preference for a service provider with proven performance;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)obtaining the most cost effective delivery of the service;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)the importance and sensitivity of the facility;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)the role of the supplier of older equipment still in service, including the provision of technical information and spare parts which are often not available other than from the manufacturer of that older equipment. The ability to source replacement parts for equipment can extend its useful life and hence defer the capital cost of replacement;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)the need to regularly test the market for new entrants in servicing fire protection equipment in order to gain any savings in more effective and efficient industry practices; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f)the desirability of providing regular opportunities for new entrants while minimising unnecessary disruption to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the new staggered system has been put in place DAS plans to use open tendering for most, if not all, contracts in future. This will be increasingly practicable as older fire protection equipment is replaced by new facilities. The present preference, in some cases, to use the manufacturer of the equipment to also service that equipment would therefore no longer necessarily apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to contractors being recognised by Standards Australia DAS advises that Standards Australia accredits an organisation's quality system rather than the amount of work it has the capacity to carry out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. DAS advises that all five companies are registered as separate entities. Four share common directors and are listed by the Australian Securities Commission as having the same ultimate holding company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The companies were selected because they have an established record of satisfactory service, they are the manufacturer of significant items of installed equipment and are able to ensure adequate support and have satisfied the tenants of buildings that they can comply with their security requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3. DAS advises that careful analysis of each offer is undertaken and comparisons made with market rates for similar work. Preliminary evaluation of all tenders received to date indicates a significant reduction in the costs will be achieved under the new contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be recognised that price is not the sole determinant. A low price tender which cannot deliver the required level or type of service should not necessarily succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4. As indicated earlier the Commonwealth already held contracts with suppliers for fire protection services which could have been extended until 1994; however fresh tenders were invited. This allowed the scope of work to be refined, the prices offered to be reviewed and, for some contracts, new suppliers to enter the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to call some open tenders and some select tenders will allow an orderly transition within the industry. New contractors wishing to enter the market will be able to demonstrate their competence progressively and existing contractors will have time to adjust to new market conditions.</PARA>

<PARA>The answer given by Senator Richardson today was a follow-up to a question asked yesterday in my absence about where Senator Richardson stood in relation to a number of matters which are directly within his area of responsibility. I find it extraordinary that today he should yet again squib at answering that vital question. Not only does the question relate to matters about which he has spoken publicly and at length, but the first part of my question asked him directly whether he had authorised the submission to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which contains a number of matters squarely within his own area of responsibility. It is a submission submitted by his own Department. One would have thought that it has to have had his approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The submission contains a number of matters that bear directly on the question of double dipping and the questions of restricting access to age pensions, which, as we know, have been rising exponentially in recent years and are now costing the taxpayer almost $10 billion a year, in addition to the amount that is spent on veterans' service pensions, which I think is another $5 billion. Double dipping is therefore a critical issue and, for once in a very long career of political expediency, Senator Richardson on other occasions has had the courage to stand up and take a national interest view. That is why he has been going to places like the National Conference of the Association of Superannuation Funds at Southport a few weeks back where there were 780 delegates, which is a world record for the industry, so I am told. Who should be there in all his glory but the Minister for Social Security. Was he there on behalf of a colleague? Absolutely not. He was there in his own right as Minister for Social Security and he had no hesitation in giving the conference the benefit of his advice in a whole range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference review note, which records what the Minister had to say at the conference, says that he was talking about things that were not Government policy, but the 800 delegates were left in no doubt that the Government wants to see investment funds flowing into value-added industries. The Minister stressed that he was enunciating a personal point of view. So not only was he going there representing himself alone but also he was quite prepared to speak out on these areas. My information is that he told those present at the conference that the natives in Canberra were restless and it would only be a matter of time before the Government moved to introduce investment controls, unless he did something about it.

That criticism, according to AAP, drew a very quick response from the President of the Association, who said that complex rules imposed by the Government were to blame.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure Senator Ray is not familiar with the White Paper on simplification of superannuation. Mr Kerin only saw the need for it when he got such a very poor reception to his announcement about the superannuation guarantee levy. He very quickly thought that he had better try to salvage it by promising a White Paper. My information is that it has already gone to Cabinet and been approved. But now, of course, in the wake of our announcements in these areas, it is all back to square one. Indeed, even the Evatt Foundation recognises that most of our initiatives have trumped the Government comprehensively. The Government will need to go back and rework its White Paper. That, of course, is the great tragedy of those who seek, for once in their expedient lives, to espouse some sort of political morality because it has to deliver the goods.</PARA></TALK.START>

If he could not get it through Cabinet, we understand that, but at least he should have been prepared to remain on the public record. He has had two chances in the last two days to say that double dipping still must stop; that the preservation age still must be raised; and that there are a number of other initiatives one can take to stop double dipping like putting a ceiling on lump sums. He is on the record as being in favour of all these things but suddenly he is not prepared to endorse them. I simply say, `We have been, why won't you?'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, it is also true that during normal ministerial duties, speeches and question times around the country Ministers get asked about everything. I even get the odd question on defence. All that Ministers can do is follow the Government line and if they do not know what it is then simply say so. That is why, over the course of five years as a Minister, it has not been a worry for me and it is not a worry now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston referred to the question of the extension of fringe benefits. He obviously does not understand where that is up to at all. So I suppose I should explain. It is not a matter of grabbing cheap headlines; nor is it a matter of the Government's intent not being serious. We shall be doing it. I went to a meeting with the States some time back. The only State to be critical of me, oddly enough, was New South Wales, which is a bit of a shock. The States overwhelmingly carried a resolution which I had suggested. I might say they have since changed their minds at a meeting with the Premier and come back with a proposal which is much more in line with what the Commonwealth would have wanted; one I did not think I would have been able to get through at that meeting with the welfare Ministers. Again, I am delighted with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of fringe benefits had nothing to do with age. Senator Alston said it affected those over a certain age but that is not true. It was an extension to all of those who are on a part pension; whereas at the moment there is an income limit of $103 or $104 a week. Senator Alston is wrong on all counts on that. I expect that an announcement on that will be made, as I have been saying for the last six months, around March or April next year, and we will proceed to do it. I am happy to answer questions on that because that is directly within the portfolio and I am the one handling the job. However, when it comes to what happens with superannuation over the course of the next 12 months as the Government's decisions announced in the Budget are negotiated with employers and employees, it will be the responsibility of the Treasurer to answer questions on that. I would have it no other way. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to inform the Senate that the Australian and United States governments have now agreed on new arrangements concerning the future of the joint Australia-United States naval communication station at North West Cape in Western Australia. Mr Acting Deputy President, you might recall that on 12 March 1990 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced that the United States had agreed to discuss an Australian proposal to take over and operate the station as an Australian defence facility, instead of as a joint defence facility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am able to announce today that the US Secretary of Defense, Mr Dick Cheney, and I have recently endorsed the elements of a seven-year phased transition plan that will result in the station becoming an Australian naval communication station. I table my exchange of letters with Mr Cheney. The changes will shortly be reflected in amendments to our formal agreement with the United States governing the station. We will achieve this through an exchange of diplomatic notes between my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and the US Ambassador, His Excellency Mr Melvin Sembler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally established as a US naval communication station in 1963, North West Cape has functioned as a joint defence facility since 1974. Its primary purpose is to communicate with submerged submarines. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transition period during which the station will become an Australian naval communication station will be marked by three important changes at the station which I will now outline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, there will be considerably enhanced Australian participation in station management and operations. A Royal Australian Navy officer will be appointed as commanding officer in 1992 and will be responsible for managing the station. Australia's leading role will be even more apparent because there will be few, if any, US Navy personnel at the station after 1993; most will have left before then. The US Navy will continue to be actively engaged at the station, which will remain a joint facility during the transition. It will have access to three of the four very low frequency channels used for communicating with submerged submarines, will contribute to operating costs, and assist with logistics support, capital upgrades and technical expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a second major change, it has been agreed that a civilian contractor will be selected after free and open competition to operate the station. Contractor operations will be introduced as soon as possible after 1992. The US Navy has confirmed a need to minimise its manpower at the station by then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, until now Australia's contribution to station operating costs has been limited to the salaries and allowances of the Royal Australian Navy and Australian Protective Service personnel working there. Under the new arrangements, the cost of operating the station will be shared by Australia and the United States on the basis of user pays principles, both during and after the transition. In broad terms, Australia's share will be about 25 per cent of the total VLF costs. The actual amount will depend on the terms of the contract to be signed with the civilian operator and other factors. I must say, however, that total operating costs and staffing levels are expected to be significantly lower than they are at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These benefits are also an excellent example of what the Government hopes to achieve under the defence commercial support program. Under this program, the Government will transfer defence support activities to the private sector, where this is practical and cost effective. The introduction of a civilian operator at North West Cape reflects my determination to pursue this policy vigorously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some speculation about what it might cost Australia to take over the station. I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that the United States Government has advised us that it will seek no compensation for the buildings and other structures at the station while it continues to have access to the station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, the Cold War may be over but, as the Gulf war earlier this year showed, the need for defence has far from disappeared. We need to remain prepared to deter and, if necessary, to deal with a range of other contingencies in support of peace and international stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In keeping with our original proposal, the new arrangements at North West Cape include a guarantee that the United States will continue to have access to the station after it becomes an Australian facility, with the United States continuing to share the operating costs on user pays principles. We welcome the continuing US access to the station, which will help support the US presence in the Asia-Pacific region. It is a very practical demonstration of the US commitment, a commitment that is also recognised and appreciated by our regional neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new arrangements also advance other Australian interests. In particular, they reinforce the significant improvements this Government has made in enhancing Australia's self-reliant defence posture. The station's capability for communicating with submerged submarines throughout and beyond our area of strategic interest is unique in our region. It contributes significantly to the security of our own submarine operations and the safety of their crews. We use that capability extensively. It will become even more important to us as the six new Collins class submarines begin to enter service with the Royal Australian Navy in the next few years. In short, the new arrangements show that Australia is itself willing to take the responsibility for ensuring that this essential element of our submarine capability is maintained. This is defence self-reliance in its maturity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to the people of Exmouth for their fine contribution to the morale and welfare of the thousands of service men and women who have worked at the station in the years since it was commissioned.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Theirs has been a noteworthy contribution to our defence relationship with the United States and in support of the Royal Australian Navy. There is no clearer indication of the warmth and generosity of the people of Exmouth than the considerable number of US and Australian service personnel who have sought to return to the station for second and even third postings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there is some apprehension in Exmouth about the changes to be made at the station. In response to these concerns, I have arranged for the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff personally to brief the people of Exmouth and station employees on the changes I have just outlined. The briefing team will include a US Navy representative from the United States. A similar briefing has been arranged for the Western Australian Government in Perth because of the many implications the changes will have for State Government operations in the town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago I agreed to the establishment of a consultative forum under the chairmanship of Mr Tom Stephens, MLC, to look at the future needs and development prospects of the town of Exmouth. While these are still early days, it is important to point out that the Australian and United States governments both remain committed to the fullest possible consultation with the station work force and with other interested parties in Exmouth concerning the detail of the changes to be phased in over the next seven years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Times have changed considerably since the station and the town grew up together. But they also present new opportunities, and I would like to encourage the people of Exmouth and those who work at the station to use those opportunities to build for the positive future of the town. The changes I have described will ensure that the station&mdash;and hence Exmouth itself&mdash;has a solid and enduring foundation for the years ahead. Today's announcement provides a firm basis for all concerned to be confident about the future and to plan accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many points of detail still need to be worked out in discussions between the Royal Australian Navy and United States Navy. Nevertheless, the changes I have outlined represent a major departure from the arrangements that were put in place almost 30 years ago and, with few amendments, have shaped the management and operation of the station since. Indeed, the new arrangements are a landmark in building Australia's defence self-reliance and a measure of the maturity of our relationship with the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secretary Cheney has welcomed the new arrangements as testimony to the flexibility in our relationship, which enables it to adapt to changing circumstances as mutual security needs require. This flexibility has made our alliance an enduring, and welcome, feature of the security environment in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1990 the Prime Minister spoke about burden-sharing. He described the Australian proposal for changes at the station as a constructive contribution to our alliance with the United States, which would support our shared interests in the peaceful development of the Asia-Pacific region. Today we have seen that initiative rewarded. The changes that have resulted ensure that the station will continue to operate in ways that best serve Australia's interests and those of our US partner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has just delivered is a very important one. It deals with an important aspect of our defence, and for that reason it deserves great attention from the Senate. The Opposition agrees entirely with that part of Senator Ray's statement in which he emphasises the importance of the North West Cape Harold E. Holt communications station, as it is named. It has performed a very important role, not only in the defence of Australia but also during the Cold War in the defence of the Western alliance interests throughout that period. We agree entirely with the comments to the effect that, simply because the Cold War is over, there is no reason why we should relax as far as our defence needs are concerned. It has a continuing role, including use by our ally the United States, and, in regard to our defence, it is important in relation to the operation of our submarines. That has established it as a very important defence facility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has no disagreement whatever with those observations made by the Minister for Defence in the statement, nor do we as an Opposition oppose the changeover of control of the station from a joint to an Australian facility. The question whether it is necessary to make that transition at this time is another matter. That will be the subject of some discussion by me this afternoon. I wish to make it perfectly clear that we are not opposing the idea of this station becoming an Australian defence facility. I dare say that many Australians, who perhaps do not place the same importance on the United States alliance as we do, will welcome that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing of the change has created a number of problems, which is what I want to concentrate on now. I want to deal with the problem of the so-called seven-year phasing of the change; I shall deal with the problems of payment and expense involved in the exercise; and I shall then deal with the serious problem that has been created for the Exmouth community as a result of the change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at how the genesis of this change from a joint facility to an Australian facility arose. As the statement points out, on 12 March 1990&mdash;a somewhat significant date because it was in the middle of the last election campaign&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) visited Western Australia where several seats were being hard fought and were greatly at stake for the Government. Mr Hawke there announced with a great flourish that the United States had agreed to discuss an Australian proposal to take over and operate the station as an Australian defence facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone would be given any prizes for assessing the political basis of this whole exercise at that time. Events that occurred subsequent to 12 March 1990 add force to that argument. Having made this great flourish in the middle of the election campaign in Western Australia, the Government was duly re-elected, and then for months and months nothing seemed to be happening. Nothing was being said about the serious financial consequences of the proposal. Figures were freely quoted at the time of some $30m in extra costs for our defence budget, yet there seemed to be no concern on the part of the Government about resolving the issues which it had created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not until the end of 1990 that there were any ministerial discussions about this question. It was then stated that at the Ausmin talks which were held towards the end of 1990 an agreement had been arrived at for a seven-year phased transition. From the perspective of the people most concerned in the area, this matter having been raised in the election campaign giving rise to doubts and concerns, every effort appeared to be made by the Government to allay those concerns. I again raised the matter with Senator Robert Ray in the Estimates hearing in April of this year. We were then told that officials were to conduct discussions about the seven-year transition proposal. All this led to the view that there would not be an immediate withdrawal of American personnel from the base and that the whole exercise would be done in a staged and sensible way. However, within a week or two of those hearings, the United States commander of the base, on his return from a visit to Washington, announced that the Americans would all be withdrawing within two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that when the matter was then raised with Ministers, including Minister Bilney in the other place who had something to say about the matter, the statement as to American bases was being played down as a United States Navy view. Senator Robert Ray said in the Senate on 28 May this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If in fact the US Government adopts the Navy's view and decides to pull out all of its officers and ranks out of the base in October 1993 instead of over the seven-year period outlined after talks between Secretary Cheney and me, we would have to look at that timetable again.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, even as recently as 28 May this year, the urgency of the matter was being played down by both Ministers, because Minister Bilney said the same thing in answer to a question in the other place. It was said that it was a US Navy view. There was nothing further from the truth because clearly it was the United States Government's view. Indeed, the United States Government seized on the offer by the Australian Government to rid itself of major costs in the operation of this facility as part of its general drawdown of forces around the world. Clearly, the Americans seized on this offer by the Prime Minister, made out of the blue in the last election campaign, as a way of assisting them in reducing their defence costs around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What surprised me was that this Government did not in the first place assess the significance of what was being said by the Prime Minister; or indeed the significance of the timetable that would be imposed by the United States Government. Certainly the Australian Government was still trying to play down the matter as recently as the end of May this year. The dogs had been barking for ages that the US Government was about to take steps of this kind, and indeed has now done so very rapidly since 28 May this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following those statements here in the Senate at the end of May this year, negotiations were quickly brought into play in Washington at official level. Indeed, when I visited Washington in the middle of September this year I was told that the agreement had all been stitched up. Things were moving extremely rapidly at a time when we and the people of Exmouth were being led to believe that there would be no worries and that it would all fall into place in the seven-year transition period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the withdrawal by the United States personnel from this base will be even more sudden than the Government has led us to believe right up until now. The Minister's statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An R.A.N. officer will be appointed as commanding officer in 1992,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is October 1992&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and will be responsible for managing the station.</PARA>
<PARA>That is less than a year away now. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's leading role will be even more apparent because there will be few, if any, US Navy personnel at the station after 1993, and most will have left before then.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that, far from being a seven-year withdrawal, the withdrawal will be even sooner, quicker and more extensive than was suggested by the US commander in May this year when he was talking about a two-year period. It is very disappointing, to say the least, that this whole exercise has been managed in this way by this Government and this Minister. It seems to me that there has been a real failure in diplomacy on the part of this Government in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are further worrying aspects. Now that we know that the withdrawal will take place in 1992, and will be well and truly completed in 1993, there is clearly a very major question as to whether Australia will be able effectively to manage the station from the time it actually takes over. Funnily enough, there will not be a change of name from a joint facility to an Australian facility in October 1992 when we appoint the Australian commander. That name change will not occur within the seven-year period. Goodness knows why it will not occur in 1992 because by then an Australian naval officer will be the commander of the base and, as the Minister has just told us, there will be a civilian contractor put in to run it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be a very serious question as to whether the contractor will have sufficiently trained personnel to take over the running of the base within that timetable. The Minister has set out a timetable at the end of his speech which does not throw much more light on the matter. It is perfectly obvious that that will be a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor is there any further light shed on this by the letters that have been tabled. The schedule that I have just referred to, the `Outline for the phased transition of Navcomsta Harold E.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference in the statement by the Minister to the seven-year transition is only a sop. He and his United States counterpart agreed on a seven-year transition when they first talked about this about a year ago, that has now clearly changed and a quite different transition period of two years has been agreed on. I do not know why the Minister just does not accept the reality of that in this statement and stop trying to make out that it is, in effect, a seven-year transition period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add in passing that the Opposition certainly is not criticising the decision to appoint a contractor to run the base. That is entirely in line with the view that we have adopted for some time in regard to the Government's own force structure statement in May and the development of our own policy. That is a sensible thing to do, but we are concerned about whether it will be possible to choose the contractor and for him to be able to get his work force together in time. It will need a specially trained work force of many people and that will present a real practicable problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next, there seems to be some doubt about payment. This has loomed large in previous discussions about whether Australia would be required to make any payments to the United States for the use of the equipment. Under this arrangement Australia will be required to start paying for its share of the operations of the base&mdash;about one-quarter, I gather&mdash;and the United States will continue to pay for the other three-quarters during this period of seven years. Presumably that will pertain as long as the United States remains a partner beyond the seven years&mdash;and we expect and hope that that will be the case&mdash;but if the United States decided that it did not want to continue that arrangement beyond seven years we, as a nation, will be faced with bearing the total cost of this operation because we need it for communications with our own submarines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his statement Senator Ray says that the United States will seek no compensation for buildings and other structures at the station while it continues to have access to the station. The question of what is referred to as residual value will not arise until the United States ceases to be interested in the base. As I said, the letter from Senator Ray to Mr Cheney says that the issue of residual value need not be addressed while the United States continues to have access to the station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, there is the question of whether or not the United States would seek to remove vital equipment if that occurred. That seems to be left entirely in the air. The question of compensation would only arise, according to Senator Ray's letter to Mr Cheney, in relation to the residual value of buildings, structures and improvements to the station funded by the United States Government&mdash;and, of course, the United States has built it all&mdash;and not removed upon termination of the agreement. We could be left in queer street as far as this agreement is concerned.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I am saying is that this agreement certainly does not seem to deal with that very important question that could arise down the track. I am sorry that the statement does not seem to clarify that in a better way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to say something about the position of the Exmouth community. The statement by the Minister is a masterpiece of understatement in relation to the Exmouth community. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know there is some apprehension in Exmouth about the changes to be made at the station.</PARA>
<PARA>I have news for the Minister. There is a great degree of anxiety among the community at Exmouth as a result of the way this Government has carried on since 12 March 1990. The community has been building up a head of steam; there is a real head of steam there now. When the community learns of this statement, as it probably will later today, there will be a great deal of anxiety indeed. I think it is just as well that Senator Ray is sending the Deputy Chief of the Navy to Exmouth tomorrow to talk to people. I know that there have been previous discussions with people in Exmouth, but nothing has been resolved by the Government, and it will have to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This withdrawal will have a severe impact on the local community. As the statement shows, there are 400 United States uniformed personnel, most of whom will be gone within the next 12 to 18 months&mdash;certainly before the two years are up. Those people were occupying nearly 200 houses in the town and their departure will leave this property vacant. What will happen to it? What effect will this have on property values in Exmouth? There is great concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has a major obligation to the Exmouth community and, indeed, so does the United States Government. The United States Government has had a major benefit from the use of the station, and will continue to benefit from its use. Both governments have an obligation to the people of Exmouth. Certainly, the Government should ensure that many of the people who have been working there&mdash;the 160 civil personnel working on the base who live in Exmouth&mdash;are given every opportunity to participate in the running of the base when it is commercialised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will need to address the problem of housing in the town. It will also have to face up to the question of what is going to be done for the future of Exmouth. The Minister mentioned that he has set up a consultative forum to consider these matters, chaired by a local member of the Western Australian Legislative Council. He does not tell us where the forum has got to or what it has been doing. It will have to be activated. The Western Australian Government will also have to be brought into this in relation to what other jobs can be created in this area. The United States personnel have magnificent facilities on the base which will become vacant, and the question arises of the future of those facilities. Perhaps they could be made available for tourist developments of one kind or another in the region. There is a build-up of tourism in that region, and that is obviously one of the most likely ways to create more jobs in Exmouth to replace the many jobs that will be lost as a result of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, in my view this is a very disappointing statement. It may be, as the statement says, an advance in Australia's defence self-reliance, and we have no objection to that. In point of fact, it is a sorry story of ineptness by this Government and the failure of its uninspired diplomacy with the United States. It was caught totally flat-footed; it was hoist with its own petard. For political purposes, this whole thing was activated by the Prime Minister, and then virtually buried for some considerable time. The United States has taken up the offer suddenly and with a vengeance. The Government has had to come into line with a timetable that was presented as a seven-year timetable and is now less than two years. It is a sorry performance on the part of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address briefly the ministerial statement on the future of the North West Cape. The statement sets out arrangements for transferring control of the North West Cape naval communications station from the United States to Australia over a seven-year period, ending in October 1998.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement contains several major provisions. First, the Royal Australian Navy will take command of the station next year. Secondly, station operations will be taken over by a civilian contractor shortly thereafter, culminating in a near or total withdrawal of United States Navy personnel by October 1993. An Australian contribution to station operating costs will commence then. Thirdly, a five-year period of joint operation will commence thereafter, with a transfer of control taking place at the end of that period. The United States Navy will have guaranteed access to the station during and after the seven-year transitional period. Finally, Australia will be liable for the residual value of buildings and equipment if United States access ends after Australian control commences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will remember that the North West Cape takeover was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during last year's election campaign, with a clear intention of wooing the preferences of Australian Democrats and Greens voters in Western Australia. This vote-buying exercise was a direct response to a campaign run by parts of the Western Australian peace movement called Take Back the Cape, which called for the base to be taken over for the exclusive use of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this takeover plan contains one crucial difference: it allows for continued guaranteed access to the station by the United States Navy for its communications needs. This would include communications to naval forces engaged in such repugnant and inhumane military operations as the Gulf war. It seems likely that United States access will be provided irrespective of the Australian Government's opinion of the legitimacy of the operation in question. There will probably continue to be a gaping hole in Australian control and sovereignty. In other words, this statement makes very little difference to the role of the North West Cape. The real changes are in cost sharing and administration arrangements. On this score, the Democrats note that there will be no payment of the residual capital costs of the station for as long as the United States has access. We wonder whether the implication is that we will be up for a lot of costs at the end of that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also note that an Australian contribution to operating costs will begin during 1993. It is interesting that during the seven-year transition period the United States will retain access to three of the four channels for submarine communications, as it does now. This suggests that North West Cape will continue to serve the United States to a much greater degree than it will serve Australian interests, and any cost-sharing arrangement must clearly reflect this arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an uncomfortable suggestion in this statement that the transfer is actually being designed to suit the United States timetable for reducing numbers of personnel deployed to overseas bases. The October 1992 deadline for appointing an Australian commander and letting the civilian operations contract is specifically designed to meet this schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have one major concern about this arrangement, which goes to the heart of our defence policy. We believe that the case for a continued operation by Australia of a submarine fleet in the light of changing regional circumstances and Australia's comfortable strategic position is highly questionable. There are many other security priorities which should take precedence over running the existing fleet and spending more than $5 billion on the new Collins class vessels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without a submarine fleet there would be no need for submarine communications facilities. It follows that the expenditures associated with this takeover are a waste of taxpayers' funds. Ultimately, the question is whether we need North West Cape at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are several points in the ministerial statement that need to be challenged. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) refers to the history of the base. It is worth remembering that originally the United States began discussions with the Menzies Government in 1960, at a time when Australia's motivation was to get the United States base here so as to make it worth its while to defend this country if Australia were ever attacked again. In 1980, Professor Des Ball referred to it as a suitable piece of real estate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1960s the Labor Party had the guts to question the need for this base, but power seems to have corroded its principles, despite the involvement of the base in an offensive nuclear war-fighting option, and the Government has never acknowledged secondary functions through the involvement of the United States National Security Agency. We can only guess at those or get information from the United States under its Freedom of Information Act, which is worth a lot more than ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some years the base has ceased to communicate with US SSBNs as the Trident submarines communicate through the VLF station at Jim Creek in the State of Washington on the US mainland. So it has served only as a backup facility for some time, but as a backup facility, of course, it still retains some importance to the United States Navy. That is why the United States Government is now prepared to allow Australia to run the base, and we apparently want it to communicate with the new RAN submarines operating off the West Coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision once again leads me to question the need for these expensive submarines, because it is the extra cost of running this huge facility at North West Cape which is the sort of item that gets left out of the accounts for the submarine project. We will have to bear all of those costs, but they are not accounted for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Submarines are designed to combat high level threats, and we have been repeatedly told that there are no high level threats to Australia. We do need more patrol boats and smaller vessels to combat low level security threats such as illegal fishing, illegal immigration, drug running, and so on. We do not need these submarines, which will cost taxpayers some $5 1/2 billion plus the extra cost of running North West Cape, which is never included in the accounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement still does not make clear how the United States will be using the facility in future or whether it will still be utilised by the National Security Agency through its naval branch. Other paragraphs in the statement are also highly contentious. The Minister referred to the end of the Cold War but then went on to justify a continued high level of military expenditure. He also referred to the continued presence of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region, which he welcomes but I do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have repeatedly stated that we should be taking advantage of the end of the Cold War to promote non-military forms of conflict resolution, not to further escalate a conventional arms race in the neighbourhood. The global policeman role of the United States referred to by the Minister seems to infer that the East-West conflict is being replaced by a North-South conflict, with Australia taking sides with the industrialised nations, continuing to maintain its dominant role in the world economy at the expense of poorer countries, especially in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Virtually every country in the Asia-Pacific region is a friend or ally of the Western alliance, with the exception of China, Vietnam and North Korea, none of which could possibly pose a threat to Australian security. It is well known that, if the United States were to vacate the facility, it could easily relocate somewhere else, as it contemplated doing some 30 years ago when it considered other sites in the western Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So now we are to continue being saddled with this somewhat ancient facility, which the United States Navy does not really need except as a backup facility, and which the Royal Australian Navy does not really need either, I would suggest. As Senator Durack pointed out, the United States Government does not bother to consult with the Australian Government on withdrawal timetables. Australia again is unassertive and ill-informed and just lets the United States walk all over us. Is this why we are now breaking new ground in inviting President Bush to address a joint sitting of the Australian Parliament? This is not an Australian tradition; it is an American tradition. Did George suggest this to Bob in one of his infamous phone calls? Regardless of where the suggestion came from, it is another example of Australia following the US lead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly disapprove of<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">all this precedent entails, especially in terms of costs to Australian taxpayers for not only the million dollar special sitting of parliament but also the gigantic security costs involving the 200-person entourage travelling with the President. They are very smart in the United States. It is the same thing&mdash;they get the kudos and we pay. With the North West Cape we will continue its upkeep for their convenience but at our expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is a bit like the Gulf war, really, out of which the United States managed actually to make money. That is, if the other countries that went into bat with it, such as Germany and Japan, cough up as promised, the United States will make $13 billion out of that slaughtering operation. In the estimation of some people, the United States will get a lot of credit points for that too, but not in mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have repeatedly stated that we should be taking advantage of the end of the Cold War to promote non-military forms of conflict resolution. That is not what we are doing by elevating our own military preparedness, as some people would like to call it, by going in for high-tech, offensive capabilities like these submarines which, as I said, we do not need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is very little mention of real costs in this statement except to say that costs will be shared in the post-transition period on a user-pay basis. Where are the figures? The Minister gives us no figures whatsoever in this statement. What kinds of charges will be laid and for what kinds of uses? None of that is mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither does the Minister deal with the costs of updating the facility. I should like to remind him of the article by Herschel Hurst in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pacific Defence Reporter</EMPHASIS> of May 1990, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Meanwhile, it is accepted in Canberra that considerable updating of equipment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>at North West Cape&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be necessary in the next five or ten years. And that will cost a lot of money. However, strategists say the money will have to be found if Australia is to continue with the policy of defence self-reliance.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister does not even mention that. The technology there is old. This is a facility that has been there for a very long time. It needs upgrading. There is no mention of the ongoing running costs or the costs of upgrading the facility. I therefore await with some interest the figures, not only for the running costs so that we can talk to a couple of submarines at any one time, but also the extra cost for Australian taxpayers of updating the facility. The Government has a responsibility to come clean and give us the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the people of Exmouth are concerned, they have had time over the years to make the transition from being a US military town, as it was from 1963 to 1974&mdash;that is what it was established for, a United States military town&mdash;to the so-called joint facility status from then until now, and later on it will be an Australian Navy town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are two other very important aspects to life in Exmouth. Local businesses would do better to concentrate on non-military opportunities to ensure a good quality of life for people who live in Exmouth and for people to visit. I mention the burgeoning fishing industry and the Cape Range National Park. Both fishing and tourism are two very important industries of which the people of Exmouth can be proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I should hope that they will be able to see their way clear not to be quite so concerned about losing some of the US influence. For goodness sake, this is meant to be Australia, not an outpost of the United States Navy. They should be glad that it is returning to Australian hands but they do need decent consideration by this Government. As Senator Durack has pointed out, that is not forthcoming. The timetable has been set from outside, imposed by the Americans. It is the same old story. The people of Exmouth deserve better than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Durack said in his excellent review of the document, this is an important statement before the Senate this afternoon. The Opposition supports the general intent of the document, but we are certainly very concerned about the shortage of details within it. It is very short on anything that we can get our teeth into, such as the actual costs which are involved. We ought to know those costs at the outset. Unlike the wanderings of the two speakers before me, I believe that we cannot have a defence force that does not cost money. If we want a decent defence force, we have to be prepared to pay for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Submarines are part of the Australian defence capability and we have to be able to talk to them and control them. The only way we can talk to a submarine and maintain communications is through the very long wavelengths that are propagated out of the VLF transmission station. This is what North West Cape is all about. It is a naval communications station; it is a high frequency station. We have many HF stations around the world and around the country, but North West Cape is the only one in this part of the world that is also a VLF station. It is the only way that we can talk to a submerged submarine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to put a lot of money into the submarines as combat weapons, we have to maximise their survivability. One of the ways to do that is by keeping them well below the surface of the water. We cannot transmit down to a submerged submarine other than through the very long wavelength transmissions from these sorts of stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been to North West Cape many times. It is a very impressive place to visit. There are a number of high towers&mdash;some of them probably go up to about 1,000 feet, from memory. It has a very big aerial farm with heavy cables between the towers. The transmission facility itself precedes the electronic era with respect to the transmitting equipment. It is all done with huge glass valves like the old radio sets were in the thirties, forties and fifties. That is done because there is not a more modern substitute for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that we would like to know the cost estimates is that very high costs, quite apart from the manpower costs, are involved in maintaining this station. The aerials, for example, have to come down quite regularly&mdash;I think about every 12 months. A number of them are replaced quite frequently. We are looking at very big costs there because miles and miles of heavy gauge copper and aluminium cables are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">North West Cape is no longer of prime importance to the United States. At the height of the Cold War and deterrence, nuclear submarines with ICBMs were deployed around the world and targeted against Soviet Russia. With improving technology and the latest marks of Tridents with their longer range, it is possible for the Americans to keep those submarines closer to the mainland of the United States in the Pacific and to communicate with them from mainland VLF stations. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain a backup facility; it is important to the United States from that point of view. But it is also crucially important to us. We simply have no other way of communicating with submarines. We should remember that not only Australian submarines in the Indian Ocean, but also Australian submarines in the South Pacific can be contacted through North West Cape if that is their theatre of operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Durack said, it is true that we got into this by accident. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) thought he was going to lose the election. Of course, it is a matter of fact that he did poll fewer votes for the Labor Party than the Liberal and National parties did. But owing to the successful rorting of the boundaries in New South Wales some years ago, the Labor Party ended up with a small majority. The point was that the Labor Party was very worried about the outcome through the election campaign in 1990. Mr Beazley and Mr Hawke decided to buy a few votes in Western Australia. They said, `We will buy this. We will take this station over from the United States'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, there has been a better outcome to it than we might have expected given the precipitate nature of the decision. We welcome the fact that it will move under Australian control. It seems, thanks principally to the generosity of the United States, that it is going to work out on favourable grounds for Australia in so far as there will not be a charge made for those facilities while the Americans, if the text is correct, have access to the facilities. So even when the transition period is over and the Americans retain access, even if they are not actually using it, I presume that there will not be a charge to Australia for the capital costs of the facilities there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I would like to make in relation to the document tabled by Senator Ray is to do with the interesting statement that this is `defence self-reliance in its maturity'. I have a very high regard for Senator Ray. He is one of the most honest of the Labor Ministers in so far as he does not seek to fudge issues; but he is certainly fudging in a very big way there. In no sense is this defence self-reliance in its maturity. It is a step along the path to self-reliance, and we support that. But one of the great canards that the Labor Party markets about its defence policy is that somehow or other since it has come to power Australian defence has become self-reliant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to spend only a few minutes looking at the capabilities of the Australian defence forces; we only have to spend a few micro-seconds looking at the sustainability of the Australian defence forces. In other words, how long could the Australian defence forces fight if there was a defence emergency? If we look at their missile stocks, ammunition stocks, fuel stocks and equipment stocks we realise that the sustainability of the Australian defence forces is measured in terms of days; not weeks, months or years as it should be. The Labor Party maintains this deception that somehow or other we have achieved maturity in defence self-reliance. That sentence in the statement is really quite wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, looking ahead to the future, I think that Australia should be carefully looking at alternative transmitter technology. As I said earlier, this transmitting station precedes the electronic age. It may be possible to come up with newer types of transmissions. I do not believe that we will get away with the need to have VLF signals to communicate with submarines in the foreseeable future. But I think it is possible that an alternative transmitter technology could arise either in the form of ground stations or airborne transmission. If that could come about, it may be that the costs of operation in the longer term will diminish for us. The facts of the matter are that for the foreseeable future we will be having submarines within our defence armament, and the necessity to communicate with them at all times and under all conditions is one of the crucial requirements for the defence forces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a Senator for Western Australia, I feel that there have been two aspects of the future of the naval communications base at Exmouth that have been of great concern in the anticipation of the statement that Senator Ray has put down today. Like Senator MacGibbon and Senator Durack, I find that it is very light-on on detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the concerns that I have is the future of the town and the people of Exmouth. This is a community, of course, that has grown around the base and taken a vigorous life of its own. It is also a community that has for too long suffered uncertainty as to its future and a serious lack of communication from this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Durack, as shadow Minister for defence, has visited Exmouth and talked with the members of its community in great detail about the transitional details that are needed to be put in place. I wonder whether the Minister for Defence has done likewise. The people of Exmouth really feel as though they have been neglected because the Minister for Defence has not taken some official consultative process earlier and in much more detail than he has currently displayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is more than 18 months since the Prime Minister announced that the Royal Australian Navy would be taking over from the US Navy at a time of anxiety for an isolated but significant community of 2,700 people. Yet both Federal and State Labor governments have seemingly forgotten until now that the Shire of Exmouth exists. The people of Exmouth have not been getting a fair deal from Labor at the State level. Their State Labor member of the Legislative Assembly promised them a marina, which was shelved once the extent of WA Inc losses started to bite. As a result of this recent uncertainty and disappointment, no fewer than 20 per cent of privately owned dwellings were on the market and Exmouth was about to experience its first mortgagee sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now told that a briefing will be given tomorrow by Admiral Taylor to the people of Exmouth and that he will be talking with the new consultative forum. I hope this will result in some practical assistance, as the Minister's tribute to Exmouth, though shared by the coalition, is not enough on its own. The people of Exmouth really deserve some proper attention by this Government. I am disappointed that it did not happen a long time ago. While it is good that they are getting this briefing tomorrow, it is a shame that they have not been kept informed on an ongoing basis about the detail of what their lives will hold in Exmouth in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Minister may refer to a seven-year transition, the fact remains that after 1993 Australia will be in effective control of the base, the US navy personnel will be gone, and there will simply be far fewer service personnel. Certainly Exmouth will enjoy some advantage with the possible contracting of work to civilians, but with 1993 looming closer there may be a need for other assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must emphasise that Exmouth is not like some of the mining towns in the north of Western Australia that were not designed to continue beyond the life of a mine. This is a very different set of circumstances. This is a town where people have made a permanent commitment and it is a town with a future beyond the servicing of a defence facility. Exmouth is ideally placed to serve as a centre for marine tourism. We now have a marine park covering the Ningaloo Reef, and Exmouth is the obvious base for those Australians who will be visiting one of the State's latest attractions. Transitional assistance in the form of roads and community infrastructure will not be a mere palliative but an investment in the future of the north. I certainly hope the people of Exmouth get this type of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to my second concern, which is the defence needs of Australia. We may well understand that the dramatic lessening of superpower rivalry diminishes the need of the United States to maintain as many defence facilities, but this development does not mean that Australia does not need a continuing naval communications facility at Exmouth. We may not need to worry any more about the activity of the Soviet Navy, but we have an abiding need to maintain our own preparedness, especially with regard to the Indian Ocean. India has developed a powerful navy with considerable potential for strategic outreach. We cannot afford to ignore the possibility that future governments of India may be influenced more strongly by hardline Hindu nationalism. This may not happen, but it is one good reason why we need to continue effective surveillance after the United States has withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Liberal, I also believe that Australia should retain close defence cooperation as part of ANZUS and what I might term the Western alliance of democratic nations that no longer confront the Soviet Union but must at times cooperate against regional tyrants and international law breakers, of whom Saddam Hussein was a prime example. Simply, the continuation of the naval communications centre is far from obsolete or irrelevant. I am pleased to hear that the base will continue, but the transitional stage is certainly my concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exmouth has played an essential role as a service town in the ultimate defence of Australia through more than 25 years of sometimes dangerous international developments. In earlier days it has been subject to the attentions of what could be called the Loony Left of Australia. We have heard one of the loony Loony Left speak today in Senator Vallentine. It is very disturbing that she has taken the attitude she has, particularly to an area in her own State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a shame that the Loony Left of Australian politics has detested our alliance with the world's most powerful democracy and that it cannot grasp the fundamental truth that effective intelligence, far from imperilling the security of Australia, is the best guarantee of maintaining peace. The alliance has also resulted in Australia obtaining facilities built by our ally at minimal cost to ourselves. In 1974, protesters travelled to Exmouth in order to stage a noisy protest at the base. The police were busy ensuring that the angry townspeople of Exmouth did not overreact to the absolute idiocy of that protest and that it was not successful. But it certainly would have weakened our defence and destroyed the townspeople's livelihoods if the protesters had been able to get a firm grip at that stage in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We owe it to the people of Exmouth to ease the transition from a military service economy and we owe it to Australia to ensure that effective naval intelligence remains.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with a resolution of the Senate on 26 May 1988, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs ("the Committee") conducted an inquiry into the social and fiduciary duties and obligations of company directors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee received 33 written submissions and conducted public hearings in Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne during February and March 1989.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new national scheme for corporate regulation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 14 July 1989, the Parliament enacted the Corporations Act 1989. In June 1990, the Government concluded heads of agreement with the States and the Northern Territory concerning the administration in Australia of the law relating to corporations and securities.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the commencement of the new scheme, the Government has commenced a major program of reform in companies and securities law.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">does the interests of shareholders, directors, creditors, employees and the general community. The Government is also concerned, however, to ensure that the Corporations Law does not unnecessarily burden the vast majority of company directors who are honest and competent. To this end, and consistent with the Committee's recommendations, the Government proposes a model for reform which takes into account, and builds upon, measures taken by the commercial community to enhance the competence and compliance by company directors with their social and fiduciary duties.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An objective duty of care for directors be provided in the companies legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">B.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A `business judgment rule' be introduced into Australian company law. It should include an obligation on directors to inform themselves of matters relevant to the administration of the company. They should be required to exercise an active discretion in the relevant matter, or alternatively, to show a reasonable degree of care in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government supports the notion of an objective duty of care and the prescription of requirements relevant to that duty. The Government proposes to achieve this directly, rather than through the introduction of a "business judgment rule".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business judgement rule, which is a common law doctrine used in the United States, offers directors protection from civil action provided they act in good faith, without a conflict of interest, take reasonable steps to obtain information and act with a reasonable degree of care and diligence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee indicated that in its opinion the enactment of a business judgment rule would encourage the making of informed business judgments, stimulate innovation and risk taking, and limit judicial intrusiveness in private sector decision making. The Companies and Securities Law Review Committee ("CSLRC") has, since the tabling of the Senate Committee's report, also recommended the enactment of a business judgment rule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government notes that the business judgment rule is one of a number of rules concerning directors' duties developed by the United States courts. The Government notes that Australian company law already confers a general discretion on the courts to relieve an officer of civil liability arising out of a breach of duty, negligence or trust. The Government is not at this stage convinced that it is appropriate to introduce in isolation this one aspect of American jurisprudence into the Australian law on director's duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the Government notes that a number of recent court decisions have imposed significant personal liability upon directors whom the court considered were not sufficiently careful or diligent: Hussein v Good (1990) 8 ACLC 390; Heide Pty Ltd v Lester (1990) 8 ACLC 958; Statewide Tobacco Services v Morley (1990) 8 ACLC 827; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Freidrich (1991) 9 ACLC 946. It acknowledges that these decisions may have created concerns in the minds of some directors about the relationship between honest, informed risk-taking and their personal liability for a breach of their duty of care and diligence to the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government agrees with the Senate Committee and the CSLRC that the law should not discourage directors who engage in honest, informed risk-taking, and to this end must provide such directors with the clearest guidance. However, the Government considers that there are alternative approaches, to be preferred to the enactment of a business judgment rule, which can provide additional guidance to directors as to what is expected of them, while making it clear that honest, informed risk-taking will not attract a civil or criminal sanction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that this additional guidance may best be provided by amending subsection 232(4) of the Corporations Law to clarify the standard of care and diligence required of company directors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection 232(4) currently provides that an officer of a corporation shall at all times exercise a reasonable degree of care and diligence in the exercise of his or her powers and the discharge of his or her duties. The Committee said that the extent of the duty of care owed by a director pursuant to subsection 232(4) is measured by reference to the particular director's knowledge and experience. It concluded that the duty of care established by subsection 232(4) was measured by a subjective standard, and that this standard was too low. The Committee recommended that subsection 232(4) be amended to require an objective standard of care, but did not propose a particular standard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that, since the tabling of the Committee's report in 1989, the courts, in their assessment of what is reasonable, have tended to raise the standard of care and diligence required of directors. It notes observations of Tadgell J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Friedrich, supra, at p.956:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"As the complexity of commerce has gradually intensified . . . the community has of necessity come to expect more than formerly from directors . . . In response, the parliament and the courts have found it necessary in legislation and litigation to refer to the demands made on directors in more exacting terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tadgell J also said that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"To speak of a director of ordinary, reasonable or average competence or prudence, or indeed of an ordinary reasonable or average director, is to give no very useful description, whereas a person seeking properly to perform the duties of a director of a particular company can be identified by reference to more specific criteria of which ordinariness, reasonableness and averageness are, or may be, merely ingredients." (Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Friedrich, supra, at p.955)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to provide the guidance and clarity mentioned above, and in an attempt to provide a more "useful description" of what is required of company officers, the Government proposes that subsection 232(4) be amended to reinforce that the duty of care is an objective one, requiring a company officer to exercise the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise. The Government also proposes that the amended provision identify a series of factors relevant to the exercise of the appropriate standard of care and diligence. The intention is that the courts would have regard to these matters in their consideration of whether an officer had contravened the objective duty of care and diligence established by subsection 232(4) as amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government proposes that those matters include considerations such as the extent to which the officer:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that this reform will provide directors with the guidance they require to avoid incurring personal liability, thus removing the need for a business judgment rule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Directors be required to attend board meetings unless there is a reasonable excuse for non-attendance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government supports this recommendation. No one could dispute the Committee's central contention that directors should, whenever possible, attend Board meetings. It would not seem appropriate, however, to impose a sanction in respect of a single failure to attend a meeting. Further, the question of how many meetings the Board convened might be just as important as how many were attended by a particular director. More generally, the Government does not understand the Committee to be singling out attendance at meetings to the exclusion of other indicia of care and diligence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">29. The Government considers that frequency of attendance at Board meetings could usefully be expressly set out in the legislation as one factor relevant to the question whether the overall pattern of behaviour of the director constituted a sufficient exercise of care and diligence. It is therefore proposed to specify attendance at meetings as a matter to which the court may have regard in its consideration of whether the director has breached the duty of care and diligence (see paragraph 25 above).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also considers that the members of a public company are entitled to know whether their directors have attended board meetings. It therefore proposes to require the directors of a public company to include in the company's annual report to its members a note indicating the number of board meetings convened that year and the number of meetings attended by each person who was a director of the company at any time during that year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">31.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The companies legislation be amended to provide for, and specifically limit, the extent to which company officers may rely on others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">32.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue here is when, in the circumstances of a particular company, it is appropriate for company officers to delegate to other persons, committees or organizations, and rely on reports or opinions prepared by them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">33.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Government accepts the Committee's recommendation in principle, it is difficult to provide for these matters in precise detail, given the great diversity of companies and their operations, and the need to avoid creating inflexibility in the way in which the managements of companies respond to changing commercial needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">34.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that, as with the question of attendance at meetings, the question of the extent to which officers delegated their powers and relied on others in making key decisions should be identified as a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the officer has fallen short of the required duty of care to the company (see paragraph 25 above). This will enable a court to consider whether an officer has delegated in an irresponsible manner and, if so, the extent to which that irresponsibility may have caused loss to the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">35.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The companies legislation be amended to set out requirements which must be met for exoneration of directors from what would otherwise be breaches of their fiduciary duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">36.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee referred to the general rule of fiduciary law that a beneficiary may forgive acts of a fiduciary which are in breach of the fiduciary's duty to the beneficiary. As an extension of this principle the Committee noted that a company in general meeting may generally ratify an action taken by a director for an improper purpose. The Committee considered that the object of fiduciary law is not to prohibit conduct but to compel disclosure, so that the company may consider whether to consent to the director undertaking a course of action that would otherwise involve a breach of the director's duty to the company. The present law, however, allows the general requirement of disclosure to a general meeting to be displaced by the company's articles of association. Further, there are suggestions that a director might vote as a shareholder to approve his or her own actions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">37.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee focused on three categories of breach of fiduciary duty: misuse of corporate assets, transactions with the company involving a conflict of interest, and the taking up for personal gain of business opportunities which ought to be taken up by the company. The Committee said that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is difficult to formulate a general rule for disclosure and consent to activities which would otherwise be breaches of fiduciary duty. For some questions the involvement of shareholders is clearly warranted, while for others it would render decision making unnecessarily cumbersome. Different consent regimes may be appropriate for the various fiduciary rules".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">38.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the tabling of the Committee's report, the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee ("CSAC"), established under the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 to provide expert advice to the Attorney-General in relation to the law concerning corporations, has addressed the issue of loans to directors and related topics. A report by CSAC, entitled "Reform of the Law Governing Corporate Financial Transactions", recommends the enactment of a disclosure and consent regime in relation to breaches of duty involving misuse of corporate assets and transactions with the company involving a conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">39.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government proposes to include in the planned exposure draft Bill provisions addressing the matters considered by CSAC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">40.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important single area concerning the exoneration of directors identified by the Senate Standing Committee and which is not addressed in detail in the CSAC report is the area of corporate opportunity.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">41.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The companies legislation be amended to permit all creditors to share equally in sums recovered from directors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">42.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government understands this recommendation to be directed at the situation where a liquidator's lack of standing under section 592 of the Corporations Law to sue directors for debts incurred by the company can lead to one or more creditors securing an advantage over others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">43.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It notes that this proposal resulted from the Committee's endorsement of one aspect of a wide-ranging reform concerning the personal liability of company directors on the winding up of an insolvent company proposed by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its "General Insolvency Inquiry".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">44.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission noted that there can be cases where only individual creditors, and not the liquidator, can sue a director who allowed a company to engage in insolvent trading. As the Commission noted, this can result in a multiplicity of actions or a situation where the relevant director's assets are exhausted in meeting the claims of some only of the creditors involved.

Further, because section 232 attracts the criminal law standard of proof, the regulatory authorities cannot succeed in any action under the section against a director for breach of duty unless they are able to establish the elements of the breach beyond reasonable doubt. To a certain extent, this could inhibit recovery action where a breach, though not committed with any dishonest intent, has caused significant loss to the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">56.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of these factors, and in response to the Committee's recommendations, the Government proposes to amend section 232 with the intention of confining the criminal liability of directors to conduct involving a dishonest intent. Civil penalties will be introduced into the Corporations Law in relation to breaches of section 232 falling short of dishonest intent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">57.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, the Government proposes to amend section 232 to make civil penalties available in relation to each of subsections 232(2), (4), (5) and (6) as they presently stand. The trial of a matter involving a civil penalty will adopt the civil rules of evidence, practice and procedure, and standard of proof. Proof of contravention of a civil matter will not result in a conviction or a criminal record. On proof of a contravention of any of subsections 232(2), (4), (5) and (6), the court will be able to make an order that the defendant be disqualified from taking part in the management of a corporation and impose a pecuniary penalty, such as those available under the Trade Practices Act 1974, the Customs Act 1901, and the Taxation Administration Act 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">58.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criminal penalties (in the form of a fine and/or a term of imprisonment) will be retained in relation to a contravention of subsection 232(2), (4), (5) or (6) which is committed with a dishonest intent. The inclusion of subsection (4) in this list responds specifically to recommendation 22 by the Committee, though it is perhaps difficult to envisage a situation where dishonest activity would properly be characterised as a breach of a duty of care and diligence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">59.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation will be empowered to seek compensation in respect of a breach of subsection 232(2), (4), (5) or (6); irrespective of whether or not the person had been convicted of an offence or made subject to a civil penalty order in relation to those provisions. On finding proved either an offence or a civil penalty contravention, the court will be empowered to impose, in addition to a criminal or civil penalty respectively, an order for compensation to the corporation involved. These propositions reflect existing subsections 232(7) and (8). It will be for the Australian Securities Commission to use the enhanced options available to it in a way that best advances the interests of shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">60.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection 318(1) of the Corporations Law provides that a director of a company commits an offence if he or she fails to take all reasonable steps to comply with, or to secure compliance with, certain provisions of Part 3.6 of the Corporations Law concerning a company's obligation to prepare financial statements. Although section 318(1) is not mentioned in the Committee's report, the Government notes that the sentencing options on a conviction for an offence against subs.318(1) are similar to those currently available under subs.232(2) (ie, they vary according to the presence or absence of fraud). It is therefore proposed, in relation to section 318, to introduce a civil penalties option such as that proposed in relation to section 232.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">61.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the level of penalty, the Attorney-General's Department is undertaking a general review of penalties under the Corporations Law. That review will include consideration of the civil and criminal penalties which should apply in relation to contraventions of section 232 as amended. Pending completion of that review, however, the Government is concerned to demonstrate clearly the seriousness with which it regards directors' duties. The Government accordingly proposes that the maximum monetary penalty for breach of section 232 should be set at $200,000 and there should be an additional penalty available, where the breach involves a dishonest intent, of imprisonment for up to 5 years. The formula $200,000 and/or 5 years imprisonment matches the recently amended penalty set out in the Corporations Law in respect of insider trading offences.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">63.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well-established in law that a company's directors may act in the best interests of employees whenever that is consistent with the best interests of the company as a whole. Clearly, a coincidence of such interests will be the usual situation. The question is whether a legislative provision is appropriate to further advance the interests of employees. The Australian Securities Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee have each expressed concern about the potential for the general provision proposed by the Committee to impact adversely on the directors' overriding duty to act in the best interests of the company. The Law Council of Australia considers that such a provision would not change the law, and is therefore unnecessary, and that an amendment which did change the law in this area would be contrary to sound policy. Given these concerns, the Government does not propose to legislate in the terms proposed by the Committee. In the Government's view, the interests of employees upon a winding-up (the issue which seems to have been of particular concern to the Senate Committee) would be better addressed directly, by providing special priorities for employees upon a winding-up. The Government proposes, in this regard, to give to employees the same special legislative priority in a winding-up in respect of unpaid employer superannuation contributions as is already accorded to unpaid back-wages.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read this document with some interest because the obligations of a director to a company, and ultimately its creditors, are quite substantial obligations in law and they attach to them quite substantial financial obligations. The existing corporations law provides that where directors have breached their duties and failed their obligations they can be made liable, and there are very good reasons why this is so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, one of the provisions&mdash;and I will discuss it in more detail a little later&mdash;is contained in section 592 of the Corporations Act. It states that, where a company incurs a debt at a time when it is incapable of meeting its debts, the directors can be made liable to the creditors. That is an example of how the law places upon a director a particular obligation to ensure that directors cannot use the corporate veil to rip off creditors and shareholders for their own benefit. Very clearly, it is important that the law place some particular obligations upon directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions that have to be asked, though, are what obligation should be placed on directors and how far should those obligations go? I do not intend to discuss every one of the recommendations made by the Committee, nor every one of the Government's responses, but there are a number that we need to look at in some particular depth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I start with the Government's response to recommendation No. 2. This recommendation was effectively that the current subjective duty of care be replaced with an objective duty of care. That is very important because there have been a number of cases where the courts, for one reason or another, have had to consider what is a director's duty of care and how diligent they must be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this report was first tabled, Senator Hill said something which I believe is quite accurate. He said that currently we had what appeared to be an objective test but which had been watered down by the courts so that they now looked to a certain degree to the director's particular level of expertise. That is not satisfactory from a creditor's point of view because the creditor enters into a transaction with the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be fair and reasonable from a shareholder's point of view because that person chooses to invest in a company, in part, because of the experience and expertise of the directors. However, a creditor or a person who enters into a financial transaction with a company does so on the basis that that person is engaged in business, not investment. It is dubious whether this subjective test, this test that looks at the directors' previous levels of experience, is satisfactory from the viewpoint of protecting the creditor. There have been a number of cases in regard to this; for example, Statewide Tobacco Services Ltd v. Morley where the director took very little part&mdash;in fact, the head note says that he took no effective part&mdash;in the management of the company. In that particular case the company traded whilst insolvent. The director tried to raise a defence that he could not be sued because he had no direct dealings with the day to day management of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that it would be reasonable to allow the law to continue in the fashion that it has. I note that the Government has proposed a number of matters which should be included as factors of which a court should bear some consideration in scrutinising the diligence and degree of care exercised by a director. I suppose the difficult point is that not every director is responsible for all the actions of the company. The provision of the law at the moment is designed to place a fairly stringent obligation upon directors to encourage them to become involved at least in the good supervision of the operations of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do get problems where a company is very large&mdash;for example, a publicly listed company&mdash;and it is perhaps very difficult for a director to oversee every individual transaction. At the same time there is a lot of public money at stake by way of shares in the company and also by way of money that the company might owe to its creditors at any given time. It is appropriate that directors at least take some steps to properly supervise the operations of the company. I believe that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other matters that the Government believes should be a factor when considering whether a director has exercised due care and attention or due diligence is the number of meetings of the board of directors which a director has attended. I agree with the Government's proposition that it is not appropriate to impose a sanction just because a director fails to attend one particular meeting. Whether attendance at meetings of boards of directors is necessarily a good indicator of whether the director has discharged his obligations well is an arguable point. One would certainly like to see some attendance. There is a very good argument that directors can be busy people and they can do work outside of board meetings. A reliance on attendance at meetings of the board of directors in itself misses the point that we would expect directors, especially those of smaller companies, to exercise more care and attention, more scrutiny of the operations of the company, than merely attending the meetings of the board of that company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation 5 there is also some discussion of, shall we say, the exoneration of the directors from breaches of their fiduciary duties. What is proposed here is some sort of consent mechanism by which the shareholders of a company can exonerate directors from breaches of their fiduciary duties. That may be acceptable if the company is solvent at the time and remains solvent. However, one must remember that where a company is solvent at the time a director is exonerated from breach of care or breach of duty and shortly thereafter the company ends up in liquidation or receivership, that is a completely different matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company in which the shareholders may be the same persons as the directors may well have waived the right to reclaim a substantial sum of money from those directors and in so doing the position of the creditors may have been compromised. If the Government proposes to follow this line, it should be made very clear that, where the exoneration of the directors occurs, at least within the relation back period in the event of insolvency&mdash;which is six months prior to the first available act of bankruptcy&mdash;that exoneration is automatically void. That at least protects the creditors of the company to some extent from the directors misusing their position and then putting on their shareholders' hats and saying, `We will excuse ourselves from the fact that we did not do the right thing'. That would be unsatisfactory. In the relation back period, if not a period of two years back from the date of the commencement of the winding up, such transactions should be void. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address most of my comments specifically to recommendation 6. This recommendation is critically important with regard to an insolvent company. It really only relates to insolvent companies and it is critically important in the administration of such companies. The recommendation is that where a director has incurred a liability under section 592 of the Corporations Act, that liability is not to the creditor who has suffered the loss, but to all of the creditors equally. Section 592 of the Corporations Act provides that if a company incurs a debt and at that time the company is unable to pay all its debts as and when they fall due, the director can be sued by the person to whom the debt is owed and the money recovered from the director. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that this provision arises out of the common law of fraud. It arose out of the fact that directors were using the company veil to defraud creditors by incurring a liability in a company which had no ability to pay. The essence of section 592 of the Corporations Act is the debt that was owed to the creditor in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that it is appropriate that any right to recover from that director should be shared amongst all of the creditors of the company because all have not necessarily been defrauded. It would be very difficult to prove amongst a whole range of creditors that some may have been defrauded and others may not have been before the company became unable to pay its debts as and when they fell due. It is very clear that if the company is unable to meet its debts and it incurs further credit&mdash;at least, if the directors know and in certain other circumstances&mdash;the directors should certainly be liable to those other creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The belief contained in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Social and Fiduciary Duties and Obligations of Company Directors</EMPHASIS> and in particular in the Government's response is that by somehow changing this law, the number of recoveries from directors who trade a company recklessly will be increased. I do not necessarily agree. At the moment there is a real possibility and a real incentive to sue those directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one is a creditor in that circumstance and one sues the director, one knows that it is possible to get one's money back. There are many companies which are insolvent where this has occurred and where there is no money in the company to carry out the action to sue the director. It is ludicrous to expect that a liquidator will put his own money on the line to run the case. That will just not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of those companies where the directors have cleaned out all the assets of the company and there is nothing but a bare shell, we will find that there will be no recovery at all because there is no money available for the liquidator to carry out an action. I believe that in focusing on the right to share in the recovery, instead of focusing on the nature of the action which arises&mdash;which is an action which arises out of fraud&mdash;the Government has missed the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that recommendation 6 should not be complied with. I believe that the Government is failing in properly supervising the operations of companies and properly protecting creditors in allowing this particular recommendation to go through. I say that with due respect to all those on the Committee, such as my good friend Senator Cooney who is sitting on the other side of the chamber and who participated in those deliberations. In reality I believe that it will just not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should finally address a number of general comments about the duty of directors. Public expectations have been so raised that perhaps we now have more stringent expectations of directors than we may have had in the past. If that is the case, so be it. The Government has chosen that particular course of action. What is of concern to me is that there are particular incorporated bodies that are above the corporations law and above the recommendations contained in the Government's response, and there are particular organisations where members or creditors do not get the same protection that is contained in the corporations law. I refer, of course, to the privileged position of union directors, the less stringent accounting standards that are expected of unions, the less stringent observance of good audit practice and, quite simply, the less stringent duty of care that is required of a union leader compared with what is required of a company director. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had numerous cases where union leaders have taken their mates to the brothel and run up the bill. I know it is shocking, Mr Acting Deputy President; I am shocked by it all as well. All those on this side of the chamber are shocked by it, and I am sure Senator Cooney and many good unionists on the other side will be shocked by it as well. We have found cases of union leaders taking their mates to the brothel and charging it up to the union credit card, and somehow this seems to get through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advancing a very simple proposition, based not on ideology but on a principle of fairness and equity. That proposition is simply this: a union official who exercises power on behalf of the union should bear the same duty of care that one expects of a company director. It does not matter whether it is the trade unionists' money or the shareholders' money, it is all money that has been put in by people in good faith and therefore it should be subject to the same duty of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be one law for all throughout Australia, not one law for some whom the Government likes and another more stringent rule for others whom the Government dislikes for some particular ideological reason. That is not acceptable. We must have the same accounting standards for unions that we have for companies. We must have the same expectations of union leaders as we have of shareholders and companies. In fact, there is a very good ground to say that we should expect a higher standard of care and a higher degree of diligence and propriety from union leaders than we expect of companies. The point about a company is that free choice is involved in becoming a shareholder of a company. People are not required, on the whole, to become shareholders of companies. However, people are frequently required to become members of a union. That act of compulsion is perhaps the strongest argument one can advance for expecting that a union leader will meet the same standards of care, the same standards of propriety, that the public has come to expect of company directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I welcome some of the provisions of the Government's response. There are some areas where I am dissatisfied. I hope the Government will extend to unions and unionists the same protection that is now being afforded to shareholders and creditors of companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased with the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on company directors' duties. I listened with some interest to Senator O'Chee, and I think he got off the point a little towards the end, when he was talking about the duty of unionists in this context. My reading of the Industrial Relations Act must be different from Senator O'Chee's because set out in the Industrial Relations Act are provisions, very similar to the ones set out in the corporate legislation, that require union officials in one case and company directors in other cases to obey very similar duties. For example, I remember a person in a particular union who had to surrender his position for five years because of an offence relating to a ballot, and I think in respect of only 20 ballot papers. I do not approve of that, but it is quite clear that the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act are very similar to the duties cast upon directors under corporate legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee perhaps should be more precise in his evidence when he says that there are cases where a union leader has gone off to a brothel with a credit card and entertained his friends. Any allegations that are to be made in this chamber should be backed up with evidence. Earlier this week I rose in this place and defended the reputation of Mr Packer. I do not think it matters where people come from. If this chamber is going to be used to denigrate a person or a group, if that is how people think the proceedings in the chamber should be conducted, that should be done only with cogent evidence, otherwise we are taking an unfair advantage of our fellow citizens. We are not special people; we are people elected from the community of which we remain a part, and we should never let our sense of fairness be overborne by any position we hold in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go through the Government's responses. The Government has looked tentatively and, in my view, properly and exhaustively at each recommendation and it has made a proper response. I express my gratitude to the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, for doing that. As an illustration of the next point I want to make, I refer not only to this Committee but also to the Select Committee on Animal Welfare, on which you served so splendidly, Mr Acting Deputy President. Much of the effect committees have is in respect of the investigations or the inquiries they carry out and the submissions they hear, and the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, of which you were such an illustrious member, is a great illustration of that. A great deal of reform came from that Committee, not from specific recommendations we made&mdash;I was also a member of that Committee&mdash;but from the fact that we were meeting different people and interest groups and that they did something about the matters we were dealing with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the Senate and the Senate committees does create a climate where change can take place. I am not suggesting that the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs brought about a change in the attitude of the courts, but it did help create a climate that led to the change that has been indicated by court decisions since the Committee's report in November 1989. On page 5 of the Government's response those cases are set out. I simply point out that, just as the Select Committee on Animal Welfare has helped to create a climate, this Committee inquiring into directors' duties has added limited, but nevertheless important, force to achieving change in the corporate world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will legislate in respect of some of our recommendations. Senator O'Chee said that the Government was to legislate in respect of recommendation 6 and was to adopt the recommendation the Committee had made. It is not my reading of the Government's response to recommendation 6 that it is going to do that, but it certainly expressed a sympathetic understanding of our point. From what appears there, I did not take it that the Government was actually going to adopt that recommendation in the terms that we suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that the Government has done is in response to recommendation 7 where the Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crime liability under companies legislation not apply in the absence of criminality.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has accepted that. In respect of one particular matter under section 232&mdash;which I know concerned many people in the company area and, indeed, outside it&mdash;the Government proposes going to civil penalties. That was recommended by the Committee and I am glad to see the Government taking up the suggestion to apply civil penalties, rather than criminal ones, to situations where officers of companies fall short of their civil duty. It is quite unfair that any sort of criminal penalty be attached to an act which really is not criminal in the sense that we understand it. A civil penalty does not besmirch a person's reputation but, nevertheless, it ensures that the provisions in the Act requiring people to act in a particular way are complied with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although these are matters in respect of which the Government cannot legislate, it has expressed its support for the recommendations made by the Committee. For example, recommendations 14, 15 and 18 really went to the issue of professional bodies, relevant to company directors and others in companies, developing a code of ethics. One of the central features of the report was that ethics be looked at as a means of reform in the corporate area. The Government cannot, of course, legislate for a change in ethics, but it has expressed sympathy for steps to be taken for that to be done. The Committee's recommendation 20 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the law be amended to make a director personally liable for complicity where he or she intentionally or recklessly assists in or encourages an act which constitutes an offence by a company.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has said that it will adopt that recommendation, leaving out the word `recklessly'. On reading that recommendation, I must confess that the Government is right in leaving out the word `recklessly'. This shows not only that governments can change their minds when they make responses to reports but also that the makers of reports can change their minds in response to the Government's answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I close by simply referring generally to the report. In my view, this was a very good and substantial report. Looking down the list of members of the Committee, one can see why. Senator O'Chee was critical of aspects of the Committee's report, but when one looks at the membership of the Committee, I suggest that he re-read the report and the response and decide whether he cannot agree with both. On the Committee, besides myself, there was Senator Richard Alston, the Deputy Chairman, who is a very eminent jurist; Senator Bob Collins, now a very good Minister; and Senator Pat Giles who, as a senator in this chamber, is overlooked in terms of the ability she displays. I admire greatly Senator Giles's mind and the skill and energy with which she goes about her work. Indeed, I think she is typical of many members of this chamber who are not in the limelight but who nevertheless contribute mightily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other members on the Committee were Senator Robert Hill, the Deputy Chairman until 22 March 1989 and now the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate; Senator Janet Powell, who went on to become Leader of the Australian Democrats; Senator Chris Schacht; and, finally, but by no means least, former Senator John Stone. Despite having Senator O'Chee in his place, the fact that former Senator John Stone is no longer here is a loss to this chamber, particularly in the economic debates that go on here. It is a shame that his career was unfortunately cut short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Chairman of the Committee, I again thank the Government for its response; for the way it has analysed the matters put forward by the Committee; and for the way it has gone about accepting what the Committee has said in so many instances and in at least one instance correcting, in my view properly, the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee stresses that the Australian Government should give a high priority in its foreign policy objectives to seeking improvement of the United Nations machinery for peacekeeping. The Committee recommends that as far as possible, Australia should coordinate its efforts towards this end with other likeminded countries, particularly those in its immediate neighbourhood. The permanent appointment of an Australian officer to the United Nations Secretary-General's Military Planning Staff should be actively and vigorously pursued. (2.65)</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government has over the past three years given high priority to efforts to improve the UN's peacekeeping machinery. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade set out Australia's policy on this in his address to the 44th session of the UN General Assembly in 1989. Subsequently the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, particularly members of the Australian mission to the United Nations in New York, have continued to press for such improvement in deliberations on this issue in the General Assembly and in the Special Committee on Peacekeeping. The Government has not had all the success it would have liked, but it and others have certainly succeeded in focusing international attention on the need for action to address this problem. The Government will continue to do so, and its efforts at wider reform in the UN complement the proposals Australia has made concerning improvements to the UN's administration of peacekeeping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government takes practical steps to co-ordinate efforts on this matter with other likeminded countries, especially countries such as Canada. It does this for example through joint Canadian/Australian/New Zealand (CANZ) statements during the regular sessions of the General Assembly. Links with other members of the region on peacekeeping issues, while increasing, are not as well developed. These nations may well come to share Australia's strong commitment to the reform of the UN's peacekeeping machinery, particularly as their involvement in UN peacekeeping operations increases, and when those operations take place in the region&mdash;as will now happen with the proposed UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). Greater Japanese involvement in peacekeeping will also assist this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contact with Australia's neighbours on peacekeeping has thus increased in recent years. The Department of Defence sent a team to Singapore in 1991 for discussion on operational aspects of peacekeeping. It may be possible to develop similar links with Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Fiji as these countries have taken a close interest in peacekeeping. The Government is also looking at strengthened co-operation with New Zealand on peacekeeping issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has been represented at three key seminars on peacekeeping in the region during 1991. The Government is giving consideration to Australia hosting an international Peacekeeping Seminar in 1992-93, which will further focus regional attention on these matters. Funding for this will be sought in the 1992-3 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Continued efforts have been made by officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence to have an Australian officer appointed to the United Nations Secretary-General's Military Planning Staff. Those five positions are filled on the basis of contracts being offered to military personnel from the principal troop contributing countries&mdash;a degree of geographic rotation is involved in the selection of these personnel. Australia's turn will come, but our interests in having personnel in those positions have to be assessed by the Secretary-General on an equitable basis against the interests of many other UN members. Meanwhile the Government has arranged this year two short-term secondments of ADF officers to the UNSG's Military Adviser's staff and we are advised that this has been of great assistance to the Military Adviser.</PARA>

Senior Secretariat staff, from the Secretary-General down, are well aware of Australia's interest in this position, as are relevant senior officials in the Permanent Five members of the Security Council. The decision on this matter is one for the Secretary-General who then seeks the agreement of the Security Council to the proposed nominee. The Australian Government fully respects the UN Secretary-General's right and competence in this matter. It is also important to note that the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Cambodia (who is still to be appointed) will have overall responsibility for UNTAC.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that a more comprehensive picture of the total financial cost of any Australian contributions to peacekeeping be readily available to Government, to the Parliament and to the Australian people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has worked with a strong sense of commitment to make cost and efficiency assessments of international organisations, including UN peacekeeping operations. The Government fully agrees, therefore, on the need for the total financial cost of operations to be given to the Australian Government, Parliament and people. However, the budgetary process for UN peacekeeping operations explains why accurate costings are sometimes difficult to obtain. When the UN Security Council accepts the Secretary-General's proposals for a peacekeeping operation, it then commissions a detailed operational plan for the operation. Once that plan is approved the UN's Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budget Questions (ACABQ) considers the plan and recommends its budget to the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly. The Assembly then approves the proposed budget and each UN member is obliged to pay its assessed contribution to the total cost of the operation. (Australia's current share is 1.57%.) This represents the total UN budget for the operation. Some reimbursement to troop contributing countries can be made from this budget, and if there is a surplus in the budget (as happened with UNTAG) moneys can be returned pro-rata to member states. However reimbursements are always lagged (partly because there are invariably delays in member states contributing their share to the financing costs for UN peacekeeping operations). Thus member states have to work on their assessed contribution, plus the additional initial cost of any commitment they might make, in determining their total financial obligation to the cost of a UN PKO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the Department of Defence, a new Defence Financial Management Information System is being introduced progressively which will allow Programs to capture expenditure electronically and will provide a wider range of expenditure recording and reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department's objective is to refine further costing systems to move towards a more reliable means of cost identification and attribution. However, information recording systems are not sufficiently flexible at this time to provide the total costs of many activities. While Defence can identify the direct costs associated with a specific activity, it is not as straightforward to identify the indirect costs, nor the costs borne by one Program for another Program. In an attempt to overcome this problem in relation to personnel costs, overhead rates have been determined for preliminary cost analysis and cost recovery purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to costs associated with peacekeeping, the main requirement to provide a more comprehensive picture is to identify the additional costs of mounting the operation and to deduct from those additional costs the amounts which can be claimed, and agreed, for reimbursement by the UN. Systems will be implemented to record and report those additional costs and reimbursement on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation Four</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that a small, permanent secretariat or task force be established as a matter of priority to oversight the many and varied aspects of peacekeeping in the evolving international order. The staffing should remain flexible so that adjustments can be made, depending on the level of activity in the external environment. Representatives from various departments and agencies affected should be seconded to the unit as required. The basic role of the unit should be pro-active, not reactive. Its starting point should be a clear identification of Australia's interests in peacekeeping, both generally, and as specific cases arise. The reference list in Recommendation Eighteen indicates the range of factors which the unit could monitor, co-ordinate and oversight. The secretariat would also be the appropriate body to oversight implementation of other recommendations of this Report. (3.16)</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although peacekeeping has some priority in Australia's foreign and defence policies, contributing to UN peacekeeping operations is not a specific objective isolated from other multilateral objectives. Against this background and constrained by the absence of readily available resources the Government intends to maintain its existing arrangements, and, regarding the oversight of Australian involvement in peacekeeping, to use more extensively the Inter-Departmental Committee process to address questions of co-ordination. This enables greater organisational and resource flexibility. The Government considers it is a more appropriate arrangement which directly addresses the issues concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In elaborating this last point it makes most sense for the ADF to maintain responsibility for the administration of Australian military personnel in UN peacekeeping operations, rather than give part of this responsibility to a Secretariat, thus creating an additional bureaucratic layer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will, however, keep this issue under review, and take a flexible approach to the deployment of resources as necessitated by the level of Australian involvement in UN peacekeeping operations, and requests from the UN for such involvement. The Government will give careful attention to the points raised in the Report and to this Recommendation in devising the best administrative structures for Australian involvement in UNTAC. The Government may also need to look at the issue again if Australian NGOs become involved directly in UN peacekeeping operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the above, Australia does not have either the Defence Force structure or indeed other resources, to move to a pro-active position on UN peacekeeping beyond the Government's current policy. This is in fact partially recognised in Recommendation 16 of the Report. Australia takes a different view from Canada and the Nordic countries on this issue. Those countries give peacekeeping a much greater priority than Australia, and their Force Structures are designed to accommodate extensive peacekeeping activity. The Government will continue with its policy of assessing peacekeeping opportunities and possible Australian involvement as they arise within the framework of our present Force Structure.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no difficulty with the concept of a history of our involvement in UN peacekeeping. The UN has published its own record of peacekeeping, The Blue Helmets, in which Australia's contributions are recorded. The Australian Defence Force Academy's recently published Australia and Peacekeeping (edited by Hugh Smith; Canberra: Australian Defence Studies Centre, 1990) provides a publicly available source on Australia's role in peacekeeping. One practical difficulty in undertaking a separate official history, however, is determining the parameters of such a history.

The request received is sometimes the result of prior negotiation with UN Secretariat officials. It is also important to note that decisions on the command of an operation are for the UN Secretary-General and then the Security Council. Australia should not expect to command more that its fair share of such operations and in that context its record of participation is an important factor.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I set out in the attachment to this letter the Australian Government's response to the Report of your Committee on "United Nations Peacekeeping and Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In doing so I wish to make a number of general points on behalf of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the Government finds the Report a helpful document which will serve to focus public attention more clearly on an important element in Australian foreign and defence relations. I am pleased to record that the Government can accept in large part almost all of your recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the Committee underrates the complexity of the task facing the UN Secretariat in maintaining multiple peacekeeping operations. This has been accentuated by the growth in UN peacekeeping activity in the last three years. From 1978 to 1988 no new UN peacekeeping operations were launched. But from 1988 to the present nine new UN peacekeeping operations have been launched&mdash;without a significant appreciable increase in UN resources to administer those operations. The Secretariat often has to work to very tight timetables under considerable multilateral political pressure to achieve the tasks set for it. I think there was insufficient recognition given in the Report to just how difficult it can be, at times, in balancing the interests not just of thirty or more troop contributing countries, but more importantly, the expectations of the protagonists to the conflict. The performance of the UN Secretariat so far in 1991 in mounting five new peacekeeping operations has thus been praiseworthy, given the time and resource pressures with which the Secretariat had to contend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, the inclusion in the Report of the views of some named witnesses on the alleged shortcomings of the UN administration of peacekeeping operations has produced a lack of balance on that issue. Such balance could have come from inclusion in the Report of the remarks of other witnesses, such as the officer from the Electoral Commission who was highly complimentary about the UN's administration of the election associated with UNTAG. The negative views quoted in the Report on the UN's administration of peacekeeping do not reflect the considered position of the Australian Government. The Government has a wider appreciation of the political complexities surrounding the administration of UN peacekeeping operations than some individual witnesses and fully recognises and appreciates why, on occasion, these matters may not proceed quite according to plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also recognises that UN peacekeeping operations, relying as they do on contributions from many countries, create unique command and management challenges. It is important to recall that the efficiency of these operations depends on national units operating coherently within the command structure established by the UN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context the Committee might also have benefited from testimony from some senior UN Secretariat officials whose views might have been evaluated against those of some of your other witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, the Report tends to downplay the complex diplomatic negotiations involved in pursuing Australia's interests in possible participation in UN peacekeeping operations. Merely stating our wishes and our expectation will not necessarily achieve our objective. Our diplomats and other officials have a firm sense of the diplomatic subtleties and nuances necessary for Australia to secure its peacekeeping objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifth, the Report states that Australia has participated in the majority of UN peacekeeping operations. This is true, and as a contributor to peacekeeping, Australia's record is good and our reputation stands high. But in personnel terms we are not in the front rank of nations who have consistently participated in peacekeeping operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Report makes reference to twenty-three peacekeeping operations launched by the UN since its inception. Australia has directly contributed personnel to ten of these operations but has also temporarily loaned personnel to three other peacekeeping operations and provided observers in support roles for a further four operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the release of the Report the UN has launched four new operations in Angola (UNAVEM II), El Salvador (ONUSAL), Western Sahara (MINURSO) and the Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC) Australia is contributing personnel to MINURSO and UNAMIC. To date Australia has participated to varying degrees in nineteen of the UN's twenty-seven operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of personnel, over the years only one in approximately every 250 United Nations peacekeepers has been an Australian. According to United Nations figures available to us at 31 August 1991, (which excludes personnel assigned to MINURSO) there were 33 Australian peacekeepers out of a total of 10,838. Of 54 countries contributing personnel, Australia ranked equal twentieth with India. In 1989 Australia's contribution looked more impressive with 309 personnel attached to UNTAG in Namibia. However, as the Report notes, so did the contributions of eight other countries contributing personnel to UNTAG. Nevertheless with 45 Australian personnel now serving in MINURSO and 40 to serve with UNAMIC, and a significant Australian contribution planned for the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), our participation rate will considerably improve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should note however that numbers alone are not a measure of the value of a particular contribution: in this case, quantity does not equal quality. While Australia's contribution in numerical terms has been small, we enjoy a high reputation in the UN peacekeeping community for professionalism and competence. If Australia has achieved a standing in peacekeeping higher than our participation rate suggests, it is because of the aforementioned professionalism and competence of our personnel when they participate in UN peacekeeping operations, and also because of the particularly significant role Australia played in UNTAG. Our willingness to play a major role in the Cambodian settlement should also help significantly in lifting our profile in international peacekeeping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would point out that the Government faces resource constraints in contributing to peacekeeping operations and in administering them. For this reason in particular the Government is not proposing any major administrative changes or Defence Force Structure changes. I assure the Committee, however, that the Government is well seized of the importance of peacekeeping in our overall multilateral objectives, and will maintain a capacity to respond flexibly in order to pursue our objectives in this area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I broadly welcome the Government's response to this important report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on United Nations peacekeeping and Australia. This parliamentary report, which has been unanimously adopted, addressed for the first time&mdash;at least in a comprehensive way&mdash;Australia's role in contributing to the United Nations peacekeeping activities. These activities, of course, have increased extraordinarily since 1988. Currently, in expenditure terms alone, they amount to more than the costs in administration and all the other programs of the United Nations put together. It is necessary that we address how we as a nation can achieve our own foreign policy and other national goals, be good international citizens and contribute to peacekeeping in the various ways in which they now occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw the United Nations taking more than peacekeeping action so successfully in the Gulf earlier this year. I think it has been announced today that the United Nations is to bring a peacekeeping force to Yugoslavia to participate in the conflict between the Serbian and Croatian forces. There are also peacekeeping forces in the western Sahara, in Kuwait itself now and in a number of other regions. One of the most successful of these involved the activities in Namibia. In what was really a transition arrangement, a UN force made possible the self-determination of the Namibian people in the election of their own government. The activity that is on the agenda the most and which has just begun is the peacekeeping contingent in Cambodia in which Australia will play a very significant role. It is with all of these recent and current activities in mind that the Senate Committee brought down this very substantial report to which the Government is now responding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response sets out the Government's position on each of our Committee recommendations. It is clear and is set out in a format which this Parliament welcomes. There were 19 recommendations in the report and they are responded to one by one. All but one have met with a very positive response from the Government. In that one&mdash;which I will come to in a few minutes&mdash;where the Government rejects the words of recommendation 19, I believe there has been a misunderstanding. I will therefore speak from the cross benches, as it were, in explaining my understanding of the Government's reasons for coming to that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly speaking, I understand the Government's response and I believe it is welcomed. I will read the first of the six points which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, makes in his covering letter to this response. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the Government finds the Report a helpful document which will serve to focus public attention more clearly on an important element in Australian foreign and defence relations. I am pleased to record that the Government can accept in large part almost all of your recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>The second and third points in the letter are a clarification by the Minister and the Government of the complexity of the United Nations administration of peacekeeping forces. In our report, we include the evidence of some witnesses to our inquiry who made criticisms of the United Nations administration. I believe the Minister is very fair in the way in which he says that, as we did not have access to some of the United Nations senior administrators, there is an unintended, but perhaps perceived, bias because we have given some undue weight to these criticisms in the Committee report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to put clearly on the record the fact that I have confidence in the Secretary-General, Perez de Cuellar, and his senior officers&mdash;in particular, his special adviser on political affairs who is responsible for peacekeeping forces, Mr Marrack Goulding, with whom I have met on several occasions this year. I have full confidence in Mr Goulding and in the way in which, not only with good intentions but also through very capable and skilful decisions, he and other senior officers in the UN have prepared advice for the Security Council and the General Assembly and seen the implementation of peacekeeping forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a point that the Minister is making as well: in the complexity of the arrangements that will be made, we ought not read, out of perspective, some of the individual statements that stand alone in our Senate Committee report. So I, as one of those who contributed to the writing of the original report, also want to underline the Minister's redress or reassurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is substance in our reference to the need to improve the UN administration when we say that there were not enough resources. There are not enough resources in the UN administration to cope with the now nine peacekeeping initiatives that have been undertaken in the last three years. There was a period of about 15 or 20 years when there were hardly any peacekeeping initiatives; but there has been a plethora in recent times. I think the point ought to be taken that the objective of having procedures in the commissioning of peacekeeping forces ought to be followed and that there ought to be more resources and militarily experienced officers within the Secretariat, including experienced Australian military officers who come with full maturity to the peacekeeping purposes of the UN. By strengthening the administration of the United Nations in peacekeeping, even those deficiencies that some individuals brought to our attention in our inquiry would be all the more avoidable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also recognise that we ought not down play the complex diplomatic negotiations involved&mdash;whether by a government of a nation or the UN itself&mdash;in determining the arrangements for peacekeeping. I also acknowledge the fifth and sixth points made in the covering letter of the Minister, which say that we should not exaggerate Australia's contribution to peacekeeping over the whole life of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have contributed to 19 of the 26 or 27 peacekeeping activities of the United Nations. But we are in fact in equal twentieth position amongst the nations of the world in terms of the numbers of personnel that Australia has contributed. I certainly do not wish there to be any misunderstanding; we have said that we have made a significant contribution to the peacekeeping forces qualitatively, professionally and strategically. The Minister's clarification that we are not able to claim that we are amongst the most active nations in the world in contributing numbers to the peacekeeping activities of the United Nations is not unwelcome. Of course, there will be an increase in the present planning with regard to the peacekeeping force in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer, in the minute or so I have left, to three or four of the Government's responses. My time is very brief so I will not be able to say all that I would have wished. Recommendation 4 calls for a small permanent secretariat or task force to be established within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which would co-ordinate Australia's preparedness for peacekeeping. The Minister responds by indicating confirmation of the arrangements already in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, he adds on page 7 of the response that the Government will keep this matter under review and will give careful attention to the points that have been raised legitimately in the Senate report. In particular, the Government will look at the arrangements, possibly for a secretariat, in the event of Australian NGOs becoming involved more fully. Recommendation 6 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government ensure the precondition for Australia contributing to a United Nations peacekeeping force is that all parties are committed to a comprehensive settlement and to the relevant United Nations Security Council and General Assembly Resolutions and United Nations peacekeeping operational plans.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear recommendation by the Committee and the Government agrees with it. We understood that this was standard government procedure in Australia and, indeed, standard United Nations procedure, but we do not want to be in any way complacent about this precondition. We do not want to be misinterpreted as being so much in favour of pointing to the way in which Australia could live up to the potential of contributing to peacekeeping operations that we are seen as being gung ho and overlooking some of these important preconditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 13 talks of the need to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That in itself is a recognition of the important role that electoral officers played in Namibia. The Government has agreed to that recommendation. I also refer to recommendation 15, where we mention greater regional cooperation. The Senate's finding greatly reinforces what we are already doing, and I am glad to see that the Minister has fully agreed with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 16 calls for international peacekeeping to be explicitly included in the objectives of the Australian Defence Force. The Minister in his response agrees in part in that he argues that this is already explicitly in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence of Australia 1987</EMPHASIS> White Paper. He outlines the three particular objectives of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no argument with the Minister's response but, unfortunately, I believe that this is interpreted too narrowly by many in the Defence Force and many in public discussion in Australia as being only the first of the three items set out in the White Paper which are in fact orthodoxy in Australia. I believe that we all still need to see that, while the priority for the Defence Force is the direct defence of this country, peacekeeping is included in the second and third points that are set out in the Minister's response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I refer to recommendation 19, which I foreshadowed earlier. It is the only recommendation that the Minister has rejected. I support his reasons for rejection. Therefore, I wish to note that there has been a misinterpretation. When the recommendation is made that there be wide publicity of the kinds of criteria that ought to be observed by Australia in the commitment of a peacekeeping contingent, we are saying that this should be done before the commitment to Cambodia. The word `before' is meant to stress that we should undertake this matter urgently so that the public is well-informed on these matters and is able to discuss and maturely accept these matters by the time the Government has responsibly made a decision about Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and the Opposition are of the view&mdash;there are a few in this chamber among the Australian Democrats who take the contrary view&mdash;that defence decisions such as this are to be made by the responsible elected government of Australia. I believe that such decisions should be brought to this Parliament as soon as possible so that the Parliament is able to debate the matter and for that debate and any resolution of the Parliament that flows from it to be fully taken into account. I do not wish to detract from the sovereignty of the Government or to delay any decision by responsible government that should be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to stress that Australia can make a real contribution to the current United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, UNTAC. I very much welcome the decision by the United Nations to invite General John Sanderson of the Australia Defence Force to be commander of UNTAC. I have confidence in General Sanderson and wish him and all the Australians serving in the United Nations peacekeeping forces every success in their endeavours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I am pleased to see that the Government has accepted almost all of the Committee's recommendations relating to United Nations peacekeeping. Our report brought down a total of 19 recommendations. It is worth emphasising that the recommendations were unanimous; they had the support of all parties represented on the Committee&mdash;Government, Opposition and Australian Democrats. I welcome the systematic way in which the Government has addressed each of the Committee's recommendations. I would like to emphasise that the recommendations arose out of a very comprehensive exploration of the issues involved in Australia's participation in United Nations peacekeeping.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report reflects the belief of the Committee that historically peacekeeping has played an important role in certain international circumstances. The recommendations also reflect the view that the need for such activities is likely to increase in future rather than decrease. That is a very important part of our assessment of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee concluded, as the Government pointed out in its response, that in purely numerical terms Australia's contribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations has been modest. But we also share the Government's view that Australia's high standing internationally as a peacekeeper is in large part due to the professionalism and competence of the Australian personnel who have participated in United Nations peacekeeping operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not attempt to comment in detail on the Government's response to each of the Committee's 19 recommendations. I will, however, make a few general remarks and refer specifically to some of the recommendations. For example, I welcome the very positive response that the Government has given to the Committee's concerns about accurate financial costing of Australian contributions and the prospective Cabinet consideration of a framework for setting conditions of service for Australian Defence Force personnel serving on United Nations peacekeeping missions. I emphasise the word `prospective'. We are very much concerned to ensure that the conditions of service for Australian personnel serving abroad on peacekeeping missions are laid down clearly and concisely in black and white before those personnel leave Australia. That has not always been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the Government's decision to use more extensively the inter-departmental committee process to address questions of coordination rather than establishing a small secretariat in the Public Service, as recommended by the Committee. The important aspect of the Committee's recommendation in my view is the need to ensure effective coordination of future peacekeeping activities, when both the level and complexity of Australian participation is likely to increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was certainly no intention on the part of the Committee to isolate United Nations peacekeeping from other multilateral objectives, to duplicate functions or to create additional bureaucratic layers. They were not the objectives of the Committee in that recommendation. On the contrary, the purpose of a clearly identified central coordinating unit or secretariat was considered desirable by the Committee in order to carry out a number of important functions. These include integrating peacekeeping even more fully into Australia's overall foreign policy objectives; ensuring that there is no unnecessary duplication or overlap of functions; and systematically evaluating our participation in peacekeeping activities under the United Nations umbrella. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the inter-departmental committee process can ensure these outcomes effectively, then I feel confident that it will be acceptable to members of the Committee. I am reassured that the responsibility for implementation of the recommendations in the report has been clearly designated, and in particular that the question of the most suitable administrative structures for Australian involvement in the Cambodia mission is being kept under active review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that the minor technical problems that have been identified as standing in the way of publication of an official history of Australian involvement in peacekeeping activities will be readily overcome and the project begun without delay, as recommended in the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there is a little literature available on the subject, it falls far short of giving adequate coverage to or acknowledgment of the services performed overseas by Australian peacekeepers. The recommendation by the Committee that such a history be written was very closely tied to the Committee's concern that the Australian community should be better informed about our contributions to United Nations peacekeeping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Committee's view, press releases announcing Australian contributions are simply not enough to ensure the level of public understanding and support for the Government's contributions to peacekeeping in various theatres abroad. It was for this reason that the Committee urged the Government in recommendation No. 18, in effect, to engage in dialogue with the community and actively encourage debate on issues relating to peacekeeping, the objective being to raise the profile of peacekeeping in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that the final decision on participation in peacekeeping is one that the Government itself must take. We all agree with that. But the decision that the Government takes should be based on as full and comprehensive an understanding of community attitudes as is possible. Letting the community know as much in advance as possible of the reasons for Australia's participation, the likely costs and the likely benefits will, in the long term, be the only way to maintain continuing community support for Australian involvement in the United Nations peacekeeping operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government response confirms the impressions of the Committee that `links with other members of the region on peacekeeping issues, while increasing, are not as well developed' as they might be. The activities foreshadowed in the Government's response to recommendations Nos 1 and 15 go some way to meeting the Committee's view that there is scope for more productive cooperation in UN peacekeeping operations at the regional level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out that recommendation No. 1 urged that Australia coordinate its efforts to improve UN peacekeeping machinery with regional and other like minded countries. Recommendation No. 15, which I also referred to, urged the Australian Government to explore greater regional cooperation in peacekeeping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate the recommendation that more emphasis be placed on introducing a peacekeeping component to the links which already exist under ongoing defence and foreign policy programs in our region. Whether this is done through joint peacekeeping exercises, regional seminars or personnel exchanges is a matter for further consideration in consultation with our regional partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is for Australia to actively initiate and pursue such an initiative. It is not only an important activity in itself, it is also a useful addition to the range of activities which our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, advocated in his statement on regional security in 1989 as adding substance to our relations with our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that the Government seek to have an Australian appointed to head the UNTAC mission&mdash;the mission to Cambodia. It is very pleasing to see that the Government has had considerable success in promoting the appointment of an Australian, General John Sanderson, to command the military component of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia. I understand that the United Nations Secretary General has nominated General Sanderson, and that no Security Council member has raised any objection to his appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee felt that this was a very important recommendation, given the importance of the Cambodia peacekeeping operation and the likely level of Australian participation in it. I am sure I am speaking for all members of the Committee in expressing my full confidence in the Government's selection of a very capable and highly experienced officer to fulfil what is going to be an exceptionally difficult and demanding task. I seek leave to incorporate the balance of my remarks in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would also like to take this opportunity to express my admiration for the dedication with which the leadership of the United Nations has tackled the enormous job of putting in place the machinery necessary to bring the Cambodian peace plan to life. I am more than conscious of the delicacy of the task and the very many pressures that the United Nations has been under.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As those who have read the Committee's Report will know, strong criticism by witnesses of some aspects of past United Nations peacekeeping activities surfaced during the course of the inquiry. The Committee felt it was its duty to acknowledge that there were aspects of the United Nations capacity to carry out its peacekeeping tasks that needed to be reviewed and improvements sought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a tribute to the leadership of the United Nations that they not only paid close attention to the Report itself, but also continued to work in a most constructive way to find the best solutions to the myriad of organisational, political and resource problems that the Cambodia peace plan confronted them with. This achievement is all the more remarkable when you consider that the United Nations was simultaneously engaged in launching three other new peacekeeping operations, in Angola, El Salvador and in Western Sahara.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure I speak for all the Committee members when I wish both the United Nations and the Australian personnel participating in the Cambodia peacekeeping operation well in their endeavours to bring a tragic episode in Cambodia's history to a close.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot agree with the suggestion that the Report lacked balance in its treatment of the United Nations administration of peacekeeping operations. It is true that there was a selection of views critical of certain aspects. Some of these criticisms came from individual military officers with first-hand experience of peacekeeping operations. Some reflected organisational views (e.g. army presentation to the Committee, p. 39 of the Report).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equally the Report gave a very full account of the difficulties that an international organisation such as the United Nations faces in mounting peacekeeping operations. Paragraphs 2.59&mdash;2.64 in particular give a faithful account of the testimony presented to the Committee by the representative of the Foreign Affairs and Trade Department, testimony which clearly acknowledged the difficulties inherent in administering peacekeeping operations by a multilateral body such as the United Nations and the role that Australia could realistically expect to play.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question over which I, and I believe other members of the Committee were left in some doubt, was the extent to which past shortcomings in the United Nations administration had been clearly articulated and made known to those responsible in the United Nations Secretariat as they occurred. It seemed to the Committee that legitimate concerns amongst personnel in the field may well have been filtered and diplomatically watered down in the past to a point where they no longer served to bring about change for the better.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The very lack of resources for peacekeeping to which the Government refers may well reflect a false complacency amongst some members of the international community that the job of peacekeeping was being done well enough and therefore needed no attention or timely and adequate funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it important to reiterate the point made by those who made critical comments, that their main concern was to see a vital international function carried out in the best possible way. The Committee shared this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report made it clear when testimony was being given in a private capacity (e.g. pp. 36-37). The Committee felt confident that the United Nations Administration was more than capable of differentiating between individual, personal opinions and the considered views of the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most valuable aspects of the Senate Committee Reports such as this one is the opportunity it gives to various interest groups, individuals and organisations to air views and reveal perspectives that can, in the normal course of events, remain unarticulated and perhaps not sufficiently taken into account by decision-makers. It seems to me also valuable for international bodies, such as the United Nations, to be made aware of the community pressures and community values that play an important part in shaping the policies of democratic governments such as ours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the suggestion that the Committee might have benefited from testimony from senior United Nations Secretariat officials, the Committee invited the United Nations, through their representative in Australia to make a submission to the inquiry. The invitation was declined on the grounds that the United Nations did not consider it appropriate to do so. Nevertheless, several reports relating to United Nations peacekeeping which were made available to the Committee by the United Nations were carefully studied in the preparation of the Committee Report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's response to the report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on United Nations peacekeeping and Australia is a very significant and extremely important document. Most of the recommendations are designed to improve the performance of the peacekeeping task which is now becoming one of the high priority areas of the United Nations both within the United Nations and within Australia. I shall not rehearse the recommendations which are directed towards those, but there are a number of recommendations which have particular significance and which I would like to advert to briefly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly agree with the first recommendation that the Committee made&mdash;and I am pleased to be now a member of that Committee&mdash;that the Australian Government should give a high priority in its foreign policy objectives to seeking improvements of the United Nations machinery for peacekeeping. It is entirely reasonable for the Government to say that the permanent appointment of an Australian officer to the United Nations Secretary General's military planning staff can wait until our continued contribution to the force warrants such a step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation No. 3 warrants comment. It suggests that a more comprehensive picture of the total financial cost of any Australian contributions to peacekeeping be readily available to government, the Parliament and the Australian people. Clearly, that is part of the accountability process and, indeed, is an essential component if we are to structure our continuing contribution to peacekeeping forces adequately and positively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that sense I strongly support recommendation No. 4 which the Government does not fully accept. The recommendation is that a small permanent secretariat or task force be established as a matter of priority to oversight the many and varied aspects of peacekeeping in the evolving international order. The Government suggests that the interdepartmental committee process is adequate to achieve that. One must express some doubt about whether it is. I do not think it is good enough. The interdepartmental committee process is essentially disjointed, not particularly focused and does not have the continuing and direct responsibility for the development of priorities in this function. We would certainly prefer the establishment of a permanent secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation No. 11 warrants a brief mention. It suggests that additional emphasis be given to imparting negotiation and conflict resolution skills in the pre-posting training period. Very clearly, that is a function at the heart of a United Nations peacekeeping operation. Regrettably in many ways but, quite naturally, this is foreign to the normal training that our defence forces receive. Clearly, it is an area which should now receive continuing and renewed emphasis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation No. 15 has been referred to previously. It suggests that we explore with countries in the region the concept of greater regional cooperation at various levels. This is something that the Australian Democrats would welcome as we believe that our defence concerns should have a regional focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation No. 16 the Committee recommends that the Australian contribution to international peacekeeping be explicitly included in the objectives of the Australian Defence Force. I believe that would be extremely important not only to confirm that the Australian Government now considers that to be a high priority in its strategic defence concerns, but also because it would have some effect on the measures taken in developing our future defence strategies and capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is well and truly on the record, the Australian Democrats favour a defence posture which is directed towards defending our shores rather than the often touted forward defence idea which would involve us in military adventures overseas. However, here we have a situation where we must provide capacity to contribute to United Nations peacekeeping forces. While this, on the face of it, shows a certain conflict with the stance we have taken, I believe it can be resolved by placing great care on our strategic considerations and selecting the sort of equipment for, and direction and development of, our armed forces which will enable them to join other forces in concert in overseas operations which are directed towards United Nations peacekeeping efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still emphasise that we should not aim for high expenditure in equipment and in general strategic provisions which are directed towards allowing us to have an independent capacity to deploy our forces overseas. Recommendation No. 19 is extremely important. I regret that the Government has seen fit to reject it. The recommendation suggests that a statement of the factors which lead to the decision, and which are listed in recommendation No. 18, should be publicised widely in the Australian community before a final decision on participation in that particular operation is taken. I prefer to apply a literal interpretation to that. I do not think there is a misunderstanding. I solidly support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation is in keeping with the view that we have held for a long time&mdash;that before Australian troops are deployed overseas a resolution of both Houses of Parliament is necessary. I do not share Senator Teague's suggestion that we should debate that after the decision has been made, after the troops have left our shores. That is closing the gate after the horse has bolted. It is a significant decision that is being made on behalf of the Australian people; it is a decision that places lives at risk. I believe that this Parliament has not only the right but also the responsibility to consider the reasons that the Executive Government puts forward for making such a weighty decision. I regret that the Government has rejected that suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by welcoming the report. It is a timely one. Very clearly, the Australian contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping force, while commensurate with our capacity, is extremely important. I trust that it will be given high priority in the future. </PARA>

The coalition parties have, of course, a fine record in supporting Australia's peacekeeping efforts, and we maintain that attitude. Those peacekeeping efforts have been both under UN auspices and otherwise. I can remember one force in particular, not under UN auspices, in the Sinai which I visited some years ago. That multinational force was playing its part in maintaining the one peace treaty that lasted in the Middle East between Egypt and Israel. I have seen Australian peacekeepers in many areas of the world doing fine work. I know that they are highly regarded and that their work is internationally appreciated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer in particular to the peacekeeping forces in Cambodia and the decisions of the Australian Government in that regard. I speak of the force that has recently been sent to join the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia, UNAMIC. It involves some 40 military personnel. The much larger group that is going to be sent will join the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, UNTAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade made mention in its report of the need to ensure security for Australian personnel. I would have thought that that was obvious. I raise the issue in the light of the very unfortunate events that have occurred in Phnom Penh in the last 24 hours, where two SNC Khmer Rouge representatives, Son Sen and Khieu Samthan, were almost lynched. We regret violence wherever and whenever it occurs, and we deplore that act. On the other hand, in many ways it is not surprising. They are senior representatives of the Khmer Rouge, which is responsible for the deaths of over one million Cambodians. Many in the lynch mob were children who had lost their parents and other relatives to the Khmer Rouge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always said that it is beyond my comprehension that the Khmer Rouge would be allowed back into Phnom Penh. I think anyone who has visited the torture chambers in Phnom Penh and contemplated the return of those who committed such atrocities on other Cambodian people would be amazed to believe that it would be possible to find a peace solution that would embrace the Khmer Rouge. Yet the international community has sought to do that, and the Australian Government has been a key player in finding a solution that legitimises the future role of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, this has caused us concern. We are not surprised about the violent reaction that has occurred in Phnom Penh. We have questioned the sense, the realism, in incorporating the Khmer Rouge, the hated enemy of so many of the Cambodian people, within that peace formula. We have pressed alternatives that have excluded the Khmer Rouge. We have pressed them upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), and he has criticised us for doing so. We have argued that the Khmer Rouge leaders should be charged with genocide. At least until very recently, when we have done that we have been criticised by Senator Evans. When I was in Phnom Penh last year arguing that Hun Sen should move to unilateral democratic elections as a step towards peace that would perhaps force the non-communist factions to become involved in the peace process with him, we were criticised by Senator Evans for advocating that sort of solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans, since putting down what he modestly refers to as `his plan', has argued that it is essential that the Khmer Rouge be part of that plan, that it be embraced within it. We have consistently questioned the realism of that solution. My colleague Senator Teague raised in this chamber the issue of Son Sen's record. He was the Interior Minister, actually responsible for the running of that torture chamber. We endorsed his presence as one of the representatives on the SNC, a body which we said was important to be constructed to take over the role of interim government of Cambodia. When we have put his record to Senator Evans in this chamber, he has avoided that issue. We have asked why Australia is embracing people with that type of record to play key roles in the future of Cambodia, and we still have unsatisfactory answers to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have asked how we could depend on a settlement which depends so much upon the good faith of the Khmer Rouge. Looking at the record of the Khmer Rouge, how could one take for granted its good faith? It was demonstrated immediately before the settlement when the KR started to force refugees out of their camps in Thailand and back into Cambodia so that they would not come under the UN authority and be protected by it to be repatriated to where they wished to go. The KR wished to return them to where it wanted them for future purposes within Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have asked how, in the real world, we can accept that all of the forces of the Khmer Rouge would, under US auspices, assemble in these cantonments, and that 70 per cent of those forces would hand in their arms and be discharged from military action and returned to the villages as peasants. It seems to us that that is a totally unrealistic proposition, yet it is a key to the basis of this peace agreement. When I put that to UN officials recently in New York their answer was, `Of course we can have no guarantee. It depends upon their good faith'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at their good faith over the past 13 years, there is no realistic basis for assuming that such would occur. The Khmer Rouge is believed to have some three or four years of weapons and ammunitions stashed away in the jungle. Is it realistic to believe that all of a sudden this communist, horrendous organisation will convert itself into a democratic group, cast aside its armed struggle and join in free and open elections? We have raised the unreality of that and have been condemned by our Foreign Minister for raising it as an issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this now mean? It means that we have sent some 40 Australian officials to Cambodia under the first of the UN missions, UNAMIC. Their role is to communicate between the Khmer factions and between the Khmer factions and the SNC. The SNC can now not operate and, as was envisaged, hold meetings in Phnom Penh. Prince Sihanouk is now trying to cause a meeting to be held in Bangkok. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How are the Australian officials who have now left the city and gone out into the jungle going to carry out that communication task? How are they also going to carry out communication tasks between the factions and in particular between the Khmer Rouge and the other factions, especially after the atmosphere that we witnessed in Phnom Penh overnight? How safe will they be? We have very serious concern about that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said that for the Government to put Australian military personnel into a country where there are literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of unmarked mines; into a continuing conflict&mdash;I remind the Senate of that; there may be less now than there was but fighting is continuing&mdash;to deal between factions that have a hatred almost more intense than anything that can be imagined, and which was witnessed in Phnom Penh overnight, is to put Australian personnel into a very serious situation, our knowledge of which is made more acute by what has happened in the last 24 hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said that the Australian Government, before doing that, should have put down a statement in both Houses explaining exactly what was to be the function of the Australian military personnel, how their security was to be guaranteed, how long they would be there&mdash;matters which the Australian representatives have a right and responsibility to debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not opposed to Australia contributing to a peacekeeping force in Cambodia in the same way as we have supported other peacekeeping forces. It can be a very useful contribution that Australia can make to maintaining peace in our region and elsewhere. But peacekeepers can effectively carry out their function only after peace has been achieved. We wanted the opportunity to debate a Government statement as to whether that peace had been achieved and whether it was premature to send those forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, you might remember that, when the Department of Defence put out its statement on the first 40 personnel going to Cambodia, it said they would be unarmed in the same way as is the general practice in UN good offices missions. Upon reflection, the Australian Government changed its mind&mdash;probably sensibly&mdash;to allow them to take weapons for personal protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Australian Government, upon reflection, was obviously more worried about their safety than had been indicated in the first statement that was put out by the Department of Defence. But there was never a proper debate in this place either on why that change of policy occurred or on what sort of information the Government received upon which it decided to change its security assessment for these Australian military personnel. These are important matters that should be properly reported to the Australian Parliament, and we should have the opportunity to debate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the Government has made an offer to the UN to provide a much larger force to the United Nations to be part of UNTAC. The Australian Government has not disclosed to the Parliament the terms of that offer. We have not been told how many troops we have offered or what functions and roles they will carry out. I cannot see any reason why the Australian Government should not have informed the Parliament of those details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told that, when the UN makes a decision on whether to accept the Australian Government's offer in that regard, then the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will put down a statement which can be debated. But the House of Representatives gets up today. So the Prime Minister will not be putting down any statement. These decisions are likely to be made&mdash;perhaps not on deployment&mdash;before the Parliament returns. There will not, therefore, be that opportunity to debate the issue put to us by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We may now be putting forces&mdash;the Prime Minister has mentioned up to 500 men&mdash;into considerable danger. We as parliamentarians have a responsibility in that regard&mdash;an issue that has been raised in general terms in the report put before the Parliament by the Parliamentary Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Teague said, explicitly in one of the recommendations. So we take this opportunity to raise these concerns. At a different level we are concerned by other aspects. We raise questions about the cost of Australia's commitment. The cost to UNTAC has been estimated to be anything between about $1 billion and $5 billion. It would be by far the largest and most comprehensive of any UN mission that has ever been put anywhere in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its functions will be beyond that of any previous mission. It will be responsible for removing the mines and making the country safe. It will be responsible for all the tasks I have talked about, of disarming the current forces of the four Khmer factions, or 70 per cent of them as in the agreement. According to the letter of the agreement, it will be responsible for interim functions of government in Phnom Penh&mdash;the functions of foreign affairs, defence, the interior, communications and one other function of government that I can not immediately remember. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first time that the UN has assumed such functions of government. It will be responsible for resettling some 350,000 refugees that are presently in camps on the Thai border&mdash;resettling them to farms that no longer exist. These are people who have been in camps for many years, with all the social difficulties one can imagine that would be involved in that, apart from the security issues. It will also be responsible for laying all the plans for the reconstruction of Cambodia&mdash;an enormous task. </PARA>

This is a country which is not familiar with these practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considering the enormous educational task alone, it is mind-boggling. The task of bringing to people who have had so many years of trauma participation in what we can so easily refer to as a democratic election process is an enormous task in itself. It is challenging. We want to see a real peace in Cambodia and we want to see that the Cambodian people have a chance to determine their own future through free and fair elections, but it will cost a lot of money. We have never had a satisfactory answer from this Government as to what will be Australia's contribution to that. For example, on reconstruction it is assumed that, because of the huge sums of money involved, the normal peacekeeping formula will not apply and that countries will be asked to make voluntary contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan is expected to make a voluntary contribution of 30 per cent of the total cost. I cannot see how we can be expecting others whom we claim to have played prominent roles in the peace process to make large voluntary contributions if we are also not prepared to do so. I suspect that means that this Government has a much larger sum of money in mind than the $15m it has already committed. We should have the opportunity to debate these issues. The Government should have been prepared to come clean and put them before us in order that we might debate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity today to say that the issues of Australia's contribution to both UNAMIC and to UNTAC are important and should be debated before the Parliament. The Minister should be prepared to put down a statement stating exactly what the Australian Government intends to do in order to give us the basis of that debate. He should put to us what the Government intends to do in relation to our contribution to the refugees, disarmament and cease-fire monitoring and what part, if any, we are to play in the UN administration function that is to be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting than when Mr Hun Sen was in Canberra recently he suggested that perhaps the functions of government would not be passed to the United Nations as was envisaged in the agreement. One wonders if in fact that is not evidencing a further failure of the agreement. Those who are sceptical about the process now raise the issue of the agreement that Mr Hun Sen and Prince Sihanouk have reached in the last week or two to join together in a coalition which is outside the terms of the UN agreement. This,</PARA>
<PARA>of course, is going to put incredible pressure on the SNC. The SNC had the four functions coming together jointly to carry out governmental functions in the lead-up to the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has that now broken down? How much of the UN agreement has now broken down by that process of the functions of government perhaps not being passed to the United Nations and by the violence that has now occurred in Phnom Penh? Is it safe, therefore, to continue looking to develop the peacekeeping function in the light of these developments. They are important issues that we want out before the Parliament so that we have the opportunity to debate them. We criticise the Government for not giving us that opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like briefly to discuss the Government's response to the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">United Nations Peacekeeping and Australia</EMPHASIS>. I will probably be reiterating much of what Senator Maguire has said and incorporated in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two recommendations to which I specifically want to draw attention. The first is recommendation 12 which relates to the pioneering role of women in peacekeeping forces. I recognise that the Government response is that the practice of having women within contingents will be continued by future Australian contingents in accordance with operational requirements. The progressive introduction of women into new areas and occupations within the defence forces will ensure that opportunities to participate in peacekeeping operations will increase for female ADF members. That is to be highly commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to recognise that women went to Namibia when the UNTAG contingent was there, and the Australian Electoral Commission sent female officers there. It is very important to make sure that women are able to exercise their rights and participate in these contingents. This is a very important part of their military work and training and it provides them with a very good basis for future progression up the scale of seniority within the Defence Force. We saw also women travelling to the Middle East in that contingent, and that is something I highly recommend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main recommendation of concern and interest to me is recommendation 10 which relates to families of defence personnel. There was a saying within the British Army last century: `If we wanted you to have a family, we would have issued you with one'. Fortunately, that attitude has changed. With each participation by Australia in a contingent of United Nations peacekeeping, we have seen improvements in how we have handled matters pertaining to the family and their concerns and problems. The Government has accepted our quite lengthy recommendation. The Government is correct when it says that it represents the bare minimum support desirable for any deployment and reflects standard procedures already in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the Minister for Defence (Senator Ray) a question a couple of weeks ago as to what had been done for the families of the contingent that has gone to Cambodia. He was able to advise me that all of the things that we had put in our recommendations had in fact happened. It is very important that we continue to remember the families of the service personnel and provide them with the support that is so necessary while their spouses are overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to remember that at least half or more of the service personnel families consist of their parents or brothers and sisters, many of our personnel being single people. It is important to remember to provide information to and care for and support the families of the members of the Defence Force&mdash;be they their spouses or their parents as next of kin. Each of the three services has to fulfil that responsibility, but the services are becoming very professional in caring for families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge other organisations that participate in peacekeeping forces&mdash;we have had a number &mdash;to carry out this responsibility. The Australian Federal Police are in Cyprus. It was commented that the Army cared for families better than it did. The Australian Federal Police was certainly interested to see our recommendations in that regard. The Australian Electoral Commission may be sending personnel overseas in company with the Cambodian peacekeeping contingent. We also have a number of bodies, although not actually military bodies, such as AIDAB, which are supporting a number of people who are also going to Cambodia. We need to make sure that these other bodies involved in peacekeeping, not just the military people, are conscious of the need to provide information to and care and support for the families of the personnel that they send to these places as well. I thank the Government for its response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a supporter of Australia's involvement in United Nations peacekeeping efforts, I commend both the Joint Parliamentary Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for its excellent report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">United Nations Peacekeeping and Australia </EMPHASIS>and the Government generally for its response which is mostly positive. I support the idea of Australian Defence Force personnel being used for the socially useful purpose of peacekeeping&mdash;which is an appropriate use of the skills of our Defence Force&mdash;along with disaster relief and emergency services rather than engaging in overseas war-making. I would say that is a very good use of taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These positive roles of the Australian defence forces need to be given a higher priority instead of that which is traditionally promoted in ADF advertisements seeking recruits. These advertisements generally emphasise learning how to use weapons system and how to become `a man' out there in wild territory. If these weapons systems are used, of course, the end result is death. That is so often overlooked. I really welcome the whole emphasis of the other side of what the ADF can do and, as other speakers have said, do very well; that is, to engage in peacekeeping efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to a couple of the recommendations. Senator Spindler has already referred to recommendation 11, which says that additional emphasis should be given to negotiation conflict resolution skills. I am pleased to say that the Government has agreed to that. The Government has organised the inclusion of a two-day module on negotiation conflict resolution skills during predeployment training for future Australian UN peacekeeping contingents. I do not think that is nearly enough, but I am very glad that is there. It is a start and I think it will prove to be very effective. I hope it will be enlarged upon. That is a most important aspect of their role, as is the cultural climatisation which overseas peacekeeping forces need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next recommendation on which I would like to briefly comment is recommendation 16. The Committee recommends that Australian contributions to international peacekeeping be explicitly included in the objectives of the ADF and, in particular, be recognised as one positive element in regional security. Unfortunately, the Government's response to that is only to agree in part. I think it is very important for this to be emphasised and promoted as one of the chief functions of the ADF. I am sorry that that has not been more enthusiastically adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the comment on recommendation 16, the Government says that in the White Paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence of Australia 1987</EMPHASIS> it is explicitly mentioned that peacekeeping should be part of the ADF role:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Defence recently reaffirmed this view in his 30 May 1991 statement to Parliament on `Defence Into The Twenty First Century'.</PARA>
<PARA>I will continue the quote with this comment from the Minister for Defence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Gulf War showed, from a self-reliant defence force structured for the defence of this nation, Australia can make a contribution to operations further afield in support of friends and allies, and activities sanctioned by the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA>This is hardly a peacekeeping operation. I find it almost unbelievable that that quote is used to reinforce the notion of peacekeeping. It seems to be totally misplaced. That was not peacekeeping, that was helping the United States in war making; that is what that was about. There should be no illusions about that whatsoever. I find it almost incredible that the Government has included that quote to re-emphasise its commitment to peacekeeping. It is totally out of place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last recommendation I would like to mention is recommendation 19, which other people have also referred to. In this one the Committee recommends that the specific peacekeeping operation be publicised widely in the Australian community before a final decision on participation is taken. As other speakers have said, it is a shame that the Government has rejected that. We need to be very careful about peacekeeping operations in which we decide to engage. The community and the Parliament need to be involved in that consultation and discussion before a decision is made and not after the event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to congratulate General John Sanderson, who is commanding the UN forces in Cambodia. I wish him well in the very challenging task ahead, and I join others here in wishing the Australian peacekeepers in Cambodia a successful tour of duty and a safe return home. They have a very difficult task ahead. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Maguire</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to inform you of action by the Government on two recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee's report into safety aspects of visits by nuclear weapons capable warships. This was foreshadowed in the Government's response tabled on 13 December 1989. The recommendations concerned emergency dry docking arrangements and nuclear weapon accident planning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The announcement by President Bush on 27 September 1991 of a new defence strategy involving the deployment of its nuclear weapons worldwide has had a large practical effect on the safety issues associated with port visits and emergency dry docking arrangements by allied warships. Of special relevance is the following extract from his speech:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . the United States will withdraw all tactical nuclear weapons from its surface ships, attack submarines, as well as those nuclear weapons associated with our land-based naval aircraft. This means removing all nuclear Tomahawk cruise missiles from US ships and submarines, as well as nuclear bombs aboard aircraft carriers. The bottom line is that under normal circumstances, our ships will not carry tactical nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You might recall that the Government said in response to Recommendation 37 on dry docking arrangements that it was reviewing dry docking policy. The review has now been completed. As a result, the Government has modified the general conditions for dry docking to make it clear that allied warships needing to enter an Australian drydock for emergency repairs must meet the RAN's safety requirements for the drydock concerned and for the repairs to be undertaken. Australian safety requirements for dry docking are similar to the requirements of our allies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of this policy review, I can also confirm the advice in the Government's initial response to the Committee's report that the guidelines for the dry docking of nuclear weapons capable warships provide for at least the same level of safety as for vessels berthed alongside. This accords with the Committee's recommendation. Amongst other matters, the RAN safety requirements take into account the type of repairs involved, the likely duration of the docking, the location of the area in the ship under repair in relation to weapon magazines, and the firefighting facilities available to the dock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, the Government will continue to consider requests case by case for US and UK warships to dry dock in Australia for emergency repairs, and will not endanger the safety of a ship or its crew in need of access to Australian facilities. Government policy also accepts the US and UK policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons on board warships while they continue to adhere to that policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 38 concerned preparation of a document on procedures for responding in the unlikely event of a nuclear weapon accident in an Australian port. Even before the President's announcement, the Government had confirmed the Committee's assessment that the risk of a nuclear weapon accident in a visiting warship in port did not warrant contingency planning measures in addition to existing and well-established general port safety plans. The President's announcement means that the need for planning in addition to existing port safety plans is further diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth, however, will continue to work closely with port planning authorities, which are responsible for port safety, on safety issues associated with visiting warships. Through the Visiting Ships Panel (Nuclear) we will continue to make expertise available to them and to the State and Territory emergency organisations involved in the development of those safety plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Visiting Ships Panel (Nuclear) has prepared an information paper outlining the division of responsibilities, internationally as well as nationally, in the event of an accident involving nuclear weapons on board visiting warships. While largely of historical interest, I am enclosing a copy for your information.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">".. the United States will withdraw all tactical nuclear weapons from its surface ships, attack submarines, as well as those nuclear weapons associated with our land-based naval aircraft. This means removing all nuclear Tomahawk cruise missiles from US ships and submarines, as well as nuclear bombs aboard aircraft carriers. The bottom line is that under normal circumstances, our ships will not carry tactical nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Policy Framework</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visits made to Australian ports by the naval ships of our allies and friends are one of the most visible aspects of Australia's international defence relations. The policy of successive Australian Governments has been to welcome such visits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government permits conventionally powered warships of friendly and allied countries, whether or not they are nuclear capable, to visit any port in Australia subject to standard navigational safety requirements and the availability of berths. Between January 1988 and January 1991 some 133 ship visits have been made to 23 ports&mdash;in all Australian States and Territories&mdash;by warships of the United States and British navies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nuclear powered warships, however, are subject to special arrangements and are permitted to visit only those Australian ports which have been assessed and approved as suitable in terms of strict environmental and safety criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not require its friends and allies to disclose whether nuclear weapons are on board their visiting warships; it respects the policy of these countries neither to confirm nor deny the presence or absence of nuclear weapons in visiting warships. However in the highly unlikely event of an accident involving a nuclear weapon, agreements are in place for both the United States and British authorities immediately to notify the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is satisfied that the standards applied by NATO countries in respect of nuclear weapons safety, and with the safety precautions taken on board visiting warships, effectively preclude the possibility of an accidental nuclear detonation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US Navy has never had a nuclear weapon accident in any port, either in the US or elsewhere. Nor has it ever had an accident involving the release of fission products from a reactor core in the history of its nuclear propulsion program. The United Kingdom also has confirmed that it has never suffered a release of radioactive material due to an accident involving nuclear weapons. A wide range of foreign warships, including nuclear powered warships, have visited Australia but there has never been an accident involving the weapons or the nuclear propulsion systems on board these vessels while in an Australian port.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Safety Issues</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst credible hazard for any nuclear weapons that might be in visiting ships in Australian ports is a fire in the magazine. The effects of a fire conceivably could include the detonation of the conventional explosives in the nuclear weapon. However the risk of this type of accident is very remote. And the general design features and crew training of modern warships are calculated to minimise the effect of any fire, to contain damage and to contain any radioactive material that might be released within the ship's hull.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any nuclear weapons that might be carried in visiting allied warships are safely stowed according to detailed safety procedures. They would be under armed guard in their magazines. They would be in an unarmed condition, electrically disconnected, isolated from stray electrical currents and able to be sprayed, smothered and/or flooded in the event of a ship fire. They would not be handled or used in training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these safeguards in ships' magazines, nuclear weapons have a number of special safety features; for example, US nuclear weapons must comply with four safety standards, requiring positive measures to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.prevent nuclear weapons involved in accidents, or jettisoned weapons, from producing a nuclear yield;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.prevent deliberate prearming, arming, launching, firing, or releasing of nuclear weapons except upon execution of emergency war orders or when directed by competent authority;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c.prevent inadvertent prearming, arming, launching, firing or releasing of nuclear weapons in all normal and credible abnormal environments; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">d.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ensure adequate security of nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A positive measure is a design feature, safety device, or procedure that exists solely or principally to provide nuclear system safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in its report concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.`. . . the known accident/incident records of the United States and British Navies do not demonstrate that a risk arises during port visits by vessels from these navies of sufficient magnitude to warrant contingency planning for a nuclear weapon accident.' (11.114); and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.`While accidents of the kind noted in paragraphs 12.65 [collision resulting in loss of weapon overboard] and 12.66 [collision resulting in exposure of fissile material] may be more credible than those discussed earlier in the chapter [12], the consequences were they to occur are limited. Accidents of this kind are sufficiently similar to ordinary shipping accidents to be dealt with under the general port safety plans which currently exist.' (12.69).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every port in Australia has a general emergency plan which would apply in the unlikely event of an accident involving a foreign warship. However, the risk of a major collision involving a foreign warship in an Australian port is very remote because of navigational practices and port restrictions on shipping movements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These safety plans are the responsibility of the port authorities, naval or civil. The plans are developed in cooperation with States and Territory emergency services and include Federal support as necessary. The plans generally provide for a graduated response, relying in the first instance on the safety design features and crew expertise available in modern warships. Should this be insufficient, the resources of the port emergency services, including State, Territory and Federal support, are utilised. But all these arrangements address a remote contingency.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This response by the Government should be welcomed by everyone in the chamber. It addresses two of the matters foreshadowed in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade of more than two years ago to which the Government tabled a response four months later. We brought the report to the Parliament in August 1989 and the Government's response was tabled on 13 December that year. In that response it was foreshadowed that there would be a subsequent addressing of these two further matters&mdash;the emergency dry-docking arrangements and nuclear weapon accident planning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has there been some progress in the arrangements the Government has made to respond completely and satisfactorily to these matters, but there has also been a most important development in the announcement two months ago yesterday by President Bush of unilateral measures for the complete elimination of tactical nuclear weapons and the removal of tactical nuclear weapons from all United States ships. Some weeks later there was a response by President Gorbachev of the Soviet Union announcing a number of other decisions, including that the Soviet Union would also eliminate such weapons. The important point is that our ally, the United States&mdash;and it is this ally's ships that visit Australia&mdash;will be directly affected by the unilateral decision of the United States that the ships will no longer have these weapons. To quote the statement of President Bush that the Minister has cited:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bottom line is that under normal circumstances, our ships will not carry tactical nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA>Those who are sceptical of the United States living up to its declarations have in logical terms quite correctly said that we have never professed to be able to verify such an affirmation. To be realistic, that is something that both the Government and Opposition have long acknowledged, and I think the Australian Democrats also acknowledge that. That is why, when in recent years we have been urging these disarmament measures, we have said that there needs to be very careful verification. We need to be aware that, even with verification procedures in place, there could some evasion. However, no-one has seriously doubted the United States' intention to implement its own announcements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to put any scepticism on the very welcome and very sound announcements that President Bush made two months ago, but I do note that the Minister for Defence included this sentence in the second page of his letter addressing this matter:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having recently submitted a question asking whether many of the recommendations of the original report have been implemented, I find this document of some interest as it deals with some of the questions I raised. I would like to make it clear that the peace movement will continue to oppose the deployment of US warships because, although we welcome President Bush's unilateral disarmament initiatives, the announcement of 27 September 1991 indicates that the nuclear weapons being withdrawn from US warships are not being destroyed but are simply being put into storage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also question the need for ship visits in the first place, since the alleged Soviet threat in the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean has now diminished. There never was any strategic need for these port calls and there is no need for them now. They are simply to show the flag and to give rest and recreation leave to the sailors, which many of us believe would be better spent at their own home ports and not in our ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's statement also perpetuates the myth that US nuclear warships have a great safety record. Recent reports have indicated quite clearly&mdash;I am referring here to the Arkin papers&mdash;that they have a terrible record, with 50 nuclear weapons at the bottom of the ocean after submarines sank and nine nuclear reactors also on the ocean floor. There has been a variety of other accidents involving nuclear weapons and nuclear powered warships. The only claim the US can make is that there has not been a significant accident in a port, and I would say that it has been very lucky up to now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record of other navies is equally deplorable, if not worse. One accident causing concern at the moment is the Soviet Kilo class submarine in the Bering Sea which Greenpeace asserts is now leaking radioactive contamination into that sea. It has always been very difficult to find out details of those accidents because nuclear navies are very reluctant to admit that accidents have happened at all or to release details. It is only by constant pressure that any details of accidents actually come out into the public arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is largely due to the fact that nuclear navies are not monitored by anybody else. There is no independent assessment of their safety records. There is no equivalent of the International Atomic Energy Agency, for example, to monitor what the nuclear navies are doing at sea. The United States Government consistently refuses to allow naval arms control to be put onto any disarmament agenda. I saw it happen at the United Nations special session on disarmament in 1988. The United States has consistently refused to allow naval arms control to get onto the agenda. It does not want to be scrutinised for very obvious reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do question the assertion in the original report&mdash;and it has been reasserted in the Government's response here today&mdash;that the risk factor of nuclear accidents is so minimal. An accident is an accident. We do not really know when one will happen. As I said, the navies have been extremely lucky that none of these accidents has happened in a port. The testimony that accidents do happen for various reasons is lying on the ocean floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make the point that the New Zealand Government's ban on nuclear ships covered both nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships. This is what we would like to see in Australia. Unfortunately, the National Government across the Tasman is seeking to review this policy now because it wants to get into bed with the Americans at very close quarters. The United States Government is just waiting for the New Zealand National Government to have the courage to try to revoke its anti-nuclear legislation. I do not think that it has a snowball's chance in hell of doing that, if it takes any notice of public opinion in New Zealand on that score. The people are as committed now as they ever were to New Zealand's nuclear free status. I commend them for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been interesting is that the New Zealand Government, in the form of the Prime Minister, Mr Bolger, is using this document, this 650-page report which took three years to complete and was totally inadequate&mdash;I would say erroneous&mdash;in its conclusions, to justify the reintroduction of nuclear-powered warships into New Zealand. I think he really needs to read the fine print and especially the dissenting report by former Senator Irina Dunn. There are so many unanswered questions. Over and over again that report showed that the United States Navy, which is the chief navy that we are concerned about because that is the one from which we receive most of these visits, consistently refused to supply information to the Committee. The Committee was hampered in its job over and over again by the United States Navy refusing to give any information. This is typical of nuclear navies. They are not the only ones which do that. As I said, the United States Navy is the one most relevant to us. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the New Zealand Government is trying to revoke its nuclear-free legislation has raised some interesting questions about the `neither confirm nor deny' policy. As Senator Teague said, most people would expect that the Americans will do as they said they would do, which is to remove tactical weapons from their surface ships and submarines. It is another case of our having to trust them. Most people would. I think we have to be ever vigilant. This is why I would like independent monitoring of nuclear navies to be put in place. However, there is one significant rider to this claim that the United States has made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bottom line is that under normal circumstances, our ships will not carry tactical nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA>That quote is taken from the documentation of President Bush's speech of 27 September. Now, `under normal circumstances' is the bit that we have to question. Who decides what are normal circumstances? Of course, it is the United States Government; it is just up to the United States Government to reintroduce these weapons at any time, if it sees fit. It will see fit if it feels that it needs to go into a particular region to protect its interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The global policing role is alive and well on the part of the United States foreign affairs department. It will make the decisions. We will have no say in them. There might be a situation of some tension internationally where these weapons, which we would hope have been removed from these ships, could be refitted very quickly to meet any contingency that the United States Government thinks it needs to meet in its own interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would never be quite sure whether these ships actually had nuclear weapons on board. The `neither confirm nor deny' policy remains intact. I think that is the big flaw in this additional reply that the Government has now put out. It is not convincing at all. The peace movement will continue to oppose all port calls by United States nuclear warships, as it will continue to encourage our Government to work for naval arms control and other confidence building measures in the region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment briefly on the letter from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to the C<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>hairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade dealing with a change in policy announced by President Bush on warships carrying nuclear weapons. Of course, the statement is welcome. In part, it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the United States will withdraw all tactical nuclear weapons from its surface ships, attack submarines, as well as those nuclear weapons associated with our land-based naval aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA>It is part of the general de-escalation of the nuclear threat between the superpowers and as such, as I have said, it is extremely welcome. However, I echo the words of Senator Vallentine when she said that the critical flaw in that statement is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bottom line is that under normal circumstances, our ships will not carry tactical nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again the question must be raised as to who decides, in what sort of circumstances and when we can be sure that ships visiting our ports do not carry such weapons. The answer is that we cannot be sure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that these weapons have been taken from the ships, but have been placed in storage and can be put back at any time. The policy of the United States to neither confirm nor deny continues. In these circumstances, while the announcement in general terms is welcome, the Australian Democrats must put on record our concern that in basic facts nothing has really changed. We are still exposed to risks. The population in port cities is still very much at risk when United States navy and other navies which potentially carry nuclear weapons visit our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that at this point the Government, unless it can get an assurance that we will get specific confirmation or denial, should refuse entry to these ships. It is a natural consequence of a government's responsibility to have a concern for the safety of its citizens. We believe we should press the other governments which wish to have their ships visit our ports to give us individual assurances that tactical nuclear weapons&mdash;and other nuclear weapons for that matter&mdash;have been removed from those ships. Our concern also extends to nuclear-powered ships because accidents have not been confined to nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter briefly states a range of measures which have been taken to reduce the adverse effects of an accident, should it happen, and these are welcome. The Australian Democrats continue to believe that it is the responsibility of government to exclude that risk as far as the Australian people are concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is the culmination of over 12 months work by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. That Committee decided, I think in June or July last year, to undertake an evaluation of the Authority despite the fact that the previous Committee had suggested that that evaluation not take place for a further 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last 12 to 14 months, the Committee has taken a wide range of evidence from a wide range of people, including members of the police force, some of whom have worked in the Authority and some of whom have not; journalists from the Authority; civil liberties groups; and academics interested in this matter. The Committee wishes to express its gratitude to those people who did bother to put in submissions and make evidence available to the Committee. The Committee met on a number of occasions in a variety of States to take this evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is unusual in that it deals with the Authority both when it was facing a difficult time and as it is now&mdash;a much calmer and steadier ship under the chairmanship of Justice Phillips. Justice Phillips is now going to leave the Authority and take up a position as Chief Justice of Victoria. I am sure that all coalition members very warmly congratulate him on having achieved that status in life where he will be undertaking the task that he has in some way been aspiring to over a period of time. It begs the question: who is going to take over the Authority?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This evaluation shows among a number of things that, in terms of efficiency, the Authority is very much a function of whoever happens to be chairman at the time. When Justice Stewart was Chairman, the Authority had one particular flavour or perception in the public arena. Then Mr Farris took over the chairmanship and the Authority had a different public perception altogether. Julian Leckie, currently a member of the Authority, had an interim chairmanship before Justice Phillips was appointed. This evaluation deals with the Authority across that time span and highlights how much it is a function of who happens to be the chairman. That, of course, begs the question: will the Government this time make as good an appointment as it did last time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would like to be able to say that, yes, of course it will. I very much hope that it does. I do not want at this time to go back into past appointments other than to say that it is abundantly clear to everyone who has come anywhere near the Authority that not all of its past appointments have been anywhere near up to scratch. One in particular caused some very serious problems in my State and in Senator Bolkus's State. There were very serious problems in the South Australian office of the National Crime Authority. Those problems were by and large the biggest problems that the Authority has had to face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says that those problems were largely a function of this Government not listening to what it had been told and having a complete changeover in Authority membership all at the one time. The Chairman left and the two members of the Authority left on 30 June, and on 1 July a new Chairman and new members took the helm. To an extent that sudden changeover did play a role in those problems. So I think the Committee is right to draw attention to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that was not the beginning and the end of the matter. There were other causes for the problems in the Adelaide office. Not all of those causes have been addressed in this evaluation report by the majority members of the Committee. The dissenting report put in by the minority members, the coalition members, raises some of the issues which, as far as the coalition members are concerned, the majority has steadfastly refused to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago, last year, the majority of the Committee put out a report on Operation Ark. That was an operation to investigate the manner in which the police have investigated themselves. Due to a police operation common to a number of States called Operation Noah, a number of members of the police force had been dobbed in, if you like, by members of the public as having some hand in drug dealings in the community. There was no certainty that those investigations had been properly carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was so much concern as to the conduct of those investigations by the police force into themselves that the Authority took on an operation, called Operation Ark, to investigate whether the police had investigated themselves properly.

A letter of transmittal to the South Australian Government was signed by Justice Stewart with the expectation that that report would be delivered to the South Australian Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 contains some minor Budget measures and technical changes, most of which have a very minor financial impact. The first relates to the indexation of pensioners' earnings credits. At the moment it is possible for pensioners to earn up to $42 a week indexed before they start to reach the taxation threshold. This Bill allows for a degree of averaging of earnings so that pensioners are not unfairly disadvantaged by the pension income test if their earnings fluctuate. The scheme therefore encourages pensioners to earn amounts in addition to their pension. It is desirable that those limits be indexed from 2 July next year, and we therefore support that measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second initiative relates to rent assistance. Currently, the maximum break in Jobsearch allowance and Newstart allowance entitlements before an individual is required to serve another waiting period for rent assistance is four weeks. For JSA recipients that will be increased to six weeks and for Newstart recipients to 13 weeks. Again, we think that is an important change which will accommodate those who quite often undertake irregular work in rural areas, such as itinerant casual labourers. It is desirable that they should not have to get back into the queue and wait simply because they have undertaken what was always going to be a short term period of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third change relates to a new limit on the amounts payable for new grants of income support to partnered persons. For claims granted after 12 March 1992, the maximum pension or benefit entitlement of a member of a couple living with a partner not receiving a social security pension, benefit or similar payment or who is receiving Abstudy will be the married rate of pension or half the married rate of benefit. Again, that change will not make any significant difference in terms of the current financial year because it operates only in the last quarter, but it will involve savings of the order of $11.29m over a full year. That is a streamlining of the system so that it will be possible at least to ensure that in some areas half the married rate is the appropriate level of payment. The proposal is necessary because currently some pensioners and beneficiaries have been able to claim more income support than is paid to each of the couple who are both receiving social security payments. We therefore support that initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth initiative is in relation to the Aboriginal employment incentive scheme. Under this change, persons receiving payments will have the equivalent amount deducted from the amount of social security income support they receive. In the interests of targeting welfare to those most in need, this is a desirable initiative and should be supported. It has a negligible financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth initiative relates to the international social security agreements with the United Kingdom, Ireland and Portugal. The Bill inserts into the Social Security Act 1991 the agreements signed with Ireland and Portugal as schedules. This would seem to be one of the meagre returns we get from that infamous sum of $125,000-odd which the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) managed to chalk up in his odysseys overseas over the past 18 months or so. One of those trips was to the west coast of Ireland. We will really never know why. Certainly, there seems to be no good reason why the discussions could not have been held in Dublin. Nonetheless, Brian Burke and a few others thought that Galway would probably be a more attractive place to spend the night. As a result, we had extravagance on a grand scale. Senator Richardson would claim that the signing of the agreement is the benefit that flowed in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old reciprocal agreements between the United Kingdom and Australia are to be revived, given that in another respect that trip was spectacularly unsuccessful. The Government, despite much talk on the subject, failed to negotiate a new agreement with the United Kingdom which would ensure that Australia did not have to bear the brunt of topping up pensions. The UK has remained intransigent on this issue and has not agreed to the terms asked by Australia, in particular in relation to the indexation of pensions paid by the United Kingdom Government to its former citizens resident in Australia. The agreements do tend to limit the flexibility of our policies in relation to what can be paid to migrants once they have arrived, but in principle at least they are normally intended to result in net savings. In this instance the financial impact is estimated to be negligible, and on that basis we support the signing of those agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next change relates to an amendment to the data-matching program so that the date of birth of a living spouse will become one of the details that can be used in the data-matching process. It is an identifier that should have been in the legislation when the data-matching provisions were introduced last year. This would seem to be merely an amendment to rectify that oversight. Quite clearly, the date of birth of a living spouse is one of those unique characteristics that only a very limited number of people would be aware of in relation to themselves. Therefore it would seem to be a quite useful check in the system, and we would support that change as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That covers the ambit of the original Bill. There are now some amendments of substance which the Government is moving in relation to extending the Jobsearch allowance and the Newstart allowance to farmers. I will have something to say in the committee stage about the form of the amendments and, indeed, I will move several amendments on behalf of the Opposition at that time. In general principle, we support the desirability of recognising that there are farmers who are not able to earn a living from farming activities at the present time, who are viable in the longer term but need a degree of income support to tide them over. Currently, it is necessary for them to be looking actively for work away from the farm. That can serve as an almost automatic disqualification for most farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These new provisions will at least introduce hardship provisions quite similar to those applicable to the family allowance and family allowance supplement, which we dealt with in the preceding social security Bill. We are in general sympathy with the thrust of the Government's amendments, but we think there is a need for several refinements in order to ensure that the same matters are taken into account in assessing hardship as operate now in relation to the family allowance and family allowance supplement. I will provide more detail in due course and, in particular, outline the approach we would take in government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 contains a number of important measures affecting the social security portfolio and a series of Government amendments&mdash;which we have seen only fairly recently and which have not been through the House of Representatives&mdash;which give effect to the Government's recently announced rural hardship package for farmers, ostensibly to enable farming families greater access to income support under the social security system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have major problems with two areas of the legislation. These are the proposed treatment of compensation payments to sole parents and the inadequacy of the rural hardship package. I will deal with those two areas later. Firstly, however, there are a number of other measures in this Bill which are generally positive&mdash;they are certainly quite significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the indexation of the earnings credit limit for pensioners. Basically, the earnings credit scheme allows full rate pensioners to accrue their weekly income test free limits up to $1,000 in a year in order that they offset the accrued amount against earnings that would otherwise reduce their pensions under the income test. Once the limit is reached, the normal income test provisions apply. This provision for earnings credit has certainly proved a very effective tool in encouraging some pensioners to take up part time and casual work, and the Democrats welcome this move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this Bill there are also some changes to rent assistance waiting periods. I would argue that these are long overdue. Previously, where Jobsearch allowance and Newstart beneficiaries were receiving rent assistance and then ceased to be entitled to JSA or Newstart for four weeks, they had to wait 26 weeks to requalify for rent assistance. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), which passed through here a few weeks ago, reduced that 26 week wait to 18 weeks. This Bill now extends the permissible break in income entitlements to six weeks for JSA and 13 weeks for Newstart recipients as from 1 March next year. This also means that, where a person is not entitled to benefits for no more than these periods, he or she will be able to count the weeks already served while receiving the benefit towards the 18-week waiting period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I came into the Senate, I have consistently called for, and moved amendments to give effect to, reductions in social security waiting periods. It is quite clear that waiting periods cause considerable and unnecessary hardship and that the sole rationale behind them seems to be to cut costs rather than to address in any way the suffering that they cause. They certainly do nothing to relieve the problems of those people who are forced, through no fault of their own, to rely on government income support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition seems determined to see these reductions as some sort of subsidy to the private rental market&mdash;I am relying on some comments about previous legislation. I have some difficulty reconciling this view with the Opposition's desire to reduce the public housing sector. Where exactly do those opposite think low income earners will live? As we see from the number of people on our streets, there is not enough public housing to go around. We can also look to the long waiting lists in every State for evidence of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data collected by the national housing strategy clearly pinpoints the enormous stresses that housing costs place on many lower income families, particularly in times of recession when the breadwinners are unemployed. The strategy's data indicates that about 10 per cent of all households in this country are suffering very severe housing related stress and that many people are paying up to 50 per cent and more of their income in rent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current situation for private renters is that housing is often extremely expensive, especially in the inner urban areas of our large cities where it is frequently of poor quality, and the ability to access affordable private rental housing often forces people out to the extremities, out to areas where their employment prospects may be reduced or where there may be less infrastructure to support the needs of families, particularly young families. That does not make much sense in economic or labour market terms and improved access to rent assistance is one, admittedly limited, way of making some inroads into this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also makes changes to the pharmaceutical allowance. This allowance was introduced to offset the charge for pharmaceuticals for people who had previously had their prescriptions filled free under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In response to concerns about how the charge could affect chronically ill persons, the Government agreed that advances of the allowance could be claimed in certain circumstances and people were subject to a liquid assets test. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill extends the period in which advance payments are payable to 31 December 1993, removes the assets test, and aligns indexation of the allowance with other legislation. We welcome these moves and I want to remind the Senate that, at the time the prescription charge was introduced last year, the Australian Democrats stated that we felt the eligibility criteria for advance payments were far too narrow. I moved amendments in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs to relax them. These amendments were defeated then, so I am now somewhat gratified to see the liquid assets test dumped altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it remains the case that, in order to qualify for an advance payment, a person must still not have an ordinary income in excess of $20 per fortnight. These income levels are most ungenerous and they operate to ensure that only the poorest of the poor pensioners&mdash;and legislation which will be put through here later tonight will include veterans as well&mdash;have access to advance payments for the allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go over this ground in great detail now, but I want to make it clear that we really do not yet know the full impact of the prescription charge. We simply do not have the evidence to say with authority that there has been any effect on pensioners' consumption patterns, doctors' prescribing habits or, indeed, the health of pensioners. In fact, anecdotal evidence from pensioner organisations indicates that the limited income test for receiving advance payments may be disadvantaging those pensioners who have been unable to afford the $10 or $12 to fill multi-scripts and who are deciding, upon their own initiative, which two or three medications they will not bother having the script filled for&mdash;in other words, they put it off until the next pension cheque arrives. We do not plan to move any amendments to these provisions tonight, but I ask the Minister to give consideration to raising the limits of the income test for advance payments of the allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a provision in this Bill to bring the maximum penalties under the Social Security Act into line with the same level of penalties for fraud under the Crimes Act. This means that the maximum imprisonment period for social security fraud will increase from six months to two years. Essentially, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has been prosecuting social security fraud under the Crimes Act because of the higher penalties in that Act. However, I understand that a recent South Australian case has held that the self-incrimination provisions of the Crimes Act prevent DSS review forms being used as evidence by the prosecution. So it seems that DSS wants it both ways: it will push for the higher penalties available under the Crimes Act, but it does not want to be subject to the same rules against self-incrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, we do not intend to move any amendments, as I accept the Government's point that fraud in these instances should be viewed very seriously. However, I wish to make the point that, regardless of which Act is used, there remain serious sentencing discrepancies between people who are convicted of taxation fraud and those who are convicted of social security fraud. Earlier this year we saw some remarkable sentencing discrepancies in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accept these changes, but I ask the Minister to monitor closely the sentences being handed out for social security fraud and, in particular, the prosecution practices of the DPP in relation to taxation and social security fraud. The Government should be very strongly committed to ensuring that both types of fraud are pursued with equal vigour and that we do not encourage the totally unacceptable double standard that somehow social security fraud is worse than taxation fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes cuts in income support to certain couples. This is a major concern. At present, where only one member of a couple receives income support, the maximum rate that that person can receive is the same as for a single person. From 1 March 1992 the maximum rate the person can receive will be reduced to half the married rate of benefit. This reduction will also apply to rates of pharmaceutical allowance and remote area allowance payable to a member of a couple with a non-pensioner/beneficiary partner. It will not apply to existing pensioners and beneficiaries as at 11 March 1991 and it will apply only to a person who is actually living with his or her non-pensioner/beneficiary partner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government argues that there is no justification for paying the higher rate to a person simply because his or her partner does not receive any income. Certainly there are some instances where this would be true. However, there are a number of circumstances where this move will cause undue hardship. I refer to those cases where the person's partner is not actually receiving any income at all from any source. Welfare groups have provided me with examples of where this could easily occur&mdash;such as where the partner does not have permanent resident status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a strong argument for targeting this proposal in a much better fashion to avoid reducing the income to those families who are already living off a single benefit. It really does not make much sense to foist even greater hardship on couples and indeed families in these circumstances. I understand that the Minister is prepared to take a closer look at this issue, and I will be following this up in Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other provisions in the Bill cover technical amendments incorporating recent changes to the Act&mdash;prepayments, improvements in access to child disability allowance, reciprocal agreements between Australia and Ireland and Australia and Portugal and so on. We have no objection to any of these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the two areas which I mentioned earlier and which are of major concern to the Democrats. First, I turn to the issue of compensation payments to sole parents. Under this Bill persons receiving social security payments who are injured while doing part time or low income work while they are receiving the pension or benefit and who then receive periodic&mdash;usually weekly&mdash;compensation payments will have their compensation treated as ordinary income; that is, the ordinary income test will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a change from the current situation where such payments are reduced dollar for dollar, creating a poverty trap which discourages people from returning to work. This is a step in the right direction. However, sole parent pension is to be included in the list of payments which are still subject to a dollar for dollar deduction when the person receives lump sum or periodic compensation, outside the particular circumstances I mentioned. I cannot see this measure as anything other than cost cutting and one that really overlooks some fundamental legal principles about the relationship between compensation and the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that no similar measure is proposed for age pensions. I think that shows up this move very clearly for what it is. It is targeting a group of people that the Government believes cannot organise any opposition. But it is the disregard for the principle of compensation that concerns me most. There has always been a quite legitimate argument for preventing double dipping&mdash;that is, that a person should not be compensated twice for the same disability or injury. In other words, if a person is receiving, for example, sickness allowance because of an injury and subsequently receives a compensation payment for the same injury, he or she cannot take the benefit of both. That is a well-accepted principle and I have no dispute with it. But sole parent pension is not a payment that is related to a person's incapacity to work. It is a payment that is made to enable a sole parent to care properly for a child or children. Accordingly, as the pension and the compensation are not related, the ordinary income tests should still apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To look at the matter in another way, if a person is working in an ordinary job and receives compensation for, say, a car accident that occurred several years ago, we would not expect them to give up part of his or her salary simply because that person had received a benefit from some other source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now in relation to pensions and benefits an ordinary income test applies. There may be some disagreement about the levels of that test, but essentially an income from another source will affect the rate of pension. Again, nobody has any dispute with that general principle but, if a sole parent receives compensation for an injury, I cannot see why that should not be subject to the same ordinary income test. It is clearly not a case of double dipping, so why should sole parents be penalised dollar for dollar?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal will lead to inconsistencies between sole parent pension recipients, depending upon when they receive their compensation and when they claim the pension. We will be moving a series of amendments which will prevent this measure from proceeding, and I urge Opposition senators to give them serious consideration. There is a principle involved here. We are not talking about a rort or any sort of unfair advantage being given to sole parents. We simply want them to be treated in the same way as are other pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I come to the rural hardship package. First, we welcome at least some acknowledgment by the Government that there really is a problem out there. We welcome the fact that the Government has now recognised that existing income support provisions for farm families are totally inadequate. That acknowledgment backs up what we have been saying in this place now for over well over a year. To expect potentially viable farmers who are in severe financial hardship to have to put their means of earning a living on the market before they become eligible for minimal income support is completely unreasonable. In fact, to expect people to have to make such a major and traumatic decision as to leave a lifetime's work because they have no income with which to buy food is barbaric and heartless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that the current arrangements have been for a long time totally unsatisfactory. However, honourable senators will recall that as recently as two weeks ago the Democrats tried to provide relief for farmers through an amendment to the Social Security Act which would have exempted farmers' tools of trade, that is, their work assets, from the assets tests for all social security pensions and benefits. That amendment did not receive support from either the Government or the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because I consider the hardship package that is before us tonight to be totally inadequate, I will be putting the same amendment again. I urge those people in this chamber with a genuine concern for the future of country families to give it very serious consideration. The Democrats believe that exempting the tools of trade from assets tests for all education and income support payments is the simplest, most equitable and most workable way to remove the discrimination against rural families which is contained in the existing system. Given the record of support so far, I will not hold my breath, but there is always some hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the package that is now before us. What exactly is the Government offering? The aim is to make unemployment benefits&mdash;Jobsearch and Newstart allowances&mdash;available to some farmers. The publicity surrounding the announcement suggested that this was a wonderful and innovative measure, but then when one looked closely at the proposals one gathered that only 2,000 farmers would benefit. I was in northern South Australia and could not understand how it would be possible that only such a small number of farmers could benefit&mdash;having visited an area where probably that number would be eligible almost immediately. Having seen the package, I now understand what is happening. However, having looked at the package, I wonder how it will reach even that number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme will work by enabling a rural adjustment scheme authority to certify under section 26 that a farmer is a `financial hardship farmer' if the person is in severe financial hardship, if commercial credit cannot be obtained to finance continued farm operations on the farm, if part C assistance under RAS is not available, if the farm is likely to be profitable in the long term, and if the person is available for and is willing to do full time paid work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the RAS authority must also be satisfied that under normal circumstances the person and his or her partner contributes a significant amount of his or her labour and capital to the farm and where the farm would normally provide the person's principal source of income. A further impediment, it goes on, to obtaining a certificate is that the farmer must actually apply for assistance under part C of the RAS scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After obtaining this certificate&mdash;those who are able to do so&mdash;the RAS authority can then issue a second certificate under section 27 that an asset of a financial hardship farmer is unrealisable. Basically, the question is whether in the long term the farm is profitable. In other words, the rules are so difficult to get through that we are beginning to understand why on government estimates only 2,000 farmers would make it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assets that can be excluded as certified under section 27 are the farm itself, farm livestock and farm machinery. In addition, unrealisable assets are redefined in section 11 of the legislation to include an asset where a section 27 certificate is in force, and a life insurance policy on the life of a financial hardship farmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Persons who have jumped through all these hoops and climbed over all these hurdles and who have a certificate saying they are financial hardship farmers can then receive Jobsearch or Newstart allowances if they are at least 18 years of age, are Australian residents, are registered with the CES, have satisfied the activity test and, in the case of Newstart, are prepared to enter one of the Newstart agreements. Then, of course, they have to take reasonable steps to comply with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An assets test presently applies on other payments and these new measures enable farmers to have their assets declared unrealisable via the section 27 certification process. Under existing financial hardship rules there is provision to disregard the value of an unrealisable asset in working out the rate of a person's pension or benefit. Presumably, the new definition of an unrealisable asset will enable more farmers to access pensions and benefits via the hardship rules. A decision made by an RAS authority to refuse a section 26 or section 27 certificate is a non-reviewable decision under section 1250. This means that farmers cannot appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal against a decision not to grant them a certificate. They have nowhere to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a sunset clause in the package which cuts off assistance under these provisions in November 1993. There are problems involved with this. For a start, it is absolutely ridiculous that farmers will be forced for apply for RAS part C in order even to get to first base. I remind honourable senators that part C exists to provide household assistance to farm families who are leaving the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from the issue of whether it should be the Government that decides whether or not a farm property is viable, why should farmers have to apply for assistance to leave the land in order to get assistance to stay on the land? It is unfair, it is illogical and it is certainly the wrong way to go about it. It is simply the wrong way round. Surely it makes more sense for farmers to be assessed first and then advised which option is best for them and what exactly their options are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind honourable senators that, once a farmer has applied for and been granted part C assistance, he or she cannot receive a social security benefit. Farmers have three options in these circumstances. If they apply for and get part C assistance, they have to get off the land. If they accept the assistance and later decide they want to stay on the land, they have to pay it back. If they do not want to get off the land because they genuinely believe their farms are viable but the RAS authority disagrees, then they are stuck without any income support whatsoever. It is a woeful range of choices. This is why we argue that it makes far more sense to have the RAS assessment done first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can only speculate about whether the Government's agenda is really about providing income support for farm families or getting as many of them as possible off the land. We will be moving an amendment deleting the requirement that farmers must apply for RAS part C. It should be noted that they still need to be assessed; they simply do not have to go through the nonsense of applying for something that they will not be pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem is that the certificate granted under section 26 will be available for only three months. Why? Obviously, there should be some time limit but three months seems extraordinarily short, especially given the somewhat convoluted process involved in getting a certificate in the first place. We think six months is a far more reasonable and realistic time period and we will be moving an amendment to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also question why there is a two-year sunset clause. We see absolutely no reason why we need to limit this package to a two-year period. Perhaps the Government is expecting a miraculous recovery out there in the bush. There are certainly no indications from everything I have read that that will happen, unfortunately, as much as we would like it to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, why is the decision of an RAS authority to refuse to issue a certificate not reviewable by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal? It is clear from this package that the RAS authorities are being given an enormous amount of power in assessing the range of factors. Many of these factors are entirely subjective or rely upon an assessment of facts that may very well be disputed very strongly by the farmer and the farm family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, what is severe financial hardship? What does `commercial credit' mean? Is it a loan offered at current market rates or within 3 per cent of market rates or 4 per cent of market rates? Does it include taking out a second mortgage or a stock mortgage? Does it mean that one can still get one's groceries on credit or does the local store have to have cut one off altogether?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are judgments that should be reviewable if only because they take away some of the tin god power from RAS authorities. They should be reviewable within the framework of the Social Security Act not via some cosy administrative arrangement set up by the same body that is making the decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal of independent review of bureaucratic decisions is an important one. Unfortunately, it is not a principle for which this Government has shown the greatest amount of respect. I urge Opposition senators to ensure that farmers have access to independent review. We are glad that the Government is doing something. It is better than nothing&mdash;only marginally, but at least it is better. Difficult and flawed as it is, it is a slight improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still believe that the approach that we have been pushing for some time is a better way of assisting farmers. I can only say this one more time to Liberal and National Party senators: if they are serious about getting real help for this country's farmers, they should support the Democrats' amendments which will have the effect of totally exempting farm assets from the assets test on social security pensions and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of those honourable senators who have not listened to this debate before, this does not mean that all farmers are exempt from everything. It means that farmers are being placed on a level playing field with all other Australians when it comes to dealing with the social security system. They will be dealing with a social security system on the basis of need. The income test will still apply, as will every other assets test. All we are exempting is the work related assets. For the last time, I urge Opposition senators to give this their support. It is simple, it is equitable and it is certainly a far more workable way of assisting all farmers in need than is this Government package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 where it refers to the rural adjustment package for farming families. Among other things, the Bill introduces a Jobsearch allowance for farmers. While I appreciate what the Government is doing with this Jobsearch allowance, I suggest that it would be more beneficial to farmers if it were a family allowance support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 29 October the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) issued a press release which said that the provisions will target farmers who fall between RAS part B, carry on assistance, and part C, which is re-establishment assistance&mdash;those who have prospects of longer term profitability but cannot carry extra debt even with interest subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That indicates to me that the farmers that this legislation is aiming at are viable farmers, yet the Bill introduces Jobsearch which, in effect, means that the farmers have to go out and search for jobs. If a farmer is viable and is going to stay on the land he will have to produce a crop for next year. If it rains, and if there is a market for his commodity, hopefully he will get back into a profitable situation, or he will have to look after his animals or his stock. But if he is forced to look for a job sometimes up to 150 kilometres away, by definition&mdash;and I hope the Minister is listening to this&mdash;he will not be viable because he will not be there to produce a crop or maintain his equipment and look after his animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions are made when assets exceed the assets test of $157,000 but meet hardship provisions. The hardship provisions are defined as liquid assets of less than $10,000 and yearly income of less than $13,708, plus $624 per child. The Government has put a two-year hardship clause on the provisions. A statement put out by ABARE on 20 November said that broadacre farms are expected to record an average farm business loss of around $30,000, yet this package targets 2,000 farmers. I do not know where the other 40,000 farmers who are going to be in need of this assistance are going to look, but there will certainly be more than 2,000 farmers. In Queensland alone I believe there are 10,000 grain farmers who need assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a time of high interest rates and very low commodity prices. On top of all that, we have had a drought. Our farmers are in an almost diabolical situation. I do not know how to paint a picture of what is happening out in the bush. Usually the farmers who are in danger are those at the lower end, the beginners, those who have just been given a farm by their family or gone through a drought or a death. The scale has now moved up to where probably 50 per cent of farmers are in danger. If the drought does not break or commodity prices do not rise, the scale will go even higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolutely desperate situation out there. One would have to experience it to understand what is happening. There are suicides and family break-ups. People are so desperate that they are becoming introverted. They are not game to go down the street. They do not have the petrol to go out. They are looking to decide what they can put in the grocery trolley. I find myself inadequate to describe the desperation in the rural sector at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has to be considered the backbone of the nation. We are going through times of desperation. If we do not look after these family farms, if we do not support them in the short term, we will not have any export income in the long term. That is going to hurt Australia now and far into the future. We have to stand behind the farmers now. While I appreciate this package that the Government has provided&mdash;this additional $20m to support 2,000 farmers&mdash;it is really like putting farmers on a drip and keeping them there, just surviving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I appreciate this package, and I certainly do. Any assistance should be appreciated. However, in 1983 there was a drought right across Australia&mdash;commodity prices were reasonable but there was a terrible drought&mdash;and the Government of the day put in $340m. In today's terms, that would probably be equivalent to $500m or $600m. The benefit of that assistance was that when the drought broke farmers had stock and equipment and they could get right back on the job. This Government has made some provision for assistance, and tonight I will not attack the Government about the adequacy of what it has provided. This is not a situation in which to score political points; it is time for the Senate to go through the amendments to see which ones can be carried and what provisions can be made for the thousands of farmers who are in terrible trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package that is offered here has to be looked at in the context that it is part of a rural adjustment scheme. Part A of that rural adjustment scheme is an interest subsidy for farmers for commercial loans or term loans. Assistance is up to 50 per cent of the annual interest. The limit of borrowings is $400,000. At a current rate of approximately 16 per cent per annum, on borrowings of $400,000 that is equivalent to 8 per cent interest subsidy. Assistance is for up to seven years, subject to annual review, when the subsidy may be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part B is for carry-on or yearly working expenses. Assistance is up to 50 per cent of the annual interest rate. The limit on borrowings is around $100,000, at a current rate of 16 per cent per annum. There is maximum assistance of 8 per cent of $100,000, or about $8,000 a year, in interest subsidy. The assistance is reviewed annually and also includes drought aid. It comes down to a flat rate of 6 per cent for between two years and seven years. There is a maximum advance of $100,000 and it is to be used on restocking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part C is for people who have decided that they cannot stay on their farms any longer and it gives household support until they sell the farm. The farm must be listed. It is there to alleviate the personal hardship of farmers prior to adjusting out of farming. The payments are in line with unemployment benefits and are paid quarterly in advance. Those are the people to whom the Government is paying household support. It is ironic that the Government is paying household support to those people who have been declared non-viable when it is putting Jobsearch on farmers who are viable. I hope the Minister can see the inconsistency there. They also receive unemployment benefits. Married couples receive $503 per fortnight, plus $53 for each child under 13 and $77 for children aged between 13 and 16. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package we are discussing tonight fits between part B and part C, which is for those people who have made the decision, or had it made for them, that they are no longer viable. Those people also get assistance of up to $34,000 to re-establish themselves in a home in the city. If they have received household support since July 1990, or for longer than six months, the amount of assistance provided in excess of six months shall be deducted from the amount of the re-establishment advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>we are discussing is access to the social security benefit for people who fit between part B and part C. These people have been subjected to a work test under this legislation, and the shadow Minister responsible for social security, Senator Richard Alston, will be moving an amendment to take care of this inconsistency. The Australian Democrats have not seen that amendment&mdash;it is being prepared at the moment&mdash;but I am confident that Senator Lees, with her consistent attitude towards these problems, will support that amendment when it is shown to her. I believe that there has been discussion with Senator Richardson, who is not in the chamber at the moment but I hope will be here when the Bill goes through the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of questions have to be asked and put on the record. Will these payments be retrospective to December 1991?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, 974 farmers claimed some form of assistance in October. That is choking the Department that administers the rural adjustment scheme. We were told today that it is taking up to three months in Western Australia for a claim to be processed.

As there is a three-month wait in Western Australia and 974 claims made in October in Queensland, one would have to concede that there is tremendous pressure on these departments that are trying to process these claims and get farmers some sort of assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Senator Lees and I have mentioned that there is only enough money at the moment to cover 2,000 people. I estimate that there are 40,000 people in need of some form of rural adjustment. Certainly, there will be if the drought does not break or if it extends further. If people are not receiving sufficient money, it is probably because commodities are being subsidised, forcing the price of commodities down in Australia to under the cost of production, as was the case last year with wheat. Farmers received in their pocket something like $70 a tonne for their wheat, yet their actual cost of production would have been around $130 to $140 a tonne. The more wheat they grew, the quicker they went into receivership. This year, many of them decided that they would not grow wheat because they could not afford to sustain another loss. I think it costs something like $65 an acre to actually produce a crop. A conservative farm would grow around 15,000 acres of wheat, the cost for which would be in the vicinity of $50,000. This raises another point which Senator Alston has taken into consideration. Under this legislation, for every $250 that a farmer has, he loses $1 in returns from the benefits that he receives. If these farmers are deemed to be viable, they must have adequate funds to plant a crop, shear their sheep and fill their diesel tanks. We are talking now about farmers who have been declared viable under the rural adjustment scheme. Under the legislation that the Government proposes, for every $10,000 in cash that a farmer has, he loses $40; in today's terms, $10,000 is almost insignificant. I have said already that it costs a farmer who plants 15,000 acres of wheat at, say, $65 an acre around $50,000 to $60,000. If the farmer has $60,000 with which to plant his crop, he will almost inevitably lose the total assistance package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston, on behalf of the Opposition, will move an amendment that will disregard the assets for the purpose of this section, such as other essential and usual expenditure incurred in the operation of the farm. It is absolutely essential that that amendment be carried. If it were not to be carried in the Senate&mdash;I am confident that it will because I believe Senator Lees and her colleagues will support it; it will have the support of every person on this side of the House&mdash;the farmers we are trying to assist will be wiped out. We would find that very few viable farmers who rely on this part of the rural adjustment scheme which fits between C and B would get any assistance at all. They would then be forced to go into part C, which is for farmers who have been declared non-viable, and to move off the farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to know whether the Government is prepared to give a total commitment to the family farm. It is essential that we make a decision as to whether we want the family farm to exist. We cannot dole out little bits of $20m. A total commitment from the Government has to be forthcoming. I urge the Government to make this commitment. I know that it has many other commitments that it has to meet and face with unemployment and various other things. But unless the Government and, for that matter, all people in both Houses of Parliament get firmly behind the family farm, we will destroy a viable institution that has provided this country with wealth, prosperity and jobs for the last 100 years. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of amendment, this Bill also includes the social security related special assistance provisions for farmers in severe financial hardship that were announced by the Government in its special package for farmers. I would like to concentrate on the provisions in this Bill which emanate from the 1991 Budget, as my colleagues have dealt with the special amendments to the Social Security Act that are proposed specifically to deal with the rural crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, this Bill provides that a person who temporarily ceases receiving either the Jobsearch allowance or the Newstart allowance will be able to count their most recent previous period on these benefits for rental assistance waiting period purposes. The maximum amount of time that a person may cease receiving these benefits to be eligible for this provision is six weeks for the Jobsearch allowance and 13 weeks for Newstart allowees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, this Budget announcement will mean that people previously receiving rental assistance who undertake temporary work for no longer than these specified periods will continue to receive rental assistance if they are forced back onto the benefit. The coalition supports this worthwhile initiative which will alleviate one of the disincentives for unemployed people taking up temporary or seasonal work opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this Bill provides that the earnings credit limit for maximum rate pensioners, which currently stands at $1,000 per year for singles and $2,000 per year for married couples, will be indexed with inflation to maintain its real value from the first pension payday in July 1992. This earnings credit acts as an incentive for pensioners to maintain some degree of self-sufficiency and, as such, it is only right and sensible that it be indexed according to the CPI. Hence the coalition supports this initiative. However, in light of the considerable concerns being expressed by pensioners about the relevance of the CPI to their spending patterns, I would appreciate it if the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) could provide the Senate with an update of the analysis currently being undertaken by his Department in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further initiative which the coalition supports on the grounds of equity and fairness is the decision to restrict the level of benefit paid to a married new beneficiary after 11 March 1992 to half the married rate if the person-spouse with whom that person is living is not receiving a benefit. This will also apply to the rate of pharmaceutical allowance paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the financial advantage in terms of paying for life's necessities that people enjoy in situations of nuptial or de facto cohabitation, it is inequitable for a beneficiary with a working spouse to receive the single rate of benefit. For many years our social security system has recognised the existence of this comparative financial advantage, and married couples have been paid a married rate of benefit. This initiative will merely extend a long accepted precedent to couples where the partner is not receiving a benefit. The coalition believes that this proposal is necessary as some beneficiaries and pensioners have been able to claim more income support than is paid when each member of a couple is receiving social security payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read a Government paper outlining the initiatives contained in the 1991 Budget which would affect the social security portfolio, I was shocked to find that the Social Security Act would need amending to ensure that prepaid benefits which are paid to a person who is not entitled to them can be treated as a debt owing to the Commonwealth. I immediately thought, `Surely we are locking the door long after the horse has bolted?'. After all, the Department of Social Security has for many years been paying prepaid benefits and pensions when a public holiday falls on DSS payday. A very large amount of money is paid out in prepaid benefits every Easter and Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister: does this mean that, until this amendment comes into force on 1 December 1991, there is no legislative basis for the Department of Social Security raising overpayments resulting from the payment of prepaid benefits? I believe that the Minister should inform the Senate whether his Department has been collecting all such overpayments, as well as the amount of money that has been forgone as a result of lack of legislative backing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar case of locking the door after the horse has bolted is the Government's belated decision to deduct the amount of benefits received under the Aboriginal employment incentive scheme from social security income. Like so many other examples, this is a classic case of a total lack of coordination between government agencies and, in particular, between Social Security and DEET. Thankfully, the coalition will alleviate this mountain of inefficiency and faulty communication by merging the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schedule to this Bill contains two new social security agreements with Ireland and Portugal which were signed earlier this year. The old agreement with the United Kingdom has also been reinserted in this Bill as the anticipated new agreement still has not been reached and is now not expected to commence before 1 July 1992. I remind the Senate that the Government's failure to reach such agreements is at the taxpayers' expense. For example, it is estimated that over $1 1/2m of anticipated savings will be forgone if the United Kingdom agreement commences only on 1 July 1992. I believe that the Minister should inform the Senate as to the reasons for this delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also call on the Minister to inform the Senate as to the current state of affairs in relation to the negotiation of the reciprocal arrangement with Greece. I would like the Minister to confirm or deny whether negotiations are effectively stalled. Does the Minister agree with the reported claims of a Greek Government official that Australia is delaying these negotiations because it fears that such an agreement would add to our welfare bill? I find it difficult to believe such a claim and I eagerly await the Minister's answer to my questions about the annual cost to Australian taxpayers of the lack of a reciprocal arrangement with Greece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also includes two essentially minor amendments to the data-matching legislation that will allow the matching agency to include the date of birth of a living spouse as a data item and will clarify the legislative effect of a breach of the data-matching guidelines. I find neither of these amendments particularly objectionable, but this Bill does give me the opportunity to expose what I consider to be the most rubbery figures that have accompanied any legislation since the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate on the Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill one year ago, the Government claimed that data matching would result in savings of $65m in 1991 and $290m in the first full year of operation in 1991-92. The Government based these claims on an assumption that there is a one to 2 per cent residual of total clients who are rorting the system, that this residual was not being identified using current monitoring procedures, and that they would all&mdash;I emphasise the word `all'&mdash;be picked up by data matching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These assumptions were based solely on an unrepresentative sample of 10,000 family allowance recipients. During the committee stage of that Bill, we questioned the Department over and over about the adequacy of that 2 per cent and how it came to that figure. We got the idea that it was a guesstimate rather than any really firm figure. Our concerns about that have been confirmed. The $290m in annual savings would be derived from a combination of identity matching, income matching and double payment matching, although the Government refused to provide a breakdown of the savings derived from each of these three matching types. The savings derived from the compulsory provision of tax file numbers were quite rightly excluded from the estimates for the data-matching legislation because these savings had already been costed into the earlier legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember the reaction when the Opposition proposed to amend this legislation to tighten the circumstances in which Government agencies could investigate apparent discrepancies in either a person's income or identity. When the Opposition decided to replace the word `suggest' with the word `indicate' in the relevant clause of the legislation, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) saw fit to write to the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, claiming that such an amendment would threaten the Budget strategy and would result in loss of `at least $100m and possibly as high as $150m in a full year'. That is what the Prime Minister wrote to Dr Hewson: if we changed that word, there would be a loss of at least $100m and possibly as much as $150m in a full year. It was an hysterical reaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in the same letter, the Prime Minister claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments pose a threat to the Budget strategy and are completely at odds with the Opposition's call for increased savings. The Government will not accept amendments simply to achieve some of the savings announced in the Budget. I believe that the Opposition's amendments would make the Bill unworkable by significantly reducing savings and adding to administrative costs.</PARA>
<PARA>Concerned about the complete lack of a factual basis for the savings projected by the Department of Finance, the Opposition ensured that the matching source agencies would have to report the first six months operation of the data-matching legislation to the Parliament. These reports, which were tabled in the Senate earlier this month, cast very grave doubts on the savings estimates put forward by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government in its 1990 estimates claimed that 113,000 Department of Social Security clients would have their benefits or pensions either cancelled or decreased during 1990-91. This would result in estimated gross savings of $65m. In fact, the number of payment-matching cases identified by the Department of Social Security as requiring examination up to October 1991 was only 22,779. We know that there was a delay in the start-up date, but given a comparable period&mdash;in fact, it is a little conservative because there was a little more time&mdash;instead of 113,000 clients, we find that there were 22,779 clients. This resulted in savings of $12.7m. In terms of both the number of matches identified and the amount of savings derived, the actual result was a mere 20 per cent of the estimate for 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had this hysterical reaction from the Prime Minister that if we changed the word, we would be losing $100m to $150m. Another $4m was identified in previous overpayments. These cannot be included in any comparison with the original estimates because such overpayments were excluded from them. The Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services and the Australian Taxation Office were not able to identify any savings during 1990-91, while the savings identified by Department of Employment, Education and Training were less than $1m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair, it might be possible to mount an argument&mdash;and I am sure that the Minister will attempt to mount such an argument&mdash;claiming that there have been teething problems with implementation of the data-matching legislation and that in the first full year of operation the estimated savings will be realised. It needs to be pointed out that the Department of Social Security has not yet collected the tax file numbers of the remaining pensioner population. No income matching has been successfully achieved because of computer problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are two of the possible reasons for the massive shortfall in revenue from the first six months operation of the data-matching legislation. They are possible explanations for the fact that to this point over $50m of the estimated $65m in estimated savings has not been realised. Of the $65m that the Government estimated would be saved from the data-matching program, $50m has not been achieved. Yet the people on the other side came into this chamber and said, `We need to infringe people's rights even further, to have a tax file number, because we will make these massive savings'. Those savings have not been demonstrated in this first six months and I doubt whether they will be evidenced in the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the corollary is not necessarily true. In its six-month data-matching report the Department of Social Security claims that the estimated savings for a full year will be $115m. This represents a massive shortfall of $175m from the original estimate. Not only have we not achieved the savings in the first period but we now also have an adjustment. We will now have $115m in a full year; that is, a $175m shortfall from the original estimate. It should also not be forgotten that this latest full year estimate quite mischievously includes the savings that are derived from people voluntarily going off a benefit when they are invited or asked to provide a tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This additional item was quite rightly excluded from the original $290m estimate because it had been included in the costings for the earlier tax file number legislation. While this voluntary cessation element is discounted, the gaping hole is even larger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also needs to be brought to the Senate's attention that in this latest report the Department of Social Security has readjusted its matching success rate for sole parents and family allowance recipients downwards from 2 per cent to 0.8 per cent and for pensioners downwards from 1 per cent to 0.6 per cent. This is the 2 per cent that the officers who sat in the Committee said was an estimate, a correct estimate, a good estimate, of the Department's matching success rate. Now what are they saying? They are saying that we will only get 0.8 per cent of sole parents and only 0.6 per cent of pensioners. I would be interested to know how that will affect the costings and the predicted savings that we were to make at the expense of having everyone provide a tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We currently have a costing situation where the percentage success rate has been virtually halved. Erroneous costing items have been introduced and there have been massive teething problems during the first six months of operation. This is on top of a set of original costings that were both rubbery and unsubstantiated. What is the Department's reaction to the savings that are not what the officers said they would be when they were putting forward the idea of a tax file number? In one sentence in the data-matching report, the Department says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taking the above aspects into account, the results so far suggest that actual savings when the Program is fully implemented will be close to the savings estimated to be available from the initiative on an annual basis. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Senate has every right to be concerned about the complete lack of evidence to support the accuracy of the original costings. Less than a year ago, the Prime Minister was writing to the Leader of the Opposition claiming that the proposed amendment to the data-matching legislation would put the whole Budget strategy at risk; the wheels were going to fall off totally. At the same time officers of the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Security were claiming that estimates were conservative and that the figures assumed that data-matching would pick up 100 per cent of the residual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we find there is hardly a skerrick of information to indicate that the estimated benefits will be derived either this financial year or next financial year. In effect, the Prime Minister's claim of a year ago seems to have come back to haunt him. In his response to the speeches made in the second reading stage, I call on the Minister to provide an explanation of the latest estimates of the savings that will be derived from data-matching during the next two financial years. I also ask him to give very serious thought to calling for a full and comprehensive revision of these estimates, the results of which he should table in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that instead of spending the taxpayers' money on hours and hours of work in looking at the package that we have put forward, he might address the issues facing him, the errors in his predictions and the estimates that have proved to be so wrong. I suppose that one could refer to the Sermon on the Mount: it is appropriate that while he is beholding the mote in his brother's eye, he ought to be considering the beam in his own eye. In this case, the beam is the gross inaccuracies of those predictions which have been demonstrated in this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall eventually get to Senator Patterson's speech, but I think I should first go through the more important aspects of this evening's debate. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) has been brought on to enable the Government to fulfil the announcement it made a couple of weeks ago that the special assistance plan for farmers could be presented by December. That is why it is being debated at this hour of the night. However, in doing so, I think it is my duty to place on record to the Senate that the Government has considered this special assistance package very carefully over quite a period of time and cannot accept some of the proposed amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all honourable senators should understand that if some of those amendments which we will cover tonight are passed, they will be rejected in the House of Representatives and the package will not be ready for a couple of thousand farmers who want it to be available on Monday. I would like to make sure that they do have it on Monday. I hope that during this debate the Opposition and the Australian Democrats might consider that position and perhaps give some ground on it. When one looks at this package, one sees that the Government has given an enormous amount of ground. That is what we have been doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would probably be best if I just went through an explanation of exactly what is occurring. I am not certain that everyone is fully aware of that. The Government has devised this package to try to assist those farmers who cannot benefit from part C of the rural adjustment scheme or the Jobsearch allowance. Obviously quite a few farmers&mdash;I think the number is about 4,000&mdash;are on the JSA. It is not as if no-one in the farming community is benefiting from it now. I think that about 4,000 farmers and their spouses are currently getting that benefit. Part C assistance&mdash;and it should be understood that that is not administered by the Department of Social Security&mdash;is not available to these farmers because their farms are considered to be profitable and viable in the long term. The JSA is not available to farmers because their commitment to work on the farm means that they are not unemployed under the definition that we have thus far adhered to. Even if they were to qualify for a benefit, the rate would be little or nothing because of the benefit's assets test. The Government is of the view that immediate financial assistance should be made available to those farmers who are in severe hardship, who are long term viable but who cannot handle any more debt. Hopefully, that is what today's package will provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAS authority in a State will receive applications from farmers who consider that they fall within the terms of these arrangements. The rural adjustment scheme authority will certify that a farmer qualifies as follows: where he or she or the farmer's spouse normally contributes a significant part of his or her capital and labour to the farm; the farm normally provides the person's principal source of income and the farmer is in severe financial hardship; commercial finance to support the farm is not available; part C assistance is not available; the farm is likely to be profitable in the long term; and the farmer is available for and willing to do full time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of those assessments, with perhaps the exception of the last one, really comes within the ambit of Social Security. That is why I was always concerned in negotiating this package with my colleague, Simon Crean, to make sure that the Department of Social Security was making no judgment about the viability of farmers. My Department is not qualified to make such a judgment. So, we have tried to ensure that this is done only by those who have this specific job to do. Similarly, when one looks at appeals, agricultural economics would be at the top of the list of qualifications for those who sit on Social Security Appeals Tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the RAS authority gives the kind of certificate that suggests a farmer qualifies under all of the conditions that I have just detailed, the farmer can be regarded as unemployed for the purpose of qualifying for Jobsearch allowance. In virtually all other respects, apart from those, the usual rules applicable to a person on JSA will apply to this farmer, even though he or she will not be subjected to a waiting period in respect of liquid assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major aspect of this assistance scheme is the modification of the benefit assets test hardship rules as they relate to farmers who have the kind of certificate about which I have just spoken. The RAS authority will certify which farm assets, including machinery, livestock and the farm itself, are essential to the farmer's long term profitability. These and a farmer's life insurance policies will be regarded as unrealisable assets. They will be ignored for the purposes of the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, in the great bulk of cases they will be regarded as generating no income. So they will not affect the farmer's rate of JSA either. The benefit assets test hardship concessions are generally available only where the value of a person's liquid or readily available assets test is less than $6,000 for a single person and $10,000 for a married couple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In working out those amounts, notice will be taken of amounts held in business accounts as working capital where the funds are required for essential and usual farm operating costs. That concession was given in the rules for the family allowance and the family allowance supplement which we discussed in this chamber a couple of weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Opposition senators and the Australian Democrats in general are suggesting that this rule which applies in the hardship test should also be applied more generally to the assets test. This is one amendment in the category that I mentioned before&mdash;that is, it will not be acceptable to the Government if it is passed in that form in the Senate tonight. This will mean that a couple of thousand farmers who are waiting for this package are going to be delayed at least a month or maybe longer before they receive it. That is something that I want the Opposition to consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government debated this package over many months. In considering whether to make concessions on the definition of `unemployment', it was concerned about the precedents that might be set. The Government is very concerned about the kind of precedent that would be set if we walked totally away from assets testing. Given that at the present time there are more than 700,000 people on JSA and Newstart, if we start to make decisions that will create precedents that we will live to regret, we can undermine what the Government has always considered to be the proper basis of these benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments also provide for the conclusion of a protocol between Primary Industries and Energy and my Department to ensure the smooth running of the scheme. The SSAT will be able to review the farmers Jobsearch allowance rate, and that is fine. It will look at decisions and will be able to reject claims. That is fine. But, obviously, they will not be qualified to look at decisions about long term viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested to me&mdash;and I do not think it ought to be a state secret&mdash;during the course of this second reading debate that we might look at the possibility of extending the appeal mechanism of the AAT rather than the SSAT. I think this is a reasonable suggestion. But greater minds than mine are being applied to it as we speak. While I cannot give honourable senators an answer to that right now, hopefully I will have something further to say on it during the course of the committee stage debate. I hope to be able to say something very soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the comments that have been made about the working capital argument, I think we ought to look at how the hardship provisions will apply. The first hurdle that a person must jump is to demonstrate that funds are required for an essential and usual expenditure in operating a farm. It is at this point that I think the Government is treating working capital properly. But the suggestion that working capital then be included in the normal income and assets test which must then be faced as a second hurdle is where we part company. I think some examples of this may illustrate the Government's concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take the example of a farmer with a dependent spouse and two children under 13 years of age, who has money in a business account and no other assets, apart from the farm, livestock and machinery, and has a negative income&mdash;and most or all of these people will be in that category. The maximum rate of Jobsearch allowance for a family of that kind is $609 a fortnight. But if that family were to have assessable assets&mdash;that is, assets excluding the farm, livestock, machinery and so on&mdash;of $20,000, the JSA rate would be $529 a fortnight. If it were $50,000, the rate would be $409; if it were $75,000, the rate would be $309; if it were $100,000, the rate would be $209; and if it were $125,000, the rate would be $109. In fact, JSA would not cut out until these assets, over and above the farm, the livestock, the machinery and so on hit $152,250. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that the Government faces is that all of the 700,000 or more people who at present are on JSA and Newstart have to be subjected to assets tests. While we are certainly prepared, as is obvious from the Bill that is before the Senate tonight, to make special provisions for farmers, and in my view we have done so, we are not prepared to walk away from the concept of assets testing of farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once one has passed the threshold hardship provision test, all we are saying is one has to be able to be assessed under the assets test with all of the things that I have read out excluded. That is a very generous provision. The precedent that one sets by walking away from any assets testing of farmers is something that the Government cannot and will not accept. So what we have here is, in my view, a pretty fundamental difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representatives of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy are obviously the experts in this matter. It is not my Department; this is a bit of a crossover argument and I am certainly not going to suddenly claim to be an expert on how to run a farm.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>The principle involved in doing away with assets testing in this area is far too dangerous. In any event, where does it place these farmers compared with these other 700,000? Under this arrangement we are already giving the farmers a very special piece of assistance. The idea that we can take it further is something that the Government rejects. I really do hope that during this debate the Opposition might give that some serious consideration. I am not talking here about some major confrontation or some silly political point scoring. We have been working reasonably well on both sides of the chamber on this matter. I would regret greatly a delay of at least a month, possibly more, for a couple of thousand farmers who are, by definition, in severe hardship and in real need. I would much prefer to see assistance going to them straightaway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the things that Senator Lees said will be better addressed in the committee stage of this debate. Senator Boswell asked a couple of questions which require an answer. The first question was: will social security payments be retrospective to 1 December 1991? I would have said a couple of hours ago that there is no problem with that. If, however, we are to delay this scheme for a month or more, depending upon the decisions that are taken here this evening, I cannot promise that payments will be retrospective to 1 December 1991. If the legislation goes through as it is here, with an amendment that I will refer to in a moment, which I have agreed with Senator Alston, the answer to Senator Boswell's question is an unequivocal yes. If it does not, the answer is anyone's guess, because we will have to determine when farmers will be able to apply and to what date we will backdate the assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Patterson has not found a hole. I wish I could comment on that, but there are limits on the sort of language I can use. The first matter I will deal with is the criticism of the failure to reach an agreement with the UK. As Senator Patterson would be aware, we have had numerous attempts to get those negotiations moving in the right direction. When I signed the most recent agreement with the Government of the UK in September 1990, we had for the first time some recognition of the question of indexation of British pensions, which is at the heart of the disagreement between the two governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have said before in the chamber that the reason the British Government is reluctant to extend to us the provisions of an agreement which extends to countries all around the world is simply that South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Canada have the most British migrants and therefore cost the most money. The British Government signed an agreement with the Philippines because there are something like twelve British pensions in the Philippines. But the British Government will not do that here because there are 130,000 pensioners, which would mean a cost to the budget of Great Britain of some hundreds of millions of pounds. I will have to get the figure, but #350m is the figure I have in my mind. In any event, it is a hell of a lot of money. That has always been the stumbling block. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am pleased to report to Senator Patterson that the British Government is now considering a modification to the process. It would not give us a full indexation of all British pensioners immediately. It is worth noting that we are talking about pensioners who came here some 20 years ago with a pension of a few pounds a week, who are still on a few pounds a week and who therefore get either the whole or a very substantial part of an Australian pension. This is a matter of importance to the Australian Government, which is why I have been to London to discuss it a number of times with my British counterpart and why, no doubt, I will make sure I get there again next year to do the same thing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's unwillingness to enter into an agreement with Greece can best be explained by saying that what we are signing here with Greece&mdash;or with any country with which we negotiate&mdash;is a reciprocal agreement. Obviously, if we are to sign an agreement, it has to be capable of being reciprocal. The problem for the Greek Government is that as further and better particulars, as they say in the legal game, have been presented it has become apparent that the coverage of Greek workers by their pension scheme is very much lower than the estimates we were given previously. That makes a reciprocal agreement virtually impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to sign the kind of agreement that the Greek Government wants, we would be doing the Australian taxpayer a great disservice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to state why the Australian Democrats will be opposing this clause and I also wish to ask some questions of the Minister. This clause is one of a series which we will be opposing to ensure that sole parents are treated the same as all other pensioners. I ask the Minister: what is the rationale behind making a differentiation between how aged pensioners will be treated when it comes to compensation payments and how sole parents pensions will be affected by any compensation payments?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think all we are doing in this proposal&mdash;while, as I said in the Senate a couple of days ago, maintaining the option of full time parenting for sole parents&mdash;is recognising that there is, and has been for some time, an increasing attachment of sole parents to the labour market. Currently, more than 58,000 sole parents are in full time, part time or casual work and about half of all other sole parents are actually looking for work. All we are trying to do is bring this into line with what applies to other benefits which are received&mdash;with the exception of the age pension where obviously people have retired from work and there cannot be considered to be a reasonable analogy between them and the labour market program. So we are just trying to bring it into line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is actually something which will affect only about 400 sole parent pensioners, so it is not something with broad application when there are something like 250,000 sole parents&mdash;I think those are the current numbers. One is looking at a measure which will affect some 400 people and these people will be getting quite considerable sums. We have already liberalised considerably the method of treating compensation payments, as Senator Lees would be aware. The kind of calculations that are made now about how long a benefit shall be suspended I think are a considerable improvement on how it was done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I hold the view that this is a fair provision. When sole parents get these payments as a result of being in the work force&mdash;that is what they will be getting these compensation payments for&mdash;then I think it is only fair that they should have their pension assessed in exactly the same way as a recipient of JSA or Newstart would have that pension assessed. Honourable senators must remember that some disability support pensioners are sole pensioners and they are subjected to this. It is in fact an anomaly that sole parents were not subjected to it before. This will only affect entry into the sole parents pension for 400 people; and when 250,000 people are receiving the payment, I do not think it is unfair, harsh or unconscionable. </PARA>

<PARA>I do not wish to move amendment No. 7 with this amendment, so I will speak to amendment No. 6. This amendment changes the period for which certificate 26 will last. At the moment it is 12 weeks and we believe it is unreasonable to expect farmers to go back and back again. We believe that 26 weeks is a far more reasonable time before we ask the farmers to go through all of these hurdles again. We believe it is unfair to expect them to keep returning and returning. I understand that the income test would still apply and, therefore, in the normal course of events, they would have to notify should their income go over the limit. Therefore, we cannot understand why they need to keep applying when in some States there is already a considerable wait for assessment. We understand that some extra staff were going to be appointed, but we still envisage long delays. </PARA>

We have liberalised this very considerably, and are happy to do so, but if one is a Jobsearch allowance recipient in Hobart and has to go every two weeks, if we say that farmers only have to go every 12 weeks, we think that that will be very much a relaxation of the rules, and an important one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that one can overlook the possibility that a farmer on Jobsearch allowance may make the decision&mdash;I hope that this will not happen too often&mdash;to leave the property.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask the Minister a couple of questions. I have no doubt as to the efficiency of the Minister's Department to a certain extent, but the rural adjustment scheme involves a lot of investigation and advice to farmers. Is the Minister happy that RAS is in a position to do all the things that he has mentioned? He said earlier that the first applications should be cleared in four weeks from 1 December. I would say that is a little hopeful considering that the Christmas break is almost upon us. Apart from that, although I am reasonably satisfied as to the Minister's Department, the most complaints I have received from rural people in Western Australia relate to the slowness of RAS, its inefficiency, and certainly some of the decisions it has made. Some of these decisions are quite arbitrary, especially if they come down on the wrong side.

<PARA>In various ways these amendments all exempt farmers from having to look for work during the period of receipt of Jobsearch allowance. It is a recognition of the fact that obviously there will be instances where they will be required to be active on the farm even though they are not generating immediate income. In those circumstances, I think we all take the view that it is more trouble than it is worth to start subjecting farmers to inquiries about the extent to which they are actively looking for work, how far they have to travel to find it and how many days a week they ought to be exempted from doing other things. In all the circumstances, it seems to us that it is sensible simply to grant an exemption along those lines. </PARA>

There is no way we would seek to do that. However, the whole direction of this proposal is that, if a crop has been put in, the farmer would accept a job if it was offered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will hazard an attempt, Madam Acting Deputy President. When I had discussions earlier this morning with Senator Kay Patterson, we were concerned to give the chamber an opportunity to disallow the determination to be made by virtue of the exercise of a power by the Minister under the Act, if the Bill is passed into law. So we are really trying to get to a situation where I am able to give a guarantee to the Senate during the debate on the pathology Bill, and these are the terms I would have been using: I undertake that the ministerial determinations for the allocation of licences for specimen collection centres required by proposed new sections 23DNB and 23DNC will be tabled by 11 December 1991. That was in order to assist the chamber to have an opportunity to exercise its power of disallowance if it was not happy with the determinations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get to that stage, I am advised that it is necessary to get the Bill through the chamber and into the House of Representatives tonight so that it can then be prepared for the Executive Council and get the royal assent, and the Act can be an Act rather than a Bill. Under that Act, the Minister will make the determination, and the determination will be tabled, as I have promised Senator Patterson, no later than 11 December to allow this chamber to exercise its powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the timetable we have in mind. We are trying to assist the Senate eventually to exercise the powers it wants to exercise. That is why this timetable was arrived at. I am sorry if honourable senators find that it will require them to stay longer in the chamber&mdash;I would think no more than three-quarters of an hour, if we got under way. It is a very simple proposition. The Bill is largely agreed around the chamber, though I have not had a chance to discuss it in detail with Senator Harradine. Undertakings will be given to enable the confidence of the Senate to be maintained in the process. That is what we are trying to achieve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment briefly on this matter because what happened this morning in the chamber created a quite dangerous precedent and attention needs to be drawn to it. This morning we had tabled a report from a committee on a Bill that had not yet entered the second reading stage. To my knowledge, we have never allowed one of those reports to become the subject of a debate. When leave was sought to debate that report, I fully expected the Government to refuse. I was disappointed when that did not happen because it seemed to me that, provided the second reading stage had not been proceeded with, there was a perfectly good opportunity to debate that report within the second reading stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In the main, I want to respond to the points made prior to the last comments from Senator Walters. In response to that, I indicate my understanding of the situation and my advice, which is consistent with an interjection I heard from Senator Tate. It is true that the physical document&mdash;that is, the regulations&mdash;can exist before the legislation is passed. It is also true that it can be made available for consultation, consideration and discussion before the legislation is passed, but there is no way that the Senate can exercise its power of disallowance until the Act is passed and the regulations can exist as a matter of law. There is then a legal entity about which the disallowance power can be exercised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is to protect the interests of the Senate that Senator Tate came to this agreement with Senator Patterson, and properly so.

I will not go on at length; it would be very wrong to make a long speech while talking about the problem of adjournments. I am very conscious of the point he makes. I know that the adjournment has been negatived often. Frankly, I must acknowledge that it has happened because of the very cooperative attitude of all senators, which I have appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that this will not be the last late night, but I will try to keep them to a minimum. One of the advantages&mdash;if I can use that word somewhat generously&mdash;of sitting through to 19 December is that it will put less pressure on us to do that as often. I will be conscious of that, as I have been in the past. For example, we do not negative the adjournment on Wednesdays, however busy we might be, for the reasons Senator Harradine correctly outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say for the record that, although there may be misunderstandings as to what was the agreement at the Whips meeting about negativing the adjournment and what might have been the agreement at the Whips meeting about what legislation we would pass after the negation, I am assured initially by our Whips and reassured that what we are doing is exactly what we thought was the agreement at that time. It is exactly what we have always thought was the agreement at all times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have always thought the agreement was with regard to three Bills. However, if there is a misunderstanding or some concern, as I have said twice before, I am seeking to offer some form of compromise to drop one piece of legislation off, which is the veterans' affairs legislation. I understand in consultation with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), although it does not exactly fill him with joy, that that is a matter that can be accommodated. For the reasons outlined by Senator Tate and which I have reinforced, we do regard the health insurance Bills as important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not and will not breach any agreement which I reached with the Opposition or other senators. Sometimes we might have to come back to say, `I am sorry; can we do it again?', but I have not and I will not breach agreements reached with the Opposition. I accept Senator Reid's bona fides in the matter, that there is a genuine misunderstanding between the Whips as to what the agreement is, but I have sought reassurance that what we are doing is exactly in accordance with what we thought was the agreement on the understanding upon which we have always operated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I pose no challenge to the bona fides of Senator Reid when she says that what she is doing is what she thought to be the agreement, but it is a misunderstanding; it is not the breach of an agreement. The assurance which we have operated under until now is reiterated: we are not breaching and we will not breach agreements which we have reached with the Opposition. But I still seek and pursue what we understood to be the agreement with that compromise offer. We do insist upon the importance of two of the pieces of legislation but we are prepared to give way on the third. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.Government Amendment No. 8, proposed clause 56P, paragraph 1132(3A)(e) after "disregarded assets" insert "and for the purposes of this section such other essential and usual expenditure incurred in the operation of the farm".</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this amendment is effectively to exempt working capital from the hardship provisions. We have had a fair degree of cooperation from the Government in proceeding as far as we have. I certainly acknowledge that Senator Richardson has done his very best to accommodate a number of concerns, both in relation to this legislation and the earlier package of legislation in relation to family allowance and family allowance supplement. But it seems to me that, having gone down the path we did on that occasion in relation to exempting both tools of trade and working capital from the hardship provisions, there is, stated at its lowest, no harm done in being consistent in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the midst of a lot of bluster about how terribly important it is to the Government that no precedents be set, in the same breath we are told that it is the overwhelming expectation that there will be very few farmers in any position to have many liquid assets, let alone a swag of other assets. In those circumstances, it would seem that we are having almost an academic debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noted that in the course of purporting to spell out why he felt that somehow this was going too far, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) said that he was not prepared to walk away from the concept of any assets test. That is purely and simply a gross overstatement of the circumstances. By excluding working capital, we are still nonetheless leaving in place a provision that would catch a whole range of other assets. One does not have to get into the exotic to imagine that there can be a range of other readily realisable assets which could be caught by that provision and that would then reduce the JSA payment on a graduated basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us that we really ought to be consistent in the circumstances. As the Minister says, we are probably talking about only a couple of thousand farmers. It is unlikely that the great bulk of them will be in any way affected by whichever version of the hardship test we have. Therefore, we think that it is important to establish a principle. If that is not done, we are in a sense being asked to take the Government on trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may well be very few people who would be caught by the tighter form that the Minister proposes. However, if some people are caught, it will just be bad luck. I would have thought that we would all prefer to give the farmers the benefit of the doubt in that sense by having a consistent principle that would ensure that, if the occasion arose, they still got the benefit of having working capital excluded rather than being simply caught short on the basis that they believed what the Minister said and it did not quite work out that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So extending as much goodwill as we can to the Government in view of the concessions it has made in this and other areas, I simply cannot see that this would set the precedent that is claimed by the Minister. The mere fact that this entire package of amendments is very much an exception, that they are targeting relief to a particular group in the community, seems to me to provide an answer to any suggestion that somehow this is a broad based precedent. It clearly is not. I would not pretend to argue that it is and I do not think the Minister would have any trouble in defending the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concessions that have been made to date are nothing more or less than a recognition of the particular circumstances of those in rural communities, just as the amendments that brought in a hardship test in the first instance were a reaction to the ill-considered proposals in the Budget before last to simply bring in an assets test at $300,000 and then $500,000 and pretend that somehow farmers were in the same situation as everyone else. We knew they were not; the Government knew they were not. The Government blustered and lost. It went away and thought about it and 12 months later it came back with a completely different package of proposals which involved the introduction of a hardship test on two specific payments purely and simply to cater for those in situations of hardship in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go down that path and accept that there are unique circumstances prevailing in country areas, I fail to see that anyone on either side of the House could find themselves embarrassed in defending the proposition that this is simply another unique exception to the general principle. I do not regard it as compromising the Government's ability in other areas. Therefore, we do not see that there is any harm done and there may well be a significant benefit in terms of reassurance, if nothing else. For those reasons, we will be pursuing this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly support the amendments that Senator Alston has brought forward tonight. We are looking at the matter in terms of hardship caused by high interest rates, drought and very low commodity prices. When farmers have to put up with one or even two of those things, they may have some way to survive, but when they are hit with this unholy trinity of the three together, then special measures are required to get them out of trouble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, to plant 1,500 acres of grain, which I suppose is the average planting in Australia, costs about $50,000 to $60,000. If it rains and if the farmer gets a good commodity price, he will hopefully get a profit. Where is the benefit of giving a rural adjustment package and then making the conditions so hard to meet that many people are excluded from it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Senator Richardson's own interpretation, this package is for all viable farmers that cannot handle any more debt. So any farmer who has the capacity to plant a crop would need $40,000 to $50,000 for the average size farm. That means that something like $120 would be taken off his package. If he needs $30,000 to shear sheep, then he loses $120 from the package every fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this amendment is not carried, the package will be rendered almost useless because very few farmers will be able to get any benefit from it. So the Government is defeating its own purpose. It is bringing in legislation to support viable farmers, to keep them viable, and then it is removing those benefits from any viable farmer that has the capacity to plant, harvest, shear or fill his diesel tanks. Senator Richardson has gone a long way. I think everyone on this side of the Parliament would concede that he has done his best, but he is defeating what he set out to do. </PARA>

That estimate of 2,000 to 3,000 farmers is with the assets test intact. It is not a matter of defeating the purpose.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to be clear on this matter. I hear the Minister repeatedly saying that there will be effectively no assets test if this amendment is carried. Is the Minister suggesting that somehow any other assets would also be exempt, that everything would be regarded as working capital?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with this problem on a couple of levels.

It is developing a profile of the sorts of people we are dealing with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course we agree with the concept that has been expressed by the coalition and of course we agree with the need to remove as much of the assets testing as possible, as we have done previously with other legislation in other areas of farming. It is not the concern of the Government to establish a precedent that worries us here.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to consider this amendment very carefully. We have here wording which to me is imprecise and open to different interpretations; for instance, what is `usual' and what is `essential'? This should have had attached to it some time ago the sort of spiel we heard from Senator Alston, which was a speech that more properly belonged in the second reading debate. I am tempted to wonder why, if it was as well thought out as the speech suggests, such options had not been presented to us and to the Minister much earlier. We could have determined our position on it and perhaps suggested even further amendments. It is a question not so much of the direction being offered here but, rather, of the method that is being proposed and the place it is being proposed. It does present us with the difficulty of having to deal with it at this time because of the way it has been added. </PARA>

Those farmers who are in desperate straits and who have the capacity to look forward to something would be greeted with an amendment that is imprecise, that requires further delays, that requires further passage through another House, then to be returned here, without knowing what the result will be, simply because the coalition has chosen to introduce it at this time rather than to sort out the fine details earlier. I cannot turn my back on those people who are expecting something on Monday.

Every $10,000 in assets is $40 a fortnight coming off the benefit, so $30,000 is $120 off the benefits. That $30,000 would not plant a crop; it might shear 10,000 sheep, which is an under-average size flock. To plant 1,500 acres of wheat, and $50 an acre is the absolute minimum cost&mdash;it should be $70 but let us use the figure of $50&mdash;$50,000 to $60,000 would be required as working capital.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rather breathtaking to find that, immediately after having thrown in the towel on the last amendment, Senator Lees gets to her feet and speaks as though there had been no consideration of this matter in other terms. Indeed, the Minister said that there had been discussions during the evening about a number of alternative approaches. I am staggered. Either Senator Lees has forgotten what it is all about or she is somehow pretending that there is nothing wrong with the proposal in relation to going to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand what the Minister told us both, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal is not qualified to deal with these matters. We then explored the possibility of the AAT. I do not know quite where that has got to, but it struck me as a sensible suggestion. I have indicated to the Minister's advisers that if that is not acceptable on a temporary basis pending the legislation which will be introduced in the new year to establish a proper appeals mechanism, one could build in a sunset clause to ensure that one does not get ratted on next time round by people who promise that they will support the amendments now and do not do so later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not an appropriate path to go down, then I would be interested in hearing alternative suggestions. For example, the Government could give an undertaking to backdate payments once the new system was in place. In other words, if people do not have any appeal mechanism for three months, let us say, one could give them access at a later time, or one could give them special benefits in the interim. I am happy to accommodate either approach. It seems to me that those are the sorts of things Senator Lees ought to be exploring rather than getting to her feet and, quite dishonestly, pretending that somehow the Social Security Appeals Tribunal is the way to go and completely ignoring what has been brought to her attention earlier this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that there was some discussion as to what would be appropriate. The AAT was the later suggestion. But my understanding was that we were to leave that for Senator Richardson to discuss and debate and to answer our questions. As I understood it&mdash;correct me if I am wrong&mdash;the Opposition had given us an undertaking that it would indeed support this amendment. Therefore, I make no apology whatsoever for saying that when I got to my feet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was our one amendment that the Opposition was interested in, despite the fact that the Opposition had moved the sunset provision previously. It seems that as soon as the Democrats move an amendment those opposite are automatically obliged to reject it&mdash;notwithstanding it was something that they had previously given an undertaking to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the decision on the last amendment and the one upon which I did seek support and advice from my colleagues, I was advised that, as this amendment had not had the chance to go to our Party room, it was most unwise for me to continue with an amendment that was likely to put a Bill at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time after time the Liberals come into this place with amendments which have been drawn up during the dinner break, or perhaps later. We really would like an opportunity to have some time to be able to examine the major amendments. I am quite happy to run with some of the smaller amendments as we go. But when we have amendments as beneficial and in fact as attractive as that particular amendment was, but which put a Bill at risk, I am not prepared to continue with it without consulting my colleagues. If Senator Alston thinks that is unwise, that is fine; it may be the way in which he operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the amendment in hand, I was given an undertaking. I understood that the Minister was looking at other mechanisms, but I do not think that farmers can sit around and wait for three months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not quarrelling with the Australian Democrats' last decision. That decision was taken by the Democrats presumably on advice and on reflection. I am quarrelling with the fact that Senator Lees got to her feet and put the matter as though she was expecting us to support her amendment and sat down. She put clearly to the Committee that she saw nothing wrong with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and expected us to take the same view. Therefore, Senator Lees, quite wrongly but maybe inadvertently, misrepresented the entire situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees had previously acknowledged that there were deficiencies as identified by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) in the proposal to take the matter to the SSAT. We both shared that reservation and explored other alternatives. What I am objecting to is Senator Lees standing up and pretending that somehow we are doing the wrong thing by not supporting an amendment which the Democrats themselves conceded was invalid. I do not want to get into a quarrel. I am simply saying that rationality should prevail and that we should all be looking at the most appropriate appeals mechanism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the score of appeals to the SSAT, the Government has two reasons for opposing the proposal. As the person who is responsible for appointing people to that Tribunal, I know the expertise it has. We have doctors, lawyers, and people with all sorts of qualifications, but agricultural economics has never been one of them. The people on the SSAT around Australia are simply not qualified in that respect and it is not the place to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I undertook to Senator Lees, Senator Boswell and Senator Alston earlier to look at the idea of this being sent to the AAT. There are a few problems there as well. The main problem, as the Attorney-General's Department rightly points out&mdash;I had not thought it through, as Senator Lees will recall; it was a request made on the spur of the moment&mdash;is that the State governments are very unlikely to agree to it. The difficulty is that, because we are involving RAS, we need the cooperation of the States. Whatever arguments we have among ourselves about consultation, if we go into this matter without talking to the States, inevitably we will get an argument. We are talking about a non-Commonwealth agency being reviewed by a Commonwealth agency. That will be difficult without the complete cooperation of the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I want to give a number of undertakings. I am not certain that this is the exact time, but with the indulgence of the Chair I will do so now. The Government can certainly undertake that, as a matter of urgency and priority, very early in the autumn session we will introduce legislation for an appeals mechanism. We will further undertake that anyone who is aggrieved by a decision from Monday on will be able to appeal to whatever tribunal is set out under the legislation. The decision can be effective in respect of payments back to the first day of the scheme. I can give an absolute undertaking that that will be done. We will not attempt to exclude people from the appeals mechanism because we do not happen to have one up and running right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to Senator Alston's request about special benefit, I think that there are difficulties. Therefore, I cannot give that undertaking because of the qualifications involved, which are a quite different set from those we are talking about now. Certainly I can give an undertaking that on the first day of the scheme whoever applies from that date will have the right of appeal to this tribunal, even if it is not set up for another few months. </PARA>

As I said, that would result in a $65m saving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Minister said in reply to me during the second reading debate that the data matching was delayed, but the savings that were given for the six-month period&mdash;or slightly longer&mdash;showed in the first period of the data matching for social security that 22,779 matches occurred with a saving of $12.7m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a shortfall. The Minister might say that there were problems and hiccups with the data matching and that only two data matches have occurred, but they were the estimates that he gave us. Surely the Department should have taken into account the problems in setting this up. The Government has not achieved the savings that the Minister said it was going to achieve, and it is appropriate that he explain to the Senate why, given the hysteria that surrounded some of the discussions that took place in the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;saying that the world would cave in if we did not get this, and that we were going to have all these savings&mdash;now we see only $12.7m in that first six-month period. It does not match with the $65m that was estimated. Can the Minister explain that to the Senate?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Patterson knows, I did that earlier on. If she does not like the explanation I regret that quite sincerely, nonetheless it is the explanation. I have already said that there will be substantial savings. I have already said that there was a hold up in setting up the system. A regrettable one, but these things happen. Nonetheless, we will see very substantial savings achieved. I am very happy to give Senator Patterson an undertaking to have a further look at the question and give her an answer in the next week or so as to where we think this is, as we speak. I will do that. When she says there was hysteria at the Committee hearing, there certainly was not any on my part. I am not a very hysterical person. I cannot necessarily deny that there was any, but there certainly was not any from me.</PARA></TALK.START>

Under the summary of estimated full year savings the total is given as $115.4m. It says it should be noted that only two data matching cycles have been undertaken. It says that up to nine cycles can be undertaken each year. It does not tell us whether that $115.4m is what is estimated for data matching for the year or whether that is what is estimated, given that there were only two done a year. If nine are done would it be 4.9 times more? It is not clear from that document and I would appreciate if the Minister could clarify that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning we are debating a package of four pathology Bills: the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill 1991; the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991; the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Licence Fee) Bill 1991; and the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Fees) Bill 1991. These Bills implement the pathology restructuring measures announced in the 1990-91 Budget. The changes arise from matters raised by the National Health Strategy in its background paper No. 6 entitled `Directions for Pathology' by John Deeble and Peter Lewis-Hughes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Health Strategy background paper provided some very interesting statistics showing the increased use of pathology services and the impact that this is having on the Budget. The number of pathology services performed increased from 22.3 million to 34.4 million between 1984-85 and 1989-90. This was an increase of 54.3 per cent. I think in anyone's terms that would be considered a large increase. However, in the same time period, the number of other medical services rose by 28.8 per cent. One can see a noticeable difference between those two increases. The total fees charged for pathology services increased by 67.8 per cent. Figures provided in the paper show that this increase has been largely due to an increase in the number of services performed. It is interesting to read that the average services per capita increased by 41.7 per cent over this period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not take a genius to come to the conclusion that there is a level of overservicing in pathology services that must be addressed. In fact, the National Health Strategy group concluded that `some pathology testing is clearly unnecessary and wasteful, even on criteria which go beyond their contribution to narrowly defined clinical outcomes, although not all of the non-clinical reasons are unacceptable'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, there is clearly a problem with the increasing costs of pathology services. As is typically the case with this Government, the problem has not been tackled comprehensively because the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) has been too gutless&mdash;I hope that is not an unparliamentary word, Madam Acting Deputy President, but with your experience I am sure that you would know&mdash;to implement the reforms that are necessary. The Minister continues to tinker at the edges of our health system instead of introducing the fundamental reforms that are so vitally needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of changes that the Government might have made. It could have addressed the problem of the absence of a price signal. If a service is free, it will be overused. I want to take the time of the Senate to share something that I was reading the other night in preparation for a speech that I was making. The founder of the first medical school in America in the mid-1700s indicated in a speech that it was important that people had a price signal and that they differentiate between the cost of pharmaceuticals and the cost of medicine so that they knew how much that service cost. That is something that somebody was saying in the mid-1700s; it is not new. People need a price signal to know how much that service is costing. If a service is free, there is a tendency for it to be overused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is there a problem on the demand side but also the provider of that service, realising that it is free, will oversupply or may be tempted to oversupply. This may not necessarily happen, but the temptation is there to oversupply. This is one of the problems facing pathology and, of course, the wider Medicare system. When bulkbilling is available and the service is provided free of charge, that service is likely to be overused. This is exactly what is happening with pathology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to some of the specific aspects of the Bills before the Senate. The Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill 1991 amends existing provisions in the parent Act to allow for the payment of fees after the Minister has accepted undertakings from approved pathology authorities and practitioners, and has approved premises in principle as accredited pathology laboratories. In order to be eligible to participate in Medicare benefit arrangements for pathology services, practitioners are required to sign an undertaking to the Minister that the practitioner will comply with the requirements of the legislation and certain administrative arrangements. The proprietor of a laboratory must sign an undertaking to become an approved pathology authority and a pathologist must sign an undertaking to become an approved pathology practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn my attention to the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment (No. 2) Bill 1991. One of the provisions will introduce a licensing scheme for pathology specimen collection centres which will require collection centres to apply for and meet a number of conditions before they could be granted a licence. One of the other Bills in the package provides for a $1,000 licence fee to be charged for each collection centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is concerned about the restrictions on the number of licensed collection centres that will be allowed to operate. We are extremely doubtful whether in fact the reduction in specimen collection centres will result in a reduction in the use of services. It concerns us that the only result might be inconvenience to the patients, who may have to travel further to have their specimens taken. I believe that the Department has admitted that it only has guesstimates on the possible reduction in centres. It has also conceded that the imposition of fees is little more than a revenue raising initiative. I do not believe that the Department has given due consideration to the effect that the rationalisation of collection centres will have on rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) to seek assurances from the Minister responsible that that will be closely monitored to ensure that rural people are not affected, as we have seen in pharmacy restructuring. In some small towns, because of a failure to address the issues in the implementation stage, it has meant that some people are without a pharmacy service and we do not want to burden those people with undue effort to have specimens collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the reduction in collection centres that has concerned us is that the Minister will, by determination, decide the maximum number of licensed collection centres that may be operated by approved pathology laboratories. We have not, as I said, seen a draft of those determinations. But, as I mentioned earlier when Senator Tate was absent from the chamber, Senator Tate has agreed to organise for us to see the directions that were given to the draftsman. In fact, I have been advised that the shadow Minister's office asked for information of this nature so we could know the formula that was to be used to determine the number of collection centres. That was not forthcoming. We received that finally this morning, but we have not had a large amount of time to consider it. We agreed with the thrust of those directions, and in the discussions that we had with Senator Tate he indicated that he would be undertaking in the chamber tonight to table those determinations on 11 November so that we would have time to disallow them if necessary. I may be losing my senses at this time of night, but if for some reason we rise before 12 December I presume that the Minister will ensure that those determinations are here the day before we rise so that we would have time to disallow them. I do not ever imagine that in fact we will be up before 12 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure in the Bill provides that a Medicare benefit for a pathology service is not payable where there is found to be some form of inappropriate agreement, arrangement or incentive for ordering the service between the approved pathology practitioner providing this service and the treating practitioner requesting the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supports this measure. There is quite a good deal of anecdotal evidence of inappropriate arrangements between pathologists and the treating practitioner: for example, TAB accounts perhaps, nursing staff, rents paid or other kickbacks provided or paid for by unethical pathologists. We are not inferring that pathologists are basically unethical. In the majority of cases, pathologists carry out their practices scrupulously and ethically, but the small minority who do not behave in an ethical way give the rest a bad name and in fact contribute to the overservicing and the blow-out in the cost. The Opposition supports this measure of preventing Medicare benefits being payable where there is found to be some illegal and inappropriate activities taking place. As I said, we would not cast aspersions on the profession, and the peak body is in agreement with this sort of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other significant measure included in the Government's reforms is changes in the fee structure. I understand that the Government is to introduce a two-tiered transaction fee as a trade-off for a 30 per cent cut. It will cover the costs of transporting specimens to the laboratory and other overheads. This transaction fee will be paid for each episode of tests. In other words, if all tests are ordered on the one day for the same patient by the same general practitioner, this measure will not affect the referring pattern of doctors but will reduce the benefit to pathologists and reduce Commonwealth outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does not believe that this two-tiered structure will have a major impact on the quality of service offered or the appropriateness of the service offered. However, it will have some impact on overuse, and for that reason we will not be opposing these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter I wish to raise relates to the amendment to clause 4 that was moved in the House of Representatives. This amendment closed a loophole that was picked up by the shadow Minister for health, Dr Woods. The loophole related to collection centres in private hospitals. The amendment Dr Woods moved illustrates the poor drafting and the speed at which legislation is presented to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, yesterday afternoon we were presented with six pages of Government amendments to two of the Bills currently before the Senate. I appreciated the briefing that was provided by the Minister's office and the explanation but, as I said, we had little time to examine them. It is not good enough to have amendments to amendments and loopholes where there would have been the possibility of some pathologists abusing the system. It had not been thought through, and that seems to be the case with a lot of the legislation that comes into this chamber. Not enough `what if' questions have been asked, and loopholes have to be detected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate that the Opposition will be supporting the amendments to be moved by the Government. These amendments basically amend oversights in the amending legislation before us. The impression I have is that some of the amendments relate to points raised by the Health Insurance Commission when it finally saw legislation or began to think about working through the legislation. It is obvious that either it was not consulted in the drafting of these changes or it had not thought through the implications of these changes adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the Government often does not consult with industry. But it appears either not to have consulted with the Health Insurance Commission or the Health Insurance Commission has not adequately thought through the implications of those changes. It is a disgraceful situation and it is unacceptable. We should not have legislation coming to this chamber in that state. It should come thought through, without the need to have an amending Bill and amendments to that amending Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already stated, the Opposition is very concerned that the regulations and determinations accompanying the Government's pathology restructuring package have not been presented. Because those determinations are an integral part of the package, it would have behoved the Department to have those determinations here so that we would not have had the fuss we had this morning and the inconvenience to the Minister, to me and to my colleagues in having to rush around trying to discuss it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will be supporting this package of four pathology Bills. As I stated earlier, the Opposition does not believe that they will make the fundamental structural changes to the pathology aspects of Medicare that are needed. However, some minor improvements will be made, so we will not be opposing them. On behalf of the Opposition, I move the following second reading amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion, add ", and the Senate congratulates the Coalition parties for turning their backs on the band-aid solutions offered by the Australian Labor Party to overcome a Medicare system which is in crisis and having the vision to develop a revolutionary health care policy which will maintain universal coverage, restore the balance between public and private hospitals, contain costs, reduce waiting lists in public hospitals and free up the health insurance system".</PARA>
<PARA>Last week, as part of the Opposition's Fightback policy package, the coalition released a comprehensive health policy that will restore equity, fairness and practicality to our ailing health system, in contrast to this Government, which only tinkers at the edges of the problems in the system&mdash;and we have an example of that tinkering tonight&mdash;providing only bandaid measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy addresses the fundamental problems plaguing our health system. As part of our policy, Medicare will be retained and improved. Up to 65 per cent of the public will receive up to $800 in tax credits for private health cover, bulkbilling will be retained for pensioners, and aged non-pensioners will receive a pharmaceutical concession card. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition health policy provides a sensible, equitable and fair means both to address the immediate problems of Australia's health care system and to achieve long term reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up a lot of the Senate's time this morning. The Australian Democrats will be supporting these health insurance Bills and the amendments that are amending the amending Bills. These four health insurance Bills represent part of the Government's restructuring of the pathology industry announced in this year's Budget and amended after it had further consulted with the industry. They come in response to evidence and widespread recognition that pathology services have been increasing for many years at more than twice the rate of other medical services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data collected by the National Health Strategy indicates quite clearly that more people are now receiving pathology services&mdash;some 34.5 per cent in 1989-90 compared with 25.6 per cent in 1984-85. Furthermore, over the period of Medicare's existence, pathology use has risen by 54.3 per cent compared with 28.8 per cent for other medical services. Increasing use of pathology appears to have coincided with it moving away from being largely a hospital based service and into a community based service&mdash;a move which has provided the scope for escalating costs and, I might add, escalating incomes for many private pathologists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from the measures in these Bills, it is high time we began looking seriously at an expansion of the public provision of pathology services. As the National Health Strategy's exploration of pathology services pointed out, many people believe that pathology is the medical service least suited to fee for service and that as it is not a personal doctor-patient service, it should be structured and financed along the same lines as other public health facilities. This is a view that I believe we really need to give some further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These four Bills comprise a package that covers structural reform, cost saving measures, and reforms of fees. According to the Minister, they lay the ground for further reform and restructuring of the pathology industry. Essentially, these Bills address three problems, and I will be brief. Firstly, there is the problem of kickbacks or inducements offered by some pathology practices&mdash;I stress that it is only some. This is for treating doctors in order to encourage them&mdash;entice them&mdash;to use particular pathology services. For example, it is well known that this sometimes takes the form of pathology practices offering staff, particularly nurses, to doctors. These staff are paid for by the pathologist. Such arrangements obviously limit the doctor's capacity to exercise freedom of choice as to what pathology services he or she will use. Further, as the nurse is generally used for collecting specimens, this is really a fairly blatant attempt to make the doctor some sort of outreach service for the pathology practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, there have also been reports of other sorts of incentives, including free travel and equipment, although such practices are, for very obvious reasons, extremely difficult to document. However, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its two hundred and thirty-sixth report in 1985, looked at medical fraud and overservicing and expressed considerable disquiet about the likelihood and consequences of such practices. The Government has moved to stop this sort of activity, and the Democrats welcome this move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there are too many collection centres operating. I think that is pretty clearly recognised. It is also recognised that the expansion of collection centres and courier services is a major issue on the supply side of pathology. Data from the national health strategy indicates that in 1989-90 there were 10.2 million non-hospital pathology episodes in Australia and that about 60 per cent of these collection centres were used. The additional cost of the use of private collection and courier services was in the vicinity of $60m to $70m. That is about 10 per cent of Medicare pathology costs. As the national health strategy Background Paper No. 6 observed, these costs `arose entirely from the underuse and inefficient use of people and facilities'. On page 70, the paper goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is one activity in which competition serves only to raise costs and whose reduction would free some valuable resources. It is an area where savings would be real and result in neither a shifting of costs to patients nor, necessarily, a reduction in provider profitability.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that there are too many collection centres, and this is generally accepted by the pathology industry. It is not an issue of reducing the number of pathology episodes&mdash;unfortunately some people have read it this way&mdash;but, rather, an issue of reducing inefficiency and unnecessary additional expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To call it interfering in a free market, as unfortunately has been done in the other place, simply demonstrates yet again the inability of some politicians and members of the medical profession to acknowledge that there is no such thing as a free market in the delivery of health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before&mdash;I do not intend to go through it in detail tonight&mdash;the evidence from here and overseas is clear: market signals are undermined by the distinctive nature of the health system. There are a number of features of the health system that make free market logic unconvincing in this context, and that analysis includes a supply of pathology services. Indeed, some of these features are even more apparent in the area of pathology, because it is not the patient who is responsible for assessing the need or otherwise for a pathology service and then going to a doctor to request it. This is one area where the patient is virtually wholly reliant on the judgment and skill of his or her doctor. It is even more of a nonsense to argue for price signals in this area than it is in the provision of health services generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, unlike the so-called genuine free market&mdash;if, indeed, there is such an animal&mdash;the taxpayer pays for inefficiencies in this area via the Medicare levy. I fail to see why the taxpayer should be obliged to protect these sorts of inefficiencies. As I said, this is not a free market, and it would be grossly irresponsible of the Government to permit the number of collection centres to grow with no regard to the consequences for public expenditure. Accordingly, we support the Government's move in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is the issue of fees. A number of amendments are proposed to the pathology services table resulting in a reduction in the schedule fee which will be offset by the introduction of a new transaction fee. These fees have been the subject of considerable negotiation with the entire pathology industry and, in fact, the package was modified, as I have mentioned, after the Budget as a consequence of those negotiations. The new fee will cover those costs not directly involved in the test procedures, costs such as collecting the samples and transporting them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These fees will be two-tiered with a higher fee being set for licence collection centres, private hospitals, the patient's residence or licence day hospital facilities. The lower fee will cover specimens collected in licensed temporary collection centres or in the treating doctor's surgery. Medicare benefits will not be payable where specimens are collected in an unlicensed collection centre or where an inappropriate agreement, arrangement or incentive for requesting the services is present between the pathology provider and the treating practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes will certainly result in savings to the taxpayer and, undoubtedly, will have some effect on the delivery of pathology services. However, it really is only playing about the edges of a significant problem in Australia's health system. It is not an easy problem to solve, and it is certainly not helped by the lack of adequate data about the actual cost structures of pathology service providers. As has been frequently pointed out, pathology fees are not based on an accurate costing. I hope that the Government is looking to undertake such an exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Opposition's concern about the unavailability of ministerial determinations to be made under the second Bill, the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Fees) Bill. This does concern us. It certainly has resulted in a flurry of activity in the later stages of today. It would have helped had this been signalled earlier. We do have some sympathy with the point of view that it is preferable to see all the regulations, determinations, et cetera, at the time when the Bill is presented to us. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. I accept the Minister's explanation and, indeed, the reality is that it often does not occur. We do accept the Minister's undertaking that we will have the required determination at a date that will give us an opportunity to disallow if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pleased to have had a copy of the agreed formula for determining the number of licensed collection centres. We have, and I believe the Opposition has, a pretty clear idea of exactly what to expect. I am also quite satisfied that the Parliament has, in this instance, conducted lengthy negotiations with the pathology industry. This is certainly not the case in radiology, given the difficulties that we are having in that area. It would be nice to see the same practice applied to radiology where all players are involved and not just some. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I accept the argument that it is desirable to see the entire package of legislation at the time of the presentation of the principal Bill. It would certainly make life much easier all around. In this case I do not believe the circumstances actually warrant holding up the passage of this package of Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of health insurance Bills, as Senator Lees has said, is a Budget measure and their purpose is to reduce the number of collection services in the pathology area. We are told the reason for the large number of collection services having to be reduced is that, if there are a large number of collection services, there will be an equally large number of pathology services ordered by the general practitioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services says that if there is a collection service just around the corner the general practitioner is more likely to say to a patient, `Oh well, we may as well have a blood test done', and then send the patient around to have a blood test. The Department has said that, because the collection centre is so close, the general practitioner will feel that he may as well use it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never heard anything quite so stupid in all my life. I think that general practitioners are, indeed, far more responsible than just ordering the odd test because a collection centre is close by. We certainly do not have that situation in our State.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say that the general practitioners whose practices are located near the collection centres would not use those services any more than the general practitioners whose practices are not situated close by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also told that there is anecdotal evidence&mdash;I would like to stress that it is anecdotal&mdash;that some general practitioners are getting kickbacks. How many general practitioners are getting kickbacks: one or two, 50, 500, or 1,000? I ask the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) whether there is any evidence&mdash;when I say evidence I do not want anecdotal evidence&mdash;that this is occurring. We have asked for the number of prosecutions that have taken place, as it is illegal to indulge in that practice. We have been told none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again that we really need more than anecdotal evidence. The Minister will not remember because he was not here at the time&mdash;looking around the chamber I cannot see anybody here who would remember, but I do&mdash;that a previous President of the Australian Medical Association, Lionel Wilson, was convinced by the Department of Health that there was considerable overservicing and fraud primarily by general practitioners. Some of the departmental officers present tonight may have been around at that time. Lionel Wilson was told that Dr Blewett, based on the Department's figures, was really going to attack the doctors. The Department, in its wisdom, had come up with an assertion that doctors in Australia were involved in overservicing and fraud to the extent of $100m. An overservicing and fraud detection service was set up in the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, Lionel Wilson, the President of the AMA, went public and said that he was ashamed to say this figure had indeed been proved by the Department, and he acknowledged it. Dr Blewett, in his typical fashion, went in for a tremendous amount of doctor bashing on the basis of those figures from the Department. Finally, Dr Blewett had to acknowledge that the figures that the Department had used were fatally flawed. Dr Blewett took the fraud and overservicing detention service away from the Department because it could not be trusted and gave it to the HIC. The Department had used figures that were totally wrong. The President of the AMA was then left saying to his colleagues, `Well, I am very sorry. I was fooled by accepting the Department's figures'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this rhetoric of anecdotal evidence was rife in 1983 when this Government came to power. That is what the Government is again doing. It is not bringing to this chamber any substantial evidence, just rhetoric. We have once again anecdotal evidence, nothing substantial, from the same Department of Health as we had when those fatally flawed figures were produced way back then. As I say, an apology was eventually given, but it was a little late as the damage was done. I just do not accept this anecdotal evidence and I hope the Minister will not accept it either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me get back to the Bill. The Government intends to cut the number of collection services to the pathology laboratories. What amazes me is that the number of collection services each laboratory should have will be reviewed annually. I suppose it depends whether the laboratory has increased or reduced its services in the last 12 months. I am not surprised that that comes from the Department because the bureaucrats have to build their castles and, if they do not have continuous annual checks, those departments cannot increase in number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pathologists have been consulted very widely on this issue. Madam Acting Deputy President, I remind you that this is a Budget Bill. The Minister will remember because he answered my question earlier on another Bill in one of the Committees. I asked him why the College of General Practitioners and the AMA were not consulted about the reduction of the $3.50 in the medical schedule rebate, and where the bulkbilled patients will have to make an up-front payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all remember the fiasco when the rebate was reduced from $3.50 to $2.50 and all the high jinks that went on in Caucus. The Government had originally decided that there had to be an up-front payment to make patients realise that the levy did not cover their health services and there was a cost to them visiting the general practitioner and it had chosen $3.50. A Caucus committee was set up which came up with the brilliant idea that we would cut the figure back to $2.50. But to make sure that the general practitioners were encouraged to bulkbill, the Government decided it would give them an extra dollar to bulkbill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister will also remember when I asked him why there was not consultation on this issue, because the doctors had been promised that, if there were going to be large changes, they would be consulted. I asked him about the additional Caucus committee decision to bring forward $12m to `reform the funding of general practices'. There were to be large, sweeping changes to general practice in this country in the areas of the use of practice grants, trialing the use of practice budgets, accreditation of general practices, supply and distribution of medical practitioners, and information technology. The Minister said, `We could not consult. It was a Budget Bill'. That was the answer the Minister gave me at that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, of course, we are debating another Budget Bill, with all the consultation in the world. The College of Pathologists has consulted widely with the Government and has agreed with the Government and has put up suggestions to the Government that have been implemented. The College agrees with the determinations that have been put up because the Government consulted it. It does not matter now that it was a Budget Bill. It mattered for the general practitioners and the AMA. It did not matter for the College of Pathologists. We may well ask why. What is the difference?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference is that the pathologists took the Government to the High Court and they won. So, of course, the Government does not want that sort of egg on its face again. It has respect for the College of Pathologists and so it will not take it on. Even though it is a Budget Bill, for some magical reason the Government is able to consult with the pathologists, but not with the general practitioners and the AMA. It said, `We could not do that because it was a Budget Bill', but it could consult with the pathologists. So I am not quite sure what the Minister's answer will be on this matter. Maybe he will just ignore it. He is getting some advice, but what use will that be to him?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to add in the final part of my speech a warning to the pathologists. I have already made this warning to the College when I spoke to someone there this morning. I said, `Are you aware of what this Government has done to the pharmacists?'. The pharmacists are now nationalised; they cannot open up a pharmacy wherever they like, whenever they like. They cannot enter into a free market situation. They have to be licensed. The Government says that they cannot open up a pharmacy in a country area if it does not think they should, if the restructuring authority does not believe there should be a pharmacy there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, if the Government thinks there should be a pharmacy there it will let the pharmacists open one but not if it does not agree with it. The pharmacists may think that they can make it go; they may think they can make a profit; they may think that it is a very good business venture, but if the Government does not want them to open then it will not let them. Up until now we have not even had an appeal mechanism for it. It has just come in now, and the restructuring authority has been going since 9 August 1990 with no appeal mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else has the Government done to the pharmacists? It told the pharmacists how much they would get paid&mdash;not how much they could charge but how much they would get paid&mdash;by the Government and how much they could charge as the result. But what the Government did not tell the pharmacists&mdash;we should remember that that agreement was done on volume of prescriptions and I am sure it was because it is a Budget Bill&mdash;is that there was going to be a payment up-front by pensioners of $2.50 which would cut the pharmacists' prescription numbers considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original agreement that was done on prescription volume is now scuttled because the prescription volume has altered so remarkably. This morning I said to the College of Pathologists, `Just bear in mind how familiar it all is. What you're agreeing to now is what the pharmacists agreed to a little while ago when they had that notorious agreement between Jim Matthews and the Government. They have lost the right to open where they want to and under this legislation you are losing the right to open a collection service where you want to. This is just the first step. In time you will be equally nationalised as the pharmacists have been. So don't come crying to us when it is all too late because you've agreed with the Government; you've negotiated with this socialist government; and you've watched the pharmacists being nationalised but you've done nothing about it yourself'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is exactly the same warning that I am giving the College of General Practitioners and the AMA. If they go along with this agreement and with these wonderful reforms of general practice where the Government tells them they can have a budget for their pathology and where the Government tells them they can have a budget for their pharmaceuticals and radiology&mdash;whereas to me a budget means that one sticks by it&mdash;what happens when one's budget is spent and one has 50 more patients lined up? What sort of service is one going to give then?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Health Insurance (Pathology) Bill is addressing the rising use of pathology. Medibank was brought in 18 years ago and what we are witnessing with this Bill is an attempt to control the dying throes of Medibank nee Medicare. What the Government is doing is saying, `Okay, we're going to cut pathology costs by limiting the number of collection centres' and that is the answer. But what has happened in the last 18 years? I do not think that the Government has woken up to the fact that there have been a few advances in science in the last 18 years. There are such things as cholesterol testing, which was not heard of 18 years ago in terms of availability, and also Papanicolaou smears for the testing of cervical cancer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The death rate from carcinoma of the cervix is rapidly decreasing because of the introduction of a scientific advance in pathology. The Minister would be aware that AIDS has developed in the last 10 years. Thousands of people are being tested and retested for AIDS; pathology tests are being done. Cytology for breast cancer has been introduced in the last 18 years. We have in-vitro fertilisation. I could go on for the next half an hour introducing the Minister and his Department to new tests that have been developed over the last 18 years. And one wonders why pathology is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allied to that, the population has increased in the last 18 years. It increases at 1.2 per cent per annum. In addition to that, we have an ageing population; two-thirds of the health care dollar is spent on people aged over 60 years and they get pathology tests. So the Department is trying to cut down on the number of pathology tests being done by cutting down on the number of collection centres. It is trying to stop the waves like King Canute. It will occur, whether the Minister, the Department or anybody else in Australia likes it. Science is advancing all the time; diseases are being conquered and new diseases are developing. That will continue, and yet the Minister seeks to cut the number of collection centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have waited until 1 o'clock in the morning to give the Minister this bit of knowledge. The departmental officers can put their pens to paper and write as hard as they like, but they will not stop the ageing of the population, the increasing number of people in the population who will have pathology tests, or the scientific advances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, with its sinking stinking corrupting Medicare, is trying to keep the sinking ship together by saying to the pathologists, `The cake is small and we will not get it any larger, despite these obvious demographic and scientific changes. The amount of money spent on pathology will not increase'. In the last five years we have seen the Medicare levy proportion of health care decrease from 25 per cent of government expenditure to 18 per cent. That is why the Government is trying to cut the pathology costs. Because the amount of money coming in is decreasing, it is trying to find the money out of revenue. We have the greatest recession that we have had in 60 years&mdash;a depression&mdash;because the taxation revenue is not coming in and the cake is getting smaller. So the Government is trying to control it by controlling things like pathology. That is what is occurring at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Minister should wake up to the fact that socialism has failed. It took 80 years for socialism to be proven to have failed in eastern Europe and Russia. That is what Medicare was based upon. It has taken 18 years for socialism to fail in relation to Medicare. The Government is trying to patch it together, stick it up with bandaids and stick it up other things too. It is trying to do that to the pathologists and other people within the community as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four great strands in society at the moment. There is the breakdown of socialism and the breakdown of governmental control which has been demonstrated in eastern Europe. The other strand that is emerging is the influence of the individual and the individual taking responsibility for his or her own health care. In our lifetimes we have seen the development of the naturopaths, herbalists, acupuncturists and whatever. People are wanting to go into those avenues. They are getting away from governmental control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third great strand which is occurring is the ageing of the population, as I have already mentioned; and the fourth is technology. Those strands are occurring throughout society and they are influencing health care as well. We have this demonstrated in the area of pathology, but there are many other examples as well. Yesterday in the other place the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Mr Howe, said that 78 per cent of all GP attendances are billed at or below the schedule and 2.9 per cent of all GP attendances are billed at or above the AMA level. Therefore, Medicare is working and bulkbilling has nothing to do with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did not say that there are more than four million pensioners, health care benefit cardholders, sickness benefit cardholders, health care cardholders and dependants in the community&mdash;nearly one quarter of the population. It has been traditional for the medical profession to bulkbill, or to charge them nothing above the rebate. It has always occurred; it has occurred since Hippocrates's days and it will occur in the future. That, of course, is part of our policy. Minister Howe did not say that two-thirds of health care expenditure is spent on people over the age of 60 years. They represent over 15 per cent of the population. He did not say that older people require more health care, and he did not say that more than 70 per cent of non-bulkbilled fees are already charged at close to AMA levels. It is the story of the big lie to patch up the stinking sinking ship of Medicare. It has to be paid for and, whether the Minister likes it or not, he will not do it via the direction in which he is heading with the changes he is trying to bring about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be another patch-up next week. After pathology it will be radiology. The Government will get the radiologists; it will stick it up the radiologists next time. It has done the GPs, it is doing the pathologists and it has done the pharmacists. It just will not work because people will not accept it. They will throw the Government out at the next election because we have a policy which will cope with all of those things. It is all so simple, if those opposite could only see it. But they are stuck with their ideology and they cannot get away from it. I am delighted, because those opposite will be hung with their ideology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four things need to be done: we need to encourage private insurance with a rebate system and subsidies to lower income earners and increase the Medicare levy for those people who do not insure&mdash;something which the Government was not game to do even though it fits with its ideology. We should allow comprehensive medical and hospital insurance because it will cost people whether we like it or not. They should be allowed to insure. But the Government has made it illegal under Medicare. It will not let people insure themselves for medical expenses&mdash;socialism at its worst.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been provoked into speaking on this package of health insurance Bills because it involves a matter of clear policy difference between the Government and the Opposition. There is a clear policy difference between what is in the best interests of the Australian people and what this Government has proposed. As my Senate colleagues have said tonight, we again have a situation where this Government is not seeking to nationalise&mdash;it has given up the idea of maintaining the ownership and control of the private sector&mdash;but it has realised that it can control things better by basically imposing this sort of legislation. It has done it in terms of a taxation and regulation system on private business, whereby the manufacturing sector in Australia now only has control over between 25 per cent and 28 per cent of its input costs. The Government has been doing it to medicine through Medicare for many years now, it has done it to the pharmacists, and now it is seeking to do it to the pathologists.</PARA></TALK.START>

The ideal system is certainly not the sort of system that we are lurching towards at the moment; it is not a system that would limit the number of collection points for pathology. Individuals can now in a scientific way have easy access to pathology services. Because of the progress we have made, we can move to a system where the old adage of prevention being better than cure can be achieved. As a prerequisite to that we want a pathology system that is readily available to all people across Australia.

It refers back to the point made by Senator Harradine relating to the late Senator Greenwood. With that sort of pathology service readily available, sending signals to patients at a fair price, we can ensure that medical service costs generally can be reduced because prevention is better than cure. The essence of a good pathology services system is to ensure that in the long term the benefits of early detection can reduce wasteful expenditure on other medical services and hospitals. What has this Government done? Its solution is to cut the number of collection centres. This is a Government that talks about providing medical services to the masses, to whoever needs them, but here they are seeking to restrict the access in a physical and practical way to those who need them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point about this Government's progress with Medicare, pathology, pharmaceuticals and medicine generally is the fact that this Government wishes to have more control over these things. We heard the Democrats via Senator Lees tonight say that the solution is not to go towards more private insurance, which will send price signals to the market in a very fair way so that our policy will allow people to insure for all these medical costs. Senator Lees would like to see us go towards more public provision of pathology services, with of course more control. It is clear from the Democrats' policies and from Senator Spindler's alternative budget&mdash;God help Australia!&mdash;that they believe in more public provision. It is quite clear from evidence around the world in the provision of any sort of service that if there is a difference between a public provision and a private provision, when the private sector does this in a competitive environment there are cost savings of between 10 to 25 per cent. </PARA>

I put it to both the Government and to the Democrats that increasing public control over this industry is not the way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to give two important examples to the Australian community of where pricing systems are so important. Two simple examples are the provision of water and the provision of air. People always thought that air and water could be provided for free. We have seen only today what happens when something is given away, where there is no pricing system. The water system in this country has been raped through stupid irrigation schemes and pollution from non-point sources by increasing the nutrients going into rivers. We saw on television tonight and have read about it in the papers the algal bloom which has broken out in Australia's once great rivers. It is only in recent times that we have seen the abuse of air&mdash;and I know that Senator Vallentine will be interested in this&mdash;because there is no pricing system. Air has been abused by the Western nations through pollution, and only now are we are realising the true cost of air pollution and the abuse of this other commodity where there is no pricing system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have used that important example of pricing systems to point to what is involved in this debate. In Australia in the past eight years we have seen a massive change involving people who provided for their own health needs moving to public provision. It has resulted in a decrease in the number of people who are privately insured. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS>! and the coalition's health policy, which Senator Herron and a number of other Liberal senators helped put together, clearly moves health provision towards private provision. As Senator Herron said, we give incentives to low income earners through rebates to provide for their own insurance. We ensure that all people will be able to insure for their own medical costs&mdash;they are not banned from doing so as they are by this current socialist government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as disease prevention diagnosis is concerned, it is quite right for Senator Herron to point to the necessity for those sorts of tests and the increasing need for them. With the growing sophistication and availability of those tests there will be a great number of them required. There is no doubt that there are inefficiencies in the provision of pathology services. There is evidence which was acknowledged by Senator Patterson and Senator Lees in their contributions where they indicated that they agreed with observations of, I think, a parliamentary accounts committee which pointed in the direction of over provision of pathology services. </PARA>

The general principles underlying this Bill were made clear to the chamber in the second reading speech. It is the undertaking I gave to Senator Patterson earlier today to generate for the benefit of the Senate the formula for determination of the number of licence collection centres. This formula was agreed by the pathology advisory committee at its meeting on 26 November 1991 as a basis for the Minister's determination under clauses 23D and B6 and 23D and B5 of the Pathology Amendment (No. 2) Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I understand that there is general agreement concerning these amendments. I will briefly outline the scope of the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two amendments to the Bill and two to the principal Act are necessary to allow the Health Insurance Commission to more efficiently administer the issuing of undertakings for approved pathology authorities and approved pathology practitioners. The amendments will prevent the possibility of medical benefits not being payable in the period between an undertaking being approved and receipt of the fee. They will also allow for the continuation of the previous undertaking when a new undertaking is accepted. The further two amendments relate to the correction of minor translations of the amendments into the principal Act in relation to accredited pathology laboratories. They are the amendments to the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill 1991. </PARA>

They skid around and say that it cannot be done because it is done on postcodes; it is not done on individual doctors. They know; I know; the computer people know. It is about time that Government members got up and admitted the truth, because it is reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other reasons I did not mention previously in relation to the increase in the number of pathology services is bulkbilling. Until that is eliminated, it is another item that is going to cause it to increase. Again, the Government is not prepared to do anything about that because it is another article of faith of Senator Schacht's socialism. It is another article of faith that belongs to the Medicare system. Senator Faulkner is another who subscribes. Proud socialists all, may they rest in peace after 1993. Because Government members are stuck with that, they are hoist on their own petard. It is not going to change, and I think that point should be noted too. The combination of bulkbilling, technology, ageing population, increasing science and the fact that unit pathology costs are going down is further evidence that these Bills will not achieve their objective. It is a pious hope of the Government and the Department. </PARA>

<PARA>The first amendment removes the restriction of no Medicare benefits being payable where a specimen is collected from an in-patient of a private hospital or day hospital facility by an employee, that is, a nurse or doctor of the hospital.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The effect of reflections from electrically conductive objects, such as buildings, fences, power lines and towers near the transmitting station can have a local effect upon the field strength. Under worst case conditions (very near the reflecting object) the field strength may be doubled, and under other quite different conditions, the field strength may be reduced to a very small value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because reinforcement of signals by reflections occurs only very close to the reflecting object, the likelihood of an increase of more than 6 dB is extremely remote. Nevertheless, to accommodate this effect and to be conservative, Professor Huey recommended the additional 6 decibel margin. As the Department of Defence has adopted the more stringent IRPA guidelines and there were no substantial reflecting structures within three kilometres of the transmitting site Professor Huey agreed that the additional margin was not necessary.</PARA>
