<TITLE>Tobacco Advertising</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio. That our Parliament immediately end this association between healthy sports and the deaths of 18,300 people in Australia each year from tobacco-related diseases.</PARA>

<TITLE>Air Landing Fee: New South Wales</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<TITLE>Report on Higher Education: Australian Capital Territory</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. We, the undersigned, wish to signify our strong opposition to the Chubb Report on Higher Education for the A.C.T. which proposes that the Institute of Advanced Studies be separated from the Faculties of the Australian National University and the Faculties be amalgamated with the University of Canberra. We believe that the implementation of these proposals would mean the destruction of the Australian National University's national and international high standing and firmly established reputation as a centre of excellence in research and scholarship. The dismemberment of the ANU would severely affect the ability of both the Institute and the Faculties to attract, or even retain, high quality academic staff, funding and support. It would also adversely affect the recruitment of top students. The maintenance of the Australian National University, as it is now constituted-a national university with an international, national and local role-is of vital importance to the A.C.T. and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>2. We call on the Senate to reject the recommendations of the Chubb report and to support the integrity of the ANU and the existing relationship between the Institute and the Faculties.</PARA>

<TITLE>AIDEX Exhibition</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and senators in the Senate assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>The petition of the undersigned shows the very deep concern of people in the community against the proposed AIDEX exhibition of weapons of war in our country. We firmly believe that it is not in Australia's interest to become dealers in death and destruction. Particularly at this time when our planet's environment is in a parlous condition and demands statesman-like leadership to the world on its rehabilitation. We therefore ask that:-</PARA>
<PARA>The Exhibition to take place be one which shows instead the ways in which we aim to overcome the dangers to our world from poisoned soil, air and water by high-lighting the need for tree-planting, solar-powered homes, electric cars, etc. as a means of attacking the global warming and other hazards to our fragile environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, honourable senators will be aware that Senator Spindler has for some time been concerned about the level of fines and penalties applying under the Trade Practices Act (TPA). Indeed, he had originally requested that those matters be the subject of particular attention by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the course of the inquiry relating to which he has given notice of a motion. Senator Spindler has agreed not to pursue this matter at this time. This is because I have indicated that the whole question of the level of penalties under the TPA is under active consideration by the Government at this time and I can assure him that indeed the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is giving close and active attention to the question of penalties and remedies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night, when the debate was adjourned, I was developing my arguments in defence of the position I had taken about a particular notice of motion that I had given last year. I did note that Senator Bishop rushed in to show her ignorance of the Standing Orders and had not even given me a chance to finish my speech and my arguments, and in doing so misrepresented me about three times. But I will deal with those misrepresentations some other time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic problem is that those of whom I speak are so proud of the Senate and all they believe it stands for, they so revere it, that they have allowed themselves continually to overstep the mark in defending it, promoting it and manipulating it. They believe, perhaps unconsciously, that the ends as they see them justify the means. They have become too involved in their political agenda that they are insufficiently dispassionate and disinterested. They have convinced themselves that, because what they espouse is not party based, they are not being political. But they are political as much as, probably more than, any of us who are involved in the thick of party politics. They have become active players going beyond giving procedural advice to involving themselves in the process. They try to run the Senate, not just the Department of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that they would not disagree with my assessment, believing not just that it is their right to do so but that it is their duty. To support that I need only quote from a recent article by Peter O'Keeffe, the Clerk-Assistant, Committees-he was Clerk-Assistant, Procedure, at the time-espousing this duty. In an article in the Table journal he refers to `the power . . . of the role of Clerks of Parliament'. He asserts that `they are the hinges around which the actual business of Parliament revolves. They are, in a sense, stage-managers with a risk-laden, proactive role'. </PARA>
<PARA> Later in the article he talks about `Australian Clerks attempting to perform their role as guardians of the procedural equity that is the touchstone of any real parliamentary assembly', and refers to Clerks being `trustees, the trust property being constitutional parliamentary government'. He says that `there are essentially only two elements of continuity in a parliament, the institution itself and the clerkship'. It strikes me that that is an invoking of a higher duty than one's actual job. It is very reminiscent to me of that former South Australian Police Commissioner who invoked his higher duty to the Crown to justify overriding his real duty. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one suggests that the Clerks have any duty to the Government, this one or any other. It is not their job to promote or defend this Government or any other Government. They should not do anything to support the Government; nor should they continually oppose and attack the Government. It is not their job to undermine any Government or otherwise give aid to an Opposition, other than in a correct manner concerning procedure. Neither of these would be an appropriately independent position. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the partisanship is against the Government and against this one in particular because it is the current one. Over time, it may well be against all governments and I do not think that that is an appropriately independent position. I support the independence of the Clerks very strongly and that is why I took the action of requesting that they observe their independence and neutrality. They are in one of those few jobs which demand absolute political propriety. The Australian Electoral Commissioner would be one of the few others. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree that in their private lives they must be absolute political neuters. Show me someone who claims not to have an ideology, to have no politics or to be absolutely unbiased and that person will inevitably be an ideological conservative. But publicly, in their official positions, they must be absolutely clean so that there can be no hint of prejudice. Unfortunately, we do not have that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no excuse that the grand tradition of Clerks over the years has done this to other governments and that their successors will do the same. It is myself and the Government Party of which I am a member that are being attacked right now. Some of the critical statements of which I complain may well be true. Some of the criticism may be fair; some of it I might even agree with. In fact, some of it I do agree with. The Clerk might be surprised to discover that I agree with some of his criticisms, but that is not the point. The point is that it should not be the Clerk of the Senate voicing those criticisms and expressing those opinions. It is for the Opposition, or lobby groups, or academics, or media commentators, writers of letters to the editor to say those things and for all those people to say them as loudly as they like. It is not for those in the peculiarly sensitive position of Clerk to say them in an official capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that some politicians sometimes do behave badly-but it is not for the Clerks to say so. I acknowledge that governments do not always act to make it easy for non-government members and senators to have their say-but I do not think it is for the Clerks to say so. Oppositions do not always act with total propriety and reasonableness-but again it is not for the Clerks to say so. </PARA>
<PARA> So it ought to be now clear, even if it was not clear all along, why I objected to the published statements I listed in that motion. It was not meant to be a complete or comprehensive list. There probably have been more objectionable writings over the years but they are amongst the more recent writings which serve to annoy many of my colleagues and to push me to take the action that I have. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just quote some extracts to illustrate what I take exception to. In the particular article in the House Magazine concerning reference of Bills to Senate Committees, the Clerk uses the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>There are some members who do not attach the same importance to scrutiny of legislation, and some who consider that the only business of Parliament is to pass the bills proposed by the Government as speedily as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>In my mind, that is said with disapproval and it is criticism of certain honourable senators. It might be true but it is not for the Clerk to say so. The article also talks about:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian governments seeking to rigidly control every stage of the legislative process, and in committing themselves to every line and punctuation mark of each government bill from the time of its introduction. This peculiar insistence on total control is supported by a morbid dread of legislative proposals being interfered with and delayed by parliamentary action. Parliamentary processes in themselves are seen as subversive and something to be avoided if at all possible. This political culture provides the greatest barrier to any changes which aim at greater scrutiny of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>There is much there that I would agree with. But the Clerk is involving himself in the political process by making those sorts of comments. It is a highly gratuitous sort of commentary. That article also contains what I believe is a prejudiced and not entirely accurate view of questions surrounding the procedure for the referral of Bills to committees. I suspect I should not take time now to try to correct that record but it is another indication of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the Australian Associated Press report, of which I complained, in which the Clerk is referred to as seeing the central problem as governments wanting to push legislation through quickly with little regard for scrutiny, and non-government parties wanting greater scrutiny but with little regard for time constraints. Later the article says:</PARA>
<PARA>There also was a need to consider doing away with an anomaly that saw the Government with a majority on the bills committees when it did not have a majority in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>There is also reference to the fact that some government people seem to be disregarding the process. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA> `They think that the name of the game is to use the numbers on committee to push through whatever they want to push through and that's it' . . . Mr Evans said the major parties' control over their members was to blame. `If a rubber stamp system persists, well, nothing can be made to work' . . .</PARA>
<PARA>They are very political comments and, if they are not criticising and insulting certain honourable senators, I do not know what is. It also included a reference to a fawning article in praise of former Senator McGauran, about how he beat the Government with repeated snide comments about the Government and governments generally. I found it a particularly sickening piece. I can accept that, but I think it is entirely inappropriate for a supposedly independent Clerk Assistant to be publishing such material. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some wonderful quotations in the article-wonderful for former Senator McGauran-such as, `His later restrained and statesmanlike contributions illustrate the care and sensitive handling that a private Senator's Bill needs and the self-restraint that its sponsor must exhibit'. That is just one example of that sort of quote, which will be very useful for former Senator McGauran to put in his next campaign pamphlet, which emphasises my point that Senate Clerks should never say anything that could be used in an election context, whether it be in praise of one honourable senator or in condemnation of a group of honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I seem to remember another article a little time ago, also by the Clerk Assistant, Committees, which was in high praise of Senator Cooney and his work on regulations and ordinances, or perhaps it was on scrutiny of Bills. I found that embarrassing at the time. I should have said something at the time-I regret I did not-but I do say it now. I disapprove of such commentary, whichever side it is about, and I trust Senator Cooney will not quote from that piece when he is next seeking preselection or election. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say on a personal level that I find it awkward when I receive praise from a Clerk, say, for a committee report I have been involved in preparing, especially if that report involves criticism of the Government. It leaves me with a sense of unease, because I would rather there was not the implication of my deserving approving noises for having done something on the approved Senate agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> In this same article about former Senator McGauran there are other examples of this problem of the writer becoming involved in the political process. I cannot find the quote just at the moment, but it refers to the assistance given in the preparation of a Bill. Peter O'Keeffe has revealed himself in the article I referred to before, the one about Clerks and members of parliament published in the Table. He openly talks about his and other Clerks' agenda. He refers to it as the `clerkly' parliamentary agenda. He proposes free votes, the breakdown of unnecessary party discipline, crossing the floor on matters of conscience, appointment of non-party political Presiding Officers, avoidance of joint select committees, the promotion of independent parliamentary education, in-House control of essential parliamentary services, in-House administration of salaries, et cetera, and House control of its own appropriations, which is an impossible thing. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that some or all of those things are perfectly appropriate things to be promoted, but not by those who are in that very sensitive position. The Clerk himself, at the Estimates Committee, gave no hint of disagreeing with any part of that amazing agenda. I happen to agree with the Clerk Assistant's criticism of the growth of the policy on managerialism; but again, I do not think that it is his place to make the criticism. It is, I suppose, just part of the power play of this place; the exercise of power is very important to some people. It is just that the people the subject of this speech and that former notice of motion of mine, who are seeking to use and expand the power they undeniably have by virtue of their positions, were never elected by anybody, and they should be very careful not to misuse their undoubted power. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the time to go into other issues involving other battles. The debate about the correctness or otherwise of all sorts of actions in this place will no doubt go on. I instance the continuing dispute over the so-called continuing orders and the question of the conference marking 20 years of the Senate committee system. But before concluding, I should deal with the press statement which Senator Harradine issued on the day I gave notice of this motion. I saw Senator Harradine's press statement only when it was reproduced in the House Magazine. I would like to deal with some of the misrepresentations in that. He referred to my notice and said, `By tradition, parliamentary Clerks do not enter public controversy, certainly not with senators'. That is, I guess, what I am saying should be the position. But by the sound of things, judging by the reaction to what I did, they do, and they rely on senators not responding. It just happens that I was pushed into responding. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine also tried to suggest that my motion was attempting to `bring them to heel', and that I was really attacking the independence of the Senate. He accused me of wanting to prevent the full development of the Senate committee system. I would have thought that everybody around here knew that I was a supporter of the Senate committee system and the way it can operate. There may be some matters of detail about process that I have differences with other people on, but it is a bit much to extrapolate from that that somehow I want to undermine the whole system. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine said that when this system for the referral of Bills to committee commenced earlier this year, `Senator Coates emerged as the proponent of the view whose implementation would have hobbled the Committees and prevented them utilising their powers to the fullest'. That is just nonsense. Certainly I had a view about the process, but it is nonsense to say that I wanted to hobble the committees. Senator Harradine's statement went on:</PARA>
<PARA>I can well remember the first meeting of one of those Committees where Senator Coates tried to put his approach to members of the Committee during a closed meeting while I chose to remain outside in the corridor. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely untrue. I was, as was Senator Harradine, outside in the corridor for more than half an hour waiting for that Committee to finish its private meeting as it debated its procedures. In no way did I attempt to enter the debate in that Committee and I was not in the room at the time. Somehow or other, Senator Harradine got his information wrong on that point. Then Senator Harradine went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coates' approach was to `kneecap' the Clerks by discouraging them from giving impartial advice to Senators who want to fight the powerful position of the Executive Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I can only repeat the point that I made earlier, that I have no problem whatsoever on the question of procedural advice. Of course that job ought to be done in that independent way. </PARA>
<PARA> My only regret about having raised these issues rather than continuing the silence of the years past about Clerks past is that my comments have served only to confirm the `clerkist' hierarchy's distaste, even disdain, for politicians and to confirm them in their own view of the importance of their office and the views that they espouse. So I assume that they will wear my complaints as a badge of honour. However, that comment brings home to me my opinion that it is arrogant to suggest that the Clerks are the only ones committed to democracy and correct behaviour, because I believe they are wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coates' unwarranted comments require an immediate response. Perhaps the greatest insult or hurt a person can direct to another is to impugn that person's professional integrity. Last night, and again this morning, Senator Coates, initially apologetically but later more deliberately, cast unprecedented aspersions and accusations against a number of Clerks in the Senate. This was a cowardly attack against diligent, hardworking professional officers who cannot defend themselves. To imply that so many officers were guilty is so outrageous as to show the absurdity of the allegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Clerks in this place are justly proud of the traditions and the role of this Senate as a House of review. In upholding this responsibility, this Senate has a position enshrined in the Constitution. It is unfortunate that the Clerks are faced with those who seek to destroy this upper House by techniques of trying to tag the office-holders with an insult not befitting their position. </PARA>
<PARA> This Senate plays an integral part in the delicate system of checks and balances which is so essential in a parliamentary democracy. I find the remarks of Senator Coates, as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, a committee which is involved in the accountability process, strange, to say the least. Only last week I participated in a seminar conducted by the Queensland Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, which grappled with the twin issues of scrutiny and public accountability. Having established processes at a federal level that are unequalled in the Western world, democratic representation in this place has a responsibility to strengthen, not to weaken, the threads of the fabric which bind democracy together. </PARA>
<PARA> This attack is not merely on the freedom of professional speech. It is also an attack on the Senate. I remind honourable senators that the aspersions were directed to more than one person. The independence, the integrity and the pride of office of the Clerks is essential to the goodwill, the harmony and the efficient running of this chamber. A suggestion of politicisation smacks of distrust, which, if not halted, will destroy much of the faith that senators and the wider community have in this Senate. I sincerely trust that given the reflective wisdom of hindsight, Senator Coates may yet regret this unfortunate foray. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Senate Estimates Committee A review of the Australian Taxation Office, the oral answers given by the Taxation Office were of an exceedingly high standard. They sought to fulfil an attitude of the Office's leader, Trevor Boucher, to continue applying a philosophy of the year of service. The approach of the officers present was indeed gratifying. However, because of the pressures of time, a number of questions were taken on notice. Unfortunately, the quality of those responses varied considerably. They are very uneven across-the-board. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to a number of those responses. I asked a question on notice at page A157 of the Estimates Hansard about a raid on the offices of the Beneficial Finance Corporation by the Australian Federal Police-Australian Taxation Office. I asked a simple question:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it true that the information obtained in the course of the joint ATO/Federal Police raids, could have been obtained under the ATO's own powers as part of the routine audit it was then conducting?</PARA>
<PARA>I also asked what guidelines existed to assist the Office in determining whether to call in the police during the course of a taxation audit. The answer was less than satisfactory. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of information obtained in the course of the tax audit, matters were referred by the Australian Taxation Office to the Director of Public Prosecutions-</PARA>
<PARA>That was noted in my question, but that was not an appropriate response-</PARA>
<PARA>who in turn sought Australian Federal Police inquiries. Having regard to the tax related nature of the inquiries, the AFP sought and obtained ATO assistance in the course of its exemption of search warrants it obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>Police raids in our society are indeed a chilling experience. Before calling in the police on such dramatic and draconian occasions, it behoves government instrumentalities, authorities and officers to use the full information that is available to them, internally in this case, through the conduct of a normal tax audit. Where this information is available they should pursue a normal course of action. After all we are not a police state. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken on more than one occasion of the denigration of taxpayers' rights in recent years. Such action frightens individuals. We should not have an instrument of government acting in such a high-handed manner on the one hand and on request failing to provide guidelines to the Senate when asked when there were not any such guidelines available. If not, raids in such situations are quite unsatisfactory. I think it is a further demonstration that there must be a proper legislative base for Australian Taxation Office administration, particularly under this system of self-assessment that we are increasingly moving towards. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to comments by Mr Martin Crowe, head of group taxation from the National Bank. He is echoing sentiments that are growing in intensity, throughout professional journals, in relation to taxation:</PARA>
<PARA>Only in a climate of certainty can business operate efficiently. Every time a ruling is issued or a decision handed down which alters the previous interpretation of the tax law, it impacts on business. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>With a great deal of trumpeting, the Australian Taxation Office . . . heralded the 1989/90 financial year as `the year of service'. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that 1991 will be the year when the Government seriously addresses the need to provide a legislative tax base for self-assessment, so that we can have a high degree of certainty in taxation administration and practice. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Crowe says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . while statistics can be produced to show that in a significant number of cases assessments were issued earlier, objections were determined quicker and correspondence was answered sooner, little progress seems to have been made with the fundamental problems of clarifying the tax laws and providing greater certainty about their meaning. </PARA>
<PARA>He says also:</PARA>
<PARA>A major cause for adjustment on audits by revenue authorities is the uncertainty in the various revenue laws. This uncertainty allows both parties to adopt diametrically opposed positions, which can only be settled by prolonged litigation, or, in the context of an audit, by an agreed amount of tax being paid as an expeditious settlement of the whole audit. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very unsatisfactory method for the conduct of tax and the payment of tax in Australia. The suggestion by Mr Crowe of the National Bank is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The redeployment of some resources away from audit towards a `relationship' environment would be akin to adopting a preventative approach to tax compliance. </PARA>
<PARA>I welcome that suggestion, which continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Such an approach should lead to less disputation and litigation, and less opportunity for taxpayer and Tax Office to take diametrically opposed views. </PARA>
<PARA>I await with some enthusiasm the response from the Government on this matter. I refer to the frequency of recent Tax Office announcements and press statements relating to the tax file number, which give the impression that failure to lodge the notification document for the tax file number will result in tax being deducted on dividends and interest at the maximum rate. On the other hand, I refer to a letter from a leading firm of chartered accountants which indicates that it is not necessary to lodge such a declaration where corporations pay fully franked dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> This is another example of the sort of uncertainty that people are having to grapple with in the area of tax compliance nowadays: the Tax Commissioner, on the one hand, giving one view; a leading firm of accountants sending circular letters giving another view. This is really quite frightening and is quite inconsistent with this whole concept of certainty in this area, where a taxpayer has to self-assess and pay the cheque without immediate verification by the Tax Office. Later the taxpayer may be subject to a tax audit down the track with very heavy penalties when in error. </PARA>
<PARA> In moving to another issue, I ask the Minister to notify the Senate of whether, for example, there is an obligation on the part of banks and other financial institutions paying interest to provide documentary evidence to a taxpayer where tax has been deducted from interest or other income in circumstances where the tax file number has not been quoted and the financial institution has deducted tax at 48.25 per cent from that payment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, most recipients of such interest merely received a one-line interest component on a bank statement. I believe that there should be some instruction that there is a document available to the recipients of interest which specifies the gross, the tax and the net amount on that document. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer to discussions of the National Tax Liaison Group in relation to what is known as division E of the Income Tax Assessment Act, in circumstances where interest on investment is paid on a term longer than one year. Again, I ask the Minister: does the Government intend to amend the legislation, and if so, when is the amendment likely to be introduced into the Senate to clarify the position in relation to the timing of interest assessability on these particular investments?</PARA>
<PARA> At page A131 of the Hansard report of the same inquiry, I raised the question whether, in considering the withholding tax exemption granted under section 128 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, a distinction ought to be made between onlending by large institutional entities and on-lending by a bank. The answer, I believe, was not correct. I wish to comment on the answer, and I also seek leave, Madam Deputy President, to incorporate the answer in Hansard so that my comments can be seen in the context of that answer. I seek the leave of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator Watson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hansard Page A131</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>QUESTION:</PARA>
<PARA> The question raised by Senator Watson is whether, in considering if a withholding tax exemption should be granted under section 128f, a distinction ought to be made between onlending by a large industrial entity and onlending by a bank?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER:</PARA>
<PARA> The implication of the question is that subparagraph 128f (4) (b) (ii) applies to onlending by a large industrial company so that to get an exemption it has to show that the funds will be used by a resident in the operations of an Australian business, or for the establishment or acquisition of an interest in such a business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office agrees with this view and has publicly said so in Taxation Ruling IT 2238 issued in December 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the withholding tax exemption available through section 128f is subject to money being used for stated purposes, it is necessary for an applicant for an exemption to demonstrate an appropriate connection between the obtaining of funds and the use of those funds for prescribed purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy underlying the use of funds requirement is that of assisting the development of Australian resources and the economy generally. </PARA>
<PARA> If a distinction were to be drawn between onlending by banks and onlending by other entities, it would create the possibility of widespread avoidance of interest withholding tax by interposting an Australian bank for transactions which would fail the Australian business use requirement. It could also result in Australia being used as a tax haven to avoid other countries' taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The ATO is working with the banking industry to develop procedures that will enable them to obtain exemptions in appropriate cases. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My main concern regarding the Taxation Office reply to the question is that the answer does not reflect the law as set out in the Income Tax Act. In particular, the answer that I have incorporated fails to explain-simply because, I think, the Tax Office cannot explain it-why subparagraph 128f(4) (b) (ii) does not apply to banks. On the face of it, this subparagraph applies to an entity that uses funds borrowed offshore in its Australian business. There is nothing in the Income Tax Act which limits this test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the context of an alternative test, in subparagraph 2, it provides an additional way of satisfying the Act, where the money-borrowing entity is not itself in business at all, and acts as a conduit for the funds. In those circumstances, the end user must naturally be carrying on the relevant Australian business. The special purpose borrowing vehicle in the manufacturing group which on-lends to an operating company in the group, would be the classic example. </PARA>
<PARA> The point at issue here has the potential for a huge economic impact on banks in Australia. First, if the Commissioner is now saying that only bank borrowings which are on-lent to other Australian businesses will obtain the exemption from withholding tax, a large portion of domestic banking activity will simply fail to qualify. This would include, for example, home mortgage lending, temporary short term money market investments of liquid funds, and repaying interest on previous borrowings which were on-lent to an Australian company which subsequently defaulted, for example, on its interest payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, if this new approach is applied retrospectively-which I have been told is the intention-a number of banks will have their exemption retrospectively denied in respect of offshore borrowing, going back 18 months. This is quite an unacceptable position for anybody to be in. This is a function of the way the Tax Office is currently administering this provision. It is not good enough, in that returns are made quarterly in arrears applying for exemption certificates. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of such certificates has ceased in respect of some borrowings in some centres but not in others. We have some cases of borrowings up to 18 months ago yet the Australian Taxation Office refuses to give, and has not given, a formal reason. In terms of open government, in terms of 1989-90 being the year of service, this does not measure up to the very high standards that the Taxation Office aspires to reach. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of some concern is fraud within the Australian Taxation Office. Mr Vince Mitchell gave me a very adequate response to what I had asked. There is also a second aspect-the revelations by the Independent Commission Against Corruption which were made on 11 March 1991. In that circumstance it was revealed that private or confidential information from the Taxation Office was sold to clients by a private inquiry agent. We naturally asked what processes had been instituted. A response came to that. But, not long after, we had the revelations on the front page of a Sydney newspaper, the Telegraph Mirror, on 29 April 1991, where it was alleged that tax file numbers were being sold as part of a massive fraud racket involving millions of dollars of PAYE revenue being lost. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember that at the time of the debate a number of my colleagues, including Senator Walters, indicated that the so-called integrity of the tax file number would give to those people who had access an unprecedented opportunity for profit. I am concerned that the allegation raised in this newspaper, which indicated that false tax file numbers were being sold in hotels for $250 each, was not mentioned when we raised the question about fraud within the Australian Taxation Office, because there was a response to that article by the Taxation Office which indicated that employees had been charged internally. There should have been a much more honest and full account given to the Senate either during that inquiry or at a later time through written answers. The situation is just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> I also call on the Government to take an early opportunity to clarify the position of investors holding worthless shares writing those shares off in circumstances other than sale where it is impossible to execute a sale by reason of a company being insolvent, unable to trade and in the hands of a liquidator. Surely it is not beyond the powers of the Government, if it has the desire and the will, to assist ordinary people who have lost money as a result of poor investments, as a result of fraudulent decisions, as a result of entrepreneurial activity which hoodwinked honest investors, to write off the cost of that investment as a deduction against capital gains instead of having to trade them through an active stock exchange market where normal transfers are possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances that I am outlining it is impossible to effect the transfer, with the company being in liquidation, until that corporation is actually wiped off. Very few actually get wiped off because there is not sufficient administrative money left to warrant such action and everything is just left in a heap. As a consequence, thousands of taxpayers are left with higher tax commitments than they might otherwise have because of the failure of the Government to recognise a situation of loss. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter raised during the Senate Estimates processes was the industry statement in relation to depreciation. There are quite a number of situations that clearly the Government had not envisaged. We certainly hope that taxpayers will not be denied legitimate tax deductions as a result of the pooling arrangements and circumstances where an asset as part of the pool is sold during the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw attention to matters which have been canvassed by the Tax Institute of Australia. Firstly, it draws attention to certain imprecise impressions on taxation in the booklet that accompanied that industry statement, that is that the new rules apply from 1 July 1991. While that in itself was not an incorrect statement, the application of broad-banding of the rates and pooling is to all taxpayers who have a substituted accounting period. That substituted period can quite easily commence before 1 July 1991 but is in lieu of the period 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> The booklet also makes no reference to the comment which was made in the Treasurer's statement of 12 March 1991 that taxpayers exercising the option to self-assess depreciation rates will be required to annotate their tax returns to that effect. In the view of the Tax Institute of Australia and in the view of any tax practitioners, not to include that statement in the depreciation booklet is likely to mislead taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is apparent to the Taxation Office, if not to the Government, that there are members of the tax liaison group who are presently seeking clarification through the Treasurer's office of the meaning of this term `effective life'. I do not think the Government has really thought this out. We hope that there will be amendments and we press the Minister in this chamber at the present time, Senator Button, who has a major interest in this area, to ensure that amendments are made to the depreciation booklet and the matters are clarified when the legislation is presented to the Senate. We await the outcome of those submissions and those discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> I now ask the Minister about the status of the Government's Budget decision last year to repeal, as an economy and as a cost-saving measure, the hardship provisions that apply to small taxpayers who are unable to meet their tax debts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman has the administrative responsibility of the Hardship Relief Board under section 265 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. At a recent hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration inquiry into the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman made the remark that it was his belief that the Government would not be proceeding with that Budget cost-saving measure. As it was in the Budget and as the Senate does not have another tax Bill coming before it prior to the Budget session, other than the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, I believe that the Government should give an account of what it intends to do in this area. Will the Board be abolished? Why should it be left to the Ombudsman to clarify the position to a Senate committee? Should not an announcement be made by the responsible Minister and, if there is going to be a change or a replacement, should it not be reflected in legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> I also draw attention to the question of the need for legislative change in relation to a number of issues which became very apparent arising from the audit of the Adsteam Group and unprecedented actions over matters involving the Patcorp decision. Will the Government consider a legislative amendment? When can the Senate expect a proper legislative base? One of those areas concerns a new interpretation and, secondly, the need to put in place legislatively a taxation practice which is inconsistent with taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA> One Australian Taxation Office practice involving nominee shareholdings currently works for the benefit of taxpayers, but there is no legislative base for that taxation practice. Such unlegislative practices are not desirable in this context of the certainty that I referred to earlier. There is a need to regulate Taxation Office practice. There is a need, in the interests of self-assessment, that there be certainty before the law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 5). However, at the outset, let me say that the Australian Democrats concur with the remarks of Senator Watson to the effect that the independence of the Clerks needs to be guaranteed. They are, indeed, the guardians of this Senate, and they are entitled to express views which assist in performing that task.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the subject of Aussat Pty Ltd. Eight years and some countless hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money later, Aussat has managed to capture less than 2 per cent of Australia's total communications market. Because of its charter Aussat has been forced to cater to the unprofitable 2 per cent, the public sector utilities-the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and remote commercial television services. </PARA>
<PARA> If Aussat had been a commercial enterprise and not simply a matter of political expediency or political misjudgment, the A-series satellite would never have left station earth. Instead, some $600m of public funds have ended up unaccounted for in some black hole in outer space. At no stage in the history of Aussat was public pressure brought to bear for its establishment. It was a symbol of the Fraser Government's grand vision and the bureaucratic push to dish it up to Telecom Australia and Telecom unions. However, the taxpayers, through direct Government and Telecom equity and the continuing Commonwealth Bank leverage lease arrangements, have been paying for an expensive technology that has long been superseded by cheaper terrestrial telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Aussat debacle is the Commonwealth Government's equivalent of the Victorian Economic Development Council scandal, so far the taxpaying public has had no explanation, and no admission of fault or responsibility. By selling off Aussat to the new telecommunications carrier the Government thinks it can bury the true cost to the taxpayer of this piece of space junk. </PARA>
<PARA> The original bad planning cannot be laid at this Government's door but, in 1986, when the expensive B-series was planned, the Hawke Government could have pointed to the Fraser Liberal Government's folly of pursuing this and walked away with only a minor debt on its hands. It did not. The political juggernaut continued to roll and the Hawke Government compounded the mistake by pouring good money after bad. </PARA>
<PARA> Against all available expert advice, the second generation B-series satellites were commissioned and ordered at a cost of $440m to the Australian taxpayer. But that was back in 1986 when television stations changed hands for a ridiculous multiple of earnings and Kerry Packer sold the Channel 9 network to his mate, Perth businessman Alan Bond, for $1.2 billion. In the two years until the deal was signed in 1988, the Government did have time to reconsider its purchase with the introduction of new terrestrial developments, which Telecom had forecast since 1976 before the launch of the A-series. </PARA>
<PARA> The purchase of the B-series satellites, which are to be launched in 1992, was another exercise in grandiosity that pales into insignificance besides Christopher Skase's egotistical attempts to buy United Artists and Warwick Fairfax's privatisation vision for the Fairfax group. Nevertheless, the purchase of the B-series was in the same class as the devil-may-care, someone else will pay for it entrepeneurialism that has given Australia a bad name. Like Skase, like Fairfax, like Bond, the Australian Government expects someone else to foot the bill for its own imprudent extravagance. Having gift-wrapped Aussat in fibre cable, the Government has hopes of selling it to a willing new telecommunications carrier anxious to enter the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> The full extent of the Government's imprudence, bad management and lack of supervision should have become known earlier this week when the Department of Transport and Communications (DOTAC) answered questions the Australian Democrats put to the Senate Estimates Committee. Since the sale of Aussat is going to be the entry price for the new telecommunications carrier, it is only right and proper that Australian taxpayers know the true state of Aussat's finances. But we do not, and the answers we have received certainly do not enlighten us. So the big question now is: how much is the Australian taxpayer to keep paying after Aussat is sold?</PARA>
<PARA> Even after it is sold, the reasons why it failed are not going to go away. From its early beginnings, Aussat was given a strictly commercial charter. But its specific obligations were exclusively to public sector entities: the ABC, SBS and remote commercial television services. These community service obligations, one of the main reasons behind Australia acquiring its own national regional satellite, will still have to be funded by the public purse.</PARA>
<PARA> Unless the Government has other plans, privatised Aussat under new ownership will still be carrying these essential but non-commercially viable services. For how long will a foreign owned, multinational telecommunications conglomerate wear such Australian idiosyncrasies? For how long, I ask? No matter how many times the Australian Democrats have asked about Aussat's true financial situation to ascertain its viability, I believe we have been fobbed off. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Government persuaded Telecom to sell back its 25 per cent stake in Aussat for $25m, without even placing a value on its 100 per cent value. This is just absurd. Telecom Australia has invested $50m in Aussat over the course of the project. What happened to the other $25m? Does anyone care about this? The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) has already stated he will sell Aussat free of debt. It remains unclear whether, in transferring debt, the Government has assumed responsibility for Aussat's entire loan-lease arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Does the Government continue paying the Hughes Corporation, which is building the B-series generation, or will the new owners continue to make outstanding payments on the second generation? Has the Government transferred all of Aussat's liabilities or just its debt? And at what point is the debt transferred?</PARA>
<PARA> These are not nitpicking questions. It is very important for us to know the answers, to enable us to determine how the cost of the second generation satellites is being apportioned between the public and Aussat's new owners. But that is precisely what the Government does not want us to know. Can we assume that the bid from the new telecommunications carrier will reflect the price paid for the satellites, or is the Government going to make its decisions based on a broader range of concerns other than strict commercial viability?</PARA>
<PARA> Aussat's assets were valued last year at $670m. Its total liabilities at the time were $590m. We do not know the extent of the liabilities incurred by Aussat in the past 12 months. When the British Telecom rival, Mercury, entered the British market-about three times larger than Australia's-it invested #1.1 billion during the first five years of its gradual introduction. If the new carrier licence fee were set to equate with Aussat's current liabilities of $600m-or maybe more, since the Government will not tell us the true debt level-the entry price would be too high when compared with the British experience. If the new carrier licence is less, as we can expect it to be given the Government's desperation, how is the debt going to be apportioned between the new carrier and the Australian taxpayer?</PARA>
<PARA> We are left wondering what the true value is of gaining entry into Australia's telecommunications market. The Government has been so busy covering its Aussat mistakes that that question remains unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA> If the B-series fails to launch first time from China in 1992, who bears the multimillion dollar cost-the new owners or the taxpayers? The Government is aware of the non-commercial viability of Aussat. In a desperate bid to provide a market for satellite capacity that is grossly uncompetitive against terrestrial networks, the Department of Transport and Communications is trying to sell the Government and the public the idea of offering a pay TV and a public mobile service licence. As it is, the public would not want to buy shares in Aussat, so the Government must do something to sweeten the sale. </PARA>
<PARA> Satellite pay TV failed in the United States in the early 1980s and is failing in the British market now, despite these markets being respectively 12 times and three times bigger than the Australian market. Australia, with two television networks in dire straits and a radio industry on the brink of insolvency, does not need another broadcaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Mobilesat is seen as the other great white hope to create a satellite market out of the bush. The target market for the Mobilesat telephone service is the non-urban, predominantly rural, fixed and mobile telephone market. It is expected to reach some 50,000 users Australia-wide within the first seven years of service. Yet, according to the Department of Transport and Communications, these 50,000 users are expected to generate network traffic of around 100 million minutes per year by the year 2000. That may be, if we count the sheep as users and we forget that there is a rural recession as well!</PARA>
<PARA> Aussat has advised DOTAC that the true cost of this service will be a `small percentage' of the cost of second generation satellites. But independent estimates of the cost of the Mobilesat satellite capacity range from $60m to $80m, plus the `up to $25m' for ground station equipment. This would place the so-called small per cent of the overall cost at around 20 per cent, which is hardly small and hardly insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking again of the Australian taxpayer, as many of us have in this debate, the behaviour of the Commonwealth Bank in the Aussat affair requires some scrutiny. The satellites are owned by a $2 shelf company set up by the Commonwealth Bank and are leased back by Aussat, which is paid a management fee. It is an unusual financial structure when used by private enterprise and rather suspect when used by public authorities. Under what is called this leverage lease arrangement, both the banks and Aussat receive significant tax advantages. Since any money the Commonwealth Bank lends to Aussat has the Federal Treasurer's cast-iron guarantee, Aussat has acquired a AA credit rating despite gearing levels described by one credit ratings agency as `extremely high'. At one point, the Senate might be astounded to learn, the gearing ratio was actually 735 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The moral of this sad Aussat saga could well be that we should not mix government with grandiose entrepreneurial schemes, especially ones that carry acronyms or initials like Aussat, B-Series, VFT, MFP, VEDC, WA Inc, or anything with the word `space' in it, like `Spaceport' or Star Wars. There is a right way and a wrong way to run public sector utilities, whether grooming them for privatisation or not. This is definitely the wrong way, and someone certainly owes the Australian taxpayer an apology. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to do something that should have been done some time ago. When in general business a report of a delegation of which I was a member had to be tabled, unfortunately I was not able to speak to that matter because of time constraints. So I take the opportunity today because it is important that I put on record my impressions of what was a very important parliamentary delegation that visited the USSR and Mongolia and Japan last year. As I was the only senator on that delegation, it is important that I make some points in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The delegation, headed by Dr Charlesworth from the House of Representatives, visited the Soviet Union on 19 September last year. The other members of the delegation were the Rt Hon Ian Sinclair, who was deputy leader of the delegation; Ms Mary Crawford, the member for Forde; Mr Duncan Kerr, the member for Denison; and Mr Alasdair Webster, the member for Macquarie; and Jennifer Blood, from our Public Accounts Committee, was the secretary of the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> The hospitality and the warmth that we received in every country and every area we visited was most overwhelming. The favourable impression that we all gained resulted from the spirit of friendship and openness that was afforded us, particularly by the people of the Soviet Union. That friendship, openness and courtesy filtered through all our discussions and everything we did while we were there. </PARA>
<PARA> It was also one of those delegations that was very harmonious. Not only did we gain a lot of information while we were there but we also got to know each other a lot better, and I think those friendships will continue during our terms in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation was unique in that it was the first Australian parliamentary delegation ever to meet with elected Soviet representatives. I make that point because throughout our relations with most countries, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, from your associations with China, it is not very often that politicians have the opportunity to meet on a one-to-one basis with their opposite numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> It was rather special that we were allowed to do that at such a significant time in the history of the Soviet Union, when so many changes were taking place. We were very fortunate to visit the USSR Supreme Soviet and the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation while they were in session. Mr Acting Deputy President, it was very interesting to see the President of the Soviet sitting where you are sitting now and to find that Gorbachev was sitting on his own, far distant from any other members. I do not know whether there was anything particularly significant about that or whether it was just the way it was set up, but it seemed rather unusual. </PARA>
<PARA> Watching that parliament, one thing that impressed me was that it is really not much different from ours. The members were arguing at considerable length over a piece of paper. Of course, we did not understand what they were talking about, but when we made inquiries we found that what they really were arguing about was whose turn it was to speak and about the orders of the day. That went on for at least an hour. So it is not much different from this place sometimes, when we spend a lot of time talking about procedures rather than getting on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of the people, rather differently from what happens here, in the press and in the electronic media the parliament obviously had the number one rating in what was going on there. All heads were glued to the mostly black-and-white television sets because parliament was sitting at the time when all those momentous events were occurring, and they still are, of course. All the headlines in the press were about perestroika and glasnost. </PARA>
<PARA> The visit we made to the Soviet Union was in two parts. The first part was spent in Moscow talking to the leaders and the second part was spent in the Soviet far east looking at what prospects there were for Australia to widen its influence into that area. It is the Soviet far east that has a greater potential trade-wise for Australia. Between travelling from Moscow to Vladivostok we spent some time in Mongolia, and I will discuss that a little later. The primary motivation which led us from Moscow to proceed through eastern Siberia across to the Soviet far east was to examine the prospects for greater economic cooperation between Australia and the Soviet Union. It also allowed the delegation to gain an impression of the views that provincial administrators held about the central Moscow Government. That was quite interesting. The major provinces in the Soviet far east are aligned with the Russian Federation, and it was interesting to gain their views about what was happening in Moscow. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing that impresses people about the Soviet Union is the huge size of the place. It represents one-third of the world's land mass. One of its biggest drawbacks is the fact that the country's sheer geographical extent underpins many of the problems and certainly does not help in arriving at any easy solutions to those problems. Against that, there is the cultural diversity and the historical and religious backgrounds of the member states of the union. Coupled with the size of the place, these are presenting enormous problems. Since we left there in October, we have seen the problems that have occurred in the Balkan states, in Georgia and in all the other ethnic provinces of the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> To say that the Soviet economy was in turmoil would be an understatement. There are problems associated with the establishment of a market economy-a convertible currency, private land ownership, a banking system, a stock exchange, company legislation and trade practices protection. Those are things that we take for granted, although at the moment we do not seem to be handling a lot of them very well, but they are all new things that those states have to face up to. Wherever we went, and whether we spoke to a leading politician or a man in the street, people were totally committed to a market economy and they thought that was the answer to everything. I do not think it is going to be as simple as that; I am sure we all know that. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of the members of our delegation asked how a market economy is going to work. Certainly there are some very sharp types around the back streets, and I think a black market economy has been operating there for quite some time. It is very efficient, as a matter of fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but not only cheap jeans, a packet of cigarettes was very good currency-particularly Marlboro cigarettes, as I will show. One night we travelled on the Trans-Siberian Railway from Vladivostok to a place called Khabarovsk so that we could fly out to Japan. We were told that we had to take some food with us so that we would not die of starvation on the 13-hour trip. When we had boarded the train and settled in-the train was not too bad by their standards-we made a request for some plastic cups. Much to our disgust, the answer was nyet. Were there any glasses-nyet. Was there anything we could put something in-nyet. But when my colleague from Tasmania, Duncan Kerr, happened to produce a packet of 20 Marlboro cigarettes, immediately the rather large blonde attendant disappeared and arrived back with 14 pewter glass-lined mugs. She proceeded to join us later in her best outfit, and the next morning we all got a cup of tea in our carriages. That is just an example of the black market.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would hate to think what we would have got for two packets of cigarettes. At the level of infrastructure, everything seems to be 40 or 50 years old, and getting older. There are transport problems: it was fascinating to see at railway stations heaps and heaps of mail stacked up on railway carriages. Nobody would know where it was going or where it was coming from. After I returned home, a postcard I sent to my mother arrived in February-which was not too bad, I guess, seeing that it was sent in September. That is just an example of the terrible problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst we were in Vladivostok we wanted to phone our High Commission in Moscow. We had to book the call the day before, and we were told the next day that unfortunately the operator could not make contact. So we can understand why, if telecommunications are so bad, the problems facing the Soviet Union are being exacerbated by the basic things we take for granted in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> As you can imagine, with virtually only one train line running across the Soviet Union, the distribution of food, clothing and consumer goods is rather horrendous. We have all read about the queues that are everywhere, and I must say I can attest to that. In Moscow, people must have money because the biggest queues are outside the French perfume shops which let in only so many people at a time so that they are not crowded out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet far east, where we spent a fair amount of time, certainly has a wealth of natural resources. I believe it is the place that has the greatest potential for cooperation between Australia and the Soviet Union. But to facilitate that, there are certainly massive improvements needed. For instance, transport is very basic. As I said, telecommunications are almost non-existent, although I did manage the other day to get a fax through to Vladivostok from my office in Hobart-which I had been trying to do for about three months. That has really restored my faith in the Soviet communications system somewhat. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet far east is endeavouring to encourage tourism. I think it is certainly a wonderful place to see. It is something different. It is unlike anything else in the world, but the hotel accommodation certainly leaves a lot to be desired. I have roughed it round the bush in a few places, and I can certainly describe the Soviet toilet facilities and cleaning facilities as basic, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, in Vladivostok, if we got hot water once a day we were very lucky. The water was turned off between 10 o'clock in the morning and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and so when we turned our taps on in the afternoon most of the water that came out was rusty. There are a few stories I could tell about that-particularly about our leader-but this is neither the place nor the time to do it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For instance, Senator Button, in terms of a particular area that you know so well, a little bit of PVC piping would go a long way in the Soviet Union. I saw no evidence of that at all. If some enterprising exporter from Australia were able to get into the Soviet far east after he had been through all the problems of getting a visa, I am sure he would be able to set up a profitable joint venture promoting the sale of PVC piping. Certainly, I saw no evidence of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nor did I see any evidence of retreaded tyres. That is an opportunity that Ian Sinclair and I saw as being one that could become very profitable. I do not think those people had even heard of retreaded tyres because most of the tyres we saw either had holes in them or were lying on the side of the road. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we were received warmly and hospitably everywhere we went. It was rather disturbing when we walked into a fruit market in Vladivostok. Vladivostok is a place the size of Canberra, but in the fruit market only two areas were open. The price of a kilogram of locally grown pears was about $A12.50. That sounds bad enough, but when we equate that with the wage structure that means that it costs about half a week's wages to buy a kilogram of pears. So it was not surprising that when a gentleman saw I had a packet of cigarettes he offered me a couple of pears for one cigarette. Then I was mobbed and offered a pomegranate for two cigarettes! So the black market certainly is alive and well. </PARA>
<PARA> Having read plenty of spy thrillers, and the types of things we read in newspapers, I expected that whilst we were in the Soviet Union censorship would be something that we would have to be careful of. Whilst I was told that one or two of the accompanying officials from the Soviet Union were KGB agents, nevertheless I had a video camera and I was able to film eight hours of video whilst I was away. </PARA>
<PARA> The only times I was asked not to video were at the Moscow Circus, the Mongolian Circus and when we were in the armoury under the Kremlin where all the jewels are kept. I can understand that because I am sure even Senator Button would be amazed by the amount of wealth that sits below the Kremlin. In fact, there was a bucketful of uncut jewels there and just one of those jewels would have paid for the $140m that the Soviets owe us for our wool. I suggested to them that they should do that, and of course I got the usual nyet, hands-off approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Even in Vladivostok, which is a closed city-and although they are saying now that it is open, it certainly is still a closed city-I was able to video whatever I wanted. There were plenty of naval establishments. No doubt we have already got plenty of film of that through our security service. There was no question of not filming or not taking photos of anything we wished to. I do not know why it is a closed city because, apart from the missile sites around the tops of the hills and a few army establishments, it looked no different from any other city I have been to. </PARA>
<PARA> There is great scope for development in the Soviet far east. We recommended that Austrade consider appointing a regional officer, based in Hong Kong, in order to promote Australia's commercial interests in Mongolia and in the far east. As part of that, we would see Austrade, in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, producing a guide for doing business in the Soviet far east, because help would certainly be needed. </PARA>
<PARA> The bureaucracy there is unbelievable. Getting a visa is an example. The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd at one stage gave up in despair trying to get in there to get some work done; it just could not get visas. It is not that people are not wanted there, but that the whole bureaucratic system is such that, for some reason or other, the local chamber of commerce in Vladivostok has a finger in the pie and if you do not get on well with it, you do not get a visa. There is a problem with currency, but there is plenty of scope for joint ventures, even barter trade, and that is something the Government and those involved should look at. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to Mongolia, it was the first time an Australian parliamentary delegation had visited that country. As in the Soviet Union, the visit was at a very important stage in Mongolia's history because in July last year the first democratic elections in the history of Mongolia took place under the supervision of international observers. During the week we were there, the country's first democratically elected government was being formed. So, naturally, in Mongolia most of our discussions focused on the political and economic reform process, the conduct and results of the election, and what had happened since. </PARA>
<PARA> Six parties and a number of Independents contested the elections for the Great People's Hural, with the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party-the Communist Party-gaining 61 per cent of the vote. The new standing legislature, the Small Hural, was then elected by a system of proportional representation, with one seat for each 2 per cent of the votes received in the elections of the Great Hural. </PARA>
<PARA> It was unique that the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, after having gained 61 per cent of the vote and being in a position to form a government in its own right, chose to form a multiparty government, with all four parties which gained seats in the Small Hural being elected. I do not think we should carry that idea forward to Australia, but perhaps there is some thought for us there. The Prime Minister, Mr Byambasuren, told us that he felt it was important because, by forming a multiparty government, he was able to gain the most talented members to contribute to what he saw as a very critical stage of the country's development. As a result, the Vice-President and Chairman of the Small Hural, Mr Gonchigdorj, was a member of the Social Democratic Party, which had not gained a very large proportion of the vote at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very impressed with the Mongolian Democratic Party. It is a little different from the one here. Its members principally are academics. I think they were the ones who really forced the election upon the country, and they were very impressive people. Mongolia is no different from the rest of the Soviet Union: there is certainly a great need to modernise the economy. But the fact that the six parties had joined together to form a multiparty government and that they were all committed to the introduction of a market economy was most heartening. </PARA>
<PARA> One of their biggest problems under this market economy strategy is going to be the redistribution of property as part of their economic restructuring. In the Gobi Desert we met the local mayor of Gobi, who was very enthusiastic. I tried to equate him to some of the local government mayors I have met, but he is in a class of his own. Honourable senators would be able to imagine the problems in a huge area such as the Gobi Desert, where there are nomadic farmers. By the way, they are fantastic farmers for what resources they have. How land will be allocated I just do not know, but as the Russians and the Mongolians say, `No problem'. </PARA>
<PARA> I meant to mention something about Vladivostok. As a result of discussions that Duncan Kerr and I had with a fishing cooperative in Vladivostok I am pleased to report that, after toing and froing, it seems that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is interested in a group of quite important fisheries research people coming out here. One of them, Dr Nosov, has done a lot of work in Tasmanian waters and around Australia. They are coming on a private visit very shortly, I believe. </PARA>
<PARA> As in the Soviet Union, the reception we had in Mongolia was unbelievable. The opportunities for trade there are absolutely enormous. The Mongolians have got every mineral that anyone could ever think of, and all still in the ground. They even have quite good resources of oil, which they are having difficulty getting out of the ground. Being a farmer I must say that I was very impressed that, even with their poor economic situation, the way they approach their agriculture and their land care is something that Australians could look at. They gain the maximum amount of production from what is best described as very harsh country. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that the Australian Government through Mr Peter Sloan, who is on loan there, is helping in some small way. We did come up with some suggestions about how we could help. We suggested that an Australian agricultural trade mission delegation visit Mongolia and that Austrade give consideration, as with the far east, to trying to help to get into Mongolia some of our people who wish to help and have joint ventures. Simple things such as electric fencing, solar powered communications, windmills, portable shearing plants, things the Mongolians have never heard of: they are the sorts of things by which I believe we in Australia, at a very small cost, could really make their job a lot easier. </PARA>
<PARA> We were very impressed by Mongolia. I believe that while Mongolia, of all the places we visited in the Soviet Union, might have the hardest row to hoe, it has the necessary joint approach and will to succeed. I believe the Mongolians will succeed, although they will have to go through a lot of pain to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> We flew out of the Soviet far east into Japan. I suppose it can be best described as going out of a dark room into the light, because the Japanese were light years ahead of anything else we had seen in that area of the world. As I said earlier, the whole country-the Soviet Union, the far east and Mongolia-is 40 years behind anything I have ever seen before. Everything seems worn out and run down, but the people are still surviving. But to come into Japan was a culture shock although I had been there before. Everything is new beaut, up to date and all the rest that we know about the Japanese. We did have some very long discussions with the Japanese politicians and business people about where we are sitting now with trade. That was probably the primary focus of our visit there. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, Japan's great paradox is the contrast between its industrial might as a free trader and its protectionist position on agricultural trade. We are very concerned about this. We took every opportunity to underline the inconsistencies and the inefficiency of this position. This is an example of the difference between Australia's attitude-where it is at the moment-and Japan's. In Tokyo, October was Import Now month. All the taxis and buses carried slogans. There were banners all around the town trying to get Japanese people to import. This shows why there is such a difference between Japan's balance of trade and ours. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge not only the assistance provided by the three host countries and the staff of the Australian embassies but also the efforts of the Australian staff, whose administrative arrangements made our delegation so efficient. Everything went off without a hitch. I particularly thank Francesca Beddie, who accompanied our delegation through the USSR and Mongolia; Victor Samoilenko, Yvegenii Tregubov and Vladimir Ivanov, who travelled with us in the USSR-I will not say, `Pick the KGB agent' because I could not-and Dr Barsbold, Mrs Bulgan and Mr Suhee, who travelled with us in Mongolia. We had great assistance from Derek Brown in Japan, and Mr Ariga, Mrs Shimura and Mr Abe. They provided us with superb assistance and made our delegation very memorable. In fact, at the moment my colleague Alasdair Webster is copying onto tape a video account of our tour. I will present this to members of the delegation I expect during the next sitting round. I hope it gives them as much joy and as many memories of this very successfully delegation as it gave us. If anybody is interested I am sure we could make that video available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the package of Appropriation Bills for supplementary appropriations; that is the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation Bill (No. 5). The first matter-although I do not really wish to attend to it-is the comments made by Senator Coates in this chamber and elsewhere and his serious reflections on the integrity and professionalism of the Clerks of the Senate. I rise to express my concern that this type of attack does nothing for the integrity of this chamber and really does nothing for Senator Coates. When Senator Coates moved his notice of motion I indicated that this bully boy approach would hang over the heads of the Clerks of the Senate like a sword, as the notice was given just before a very long and extended break in the Senate. I am very pleased to see that Senator Coates has now withdrawn that notice of motion. Nevertheless, some of his comments last night and this morning confirm my view that his attack on the Clerk of the Senate and one of the senior Clerks is deplorable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coates alleges that the Clerks have engaged in partisan activity. Frankly, if one wanted to question whether the Clerks act appropriately in this chamber or elsewhere, one would only need to look at what happened last night. In the adjournment debate last night, Senator Bishop attempted to correct some of the statements made by Senator Coates when speaking to the Appropriation Bills. What happened? The Deputy Clerk at the table gave advice to the President that Senator Bishop was not in order in defending the Clerks because the honourable senator was anticipating a debate or reflecting on a previous debate. The matter was very neatly and nicely handled by all concerned-the President and, indeed, Senator Bishop. </PARA>
<PARA> But we now have the matter before us, so we cannot avoid it, although I would have hoped that we could. The allegations are that the Clerk of the Senate and a Clerk Assistant have engaged in partisan activity. Quite frankly, that is groundless. The Clerks, as with academic researchers and other professionals, must have a certain freedom to develop a line of thought in written articles which can be used by political science students and all others who follow the work of our parliamentary institutions. The correct response for someone who disagrees with what they write is to submit an article in rebuttal. I ask Senator Coates whether he feels so insecure in his ability to do that that he will not submit articles to various journals in respect of what this Senate is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned not only for the Clerk and the Clerk Assistant concerned, but I am also concerned about this institution, its integrity and why it exists. I know that a number of people say that the Senate ought to be abolished. That was the view of the Australian Labor Party for many years. It has now changed that view. But presumably Senator Coates is one who has a hankering for the unitary system rather than the bicameral system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate was established as a House of review and not as a party political House. This House was established by the founding fathers as a House to uphold the rights of the States. I am appalled that an honourable senator from one of the smaller States should so reflect on the functions of this chamber as to diminish its role in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Senate has been diminished over time. I have witnessed it during the 15 or 16 years that I have been here. I have witnessed the predominance of party discipline in this chamber, and that ought to be a matter of concern and note. Whoever notes it-whether it be the Clerks of the Senate in learned journals or myself on the political stump-does not matter. It is a question of what this chamber was intended to be and whether it is carrying out those functions, and I will refer to one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> We in this chamber have always prided ourselves as upholding the rights of individuals. I ask whether the rights of the individuals who are under attack by Senator Coates are being properly upheld. In my view, they do have the right to discuss in measured, appropriate terms in journal articles and elsewhere the questions relating to the functions and the functioning of this chamber or of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate, through the President and the officials, has undertaken considerable initiatives in respect of various displays and seminars on the Constitution and other topics, which are very important for us to consider. Really, they cannot usefully comment on the work of the Senate by simply writing about how the Senate chairs are arranged, how the Senate table is arranged, what the Senate attendants are wearing or the Senate broadcast system and scrupulously ignoring any direct mention of honourable senators and their work. It is ludicrous to suggest that any meaningful article could be so written. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to admit that I am now one of the longest serving-I will not say oldest-members in this place. For some years, my colleagues have seen fit to appoint me as the Chairman of the Parliamentary Studies Fellowship Committee, which has the task of selecting a person to occupy an important study and research position in the Parliamentary Library. I have had a professional working relationship with both the Clerk and the Clerk Assistant mentioned by Senator Coates for many years and, in my long experience, I must say that their approach has been impeccably impartial and professional. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not always agreed with them or followed their parliamentary advice, but I have been grateful that they have operated under a system of independence from the Executive Government. I had a fear that Senator Coates was acting as a stalking-horse for Ministers. Now I do not think that is the case. I think he is somewhat on his own in the position that he takes at the present moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the feeling that there may have been something more behind it, given the new developments in the Senate committee system. Under the new system, legislative Bills have been referred to standing committees of the Senate, where Bills, Ministers and public servants responsible for the Bills have been put under the microscope. Senators, both members of the committees and others, have been able to quiz public servants to find out more about the meaning of clauses. </PARA>
<PARA> All round, the system is proving to be probably more successful than Ministers, I or anybody else had considered possible. I make an aside here. Senator Coates, when referring to a comment that I had made which was printed in the House Magazine, questioned this morning the veracity of what I had said in that journal. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>I can well remember the first meeting of one of these Committees where Senator Coates tried to put his approach to members of the Committee during a closed meeting while I chose to remain outside in the corridor. Fortunately, this particular Committee decided to permit a fairly open approach in dealing with witnesses and I and other Senators were able to question the public servants about the detail of legislation and, indeed, I obtained agreement from the Committee for an important amendment to the Bill under question. </PARA>
<PARA>I understood Senator Coates to say this morning-and it is a minor matter-that he was out in the corridor waiting with me. He must have been in a different corridor because I remember quite clearly that I, and indeed the Minister, Senator Button, were waiting out in the corridor to find out what the committee-of which Senator Childs was chairman-was going to do: was it going to allow the public servants to be questioned or what? Who knows? Senator Coates may have been responsible for what happened subsequently in that we were able to question the public servants and the Minister. I know that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats-I think Senator Coulter was involved-were quite adamant that we should be able to question the public servants. And, in the end, we were. Everybody was quite happy about the way the proceedings were conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the real issue. The Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk Assistant that Senator Coates has attacked are the people that ordinary senators rely on for advice as to what they can and cannot do. Also, they are not in a position to publicly defend themselves. The only message that I have received-and I have not discussed this with the Clerk-is a letter dated 11 February 1991 from the Clerk of the Senate. That puts the position into its proper perspective quite sufficiently and I would hope that will be the end of the matter. If it is not, and if there is a continuance of attacks on the paid officers of this Parliament, it will reflect on the integrity of this chamber as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind Senator Coates that if some people are writing in academic journals and so on about the functioning of the Parliament and this chamber, as to whether it is functioning as a party House or a House of review, those are very important matters. I would hate to see this chamber degenerate into a party House where we simply rubber-stamp what comes through from the House of Representatives. If that occurred, of course, one would soon get a demand for the principle of equality of representatives from States to be abolished. I do not know where Senator Coates or I would be if that occurred, because the place would be stacked out by New South Wales and Victorian senators. That is no reflection on colleagues from New South Wales and Victoria; they are capable people. But this matter now ought to be properly buried. I seek the leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard a letter that I received, and which I understand the Party leaders and independent senators received, from the Clerk of the Senate dated 11 February 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>11 February 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Senator B. Harradine</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Harradine</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing to each party leader and independent Senator concerning the notice of motion given by Senator Coates on the last day of sitting. On 16 January I wrote in similar terms to Mr President and the Leader of the Government in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>This notice makes a most serious and defamatory allegation against my colleague Peter O'Keeffe and me, namely, that we have published statements of a partisan nature, an allegation which impugns our professional integrity. </PARA>
<PARA>Immediately after the notice was given I wrote to Senator Coates expressing surprise that he had not sought to discuss with me his apparent concerns before giving the notice, and inviting him to discuss the matter with me. I have repeated that invitation but it has not been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>The only basis of the allegation contained in the notice is a reference to two articles written by Peter O'Keeffe and me in parliamentary journals and a report of my answers to some questions put to me by a journalist concerning the procedures for consideration of bills in committees. </PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing in these items to justify the allegation of partisanship. A statement with which a Senator may disagree is not for that reason a partisan statement. My article and the press report give a favourable account of the new procedures for referral of bills to committees, but it can hardly be partisan to be supportive of procedures which were unanimously recommended by an all-party Senate committee and which were adopted by the Senate without opposition. Contrary to the assertion in the notice, those items do not contain any ``criticism of certain Senators''. They refer to differences of view among Senators, but offer no critique or evaluation of those different views. The press report contains a great deal of commentary by the journalist in addition to my answers, but I am not responsible for that commentary. The characterisation in the notice of Peter O'Keeffe's article as being ``in praise of a former Senator'' is absurd. That article is a study of the way in which a Senator can use a private Senator's bill to deal with a difficult and sensitive issue. It is no more ``in praise of a former Senator'' than a previous article by Peter O'Keeffe referring to the role of the Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee was in praise of Senator Cooney. </PARA>
<PARA>The serious allegation of partisanship is therefore not justified by the items referred to in the notice. </PARA>
<PARA>The articles in question are not different in kind from other articles written by other clerks on parliamentary matters over many years. Such articles frequently contain analysis, critique or evaluation of parliamentary matters, but never partisanship. In fact, articles written by clerks in the past were far more robust in commenting upon proceedings in the Senate than I or my colleagues have ever been. In an article written in 1970 the then Deputy-Clerk, Roy Bullock, referred in the following terms to the practice of the then government backbenchers of clogging the general business section of the Notice Paper with their own items of business:</PARA>
<PARA> ``This situation was not good. It denigrated the Senate as an institution, frustrated a vigorous Opposition, and was completely out of keeping with the new order of things under proportional representation, and the need to streamline Parliamentary procedures.''</PARA>
<PARA>Such writings did not lead to any notices of motion in the Senate, or, indeed, to any adverse comment at all. </PARA>
<PARA>If the articles in question are regarded as objectionable, then virtually nothing can be written by any officer. </PARA>
<PARA>As you would be aware, my colleagues and I advise all Senators without regard to their political affiliations. Frequently we give advice which may not suit the political convenience of one or other of the parties in the Senate. Hitherto that very proper situation has not led to any allegation of partisanship. I trust that we are not now coming to a situation in which advice that accords with one party's objectives is regarded as good advice but advice to the contrary is considered partisan. </PARA>
<PARA>If the notice of motion remains on the Notice Paper undebated, as is normal with general business notices of motion, that may be taken as an indication that the allegation is not regarded as important. </PARA>
<PARA>Regardless of any other action in relation to the notice, I ask that this letter be incorporated in Hansard as a refutation of the allegation in the notice. </PARA>
<PARA>I have forwarded copies of this letter to Mr President and the Leader of the Government in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address a large number of matters in this debate on the Appropriation Bills. I refer the Senate to the report of Estimates Committee B of May 1991. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Changes to Explanatory Notes-AIDAB</PARA>
<PARA>During questioning under program element 5.2.2 relating to a UNFPA aid project to strengthen the technical capacity of the Centre for Population Studies in the Ministry of Labour in Vietnam, the Committee was informed that the money defined in the Explanatory Notes as being for this particular project had subsequently been diverted to a different UNFPA project in Papua New Guinea and that AIDAB had been aware of this funding change since late February. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee regards this situation as unsatisfactory and advises AIDAB that when significant variations to Explanatory Notes occur, replacement pages indicating these variations should be provided to the Committee in advance of the public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very significant statement by Estimates Committee B. We as parliamentarians, besides all of the functions I have referred to, have an audit and control function, and we must exercise that function. In order for us to exercise that function of care of public moneys we have to be told the facts, and we have to be told them in good time to enable us to examine them and research them. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter we now have before us-the funding of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) project in Papua New Guinea-will give rise to vigorous questions amongst many groups and individuals who do not share my views. The fact is that it now appears that the proposal is to fund a UNFPA program of population control in Papua New Guinea under a PNG strengthening maternal care and family planning services project. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of money will go to assist in purchasing drugs and contraceptive devices. It has been ascertained from further questioning that has occurred since the Estimates Committee hearing-the answers to which were tabled yesterday-that the project documentation from the UNFPA indicates that the drug injectable depo-provera will account for 58.5 per cent of total expenditure on birth control supplies. Information from the bulk procurement office of the UNFPA in New York indicates that this will be directed to about 63 per cent of the people targeted. In other words, depo-provera will be used in 63 per cent of the female target group for which this program is designed. </PARA>
<PARA> I need not remind the Senate of the great concerns that have been expressed, largely through feminist groupings-of which, I admit, I am not a member-but also amongst a large number of other groups. A study was undertaken of depoprovera by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States using persons who were also agreed upon by Upjohn Pty Ltd, the manufacturer of the drug. That study showed that, because of the considerable ill effects that the drug had on women as well as the dangers to their health, the Food and Drug Administration would not approve of the drug as a contraceptive. That is still the position in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, the MIMS Annual 1990, which has just been published, states:</PARA>
<PARA>The use of Depo-Provera for contraception is not an approved indication and such use is investigational since there are unresolved questions relating to its safety for this indication. </PARA>
<PARA>What do we do with our aid money? We say, `Bung it off to Papua New Guinea. After all, they are only ex-colonials. The poor women up there as they line up for their other injections would not know what this is'. In my view, this is tantamount to cultural colonialism. The question-and I raise it now so that the Government can have another look at this before the Committee of the Whole debate takes place-is: if this drug is not officially approved for contraception in Australia, why are we now paying for the drug to be purchased and used in a program developed by UNFPA in Papua New Guinea?</PARA>
<PARA> I know that it is being said, and will be said, that the World Health Organisation has approved the drug for that purpose. Approval was pressed upon the WHO through UNFPA and the human reproduction program, both of which have questionable track records in these particular areas. The fact remains that the drug is very much opposed by a broad range of people in Australia and the United States. It is not approved for contraception purposes in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note-and I will go into this in detail in the Committee of the Whole-that we have been asked in the Estimates Committee to look at a program of maternal health care. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the part of the MIMS report which deals with the contraindications of depo-provera so that the official documentation is contained below what I have said. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The report read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Contraindications</PARA>
<PARA>1. Thrombophlebitis, thromboembolic disorders, cerebral apoplexy or patients with a past history of these conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Markedly impaired liver functions. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Undiagnosed urinary tract bleeding. </PARA>
<PARA>5. Undiagnosed breast pathology. </PARA>
<PARA>6. Missed abortion. </PARA>
<PARA>7. Known sensitivity to medroxyprogesterone acetate. </PARA>
<PARA>8. Use in pregnancy. (Category D)</PARA>
<PARA>Animal studies have shown that high doses of progestogens can cause masculinisation of the female fetus. </PARA>
<PARA>9. Severe uncontrolled hypertension. </PARA>
<PARA>Warnings</PARA>
<PARA>1. The physician should be alert to the earliest manifestations of thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis, cerebrovascular disorders, pulmonary embolism, and retinal thrombosis). Should any of these occur or be suspected, the drug should be discontinued immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilloedema, or retinal vascular lesions, medication should be withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Following repeated injections, amenorrhoea and infertility may persist for periods of up to 18 months and occasionally longer. </PARA>
<PARA>4. In all situations where cessation of therapy is warranted, the physician should be aware of the slow elimination of the depot formulation. </PARA>
<PARA>5. Clinical suppression of adrenocorticoid function has not been observed at low dose levels, however, at the high doses used in the treatment of cancer, corticoid-like activity has been reported. Animal studies show that medroxyprogesterone acetate possesses adrenocorticoid activity. </PARA>
<PARA>6. Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occasionally been reported in patients treated with Depo-Provera. </PARA>
<PARA>7. The following laboratory tests may be affected by the use of Depo-Provera: gonadotrophin levels; plasma progesterone levels; urinary pregnanediol levels; plasma testosterone levels (in the male); plasma oestrogen levels (in the female); plasma cortisol levels; glucose tolerance test; metyrapone test. </PARA>
<PARA>Precautions</PARA>
<PARA>1. The use of Depo-Provera for contraception is not an approved indication and such use is investigational since there are unresolved questions relating to its safety for this indication. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The pretreatment physical examination should include special reference to breast and pelvic organs, as well as Papanicolaou smear. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Because this drug may cause some degree of fluid retention, conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, or cardiac or renal dysfunction, require careful observation. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Breakthrough bleeding is likely to occur in patients being treated for endometriosis. No other hormonal intervention is recommended for managing this bleeding. Nonfunctional causes should also be borne in mind and in cases of undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. </PARA>
<PARA>5. A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on progestogens. The mechanism of this decrease is obscure. For this reason, diabetic patients should be carefully observed while receiving progestogen therapy. </PARA>
<PARA>6. Patients who have a history of mental depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if the depression recurs to a serious degree. </PARA>
<PARA>7. The age of the patient constitutes no absolute limiting factor although treatment with progestins may mask the onset of the climacteric. </PARA>
<PARA>8. The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. </PARA>
<PARA>9. Gluteal infiltration and abscess formation may occur with intramuscular administration. See Dosage and Administration. </PARA>
<PARA>10. Certain endocrine and possible liver function tests may be affected by treatment with Depo-Provera. Therefore, if such tests are abnormal in a patient taking Depo-Provera, it is recommended that they be repeated after the drug has been withdraw. </PARA>
<PARA> Depo-Provera is not to be used as a test for pregnancy or where pregnancy is suspected. </PARA>
<PARA>Adverse Reactions</PARA>
<PARA>The following events listed in order of seriousness rather than frequency of occurrence, have been associated with the use of progestogens including medroxyprogesterone. </PARA>
<PARA>1. Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid-like reactions. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Thromboembolic disease. Thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Central nervous system. Nervousness, insomnia, somnolence, fatigue, depression, dizziness, headache and tremor. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Gluteal infiltration and abscess formation. This reaction appears to be related to the volume of agent administered and the highest frequency of this complication occurs with large volumes, ie. greater than 2.5 mL. </PARA>
<PARA>5. Skin and mucous membranes. Urticaria, pruritus, rash, acne, hirsutism, alopecia and sweating. </PARA>
<PARA>6. Gastrointestinal. Nausea. </PARA>
<PARA>7. Breast. Tenderness and galactorrhoea. </PARA>
<PARA>8. Cervix. Changes in erosion and secretions. </PARA>
<PARA>9. Miscellaneous. Hyperpyrexia, Cushing's syndrome, weight gain. </PARA>
<PARA>10. Moderate elevation of blood pressure, transient elevations of alkaline phosphatase and/or serum transaminase activities, elevations of serum calcium and potassium levels, and increase in white cell and platelet counts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I rise to speak on Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1990-91, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91 and Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1990-91, Australia is in the middle of a recession that we are told we had to have, a recession which was engineered by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), he tells us, for the purpose of cutting back imports into this country. His colleague Senator Bolkus follows that with an Offshore? What for? program which is designed to encourage government entities and corporations to buy Australian products. I find this very ironic because there are a number of instances in which the Government has failed to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have already seen the case of the cruising yacht purchased by Qantas Airways Ltd, but not from an Australian builder. In fact, Australian shipbuilders did not even have the opportunity to tender for the cruising yacht. It was built and purchased overseas with Australian taxpayers' money. That, if nothing else, shows that the Offshore? What for? program is a sham. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned to hear, as I travel around this country, other stories of Australian suppliers who were not just disallowed from tendering for many Federal Government contracts, but were never given the chance to tender. Very recently I heard of another case that I only flag here in passing, which related to the supply of camouflage nets to the Australian Army. It has been suggested to me that the contract was let to a foreign company in preference to an Australian supplier, whose product had substantially more Australian content than that of the foreign company, in spite of only a 4 per cent difference in price. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian company in question said that the Government refused to accept the tender that it put in upon the basis that the garnish-the green coloured cloth that overlays the net-was not of an acceptable standard. It is in fact the same garnish that is used by the United Kingdom and most other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation for their camouflage nets. It seems rather strange to me that it suits them, but it did not suit this Government at this time when it is trying to encourage companies to buy Australian products. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall leave that debate and move on to another Australian industry which has been directly threatened by this Federal Government and, in particular, to one small part of that industry. I refer to the forestry industry and to that part of the industry in and around the town of Ravenshoe. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that it is now seven months to the day since I came into this chamber and exposed how something in the vicinity of $7.6m of taxpayers' money had disappeared from the Ravenshoe sawmill. The Government has been wholly incapable of explaining where that money went. It is seven months since I first tabled those documents in Parliament. What has happened? What public information have we received? What charges have been laid? What Government documents have been tabled in the Senate? None. Nothing. Not one thing has been brought back to this Senate to show that the Government has indeed been assiduous, careful and vigorous in its pursuit of what happened to taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been seven months in which $7.6m has supposedly been investigated, yet nothing has been brought back to this chamber for the Senate, for the Parliament of this country, to scrutinise how the Government has been spending our money. That, I believe, is absolutely shameful and should never have occurred. At this point, I seek leave to table an inter-office memorandum dated 7 June 1989 between the sawmill in Ravenshoe and its head office in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This document is of particular importance because a perusal of it will show that in June 1989, some 10 months before the mill went into receivership, it had outstanding-that is, overdue-debts in excess of $239,000. This document identifies overdue debts of $239,000 that were owed 10 months before the mill went into receivership. This document also highlights the fact that at least three suppliers had stopped credit to the mill in June 1989 because they had not been paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of those suppliers was Boral Concrete, which at that stage was owed over $23,000 in overdue debts. The only way that company saw itself getting its money back was to stop credit to the mill because the company did not want to take a risk on it any longer. This is 10 months before the mill went into receivership. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned that anybody looking at this document would find it reasonable to suspect that the company may have been technically insolvent as early as June 1989. It certainly did not have any money in the bank to pay the bills. Suppliers had even stopped credit to the mill and, as far as most people are concerned, the mill may well have been broke. Yet in spite of this it continued to run up debts. That, of course, has grave implications for everybody concerned because if it were the case that the mill was insolvent and it continued to clock up debts, it would mean that it is possible for the people who are owed money by that mill to bring actions against the people who were responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said in this Senate so many times-I am afraid I have to say it yet again-the people who are owed the money have no chance at the moment of getting it back because this Government is sitting on reports from the receivers that it refuses to table in the Senate. Those reports were prepared for one purpose and one purpose only and that was to aid the investigation of matters such as this. As I have said, there has now been seven months of investigation and nothing has been brought before the Senate-seven months of shame for this Government; seven months of suffering for the people of Ravenshoe. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a case that has to be answered. There is a case that the Government must address, and must address as a matter of urgency. I am gravely concerned for the people of Ravenshoe. This memorandum identifies one contractor, who in May was owed $16,800. I have yet to confirm it, but I believe it is the same contractor who 10 months later was still owed $60,000. In other words, the mill had added even more to the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is shameful; it is totally unfair to the good people of Ravenshoe who put their trust in the mill and in the Government's promise that nobody at Ravenshoe would be disadvantaged. This is the seven months of shame which have followed the tabling of this document; the seven months of suffering in Ravenshoe. But this Government, as far as I can see, and as far as can be seen by any member of the Senate, and we are privileged people, has done nothing about it. It is by that seven months that this Government will be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been suggested that the parent company, Scotswood Street Pty Ltd, paid a dividend to its shareholders while this was going on. This is in spite of owing $414,000 to the mill when the receiver was appointed. As yet this money has not been recovered, nor will it ever be recovered, because Scotswood Streets does not have, as far as I am aware, a bean-it does not have a dollar-to its name. Yet it owes $414,000 to the sawmill in Ravenshoe, which owes $7.6m to the Commonwealth and between $500,000 and $600,000 to the good people of Ravenshoe and far north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that this dividend may have been paid when the mill was broke or in the process of losing money. We must know how much was owed to the mill at the time the parent company paid the dividend. It may be that shareholders or directors paid themselves in preference to the Commonwealth and local businesses. That is a very serious situation and I hope it is not true. But we will never know the answer in this place or anywhere else in this country until the Government comes into the chamber and does the decent thing by tabling the documents. The documents are in the Government's possession. It is just that this Government will not make those documents available to the people. Senator Richardson, in a statement to the Senate on 16 October, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd's draft set of financial accounts for the financial year 1988-89 reported a profit of $368,083. These financial statements show the company was solvent as the equity of shareholders was $2,328,474 after taking all liabilities, including its debt of $4.2m to the Commonwealth, into account. Related companies in the Timbertech Group owed Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd $1,235,266 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One of those related companies, I suspect, is Scotswood Street Pty Ltd, the ultimate holding company which, I am told, paid a dividend to its shareholders in the last six months of 1989. Senator Richardson continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Advice from our accounting advisers suggests that the APS sawmill at Ravenshoe was operating at an overall profit during the entire period of the Commonwealth Government's assistance agreement from 1 July 1988 until the Timbertech Group, including Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd, went into receivership. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement, with due respect to the Minister for Social Security-I know that the Minister did not prepare the statement, so I intend to let him off the hook a little-is arrant nonsense. If indeed the company did make a profit in the 1988-89 financial year, I think that when one looks at the accounts of the whole group of companies it becomes very dubious whether any of the loans that were owed to the sawmill at Ravenshoe were ever going to be repaid or were ever capable of being repaid. When one looks at the whole accounts, it just does not add up. </PARA>
<PARA> When the sawmill went into receivership some 10 months later, the statement, the report as to the affairs of the company, showed it had a deficiency of assets to liabilities of $1,658,000. It has gone from having a surplus of $2,328,000 to having a deficit of $1.6m. In other words, even by simple accounting, the sawmill during this time must have lost in the vicinity of $4m. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rubbish to suggest that this mill was operating at a profit all the time that the agreement was in place. I suggest that the reason was the wholly unsatisfactory practices that were going on at the Ravenshoe sawmill about which this Government knew absolutely nothing. It is because of the manner in which $7.6m was sucked out of that mill that the people of Ravenshoe are going broke at the moment. Yet this Government, which claimed it monitored the operation of the mill, did absolutely nothing about it and knew absolutely nothing of it. That is a sad indictment of this Government's financial mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is more, and it is more frightening yet. Even if the Government knew what was going on, it did nothing about it. I am very concerned now because in the time since the receiver was appointed-over 12 months ago-nothing has been done to put the company into liquidation. By a quirk of law, if a preference is paid to one creditor over other creditors it can be recovered under certain circumstances provided a liquidator has been appointed. But there is a time period in which the debt can be recovered. It has to be a debt which was incurred within so many months of the company being put into liquidation. Because the Government has done nothing for 12 months to put the company into liquidation, it has prejudiced the possibility of recovering preferences that were paid to some creditors in favour of them to advantage them over both the Commonwealth and the ordinary people of Ravenshoe. In other words, just by sitting on its hands after the receivership occurred, this Government has caused more loss and more suffering to the people of Ravenshoe, the people it promised would not suffer any disadvantage as a result of what it was doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators can see why I am concerned, why the people of Ravenshoe are concerned. One can make the argument that there is a difference between being technically insolvent and being illiquid. Let us just leave the finer legal points aside. I have the honesty to acknowledge that that is a legal argument and one which the Government might want to pursue. But one thing is very clear: something was wrong at the Ravenshoe mill and the Government did not know-over $230,000 of overdue debts, and the Government did not know. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The boiler and other assets disappeared in breach of the agreement, and the Government did not know. This document highlights one more thing: apparently $1.17m had been spent on retooling the mill in June 1989, yet 12 months beforehand the Government had lent $4.5m for that purpose. This document shows that the people at the mill did not even know how much money was available for the retooling of the mill. They had no control over what was going on; they had no way of ensuring that things were working out right. I believe that the people who were at the mill-and this document proves it-genuinely had the interests of the people of Ravenshoe at heart, but I do not believe that the people at Ravenshoe have had a fair deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that there has been substantially unsatisfactory activity, not just in the company itself but in the inaction and the financial incompetence of this Government.

The honourable senator introduces other factors into his question, such as wages policy. We have a wages policy-something those opposite have never had at all. As has been said on numerous occasions-and I repeat it here-a number of factors have caused the current very adverse economic circumstances, which are reflected in high levels of unemployment. They are the cyclical downturn in the Australian economy and the fact that the Government retained high monetary policy on the basis of indicators available to it for longer than it might have. Those things have been said a dozen times in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other factors have contributed to this issue. They are, of course, the dreadful situation in the rural sector in Australia, which is largely a matter of market access for Australian producers, and the corporate behaviour of many companies in this country during the 1980s which, if anything, has dampened the animal spirit of corporate Australia and damaged it in a very real way.</PARA>

All these macho men on the other side are going to fix up all these issues with one stroke of the pen; they will legislate in the first week to fix the world's problems.

<PARA> In the field of information technology, it has been traditional for all the major suppliers to provide systems that follow standards unique to the supplier company with the result that it is difficult for different brands of computers to work together. With the strong, worldwide support of users, including governments in Australia, the United States of America and the United Kingdom-Senator Hill would not do that; he would not offer any support-open standards have been developed to replace the older proprietary standards.</PARA>
<PARA> Important amongst these standards is the government open systems interconnection profile, known as GOSIP, which is now available for use in Australia and which will be a mandatory part of specifications in purchasing by Commonwealth agencies from 1 August 1991. I must say that Senator Bolkus is one of those to be congratulated on pursuing this question vigorously through the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The growing adoption of open systems standards is a watershed in the information technology industry. Opposition senators should listen to this because in about 10 years time when they catch up with these movements in technology they will be able to ask questions about it at Estimates committees. That is something to think about for the future. Australian companies stand to benefit from the opening up of new markets provided they can meet demanding international criteria. The major information technology markets insist on advanced products with high reliability proven by operation. That is where the Government's national procurement development program (NPDP) comes in. The national procurement development program offers financial support for the trialling and demonstration of new products in the government agency.</PARA>
<PARA> This environment provides companies with the opportunity to develop new product lines consistent with user requirements. It also gives government agencies the chance to adopt the latest technologies with lower risk. It is encouraging to see companies such as Network Automation, which is the company Senator Crowley asked me about, making use of the NPDP to address an emerging market opportunity. That company has received a grant in respect of the NPDP. Although recently established, Network Automation has demonstrated its technological capability and has already made arrangements for overseas distribution of the fast packet switching systems, which will be trialled in the South Australian Justice Department under that program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be no secret that there has been industrial action at Wodonga Meats for quite some time now. I am advised that that action has been going on for about 18 months. At present, that industrial action has taken the form of a reaction to the dismissal of a number of union delegates and some further steps have been taken by other employees who, themselves, have now been given notices of dismissal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, they are all members of the Australasian Meat Employees Union. Of course, they would not be refused benefit because of their union membership but, rather, because of the Social Security Act which does preclude payment of unemployment benefit to members of a union involved in industrial action. The members of the Meat Employees Union who have been employed at Wodonga Meats and who have applied for unemployment benefit have had their claims rejected. Of course, that industrial action is still proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department has obtained information from both the employer and individuals as they have come in to make their claims in relation to the reason for the unemployment. There has been no necessity, in the view of the Department, to interview any of the people concerned, because we are getting claim forms setting out the position as well as information from the employer.</PARA>
<PARA> In deciding whether or not to apply that section of the Act which does preclude payment to people engaged in industrial action, the Department would normally seek information from the claimant, the union, the employer and perhaps the Department of Industrial Relations, if it was felt necessary, or even the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. So on this occasion the Department thinks that it has got plenty of evidence, which does not appear, I might say, to be disputed. So it has not seen fit to conduct interviews. That does not mean that we take decisions on hearsay. We believe that there is enough evidence.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the spouses of striking workers may be eligible for unemployment benefit. Indeed, some have applied and been successful. Others might be eligible for special benefit. Again, some have applied and been successful. Otherwise, there is not much joy for those meat workers in making unemployment benefit claims. Senator Cooney might recall that Senator Grimes tried to amend this section of the Act in a number of ways in 1983-84, and that attempt failed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can tell Senator Beahan that, as one can see from the submissions that various sectors of industry have made to the review of occupational health and safety in Australia, industry has quite clearly made forthright calls for greater uniformity in occupational health and safety law in this country. Many of the submissions made by employer groups have been based on experiences that they or their constituent affiliates have had in the United States or the European Community. In the United States, for example, national standards have been mandatory since Congress in 1970 passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act. That Act requires the United States National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health to take action on behalf of all workers in the United States to ensure that there is a minimum standard of safe working conditions in that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the European Community, uniformity in occupational health and safety regulations will be achieved by the end of 1992 with the closer integration of that Community. The main motive behind this push for national uniformity-without in any way denigrating the socially just nature of many of these reforms-is an economic one. It is recognised by companies that it is certainly more efficient, in particular for national companies or companies thinking of investment in more than one State, to have a common set of standards for occupational health and safety that must be observed. I will give two classic examples. There is obviously a need to have a common coding standard for chemicals in use rather than, in a country such as Australia, six different standards, one for each State. In the certificating of plant and equipment from a safety point of view, there is also a real need to see that the standards between States are the same.</PARA>
<PARA> The Ministers for Labour Advisory Council, which consists of all of the State and Territory Ministers plus me, has reaffirmed its determination to set national uniform standards for occupational health and safety in Australia. The debate there is about what level of standard should apply. We certainly do not want to see national standards arise which are at the lowest common denominator. We want to see national standards arise which reflect the need for uniformity and also observe a level of reasonableness and fairness in protecting workers from injury or disease at work.</PARA>
<PARA> From the Commonwealth's point of view-and I am sure Senator Beahan shares these sentiments-we wish to see that common standard in Australia arise quickly. That relates to what the Premiers have said at previous Premiers Conferences about micro-economic reform and the need to speed that up by getting standards in other areas of industry as well.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the report entitled Immigration and its Labour Market Impact in the Northern Territory which has been published and which was reported on, I thought very fairly, in the Australian today. The report by Dr John Taylor is critical of the Trade Development Zone Authority. The damning words deserve quoting here. The report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Given the fact that part of (its) task was to assist in sponsoring visa applications and provide the main point of contact with prospective employers, the Zone Authority's facilitating role appears to have consisted not so much as turning a blind eye to company activities but simply not bothering to ask appropriate questions in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased that that has now been published as an objective finding. It is certainly what we said in government at the time when we asked that the trade development zone clean up its act.</PARA>
<PARA> One will recall that back then Chinese guest workers were brought into Australia, kept in barracks, paid a rate well under the award and not given their legal entitlements. In some cases there was innuendo that they would be deported in disgrace back to China if they spoke at all to unions. I know that some of them had clandestine meetings with unions in order to discover what their rights were, and later unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions made representations on their behalf. Later they were told that even if they were paid something in terms of their proper legal entitlement, that would be taken off them by the agents when they returned to the People's Republic of China.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Industrial Relations at that time investigated the particular case of Hengyang Darwin and Hengyang Holdings. Seventy workers were employed by both those companies. We found that underpayments of wages and superannuation totalled $684,000. Of that amount we have recovered $220,000 for wages and superannuation payments. We believe that there is more to be recovered, but what is a sad fact is that a substantial amount of the due and proper legal entitlement of these people will not be recovered in the events that have followed since.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems with this trade development zone has now been remedied legislatively with the aid of the Australian Democrats in changing the Federal Industrial Relations Act late last year. There is now a requirement that there be kept in a standard format proper time and wages records. In the investigations we found that no proper records were kept by the employers and therefore we were not able to pin down exactly what the amount of money owing was. Where people are non-union members they can now at law, as a result of the legislative changes last year, obtain back pay when they have been underpaid. That is a further improvement that has been made in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that the final improvement we have made is quite significant, too. If it is now found that workers have not had superannuation funds-the right employer superannuation contribution-lodged on their behalf, the amount of contribution can be recovered and lodged for them, plus what that amount would have earned had it been lodged at the proper time. With the program by my Department to disseminate this information to employers more widely and with this report turning a spotlight on the trade development zone, an example will be made and information will now be supplied to prevent this sort of practice growing further.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Standing on the carpet or standing on Senator Crichton-Browne, as I have to do from time to time. I am very grateful to Senator Bell for this question. I have consistently pointed to the carpet industry as being a successful part of the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. It is certainly one sector of the textiles, clothing and footwear industry which has taken the restructuring message to heart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The carpet industry to which Senator Bell referred was one of the first industry bodies to write me a letter following the March industry statement, accepting the challenge-as it put it-of restructuring in its industry and saying that it totally accepted it and would take it up. The carpet industry has seen a quite spectacular growth in exports recently. For example, in the six months to December 1990, compared with the six months to December 1989, exports in this industry more than doubled. In fact, there was an increase of 84 per cent in exports. Of all the grants made by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority prior to the March statement, 21 per cent went to carpet manufacturers whose production represents 7 per cent of the total output of the textiles, clothing and footwear industry.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is a testimony to how seriously this industry is taken and has to be taken. I also believe that part of that success can be attributed to the close relationship which has now developed between the carpet wool growers and the processors, the carpet manufacturers, in recent years. Under the protection of a fixed floor price plan for wool, for example, or under the high manufacturing protection in some industries, the relationship between suppliers of primary products and producers of manufactured products in this country was very bad. There was a lot of waste and a lot of uncoordination of productive effort.</PARA>
<PARA> About 64 per cent of all wool processed to yarn or fabric in Australia is processed by the carpet industry. Until recently most of that wool-about $100m-worth a year-was imported. The development of the local carpet wool industry has helped to replace these imports and to enhance the value of the exports of finished carpet. The wool tax decision in October last year-that is, exempting coarser wools of 32 microns and above from the market support component of the wool tax for two years-took these factors into account. I am sure that my colleague Mr Kerin as responsible Minister will give very careful consideration to all these factors once again.</PARA>

I have also made it very clear that the Government has acted on the very clear advice of our legal advisers in the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Olsen made some allegation about party political motivations and whatever. I have also made it very clear that the Government's motivation in this area is to respond to a very growing and real problem in our community. It is a problem that Senator Olsen recognised in a press statement that he put out on the weekend about the Government's disclosure Bill. When putting out that press statement, it was very clear that Senator Olsen attempted, in a low level party political way, to mislead the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA> We, on this side of the Parliament, are concerned about something that those opposite are not concerned about; and that is to ensure that the costs of campaigning are reduced to a level where we do not have a continuation of inquiries into the relationship between the corporate sector and government, so that in the future people such as Tony Eggleton cannot say that donors get easier access to Prime Ministers and so that we do not have a continuation of a system in which people such as Commissioner Roden, in the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales, can say:</PARA>
<PARA> So long as substantial donations can be made to political parties or candidates without disclosure, they can be used to purchase influence.</PARA>
<PARA>The only way to remove that sort of problem from our political system is to do two things. One is to reduce the need of parties for campaign funds. The only effective way to do that is what we are doing here-this has been done elsewhere throughout the world-and that is put a ban on paid advertising. Secondly, we can introduce disclosure legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Olsen mentions party political motivation. I read his press statement on the weekend. I notice that it was about the Government's disclosure Bill. He called it a trick; he said that it was not absolute disclosure. We, on this side, made it very clear at the start that we would be surprised were the Opposition to stick with its expressed position supporting our disclosure legislation; I will still be surprised. It will be even more surprising because of the sorts of things that Senator Olsen has been saying. In his press statement Senator Olsen said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is absolutely no mention of unions' disclosure of the compulsory millions of dollars in affiliation fees and other donations which they pass on to the ALP each year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 May Senator Lees asked me a question on waiting periods. I undertook to provide further information on the use of hardship provisions. In conjunction with the introduction of the liquid assets test, the Government took steps to ensure that unemployment benefit (UB) and job search allowance (JSA) claimants in financial hardship receive immediate access to unemployment benefit rather than having to claim special benefit, as had previously been the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because the assessment of financial hardship now takes place automatically as part of the liquid assets test, it is likely that the liquid assets test has helped a lot more people than it has hurt. In the first two weeks of February, for example, of 45,900 people granted UB or JSA, some 16,800, or 37 per cent, did not serve a waiting period. Almost one in five had the waiting period waived under the financial hardship provision, including a small number who would otherwise have been required to serve a deferment period under the liquid assets test; 10 per cent transferred from another benefit; and 6 per cent had the waiting period waived under other provisions which protect those who have already served a waiting period in the recent past and former long term beneficiaries returning to benefit after a short spell of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> I was also asked a supplementary question about young persons' access to special benefit during the education leaver deferment period. During the 13 weeks to 15 February 1991, the period during which education leaver claimants are most likely to have been serving such a waiting period, some 8,700 people were granted JSA or UB after serving a full six-week or 13-week education leaver deferment period; another 9,300 had that period reduced or abolished entirely; and there were 9,600 grants of special benefit to education leavers, which I think demonstrates the point that I had made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chapman asked me a question yesterday in which he asserted that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) ignores Australian women composers. The ABC has provided me with the following information in response to Senator Chapman's question. The arts programming policy for Radio National and ABC FM is to increase the number of contemporary women represented as creative artists, which includes composers. The policy is constrained, however, by the limited amount of relevant material actually recorded and available for broadcasting. The ABC understands that all arts commissioning editors are aware of the need to seek out and encourage women to write special features and to record women's music wherever possible in live broadcasts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> ABC Classics is about to release two discs featuring women composers. The first, to be released within the next few weeks, is the `Kathryn Selby Piano' disc which includes Miriam Hyde's `Valley of the Rocks'. The second, to be released in July, is a recording of three Australian violin concertos, including Margaret Sutherland's violin concerto. Discussions are also taking place with a view to releasing an all women composers disc of orchestral, chamber or instrumental music.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to Musica Nova, the ABC coordinated the festival in Brisbane and was responsible for the commissioning of six Australian composers. The composers were chosen to showcase Queensland work on the basis of artistic criteria relating to the general theme of the festival-an exploration of recent attitudes to modernism. The individuals and organisations which were invited to perform made their own choices of composers, constrained only by the requirement that Australian works programmed should concentrate on Queensland composers, and that the work of four visiting composers be included if possible. The ABC selected and sponsored the overseas composers, one of whom was Sophia Gubaidulina.</PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, there are currently more men than women active in composition, particularly orchestral composition. The ABC is committed to helping overcome this situation wherever possible. For example, each year the ABC runs an orchestral composers school in conjunction with Sounds Australia. The ABC contributes the services of an orchestra and conductor for a week, to workshop and perform the work of young composers. For the last two years the ABC has endorsed a procedure in which one of the four composers is a woman. The ABC has also agreed to apply affirmative action principles in the selection of the next two composer residences with ABC orchestras. In effect, priority will be given to allocating one of these two positions to a woman.</PARA>

<PARA>That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA>The failure of the Government's economic policies, which have led to the most severe recession since the Great Depression, and its total inability to pursue the policies necessary to restore hope and economic growth to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>In doing so, I welcome Senator Button as I see that he will follow me in this debate. It is a great surprise to see Senator Button join in this debate. To my recollection, it is the first time that Senator Button has participated in an economic debate of this nature in the life of this present Parliament. I can only take that as an indication that, at long last, the Government is realising the seriousness of the dramatic downturn that is occurring in the Australian economy at great cost and hardship to virtually every Australian-hardship that has been caused, without any doubt at all, by the failure of this Government and its inability to pursue responsible policies to put our great nation on the right path for the 1990s and into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of `banana republic' statement day. The Senate will recall that on that day, 14 May 1986, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said some very serious and very sensible things. In an interview on the John Laws radio program he was asked what would happen if we did not get out of the economic hole we were in at that time-a hole, I must point out, that had already been dug by that Government, of which Mr Keating had been Treasurer for over three years at that stage. When he was asked what would happen if we did not get out of the economic hole, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The fall-back solution is inevitable because you can't fund $12 billion a year [current account deficit] in perpetuity every year, and then the interest on the year before that, and the interest on the year before that. The only thing to do is slow the growth to a canter. Once you slow the growth under 3 per cent, unemployment starts to rise again . . . Then you have gone. You are a Banana Republic. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer was right in what he said at that time. So what have his policies, which were designed to avoid this very situation, produced? The short answer is that they have produced precisely what the Treasurer said in 1986 must not be produced. At that time he said that if we did not get out of the economic hole we were in then-a hole that had been dug by the Treasurer himself-we would have to close the economy down. I will quote the Treasurer precisely. In those circumstances, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>You cut all growth to zero, you stop all the imports growing and unemployment starts rising again, and profits fall apart . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We need to cut through all of the Treasurer's mindless rhetoric of recent years-such as his famous statement of the 1988 or 1989 Budget, `This Budget brings home the bacon'; his infamous, `This is a beautiful set of figures' statement; his `We've pursued fiscal rectitude' statement; his `We've fundamentally restructured the economy' statement; and his unbelievable statement made in the last Budget Speech only eight or nine months ago when he had the audacity to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has negotiated a difficult transition over the past 12 months-from an economy where spending and growth were overblown to an economy with lower activity and fewer imports. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Tonight I am able to report that we are emerging from this phase in fundamentally better shape having succeeded in this transition. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The faith the Australian people exhibited in the Government at the election-</PARA>
<PARA>the election in March of last year, two days before which he said that under no circumstances were we going to let any recession happen-</PARA>
<PARA>is now being repaid as the economy adjusts to a sustainable rate of growth without a catastrophic collapse. </PARA>
<PARA> This year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up. </PARA>
<PARA>In short, the kind of outcome the Government was seeking, delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession. </PARA>
<PARA> He said that the Government had had its trust put in it by the Australian people. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's Budget-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the last Budget, the Budget of eight or nine months ago-</PARA>
<PARA>is just about that. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, about trust. Cutting through all of that rhetoric, that absolutely grossly misleading attempt to fool the Australian people into believing that the hardship that was being induced was not there, what do we find? We find that today, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 844,000 people are out of work-the highest figure ever recorded by the Bureau. That is 9.9 per cent of the work force; more than 10 per cent in five of the six Australian States-the only exception being the Liberal State of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The figure of 9.9 per cent-which compares with the figure of 7.9 per cent at the time of the banana republic statement-includes youth unemployment at a criminal 27 per cent. In reality, the unemployment level in Australia is much higher than those figures. The Commonwealth Employment Service has more than one million people seeking jobs-12.4 per cent of the work force. If we add people who are working fewer than 15 hours a week or fewer hours than they wish, the unemployment figure is almost 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, my colleague Senator Alston quoted a statement made in 1983 by Senator Richardson, which I think and hope will come back to haunt him-although he is pretty hard to haunt-that the Government was elected to get unemployment down and that if it does not do that it does not deserve to govern. That is absolutely right. That is the situation that has existed since then. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the Treasurer's beautiful unemployment figures; so much for a current account deficit still running at an annual rate of $16 billion to $18 billion a year; so much for our ever escalating foreign debt, now in excess of $150 billion compared with $93 billion on the day that the banana republic statement was made and compared with $7 billion only 10 years ago; so much for interest payments on that debt, now requiring more than 20c in every dollar of export earnings, one-quarter higher than it was just five years ago; so much for our bankruptcy rate, up 52 per cent over the last year; so much for real interest rates, running at some 10 per cent, the highest in the Western world, and crippling business and households alike; and so much for a massive deterioration in the Government's budgetary position and the budgetary position of the public sector in Australia as a whole, again brought about essentially by the policies of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line of all of this is a fall in the nation's production in four of the last five quarters to December 1990 and almost certainly again in the March quarter 1991. In other words, we are in the worst recession since the 1930s-the worst recession for 60 years. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, does Senator Button want a copy of today's Age? Senator Button had to make a statement. These are the facts of the grim reality of our economic situation. These are the facts that prompted the last Hawke Government Finance Minister, Senator Walsh, to say last week that Australia is arguably not still in a recession, but a depression. Views such as these have been voiced increasingly by those at the coalface in the business community. The Business Council of Australia found, in a survey only two days ago, that three-quarters of all the respondents expected further sharp falls in both employment and investment over the next 12 months following the dramatic falls, particularly in employment, that have occurred in the past 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Comments have been made by business leaders. Two days ago the Coles-Myer Finance Director said that the economy has not yet bottomed. Philip Brass of Pacific Dunlop Ltd, one of the major companies in this nation, said that he expected no change in the very low demand for buildings, plant and equipment with the level of economic activity down 8 to 10 per cent on the same period last year and the potential for several months of further decline. Ian Webber from Mayne Nickless said that the company is still experiencing extremely difficult trading conditions and he would not want to suggest any sign of relief. </PARA>
<PARA> Even Senator Button's own Department's Construction Forecasting Committee is predicting a deeper slump in construction activity than occurred in the 1970s, and lasting until 1993-94. Also, that Committee has expressed concern at the signs that the investment climate is still not favourable for major projects which are internationally mobile. That is also a very conservative statement. Two days ago the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI) found, in a survey of 168 executives, that 94 per cent of those executives thought current trading conditions were poor, very poor, or depressed, and 90 per cent found the investment climate to be the same. Ian Spicer, the Executive Director of the CAI, says that business confidence is unbelievably low. He says that the business community is angry about the cavalier way in which the Government has decided to cure our economic problems, irrespective of the hardship that it will cause for industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition welcomes today's fall in the inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI). It is a welcome figure; it provides welcome relief from the continuing bad economic news. But it is the least that could be expected from an economy that has been so brutally bludgeoned for so long by the Hawke Government. I put it to Senator Button-and I hope that he will respond to this in the manner in which it is put-that the trick now is to ensure that, when the economy finally claws its way out of protracted recession, it does not drag the CPI back up with it. The Treasurer's recent comment that beating inflation was `like snapping a stick' indicates that the Government has no real idea of just what is required to achieve a sustainable low inflation environment. That is also apparent from the fact that the Treasurer conspicuously turned his back on the inflation problem until he opportunistically picked it up as his latest pet issue a few months ago because he saw the inflation rate falling due to the recession-induced impact. He thought that he would get a bit of political mileage out it in his continuing run for the prime ministership. </PARA>
<PARA> How much less painful the path to lower inflation could have been if the Treasurer had adopted monetary policy for its proper role-that is, the role of fighting inflation-from the start. He should regard today's drop in the CPI as a very lucky break. To keep on that lower inflation path, the Treasurer must now recognise his past mistakes. The Government now needs to lock in lower inflation over the longer term and salvage one lasting benefit from the unnecessary destruction of our productive base and the hurt to millions of Australians that the Treasurer has caused. The Government should announce immediately a clear and coherent anti-inflationary strategy. It should clearly articulate the costs of inflation and quantify these where possible. It should give an unequivocal commitment that inflation will be a priority for the Government over the rest of its term. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, said today, the Government should target an inflation figure of nought to 2 per cent over the remainder of its term of office, and it should give the Reserve Bank greater independence and a charter to tackle inflation as its sole objective. The coalition is working on plans to do just that when it returns to government. Together with a clear and believable anti-inflationary strategy the Government must also get serious about the structural reform which it trumpets but from which emerges virtually no results. Only if it puts in place the correct structural policies will the creation of a lasting, sustainable, internationally competitive low inflation environment be achievable. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has offered the Government the hand of bipartisanship to achieve this. The Government will have, and knows it will have, our full support to implement a comprehensive program of structural change, including, most importantly, genuine enterprise bargaining and reform of the labour market, land transport, coastal shipping, the waterfront and telecommunications, if it seriously embraces privatisation and the other public sector reforms, including reshaping the tax system by the introduction of a broadly based goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> All the indications, tragically for the Australian economy and the Australian people, are, however, that these reforms will not be forthcoming from the Government. Why? It is because the Government and the Treasurer in particular refuse to accept the blame where it fairly and squarely lies-at its own feet, at the feet, quite clearly, of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer. This deep and unnecessary recession that we are now having is Hawke-led and Keating-driven, but the Government blindly refuses to accept this. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the Prime Minister and the Treasurer blamed everyone but themselves for our present situation. The Treasurer kept blaming consumers for spending too much in 1988 and 1989. He blamed the banks. He said it was the banks' fault because asset inflation took off and gross domestic product was squandered. He blamed the employers, saying that they were trying to throw 15 per cent wage increases to employees if only they would take it. But the daddy of them all was that he claimed that the recent deterioration in the terms of trade had been the main cause of his problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the Treasurer really went over the top on that. He said that with halfway decent terms of trade it would be `game, set and match' for the economy in the 1990s. Let us look at this heroic assertion which the Treasurer has been throwing around for some time and which is even getting some credence with the economic commentators. It is an absolute nonsense. It is correct that the terms of trade are a relevant factor influencing our economic performance but they are by no means the primary influence. But even if they were, what do the figures show? They show that in the March quarter of 1989 Australia's terms of trade reached a 1980s high. Although they have since fallen by 11.7 per cent from that 1980s peak, they are still higher than at any time between the June 1985 quarter and the March 1988 quarter. The period from March 1988 until very recently was a period of better than average terms of trade. To hear the Treasurer bleat, one would think that the terms of trade had done him wrong. That is absolutely not true. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a graph demonstrating these facts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Treasurer, who has deliberately, to use his own words, `pulled the levers' to engineer the recession-as Senator Peter Walsh rightly says, arguably a depression-said in March 1990, two days before the Federal election, that we were not going to have that recession, but only eight months later we had to have it. Now there are among his colleagues many who apparently want to recognise this magnificent achievement of wrecking the Australian community, putting almost two million people out of productive work, by promoting him to Prime Minister. The Treasurer has already experienced the Peter principle once-promotion beyond the level of one's competence. Surely we are not going to make it the Peter principle revisited. It is a tragedy that the Government has pursued the policies that it has. They have led to gross misery and loss of production, employment and investment, and great hardship to virtually every Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This has occurred because of blind ambitions on the part of certain members of the Government, notably the Treasurer. It has arisen because of the Government's inability to pursue consistent policies to have the right objectives for economic policy, namely, an eye on the ball in getting inflation down. The Government has lost sight of the real level of government and that is governing for a better Australia. For that the Government stands condemned, and I urge the Senate to support this urgency motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, they did not. Their last Treasurer ran away from all the issues that they now embrace. I know it in my own area. In regard to a general inquiry into tariffs in 1977, Treasurer Howard said that there would be no reduction in tariffs as against the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission. Again and again we find this pattern of behaviour. The Liberal Opposition lists all the wonderful things it intends to do now about labour market reform, waterfront, telecommunications, and all these things.

<PARA> Up came the squatter mounted on his thoroughbred;</PARA>
<PARA> Down came the troopers-one, two and three. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Ian McLachlan is all about. In relation to all these issues that Senator Short mentions, Mr McLachlan is here, as he says, to do a few things and then retire gracefully, as his lifestyle has always dictated. As they say in South Australia, as Senator Teague knows, `You can always tell a McLachlan. There are lots of them here, but you can't tell them anything'. That is the sort of leadership on some of these issues from which the Opposition is suffering at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach to this issue which I want to deal with as simply as possible is to say that, in spite of all Senator Short's windy rhetoric, this Government concedes the depth of the current recession and we concede the very severe impact that the current recession is having on many people. I also wish in my remarks to stress the cyclical and short term nature of this recession and look at the overall fundamentals of the Australian economy, the expectations regarding an improvement of these conditions, and the structural improvements on the supply side of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of discussion as to whether the current recession has bottomed out, as they say, and whether there is likely to be an immediate or short term upturn in the Australian economy. In that respect, I think that today's inflation rate will be a helpful signal. I can best summarise these issues by referring to an article by Alan Wood, Economics Editor of the Australian newspaper, on 14 May when he looked at the indicators in the Australian economy. In that article he described some people as talking about the indicators as `straws in the wind', and quoted the Business Council of Australia survey, to which Senator Short referred. That survey stated:</PARA>

Alan Wood made another reference to the highly regarded Dunn and Bradstreet survey of business expectations and said that the track record of that survey had been good; it covered a large sample of firms. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Its latest survey, for the second quarter of 1991, seems to suggest that the trough of recession has been reached. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wood then referred to Dr Duncan Ironmonger, who prepared a comment based on the survey. Dr Ironmonger stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is still too early to put firm dates on when the actual levels of business sales will start to rise. However, if interest rates and inflation continue to fall-</PARA>
<PARA>I must remind honourable senators that falls in interest rates were the largest component, apart from transport equipment, in the consumer price index fall-</PARA>
<PARA>we can expect rising sales in September quarter 1991 and the levels of employment and profits starting to rise in the first quarter of 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>Alan Wood went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> This is the most optimistic private survey . . . but Dr Ironmonger is not alone in his view. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wood then referred to the stock market indicators and said that, although economists were sometimes suspicious of the stock market, it had quite often been right. I mention those things because I want to emphasise that it is no good my coming in here as a government spokesman and saying that there is any joy for us, as honourable senators know, in the circumstances of this recession. I have said on numerous occasions that as a government we, together with the wide sectors of the economics profession, clearly misread some of the indicators, or lagged indicators as they were last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if one seeks alternative advice from the Opposition on this sort of thing, one finds that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was saying much the same thing in many statements. For example, in February of this year he made the point:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't see any particular month's figures as a trigger one way or other in relation to monetary policy. I would say though that monetary policy has already eased quite significantly. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hewson went on to talk about interest rates falling as the economy slowed down and said that he considered that was an official judgment that had to be made. He made some speculative observations in June 1990 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister is wrong to say is that . . . inflation will fall to 6 per cent in the 12 months to June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>That was about the Budget forecast. In fact, the inflation rate will be below the Budget forecast. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Prime Minister simply appears to be out of touch with both domestic and international thinking on inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>The figure on inflation is getting out of touch with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Our inflation rate is lower than that of many of our trading partners in Europe and North America. </PARA>

Year after year Senator Short would walk in here telling me what a great lady Margaret Thatcher was and telling about all those wonderful things that those opposite would do, but would never have had the guts to do. She was a folk hero. But now they have forgotten all about her because there has been a deep recession in the United Kingdom, as there is in North America. Senator Short cannot have it all possible ways in here, not with my responding to him as he invited me to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me put this in perspective. Of course the policy induced aspect of the recession is of severe concern to the Government. But many other factors have been affecting the problem in Australia. These are not present in Britain, the United Kingdom or Canada. Firstly, there is the impact of the rural recession here, which is very large and largely associated with international commodity prices and inability to gain market access. Secondly, of course, there are the corporate collapses from the excesses of the 1980s, which were well under way before the recession. I think everybody in this country misread the effects of the 1987 stock market crash on this country. Those corporate collapses have led to all sorts of extraordinary behaviour, as I said at Question Time, by the banks and financial institutions, which have not been as supportive of the productive sector of the Australian economy as they were of the Alan Bonds of this world during the 1980s. The current recessionary circumstances have to be seen in that context.</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout all this period, the Opposition, which is a legitimate function for an Opposition, has persistently drawn attention to one major factor, and that is unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA> Looking forward, this recession will end and improvements in the Australian economy will appear. The performance of Australian industry gives me great confidence that Australia will be well placed to meet the challenges of the 1990s. When one asks the Opposition about these issues and about its economic stance-as I showed using quotations from Dr Hewson and others-one sees that it offers very little alternative except this rhetoric which Dr Hewson engaged in again today. When asked how he would fix all this, he answered:</PARA>
<PARA>We will introduce a comprehensive program of structural change, more genuine enterprise bargaining, reform of the labour market, land transport, coastal shipping, the waterfront, telecommunications, privatisation, other public sectors reform, including the reshaping of the tax system and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the rhetoric pattern of the Opposition which, in all its 30 years in government, never addressed any of these issues. Was waterfront reform or transport reform ever heard of when the Liberals were in office? Why was it not heard of? Because the Opposition cushioned manufacturers with high tariffs. If a company were trading in Malaysia it just came up here to see Malcolm Fraser and it got a special quota. Manufacturers got high tariffs and were protected from the outside world. The Opposition now comes back and talks to us about international competitiveness. All these issues are on the agenda, not because those opposite put them there but because we did. We have made huge structural changes in the Australian economy which were never attempted in the past. Low inflation will underpin the improvements. </PARA>

When one has that sort of economy and embarks on a program of structural change, of course one runs into difficulties. Enormous structural change has taken place in this economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this context, there is a very real danger that the Opposition will oversell to the community the economic problems which we face. The other real danger is that it will oversell its capacity to deal with them. This debate is being broadcast; I have to tell the people of Australia that the Opposition's capacity to deal with these issues is almost minimal, and it should know that. All this silly stuff that some of the more macho Opposition spokesmen go on with is not in itself a solution, when the macro-economic issues to which I have referred are not being dealt with in any different way by the Opposition in the statements that have been made . </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the 1980s has been a difficult decade as a result of changes in the environment. Tariffs have come down in an environment of uncertainty. There have been volatile exchange rates as a result of the decision to float the dollar. There has been some indifference towards and bad structural relationships between the financial and manufacturing sectors. There has been a bad situation for Australia in terms of world markets for its rural products. All these difficulties have been with us. In spite of that, there has been strong growth in structural improvements of the Australian economy. These have been recognised elsewhere. They provide the underlying strength for recovery, which will lead us away from the misery index put forward by the Liberals, a party buoyant with gloom because it is dedicated to our catastrophe in the interests of its political advancement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has displayed these qualities in Question Time today and throughout this debate in the remarks of Senator Short. I would not get too buoyant with gloom; we will get out of this difficult period in time. When we do get out of it, we will get out of it in much better shape than anything we have seen in the last 40 years in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again the Senate is debating, at the behest of the Opposition, the disastrous economic and social consequences, particularly as far as employment is concerned, of the Government's economic policies. I listened very carefully to the speech that Senator Short gave on behalf of the Opposition in support of his motion and, once again, I could not help but agreeing when he outlined the disastrous consequences of what the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) called the `misery index', and being `buoyant with gloom'. Certainly, Australia is now in a critical position and people at the bottom of the ladder are paying for it. Twenty-seven per cent youth unemployment speaks for itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I listened in vain for any measures that the Opposition would be prepared to support which would address, as a matter of intervention in our economy, the difficult situation that we are in-measures which would get people back to work today, tomorrow or next week, enliven our economy and enable our manufacturing sector to compete overseas to increase our exports. Just a little while ago, a second reading attachment to Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91 was circulated suggesting three measures: initiating a further one per cent drop in interest rates; assisting State governments to eliminate payroll tax; and providing accelerated depreciation allowances for productive equipment in the manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I was amazed and disgusted when I was told that the coalition parties would not be able to support the second reading amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 4) that the Australian Democrats are putting forward. The clear implication is that the Opposition, as much as the Government, is prepared to abdicate its responsibility to intervene in the market to ensure that the economy produces employment and the social and economic goods that satisfy people's needs. Opposition senators are prepared to leave their responsibility adrift in the sea of the market. The market, without values and without vision, is supposed to allow us to achieve our national objective at will. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have approximately one million unemployed-a figure which is up 60 per cent from last year. Bankruptcies are up by 53 per cent. These figures alone indicate the difficult situation that Australia finds itself in. We also know how we got there. We know that it was the concern of the Government to bring down the foreign debt to achieve a better balance of payments-in other words, to contain imports. The only solution that people who subscribe to the market ideology could think of was to bring down economic activity as a whole-once again, to crack a nut with a sledge-hammer. Would it not have been much better to contain imports by carefully targeted intervention methods-by increasing, for example, import duty on luxury imports and by requiring entrepreneurs to be subjected to the same loan restrictions as public utilities? Let us not forget that 65 per cent of our foreign debt was incurred by private entrepreneurs seeking loans for mostly non-productive paper takeovers. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of Australian assets, as Senator Coulter advises. Let us look at some of the measures that are now available to the Government and the Opposition if they would care to support them. Certainly the Democrats would support the Government if the Government chose to do something about people who are now without jobs. I have already mentioned interest rates. Public pressure seems to be so strong that I would venture to say that within two or three weeks we will see another drop of one per cent in interest rates. But what about payroll tax? In all States around Australia, payroll tax is being levied on employers: it is a direct cost to employment. The Australian Democrats propose that one of the priorities of the Federal Government should be to assist State governments over time to phase out payroll tax and it should start doing so right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The manufacturing sector has been asking for accelerated depreciation allowances. We would support that proposal and call on the Government to initiate it, particularly in those sectors of the economy which are able to increase their export performance. I am adverting here to the environmental technology sector, which I mentioned yesterday in the debate on the Appropriation Bills. The proposal is being put forward as a worthwhile strategy by Dr John Stocker of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and has been endorsed by our Ambassador for the Environment. Many other sectors-for instance, the tourism industry-would equally repay some of the investment and assistance which has been provided by the Government in removing impediments and developing infrastructure, which is particularly important and critical in those sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that exports should be increased quickly. We believe that a 5 per cent bounty offered on new exports only would be an incentive that would repay the investment many times over. In the last year, $2,800m worth of new investments would have meant a bounty of $140m. This could easily have been doubled with a further expenditure of $140m. Alternatively, the Government could consider a tax break on, say, 50 per cent of income derived from new additional exports. This is one measure that Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with which we are competing are using to gear up their exports to bring goods into Australian cities and to sell to Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Government should introduce a research and development guarantee. It is quite clear that the $30 billion that private enterprise has derived in Australia from the operations of the accord over the last six to seven years has not been used for investment. The investment by Australian companies has been marginal at best. If private enterprise is not capable of doing it, maybe the public sector or the Government should take some action to ensure that research and development pursues a path that will lead to our becoming the clever, the active and, ultimately, the just country. In the current situation, we would favour increased expenditure on transport, housing, education and research. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also mention briefly the community work program which the Democrats are now putting forward, which would enable people who are on unemployment benefits to carry out work organised by local government: to carry out projects, for instance, for the conservation of public parks, land care and other environmentally important areas; and to carry out work for elderly people, in child-care centres, in community health centres and in other such areas. It would mean that they would need to derive some payment on an hourly basis in addition to their unemployment benefits which would lift the total remuneration to the award level of wages. This would have clear implications for social security legislation, but this should not be above us. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that Senator Kemp is in the Senate at the moment. He has started a fashion of looking at other parties' policies. I have taken the liberty today of looking at the Australian Labor Party platform for 1988. Under employment, education and training, in paragraph 3 of the introduction, we read the following:</PARA>
<PARA> The achievement of high and sustained economic growth is central to the fight against unemployment and poverty. Improving Australia's education and training systems is a central part of the task of achieving our full employment objective. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Government and its Ministers would do well to read this paragraph again and to take some action, as I have outlined before, as proposed by the Democrats. Senator Kemp also asked, as he does continually, `Where is the money coming from?'. I could give him a number of examples which were published in the alternative Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, a 39 per cent withholding tax on interest paid to overseas lenders would yield about $600m; a one per cent Commonwealth land tax on the improved value of land held by absentee foreign landowners, $100m; a tightening of tax haven legislation, $250m-the Government has done something about that, so the additional amount is probably worth only about $100m; taxing trusts as companies, $100m; the abolition of negative gearing on companies, which was a total flop in obtaining the additional construction of low rental properties, about $100m immediately and, through a phasing out of existing arrangements, a further $200m; a 40 per cent increase in the tobacco and alcohol excise, as recommended by the Australian Medical Association, $1.1 billion; and a road freight levy of 1c per tonne per kilometre, $455m. </PARA>
<PARA> I could continue with this list. Indeed, I am well aware that Senator Kemp perpetrated yesterday some lies about our taxation policies in the area of capital gains and wealth taxes. I suggest that Senator Kemp keep to the facts when he looks at our policies and when he publicises--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating an urgency motion which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government's economic policies, which have led to the most severe recession since the Great Depression, and its total inability to pursue the policies necessary to restore hope and economic growth to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>I regret to have to tell the Senate and the Australian community that all the indicators are pointing towards frightening prospects for our economy. Senator Button, who is often given to refreshing bursts of candour, has already admitted that the worst is yet to come. This country is in dire straits. In February this year, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reported that Australia was the worst performing economy among the 10 major industrialised economies in the world. In October 1990, Australia ranked seventh out of the 10, but by January 1991 it was ranked last-even behind New Zealand. We are all part of the same world environment, but Australia is handling the current conditions worse than any other industrialised country. We are in the recession which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said that we had to have and which he generated because of a completely inappropriate economic policy mix. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this, the effects of the severe rural recession have not yet flowed on to the cities. The National Farmers Federation is predicting the worst period for agriculture since the 1890s. When the multiplier effect of this really hits the secondary industries and services, business bankruptcies, which are already at record levels, will continue to soar, and the unemployment level, which is currently standing at 10 per cent, will go even higher. Living standards are continuing to fall, and this will accelerate when the effects of the current trade recession in the United States of America and Japan push the Australian economy down even further-a situation which Senator Button chose to ignore today, assuring us that we will come out of all of this very soon. </PARA>
<PARA> Make no mistake: we are currently in a very deep recession, and it is the result of the disastrous economic policies of the Hawke-Keating Government. When the effects of the world downturn are added to this, Australia could be pushed into a full-blown depression. How have we got into this mess? Over the last eight years the Hawke Government has made a number of fundamental errors in its direction of economic policy. It should have been getting the policy settings right to solve the underlying economic problem: our failure to produce sufficient goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> The top priority of the Hawke Government over the last eight years should have been to boost productivity. Instead, it has focused on demand management and on discouraging expenditure through a regime of high interest rates. Interest rates have been kept too high for too long. There are people in the Federal Government who recognise this. Mr Kerin, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, is one of them. Only this morning he is reported as saying that `lower interest rates are better than high interest rates'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's policy mix has been one of massive overkill. The Treasurer might rant and rave about banks and businesses but, when his policies were to keep interest rates high in the first place, it was really his fault that these businesses were pushed to breaking point. In February, the Treasurer admitted that the recession might have further to run and he was uncertain when recovery would emerge. But in February he assured Australia that it would not be before too long. He said that the Government's existing policies were on track and soon the economy would turn around. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the policy objectives of the Government at this time? It used to be to contain external debt and the current account deficit but now the Treasurer says that inflation is at the top of the agenda. One suspects that it is at the top of the agenda only because it is easier to achieve a lower inflation rate after one has hit the economy with the high interest rate sledge-hammer for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is now going backwards. Out in the suburbs and down on the farms people are feeling the pain. Living standards have declined dramatically and the people most affected are the most defenceless-the young, the unskilled and the unemployed. Adult unemployment in April reached the appalling figure of 844,000 people or 9.9 per cent of the work force, but youth unemployment is at 25.8 per cent or more than one in four. For the youth of Australia, the Great Depression has already arrived with a quarter of them officially without a job and without much prospect of getting one in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> Do the people in the Government, who have been insulated in this city for eight years, have any idea of the feeling of hopelessness and despair amongst good kids who, through no fault of their own, face enforced idleness? These kids must wonder why they tried so hard at school to become part of the clever country when, at the end of the process, they graduate to nothing with no prospects but enforced idleness. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployment figures are the ones which we are told about. These are the official figures supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Who are these unemployed? You are counted amongst the unemployed if you do not work at all. If you happen to do one hour's unpaid work a week, you are no longer listed as unemployed. You get no pay but you are considered to be employed part time. </PARA>
<PARA> If you do work experience for no pay, you are not unemployed either; you are employed part time. If you work on the family farm for one hour for no pay, you are not unemployed; you are employed part time. If you help in the family business for one hour with no pay, you are not unemployed; you are employed part time. No-one knows what the real unemployment figure is because of this strange ruling by the Department. Especially, no-one knows the real unemployment figure for young people because these are the people who are likely to be doing one hour of unpaid work in work experience, on family farms or in businesses which put them into this part time unemployment bracket. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the bodgie official figures are really only just the beginning. It has been predicted that unemployment will top the post-war high of 10.3 per cent. Jobs have been disappearing at an unprecedented rate since January and there has been an alarming increase in the number of job seekers, which has added the record number of 66,900 to the ranks of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder how much comfort it is to the unemployed to be told by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that the human toll of unemployment is a necessary part of restructuring the economy and that they are necessary statistics in the Government's plan to move to a much lower inflation rate. What does the Government propose to do about this? What does it say?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer talks about getting the ship back on course but he has been saying that ever since he became the Treasurer. All that the Treasurer can ever do is blame someone else. It used to be the former coalition government which caused all the evils of the Hawke Government's mismanagement. Then it was business, the banks, even the public because they spent too much, the importers-anyone except the Government or the trade unions. When confronted with the latest unemployment figures, what did the Treasurer say:</PARA>
<PARA>This recession is deeper than official policy would have had it be. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us have a look at some of the real underlying causes. Unions have a case to answer when they hold this country to ransom for wage increases that employers cannot afford. What is the result of that? The employers go out of business and the employees join the ranks of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there are the accords: marks I, II, III, IV, V and now VI, which has been firmly rejected by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. This is systematically being used by the unions to threaten companies with a $12 a week across-the-board wage rise which cannot be condoned or afforded at this time of deep recession. Employers were able to take some heart recently when the umpire, the Industrial Relations Commission, rejected the latest accord mark VI, only to face the reality of union persistence with the accord wage and superannuation rises. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take just one example. This week in Newcastle, the floating dock run by Forgacs Dockyard Newcastle Pty Ltd was forced by strike action and other coercive tactics to agree to part of the accord claim for $12 a week across-the-board wage rise. The company had no choice. The ships were tied up and were going to remain tied up until the claim was agreed to. When the company did agree to the claim, the unions decided to strike until Thursday. Today, the news is that Mr Stephen Forgacs is considering leaving the business. His problems are numerous. Ships are behind schedule and, in the case of one ship, the strike is costing him $15,000 a day. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at some of the work practices in this particular industry. The unions allocate workers from a 50-man A-list roster on a rotational basis. Mr Forgacs has no control over who works on his dock. Many of the workers are totally unsuitable but they have to be paid because they are on the list. This is happening at a time of recession when we have unemployment at almost 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Another one of his problems is gross overstaffing. Every blasting pot and every dock arm in Forgacs is manned by three men; in Japan, this equipment is traditionally manned by one person. There is also no provision in the award for shift work, so penalties rates apply for any work done outside the hours of 7.30 a.m. to 4 p.m.. Not only is Forgacs losing credibility and money through the delay on the HMAS Tobruk refit, but also three contracts for the repair of ships have been lost in the past week at a cost of a couple of million dollars to the dockyard. </PARA>
<PARA> This is just the beginning. This is clearly a systematic campaign being launched by the Australian Council of Trade Unions to enforce the accord mark VI despite the Industrial Relations Commission and regardless of the recession, of economic strife in this country, of escalating unemployment and of the demise of businesses through inability to pay claims. This Government has got it all terribly wrong, as the example I have just given of Forgacs floating dock illustrates. </PARA>
<PARA> In its fourth term in 1990, the Government belatedly discovered the so-called micro-economic reform agenda. Senator Button claimed today that the Government had done a lot in this area but it is doing too little, too late. The Government is consistently hampered in real workplace reform by the self-interest of trade unions keen on protecting a whole lot of comfortable and inefficient work practices and benefits which they have built up over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> What is needed in Australia is genuine productivity based workplace reform where workers and management sit down and work out a package of work practices and benefits which will not only deliver a higher standard of living for the worker, but also enable the company to stay in business. This is possible. Already, there have been a number of celebrated cases where, despite the opposition of trade unions and the industrial relations club, employers and employees have broken out of the system and formed their own productivity agreements which have delivered both higher profits and higher wages. </PARA>
<PARA> These cases have been landmarks in Australian industrial relations history: Dollar Sweets Co. Pty Ltd; the SPC Ltd fruit cannery; Robe River where 400 per cent productivity increases were reported; and, of course, Mudginberri abattoirs in the Northern Territory where an agreement was hammered out to save the company. This was done against union opposition. These types of agreements are not new. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was a student of industrial relations at Sydney University 25 years ago we studied cases like this which were occurring at that time in Europe and the United States. One model example of workplace cooperation and mutual benefit even occurred around the turn of the century at the Tartar steel mill in Jamshedpur in India. It seems to have taken a long time for these ideas to flow through to the workplace in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> But such practices are essential if we are to solve the basic underlying problem facing the Australian economy-the problem of low productivity. This is the key, because if there is genuine workplace reform which boosts productivity the country can move to a position where it produces more than it consumes and where it exports more than it imports. The effect of such a turnaround would be lower overseas debt, lower long term inflation, lower interest rates and lower levels of unemployment: all of the economic indicators would start to head in the right direction, as they have done for many years in economies such as Japan and Germany, which have high levels of productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The key to creating this situation in Australia is to have genuine enterprise agreements based on productivity. The Government has made a tentative start down this road, but it must urgently introduce policies to free up the workplace if it is to restore hope and economic growth to the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today on behalf of the Government to oppose this motion about the economy which has been moved by the Opposition. I think it is a product of the thinking of the Liberal Party tactics committee which-knowing that the inflation figures would come out today, that we would see the price level in Australia plummet and that it would be bad news for the Opposition-got together and worked out how it could distract public attention from this historic indicator, this landmark figure, on the inflation front. So it came up with this pathetic motion this afternoon in an effort to distract attention from the landmark inflation figures which have been released today which show the lowest rate of price inflation in our economy for many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are the people who, throughout the 1970s and the early 1980s, said that their cornerstone policy was to fight inflation first. These are the people who went to the electorate time and time again saying that they would fight inflation first and who were booted out of office with inflation and consumer prices in the double digit range at 11 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I am as concerned as anybody about the unemployment figures which were released last week. Understandably, there has been a great deal of focus on those figures. They are of great concern and it is understandable that people are concerned about them because many people have lost their livelihoods and, certainly, it is an uncomfortable time for many Australian families. I am concerned that the 9.9 per cent unemployment rate which was released last week is almost up to the levels of 1982-83 when we saw an unemployment rate of 10.3 per cent recorded in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out yesterday, the figures which were released last week are a little unusual in that at the same time as the unemployment rate was recorded as having risen, there was also a measured increase in the number of people working in Australia-a very unusual result at a time of recession in this country. It is one that is also clouded somewhat by the figures which have been released by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd on the number of advertisements for employment which have appeared in metropolitan daily newspapers. Those figures show that, for the first time in some months, in the month of April-the very month when unemployment rose to a measured 9.9 per cent-there was an increase in the number of job advertisements which appeared in Australian newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting indeed to note that in April the nation as a whole recorded a 3 per cent rise in the number of employment advertisements compared with March. It is also very interesting to note that, despite the rhetoric of those opposite about the so-called economic competence of the Government of New South Wales, in fact the rise in the number of job advertisements which was measured in the Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Morning Herald-the two newspapers sampled in that State-was lower than the national increase for the month of April. In fact, four of the Labor States-those which are being attacked repeatedly by the Opposition-actually had percentage increases in the number of employment advertisements which appeared in their metropolitan newspapers which were well ahead of the increase for the State of New South Wales in April. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's high unemployment figures reflect past policies; they do not reflect policies which are in operation today because there are long time lags associated with economic policy and long time lags between when a policy is changed and when the effect actually shows up through investment or production or shows up in the labour force. In fact, the unemployment figures now reflect the policies which were in place at the beginning of 1990, not the policies which were in place at the beginning of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is 12 months late in calling for a change of policy because there have been adjustments to policy throughout that period. Of course, at the beginning of 1990 we had very high interest rates-18 per cent was the official cash interest rate in our economy. We had a very tight fiscal policy and last financial year there was a Budget surplus of over $8,000m. So two very tight policies were working together. The reason for that-which has been ignored by the Opposition today-was to bring down the demand for imports in the Australian economy. That is a problem we have had: our production has not been keeping up with the total level of spending in the community and there has been a spill-over into imports. Those tight policies were engineered in order to in fact reduce the demand for imports. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to note that in the nine months to March this year the deficit on our overseas current account was $13.4 billion, compared with a deficit for the same period last year of some $17.6 billion. So there has been quite a remarkable improvement in that current account deficit. The reduction in imports has been proceeding apace and the recorded deficit of $13.4 billion compares very favourably, I believe, with the Budget forecast of $18 billion for this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates have been cut on a number of occasions. As I have pointed out, they were running at 18 per cent in January last year but in February last year we mooted a change. Dr Hewson said that this was electioneering; that we were in fact easing interest rates because an election was on. But those reductions were very timely and, since then, there have been a number of reductions following on from that. Official cash interest rates are now not 18 per cent, but 11 1/2 per cent in the Australian economy. So those rates have been cut by over one-third in that 15-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> This should help boost activity in the Australian economy-for example, activity in the form of new housing and new dwelling construction. New housing starts should increase in this coming financial year. I cite a forecast from the chief economist of the Commonwealth Bank-Australia's largest home lender-who last week went on the record as saying that he expected there to be 122,000 housing commencements in the current financial year and 134,000 in the next financial year. So an increase is being forecast by Australia's largest home lender. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to hear the rhetoric from the people opposite who keep claiming that this is the worst recession since the 1930s. When one looks at the housing industry one can see that that is clearly not the case. In fact, it is very easy to identify that in the Australian economy in 1982-83 in the recession which was engineered by Mr Howard there were only 105,000 housing starts. In this current financial year the Commonwealth Bank is saying that there will be 122,000. That is one clear statistic which nails the Liberal lie that we are currently in the worst recession since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that fiscal policy has been relaxed, along with interest rate policy. There have been two rounds of tax cuts, as Senator Jones well knows, in order to help to keep down gross wage claims in the Australian community and to remunerate employees by boosting their after tax disposable incomes. Those rounds have taken wage pressures away from business and have helped business to keep its costs down. That is one of the key reasons why today we have the very impressive result of a negative consumer price index figure being recorded for the March quarter 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> Before today the consumer price index was at an annual rate of 6.9 per cent. With the introduction of the figure for the March quarter this year, the March figure last year-1.7 per cent-is removed and replaced by a negative figure of minus 0.2 per cent today. We have two percentage points coming off the consumer price index, bringing it down to 4.9 per cent. That will certainly help take the pressure off the family budget; it will help keep living costs down. It will do that despite the claims made this afternoon by those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have the lowest price increase rate in Australia for many years. Two of the key factors contributing to that, as I have pointed out, have been the reduction in interest rates under this Government and the reduction in the pressure on wages as a result of the tax cuts designed to remunerate workers by giving them higher after tax incomes rather than encouraging them to demand larger gross wage rises. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am discussing the inflation rate, it is important to note that the Budget last year forecast a 7 per cent inflation rate up to June this year. We have already had a 4.9 per cent inflation rate to the March quarter. Very importantly, Australia is becoming more competitive compared with its overseas trading partners. If one looks at the industrialised countries of the world, represented through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development based in Paris, the average inflation rate up to February for those countries was 6.6 per cent. Australia has an inflation rate of 4.9 per cent, which is well below 6.6 per cent. The trend in the rest of the world is for accelerating inflation; the trend in Australia is for decelerating inflation. We are on target to improve the competitiveness of Australian firms; to boost the price advantage of Australian exports. That will be a boost for local business and will certainly help other Australian firms compete better with imports. </PARA>
<PARA> I continue looking at the consumer price index and remind the Senate of the forecasts for inflation for the rest of this year that have been made by private sector economists. Before the figure came out today, Syntec Economic Services Pty Ltd was forecasting a 3.5 per cent rate of inflation by December; Westpac Banking Corporation, a 4.5 per cent rate; Bain and Co., a 4 per cent to 4 1/2 per cent rate; and the ANZ Bank business indicators released this week said the rate will possibly be below 4 per cent. The ANZ Bank business indicators may be right, in view of the figure that has come out today. The private sector certainly sees falling inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> When the June quarter figure comes out we have the prospect of the figure for the June quarter last year of 1.6 per cent being removed from the index. If we get an inflation figure for the June quarter of, say, one per cent-in other words, a long way ahead of today's figure-even that figure will reduce the annual rate of price increases in the Australian community from 4.9 per cent to 4.3 per cent. I remind the Senate that the Budget forecast for the period until June was not for 4.3 per cent inflation but for 7 per cent inflation-a far cry from the record of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> When those opposite left office there was double digit inflation, despite claiming that their priority would be to fight inflation. What they will do, if they ever get into government, is bring in a broad-based consumption tax. That is their so-called panacea for Australia's economic problems. They will tax everything in the Australian economy, except the price of fuel. That is the only exclusion that I have heard from those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> If a 12 1/2 per cent consumption tax is introduced by the Liberal Party-if it ever gets into government-it will boost the inflation rate by 5 percentage points. Instead of having today's rate of 4.9 per cent, we would have a rate verging on double digit figures-to which the Liberal Party is highly accustomed. A 15 per cent consumption tax, which is even more plausible on my calculations, would lift the inflation rate even more. </PARA>
<PARA> Two of the great areas of consumption spending in the Australian economy are food and clothing. Both areas are substantially free from tax at the present time. There is no wholesale tax on 99 per cent of food items; there is no wholesale tax on the great majority-probably 100 per cent-of clothing items in this country. We will find if there is a 15 per cent tax brought in by the Liberal Party-food being tax exempt at the moment-that the price of food will rise by 15 per cent in the Australian community. As a result of that, there will either be a blow-out in the family food budget, as people have to budget for an extra 15 per cent on their supermarket bills, or, more likely, people will substitute cheaper foods for more expensive foods. The reality is that people will go for cheaper foods rather than the traditional foods they purchase. Items such as red meat and fish will be in the firing line. People will substitute items such as baked beans, sausages, soups and minced meat for commodities such as fish and red meat, which are traditional staples in the Australian diet. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that under the Liberal Party, while we would see food and clothing prices going up by around 15 per cent-in other words, the extent of the tax that it would bring in-at the very same time, the price of luxury goods in the Australian community would be reduced. At the present time, diamonds, jewellery, furs and expensive cars are all taxed at a 30 per cent sales tax rate by the Hawke Labor Government. Yachts are taxed at 20 per cent. Under the proposal of the Liberal Party, all of those items will be taxed at the general rate-which will probably be 15 per cent. I do not know how the Liberal Party can justify making the prices of luxuries cheaper but making the price of food and clothing more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me is that most luxury goods sold in the Australian economy are imported. The Opposition will be making luxuries cheaper, thus giving a further boost to imports. That will worsen the balance of payments. I cannot fathom why it is trying to make luxuries cheaper when it is totally counterproductive in terms of economic policy to make food and clothing more expensive and imported luxury goods cheaper. A stimulus to spending on luxuries will be given by the Liberal Party in Australia if it brought in a broad based consumption tax. </PARA>

<PARA>In the brief time that I have available, I want to make a number of points. I think Senator Button's speech had many flaws. It was a great pity that these very serious issues, which are now before the Parliament and the Australian economy, were not treated with more seriousness. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recording-the Hansard will show this-that Senator Button made a very important concession and recognised, to a certain extent at least, that his Government's policies have produced the recession from which we are suffering at the present time. He did not duck and weave on that issue, nor did he support the Treasurer (Mr Keating) or the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with the ducking and weaving. They have tried to avoid admitting that it was the Treasurer's policies which have produced the suffering, and the bankruptcies and the unemployment which are now occurring, in the Australian community. I thought that was a very important concession. </PARA>

The Labor Party is afraid-this goes to the nub of the complaint that Senator Maguire talked about-that the Liberal Party of Australia will be going to the next election with a comprehensive tax policy which will deliver substantial tax cuts to Australian workers throughout the community. They will be tax cuts brought about by a restructuring of the tax system and a cutting in government expenditure. Those opposite are worried and afraid of that, because they cannot make those decisions. They cannot follow the policies which their Treasurer tried to pursue in relation to restructuring of the tax system because of their close association with the trade union movement. That is why they are so sensitive about these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make a brief comment on some of the matters that Senator Spindler raised in this chamber relating to the tax policies of the Australian Democrats. Senator Spindler, Senator Lees and Senator Bell have become very sensitive in the last few days or so because I have taken the trouble to stand up in this Parliament and talk about the tax policies of the Australian Democrats. They have tried to go around the countryside playing politics with this recession, pretending that the Australian Democrats have the solution and that they will be providing assistance to the rural sector. I have pointed out that many of the policies of the Australian Democrats are decidedly anti-rural and that they would particularly hurt people in the country areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I have pointed to the tax policies of the Australian Democrats and I have the documents before me, so there cannot be any argument from Senator Coulter who is in the chamber. The Democrats propose inheritance taxes and tightened capital gains taxes. They propose a capital gains tax which would apply to the family residence, particularly if the residence were valued at more than $500,000, so there would be a very substantial expansion of the capital gains tax. They propose a form of death duties and they propose increased taxes-marginal tax rates on incomes and heavier tax burdens on companies. I do not believe there is any argument about that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. To return to the substance of the debate, I must say that in some ways this debate is a bit of a farce and it has been treated as such by the Labor speakers. I say that for two reasons. First, speaker after speaker has supported the Hawke Government, but those very same people are currently going around and meeting in offices in this Parliament House, planning to effectively dismiss the Hawke Government. So it is an extraordinary feature of this debate that speakers on the Labor side have been defending the Hawke Government when in effect they are the people who will be disposing of that Government within a very short time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second reason that this debate happens to be a farce is that none of the Labor Party speakers believe in their hearts that the economic policies of the Hawke Government have worked. No-one can argue that point, because the policies clearly have not worked and they will not work. Labor Party members are proposing to dump overboard the captain of the ship, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and to replace him with a new captain, the Treasurer, Mr Keating. This new captain of the ship, Mr Keating, is the one who has driven the ship onto the rocks. This is an extraordinary situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason they are doing this is that Labor Party members have made a judgment that the best way they can protect their jobs-and I stress that-is to change the captain of the ship. I make that prediction and I think that by the end of June we will not be speaking in this chamber about the Hawke Government; we will be speaking about the Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If Labor Party members really thought about the jobs of ordinary Australians rather than their own jobs-in other words, if they put the interests of the Australian people above the interests of the Labor Party; and in recent years they have found that very hard to do-we would have seen Senator Button, Senator Maguire and hopefully Senator Aulich, proposing a substantially different series of economic policies. Of course, they will not do that because they are besotted with this man Keating, who has driven the ship of state onto the economic rocks. In a sense, we are probably seeing the great Labor death wish emerging. The man who has produced the failure in this country is Mr Keating. It was admitted by Senator Button today that the Government's policies-and let us face it, they are Mr Keating's policies-helped to produce this terrible recession that we are now suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> During Question Time I was interested to hear Senator Button refer to Shakespeare's famous play, Henry IV. If I can extend the literary analogy, perhaps honourable senators are aware of a book by Voltaire, Candide, in which Candide said, `All is for the best in the best of all possible worlds', even though the world was collapsing around him. In a sense we are seeing this situation with the Treasurer. His colleagues currently on the government bench seem to think that despite the disaster which has affected the Australian economy, despite the fact that we have 884,000 unemployed people and that unemployment levels could rise possibly to over 12 per cent, and despite the fact that we have zero productivity, we still have the best of all possible worlds. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to Labor Party members that there are people out there in the community who do not accept that Labor's policies have produced the results. In the last election, honourable senators on the opposite side undoubtedly went around explaining to the Australian people-in their desperate desire to get re-elected and to retain their seats on the government benches-that this country would have no recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did the Government not level with people then when the economic forecasters were telling us that we were going to suffer a very severe recession? This pattern of deception by the Labor Party has occurred year after year. For example, all through the Budget Speeches of the Treasurer-the man who is going to be the Labor Party's new Prime Minister-he has deceived the Australian people. I invite Senator McMullan to listen to what he said in the September 1987 Budget Speech: `This is the coming of age of Australia. This is the golden age of economic change'. That is what the Treasurer said in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> In the May 1987 Mini-Budget he said, `We have acted decisively to turn the situation around. Tonight I can report Australia is winning'. That is what he said in 1987. In the 1988 Budget Speech he said-remember this one; it was a great phrase-`This is the Budget which brings home the bacon'. Finally, in the 1990 Budget he said, `The reformation of the economy is continuing and at a time of difficulty'. He went on to say that these were definitely the golden years of change. This is the man whom the Labor Party wants to make the next Prime Minister of this country-a man who has indulged in a pattern of deception for years with the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point, to pick up on what Senator Short said, that Australian people were ready to be lead; that provided this Government had been prepared to give them the leadership, the support in the community was there. But because of this Government's accord with the trade unions it could not give that leadership. So we are now plunged into the worst recession since the 1930s; 884,000 people do not have jobs and, in the coming months, a million or more will find themselves in a similar situation. </PARA>

I listened very carefully to all the Opposition speakers to see whether they were coming up with some new approaches which might be relevant to the Australian community and the current situation that Australia is in, but I did not hear them. I will go through some of the areas where I think we might have substantial agreement and then I will look at the areas where, for example, we disagree markedly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I do so I ask Opposition senators what they want the Government to do. If that question had been asked at the beginning of the debate it would have been met with a parroting of the policies that we have already carried out; in other words, where there is substantial agreement in the Parliament. That does not mean to say that I personally agree with those policies. In fact, I have concerns that this country seems to have been run by economic gurus living in Treasury, hiding in the bunkers, telling the rest of Australia what to do-trying to make us grow up so quickly in this big, bright, new, tough world out there and not really understanding that Australia is a very vulnerable society in terms of its economic growth, particularly as a result of the neglected years of the 1950s and 1960s when we could have taken the bull by the horns, when we should have made decisions about the restructuring of the economy, when we could afford to do so and could have done it early enough to make us competitive in the 1980s and 1990s. It all had to be done in a very harsh and determined way when this Government came to power. I ask again: what do Opposition senators want the Government to do?</PARA>
<PARA> First of all, let me go through some of the things that have been done. We have deregulated the financial system. This was something that all parties in this chamber, with the exception of the Australian Democrats, believed in. We floated the Australian dollar so that it would find its own true market level. We allowed the entry of foreign banks and freed up the financial system. I can go through any number of areas where this Government has said, `We are now going to be competitive in world terms as far as our financial system is concerned'. We brought down tariff barriers, agricultural inputs or quotas on cars, textiles, footwear and clothing. This Government, despite an enormous reaction and counter-reaction from a significant number of interest groups in the community, has done more to lower tariff barriers in this country than any government in the last 40 or 50 years. We have also abolished quotas in the car industry. We have said to the car industry, `We will help but, at the end of the day, you will have to stand on your own feet. We are not going to protect you behind tariff and quota walls'. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told by the economic gurus that reducing personal income tax in this country would create incentive for people to work-that it would create not only an incentive for people to work but also an incentive for them to pay the tax that they properly owed; that somehow or other the burden would not be shifted onto those who are on middle or lower income levels. One wonders whether that has really happened or whether, as the statistics that I have seen show, those people who are still relatively well off still do fairly well out of the system, pay no more tax than they were paying before and that the burden still falls on the middle income pay as you earn taxpayer in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We reduced company tax with the same viewpoint. As I understand it, Australia is still one of the most incorporated countries per capita in the world. In other words, we have more proprietary limited companies established in this country per capita than any other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country. So reducing company and personal income tax has not exactly solved Australia's problems. We have cut government spending. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1984 the figure was 37 per cent. This Government reduced that to 31 per cent between 1985 and 1990. That means that we surpassed every country in the OECD, with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom, in reducing the amount of GDP that goes to servicing government. What has been the miracle formula?</PARA>
<PARA> We have cut inflation. The latest inflation figures in this country indicate that in the March quarter inflation was down to minus 0.2 per cent, which gives us an annual figure of 4.9 per cent. For the most part, the OECD average-that is, the average of the majority of our competitors in Europe-is 6.6 per cent. The rate for the United States is 5.3 per cent-well above ours. The rate for the United Kingdom is 8.9 per cent and, for Canada, 6.2 per cent-way above our 4.9 per cent. So we have achieved in that area as well. We have cut the inflation rate to below that of the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada-three of our major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> We have carried out all those prescriptions of the economic gurus. We have carried out the views that are held by the Opposition. The Opposition asked for all of those things to be done. On the whole, it supported us in that policy prescription. Although we have done this, the economy is still not as it should be. The Opposition has said, `Ah! There is one difference then. You have carried out everything else according to the prescriptions of the dry economic rationalists, the conservative economists in this country'--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the consumption tax. However, I am not sure that half of those opposite believe that either. They basically look at a consumption tax as some sort of cargo cult initiative, which will suddenly make everything all right. Some of them know deep in their hearts that a consumption tax would be a disastrous point of take-off for inflation in this country. They know that deep in their hearts, and they do not particularly want to push that as a policy. However, they may be dragged to the barrier on that issue by the right wing ideologues who dominate the policy areas of their Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us get back to the area that separates us, that of labour relations. The Opposition hates the accord between the trade unions and this Government. It has hated it from the day it was first announced prior to our coming to office in 1983. It hated it because it did something with which Opposition members disagree in principle. The accord said to the trade union movement, `You are an important, in fact an essential, part of the operation of the economy. You who represent the workers in this country are entitled to significant and ongoing discussions of economic and social policy with the newly elected Labor government'. The Labor Government was sending a message to the trade union movement that it had a role to play in the running of the economy. It is a principle that Opposition members do not like, partly because in snobbery terms they do not believe that trade unionists have the same rights as the major captains of industry, who have their knighthoods, their clubs and their places in the Liberal Party and who have had those places for years. Those opposite do not believe that trade unionists are entitled to meet with the top politicians in this country, to have their say in the halls of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, those opposite take the ideological view that somehow or other the best trade unions are those that are disorganised, are driven into the ground and do not represent more than a fraction of the country's workers-in fact, organisations that are pushed out of the central position in economic planning. </PARA>

<PARA> In the few minutes that remain in this debate, I will go on a little further about the accord, because it is a major issue, possibly the major issue, which separates the Opposition and this Government. Between 1983 and 1987, as a result of the accord, there was a 70 per cent fall in the level of industrial disputes measured by days lost. That compares with a 40 per cent fall in the same period among member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In other words, Australia made an enormous improvement in its labour relations, because it gave the trade union movement a role to play in the economic life of this society. The cost of labour-and this must interest all businessmen in the community-between 1983 and 1989 dropped 9 to 10 per cent, something that those opposite were never able to achieve. They who say that they represent free enterprise and the right of people to make a reasonable profit were never able to achieve that. This Government achieved it because we did something that was unique in the Western world. We were able to arrange an accord with the trade union movement to help with economic and social policy, an accord which has lasted longer than any other social contract in an OECD country this century. The Swedes, the Germans, the Americans and the English say, `You have achieved something that is extraordinary'-the capacity to involve the union movement in this country's economic life. I have spelled out the benefits-a dramatic fall in industrial disputation, a dramatic fall in the cost of labour to business, and an improvement overall in the type of advice which is coming from the labour movement to governments in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> If Opposition members do not believe that that is an important move in the right direction, they should look at what the Germans are doing. Germany is the country with the most spectacular and consistent growth in its economy in the Western world. Let us look at its figures. Germany has the best growth in Europe-Italy is next-because the Germans work with the trade union movement. They take the brains and talent that are inherent in the trade union movement and say, `Come to us and give us your opinions. You put in on behalf of the organisations that you work for', so that business and labour work together with government. That is the reason why the Germans are winning and we are not. The Germans have taken a view that the country overall must work together. They do not separate people and say, `You have no right to a say in the way in which this country's economy is run'. They do not say, `Let's leave it up to incentivisation', as the Liberals said when they used that terrible word. They do not say, `Let us leave it up to capitalists to make the money, to generate profits and benefits for our society'. That does not work on its own. It requires businessmen, trade unionists, the labour force at shop floor level and governments to work together for Australia to get out of its present problems so that we are able to compete with countries such as Germany. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be brief, as there are only a few moments remaining for this debate. Senator Kemp in his speech confused the issue of an inheritance tax with death duties, and I think it is important that that difference be explained. A death duty, which is not in our policy, is a duty which is levied against the estate of a deceased person and has first priority against that estate before the remaining part of the estate is distributed. An inheritance tax, which is part of our policy, is a tax that is levied in the hands of the receiver of part of that estate in relation to the size of the inheritance and the other assets held by that person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A person may well die and leave a very large estate distributed among a number of people and, if the amount in the hands of the recipient is sufficiently small, no tax whatever is levied. That is the difference between an inheritance tax and a death duty. I repeat that a death duty is not part of our policy. An inheritance tax is part of our policy, and we will defend an inheritance tax as just and equitable, in the same way as income tax levies against those with large incomes. Part of that income may well come by way of inheritance, and it should appropriately be taxed in the same way as income is taxed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In continuation of my earlier remarks, I draw the Senate's attention to the situation which is currently being experienced at the Ravenshoe sawmill and the particular hardship, both financial and emotional, which is being suffered by many people in and around that town in north Queensland. Before the Senate adjourned at 12.45 p.m. today, I was highlighting an absurdity which has arisen as a result of this Government's inaction. That absurdity is, however, also very tragic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a legal impediment to the recovery of preferences under the corporations legislation or under the Companies Code. Basically, if a creditor in a company which has become insolvent is paid in preference to other creditors, a liquidator can recover that money and make it available for all the creditors to share equally. Unfortunately, that payment has to have occurred both when the company was insolvent and within six months of the appointment of the liquidator. Regrettably, for over 12 months now this Government has sat on its hands whilst a receiver has administered the assets of the company. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of that is really quite simple: any chance of recovering preferential payments made before the appointment of the receivers is now lost totally and utterly. In other words, the Commonwealth's negligence, its failure to act, and its failure to understand the importance of the matters in which it was dabbling, may well have cost creditors in this mill thousands and thousands of dollars. The Commonwealth's failure to appoint a liquidator has meant that the claims of the creditors for recovery of that money can never proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, the Commonwealth has compounded its original financial ineptitude by further financial ineptitude. In other words, the Commonwealth not only sunk the money into the mill and did not look where it went-I highlighted it in my speech earlier on today-but also put money into a mill when it may in fact have already been insolvent 10 months before the receiver was appointed. It has been suggested-and I hope the Commonwealth will answer the queries I raised with respect to the dividend paid by the parent company-that in fact the parent company may have paid a dividend at a time not only when the mill may have been insolvent but also when that parent company owed $414,000 to the Ravenshoe mill. It is, in any sense of the word, a tragedy that so many honest hardworking people may have lost money as a result of an action such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier today, I sincerely hope that this dividend was not paid. But there is strong evidence to suggest-and many allegations have been raised, so I feel it is incumbent upon me to raise this matter here in the Senate-that in fact a dividend was paid and that the shareholders of the parent company may have been paid in priority to the Commonwealth and to other creditors of the mill. In other words, the money went out the back door. And again the Commonwealth did not know. </PARA>
<PARA> We can see the enormous financial ineptitude that this Government has put into practice in the administration and management of the loans and grants that it made under the assistance agreement to the mill in Ravenshoe-financial incompetence where it did not know the state of the company; it did not know that the company was experiencing severe difficulties in paying its debts. The Commonwealth did not know that the company had sold off assets to which the Commonwealth had a security which, under the terms of the Commonwealth's own agreement with the mill, were not supposed to be sold without the Commonwealth's permission. In fact, the Government and the Minister did not even know these assets had been sold until after the appointment of the receiver. So much for the monitoring of the mill, so much for this Government's concern for the taxpayers' dollar and so much for this Government's concern for the people of Ravenshoe. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the financial ineptitude that this Government has manifested-a financial ineptitude which this Government has compounded by its lack of action in appointing a liquidator, which has ultimately led to the fact that unsecured creditors face very little prospect indeed of recovering moneys which may have been available to them had the Commonwealth acted properly and with a sense of decency-or just acted simply intelligently. But this Government has not done that. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Ravenshoe is a microcosm of this Australian economy. For eight years now those opposite and their friends in the Australian Council of Trade Unions-the faceless men who pull the strings above the amiable characters on the front bench-have been in command of this country's economy. These people, and nobody else, have caused the hardship, the suffering, the unemployment and the bankruptcy which so besets Australia's economy today. These are the people responsible. It is not the banks, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) would like us to believe. That is a very convenient and a very simply fiction that the Treasurer uses to hide his incompetence, his inability to manage the economy of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Numerous times today we have heard-we heard yesterday, too, from Senator Maguire-numerous dubious statistics about improvements in Australia's economy. When, on the Government's own figures, one in 10 Australians is out of work, that is not an improvement. When this country has interest rates twice those of its competitors in the United Kingdom, that is not an improvement. When this country faces the prospect of youth unemployment nationally being in excess of one in four, that is not an improvement. This Government-and I say it with a sense of tragedy-has destroyed, dashed, the hopes of a generation of young Australians. In some parts of this country over one in three young Australians-people under the age of 21-are out of work. That is not an economic phenomenon, some sort of fillip, some sort of thing that we should do to cut down the level of imports; that is purely and simply the result of the ineptitude of this Government-of Paul Keating and of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Prime Minister Hawke has been at the head of this relentless machine which has ground down the hopes of so many young Australians; which has caused so much hardship; and which has led to exceedingly high levels of business failure, of bankruptcy, of divorce and marriage break-up. Prime Minister Hawke has been at the head of this machine and he must take some of the responsibility too. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been said-and I concur wholeheartedly-if Paul Keating does not have the decency to resign, then the Prime Minister ought to have the decency to sack him. It is unfortunate however that it might just work the other way around. Australian Labor Party members are saying that the Prime Minister ought to have the decency to resign. But on television the other night the Prime Minister said that he will not do it, even if they come knocking on the door. He will say, `No, I am not going to go'. He still thinks he is the best thing since sliced bread for this country. It may well be that the Treasurer, who ought to resign himself, will compel the Prime Minister to resign or be sacked. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, that is half of the solution, half of the problem gone. If we get rid of the Prime Minister we still have the Treasurer to go. For the last eight years both of these men, hand in hand, have inspired the recession which is destroying this country. Both of these men are as guilty as each other. Both of these men have on their hands the blood of a generation of young Australians whose hopes of work and prosperity and the possibility of advancement have gone out the window in this government engineered recession. For these reasons, history will be the judge of those opposite, and it will not judge them kindly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are only a few isolated instances in this place when the behaviour of one honourable senator causes general disgust among his colleagues. One such incident started in the Senate last night and finished this morning. It was committed by Senator Coates. As Senator Watson said earlier today, to impugn the professional integrity of a truly professional person is perhaps the ultimate insult. I am only sorry that Senator Coates is not here. I informed him I would be speaking and objecting to his speech so that he could be present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Knowing Senator Coates as well as I do-I am sure he will correct me if I am wrong-I guess he did not have the decency to inform the Clerks last night when he started his attack on them. In this place it is traditional that if one is going to personally attack the integrity of someone, he is informed of the fact so that he has the opportunity to hear and defend himself. Maybe Senator Coates's excuse for not bothering to inform the Clerks of his attack on them is that he knew they did not have, even if they had been present, the right to defend themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates used all the underhand intimidatory actions he could muster in his speech. One comment that he made-and I think it is a most important one-was that only Opposition senators would be supporting the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk Assistant; that all the support would come from us, not from his side of the chamber. Did he think that, by making those sorts of comments, he could either intimidate the Clerks into treating the Australian Democrats, the Independents and Opposition senators in a less equal way than Government senators, or did he think that those intimidatory comments would mean that the senators on this side of the chamber would not rise on that matter? If so, the tactics he has used are unacceptable and are not worthy of any member of this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am well aware that all the support and defence of the Clerk and Clerk Assistant does not come from one side of the chamber as Senator Coates claimed. Many of his own colleagues have strongly supported the Clerks and have been thoroughly embarrassed by his stand. Senator Coates has not only objected to the Clerks' articles in The House Magazine, the Australian Associated Press report and The Parliamentarian as stated in his motion, but during the Estimates Committee A hearings he also objected to other articles written by the Clerks and their displays and seminars. He also objected to the pro-active advice being given to Opposition senators, although pro-active advice is given more to members of the Government. Indeed, there is nothing that Senator Coates did not complain about. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not forget the history of the Australian Labor Party because it explains the action taken here by Senator Coates. From 1919 to 1980 it was the written policy of the Labor Party to abolish the Senate. It was about 1980 at one of the Labor Party conferences that the decision was made to delete that from the written policy. I will quote Senator Gareth Evans at that time because I do think that it is important that we understand the full history. Senator Evans said of the written policy:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not popular with the people of Australia to have that up front in Labor's policy, so let us get it out of our policy. But we can still work very hard underneath for the ultimate abolition of the Senate. But because it is not a popular thing to have up front in our policy, we should delete it.</PARA>
<PARA>When Senator Evans came into this place he said that the best way to abolish the Senate was `to white-ant it from within'. Is it any wonder that Senator Coates objects to the Clerk and the Clerk Assistant of the Senate, whose main aim is to uphold and improve the functioning of the Senate? He said this morning that:</PARA>
<PARA>The basic problem is that those of whom I speak-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Clerks-</PARA>
<PARA>are so proud of the Senate and all they believe it stands for, they so revere it, that they have allowed themselves continually to overstep the mark . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to make many claims, ending up by saying that he believed they were `insufficiently dispassionate and disinterested'. It is the first time I have ever heard someone being criticised for being too interested in his or her job. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates goes on to talk about democracy, a subject about which he and I have totally different views. I believe that the Senate, in particular, is the ultimate chamber in our democratic process. Ever since his Party has been in government, Senator Coates has been carrying out Senator Evans's directions to white-ant the Senate from within. He was opposed to the setting up of the system of the referral of Bills to Senate committees, and indeed visited our committee in an attempt to thwart its smooth running. He, as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, refused to allow the Opposition to elect a deputy chairman to that Committee until, in the last couple of weeks, he was finally forced to do so. I might add that every other legislative and general purpose committee of the Senate had a Government chairman and an Opposition deputy chairman. Senator Coates attempted to stop the Opposition taking its rightful role on that Senate Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1981, Senator Coates gave the Senate the benefit of his views of this chamber. In September 1982, he refused to address senators according to their correct titles and sought permission for Hansard to refer to senators as he chose to refer to them. I will quote from the Senate Hansard in August 1981. This is just a small selection of Senator Coates's views. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I should say something of my attitude to the Senate, as a dedicated former member of the House of Representatives. If I must accept that this place exists, at least I can object to the Senate's powers and the way its supporters suggest not just that its powers are equal to those of the House of Representatives but that they are more than equal. This assertion of power is manifested in many ways, including subtle ways such as those I have mentioned before-for example, referring to it as the upper House rather than the second House. I suggest just that there is much forelock tugging here which is largely a result of the use of the title `Senator', a name style I find difficult to get used to although I suppose I will have to. The existence of such a continuously used title is one of the subtle ways in which this place wrongly asserts superiority over the House of Representatives where everyone is plain Mr, Mrs, Miss or Dr, or whatever. At least `Senator' is a non-sexist term.</PARA>
<PARA>That was Senator Coates's view of the Senate. Because of his choice to not refer to senators by their correct titles in this place, he sought permission from the President to have his method of address used in the Hansard. The President at that time in December 1982 refused permission and said that the Hansard must correct his usage and address senators in the correct way. Senator Coates was then asked as an interjection by Senator Martyr:</PARA>
<PARA>How do you refer to yourself? Aren't you a senator?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coates's answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>I prefer not to use that title any more than I have to.</PARA>
<PARA>One can see that Senator Coates has no great love of the institution of the Senate and the chamber of which he is a member and in which he serves and represents the people of my State. Is it any wonder that Senator Coates is upset with any officer who upholds this chamber, defends and promotes it and who writes articles to educate the Australian people of its importance in how it protects the people of the various States. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand Senator Coates's frustration, but to take it out on the Clerks in the bitter way he has today and last night is unbelievable. Frankly, I am not sure whether Senator Coates is aware of the danger of the road he is traversing, a road that, if carried to its limit, could make the Senate unworkable for the Government. It must be remembered that, unlike in the House of Representatives, the Government does not have the control by the numbers in the Senate. It is because of this that Senator Coates does not have the luxury of going down that road. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Walters, I have been drawn into this debate because of the remarks of Senator Coates, expressed last evening and again today, in relation to the activities of the Clerk and a Clerk Assistant of the Senate. I am trying to be as impartial and unemotional as I can be in this debate, because I know that if I were to become too emotional on this subject-and I feel very emotional about it-I might unfortunately offend some members of the Australian Labor Party in such a way that they would feel obligated to come into the Parliament and defend their colleague just because he is their colleague. I am trying desperately to remain impartial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I appreciate that Senator Coates has now put his case in support of this notice of motion, because at last we are able to see precisely what he is on about. This notice of motion has been sitting on the Notice Paper of the Senate, causing many of us grave concern and causing us to wonder when we would get an opportunity to hear what Senator Coates had to say in support of the notice of motion and to analyse whether there was any merit in it or not. </PARA>
<PARA> I say sincerely to Senator Coates that he is standing too close to the trees. He is so close to the political party fighting which goes on, not only in the Parliament but also outside Parliament, that he is seeing the activities of the Clerk and a Clerk Assistant of the Senate too closely. He is drawing invalid conclusions about their activities. I had forgotten that Senator Coates was a former member of the House of Representatives until Senator Walters just spoke, and I had forgotten about the matters which Senator Walters referred to. Perhaps that is why Senator Coates is so close to the trees that he is unable to see the forest. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, to suggest that former Senator McGauran or Senator Cooney would in some way be able to achieve some political advantage, either within their own Party or at an election, by being able to quote in some way or other the words of an article written by a Clerk of this Parliament is, I suggest, absolute nonsense. Indeed, what Senator Coates was promoting as being the case would be worse than that. It would be a deficit if Senator Coates's words were valid. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to one of the articles which Senator Coates complained about, which was published in The Parliamentarian. It was about former Senator McGauran. I suggest to Senator Coates that, if he looks at the article, he will see that the problem is the way it has been presented by the editors of the magazine. There are certain headlines and boxes presented in such a way that one might draw a conclusion that it was in some way or another promoting Senator McGauran, but that is not what the article was doing. The article was promoting the institution of the Senate. The way The Parliamentarian wrote it up might have presented to those who read The Parliamentarian a different viewpoint, but that is not the author's fault. The Parliamentarian, in fact, does that with every issue. It promotes honourable senators and honourable members and it has now reached the stage where it is promoting journalists in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I view The Parliamentarian with a somewhat jaundiced view, because I have been member of this place for 15 years and it has not once decided to mention anything that I have either said, done or been involved with. I have some views about that magazine too, but the style of the magazine is not controlled by the author of the article. One has to say that The Parliamentarian, which is issued in this place, is, in any event, what one might call an arcane journal. Who else reads it other than the people in this place? In fact, many of the people in this place do not read it in any event. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at one of the other articles about which Senator Coates has complained, we find that it was published in a journal entitled The Table which is a journal of the Society of the Clerks-at-the-table in Commonwealth parliaments. How arcane a journal would that be? The only people who receive that journal would be Clerks in Commonwealth parliaments around the world. To my mind, to attack an article in that journal indicates the state of mind of Senator Coates in relation to this matter. He has given it far more publicity than it could ever have achieved. Why? I shall come to some parts of that article. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to acknowledge an interest in relation to the article because, when I read it for the first time, I saw that it quoted some things that I had said at a somewhat small gathering of people. I also draw attention to the fact that people such as Senator Cooney, who I mentioned before; former Senator McGauran; and, I am sure, Senator Collins have also been the subject of the pen of the Clerk Assistant, Mr Peter O'Keeffe, who was the author of this article. Indeed, in the article not only am I mentioned but also Senator McMullan is quoted-and it is a very good quote-and former Senator Lionel Murphy is quoted. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether our quoted words are said in praise of us or not. They are, in fact, a use of the words which we have used at some stage or other in order to promote the point being made in the article. I do not see that that is a promotion one way or the other. In any event, let me assure the Senate that the 280-odd journalists who work in this place certainly did not see the article and certainly did not write any words of praise about me, Senator McMullan or former Senator Lionel Murphy as a result of anything that was written in this article or as a result, in my view, of anything written by Senator Coates. I say sincerely to Senator Coates that he is misreading what is happening in this place. I would now like to turn to the words of Senator Coates last night, as recorded in Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the opportunity to explain my case on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the question of the notice of motion. I agree with Senator Coates in that regard and thank him for explaining his case on the matter, because it gives us a chance to analyse that case. He then went on:</PARA>
<PARA>All I ask is for those opposite to listen carefully to what I say, not what they think I might have said. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to him that I have attempted to do that. I have read the Hansard of last night. I shall read today's Hansard. I listened very carefully to what Senator Coates was saying this morning and tried to make some notes about it. Last night he defined what he believed as being political as being much broader than what the Clerk of the Senate believes to be the definition of `political'. Senator Coates referred to something which is political as being political in the wide sense-in other words, not just party political. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>My concern is with the clerkist hierarchy of this place running its own political agenda. Again, I emphasise that I use political in the broad sense. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to him that the use of the words `clerkist hierarchy' are emotional, but I will ignore that. He has said, in other words, that his concern is that the Clerks of this place are running a political agenda in the broadest sense. Then Senator Coates went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a partisanship, not on a party political basis per se, though because of the nature of things it effectively becomes such. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall come again to that, but I deny that it is in any way party political. But obviously Senator Coates thinks it is. Again I say to Senator Coates, `You are so close to the trees that you are unable to see the forest'. Then Senator Coates comes to his real complaint:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a partisanship against anyone who does not automatically accept the suggestion that the Senate is an institution always to be revered in a way defined by the Clerks of whom I speak. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I deny that there is partisanship against anyone at all. I say to Senator Coates that in no way do the Clerks criticise anyone. What they do is promote a point of view. In effect, Senator Coates's real complaint is the Clerks' defence of and loyalty to the institution of the Senate. That is his complaint-that the Clerks of this place are loyal to and defend and promote the institution of the Senate. Glory be, what would we expect of the Clerk of the Senate other than that he or she-one day it may be a woman and I look forward to that day-will promote the institution of the Senate, will be loyal to the institution of the Senate and will defend the institution of the Senate? I would expect all of the Clerks to be that way and I believe that they all will be. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Coates got his way and got rid of those Clerks who at this stage appear to hold those views and got another set of Clerks, within a very short time those Clerks would feel the same way about this institution. What organisation does not expect its chief executive and the staff to be loyal and to defend their institution, whatever it is? Surely the Clerk of the House of Representatives is loyal to and defends the House of Representatives and promotes it? Surely the heads of the Ford, General Motors and Nissan organisations are loyal to, defend and promote the companies that they are the chief executives of. </PARA>
<PARA> With all due respect to Senator Coates, it is an absolute nonsense to be critical of people for being loyal to and defending the institution that they work for. It is something of which I am sure they are proud and rightly proud. But with that basic prejudice-and that is the problem-Senator Coates sees everything through blinkered eyes. </PARA>

But that is not what he is elected for; he is elected for party political purposes to represent the Australian Labor Party in this chamber. No-one is arguing about that. Let me again turn to the words which Senator Coates used in his speech. He referred to the `power of the clerks' as mentioned in the article by Mr O'Keeffe, but those words were not used in a way that Senator Coates tried to imply that they were used. Since when has a Clerk had any power over any senator or, indeed, over any committee? Are we inept? Are we fools?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a nonsense to suggest that a Clerk of this Senate can in any way influence a senator to do something that the senator does not want to do. On the other hand, I acknowledge that the Clerks frequently draw to our attention matters which may be relevant to an issue-and rightly so. I hope that they continue to do so. But to suggest that in some way or other the Clerks wield power over a committee or the chairman of a committee is an attack on senators-including in particular Senator Coates's own colleagues who are the chairmen of the various committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates said something along these lines: `The basic problem is that those of whom I speak are so proud of the Senate'. Dear, oh dear, what a criticism-that the Clerks and Clerks-Assistant are proud of the Senate! But he drew the bow here because he went on to say something about how the Clerks defended and promoted, and then he said that they manipulated, because the Clerk-Assistant, Mr O'Keeffe, in his article referred to the Clerks as being a hinge. A hinge does not manipulate; it simply holds the door. To suggest that, because Mr O'Keeffe said Clerks were a hinge, this was in some way or other the promotion of a view that Clerks manipulate the Senate is utter nonsense. One has only to repeat it to realise that it is an utter nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates also said-it was very difficult for me to get these words-something like, `It is me and my Government which are being attacked right now'. Nowhere in any of these articles, or in anything that I have ever read by any Clerk, is there ever an attack on Senator Coates-either directly or by implication. But Senator Coates thinks there is and draws that bow. That is an absolute nonsense. As for its being an attack on the Labor Party, again that is absolute nonsense. Senator Coates is drawing his own conclusions and then attacking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an attack on any party that locks in its people absolutely. Senator McMullan has also criticised the Australian Labor Party for this, and rightly so. The Labor Party got rid of Senator Georges because he did not vote in accordance with one of its principles. But this is now a party debate. The Clerk's article never gets to that stage in any way, other than to draw attention to the consequences of what has happened, from a parliamentarian point of view, with regard to party manoeuvres in this place. Not only Senator Coates, but apparently also Senator Schacht, have taken some words, given them their own meaning and criticised the author.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coates claims that there was partisanship against governments. That is his interpretation; it is not valid and I deny it. The author has criticised the rigidity of the party system as being contrary to parliamentarianism and so have I. That was the purpose of the speech that I made to which he referred. It seems to me that an argument which appears in an arcane journal, which is addressed to Clerks, about parliamentarianism and the effect that the party system is having on parliamentarianism cannot become, in any way, an attack on any particular senator, any particular party or any particular government. It is nonsense to argue otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to what really bothers me about Senator Coates's speech and, I might say, the attitude of Senator Schacht. One could be forgiven for speculating that the declaration of political partisanship in relation to articles by Senate officers is a portent of things to come. If one ties that in with the Government's proposed banning of political advertisements on television and radio, one can see what we might be confronted with. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about democracy. Democracy is a precious institution. It is not robust and can be easily destroyed, especially by people who believe their cause is the best for their country. They are the people who destroy democracy-the people who absolutely fundamentally believe their cause is the only cause for their country and that no opposition should be listened to. Democracy needs to be protected at all levels. The thinking of a few government senators worries me and perhaps there are members of the House of Representatives-although I do not hear them-who also think along these lines. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a problem of all governments-not only governments of this country. Governments in other countries which claim to be democratic have criticised people who oppose the government's point of view. They believe that a government provides information to the people of the nation, whereas anyone else produces only propaganda. We have only to look at some of the parliaments around the world-indeed, around the Commonwealth-to see where the democratic institutional values have fallen by the wayside because they have not protected the institutions of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, those institutions need to be protected at all levels. If, on the one hand, Senate officers are blatantly party political, then of course criticisms of their activities would be entirely justified. But if, on the other hand, Senate officers are stifled in their zeal to promote their institution, we will be the poorer for it. </PARA>
<PARA> As things stand, Clerks need defending to enable them to fight the good fight in institutional terms. The day that this Senate, as an institution, and individual members of this Senate stop backing the efforts of their Clerks is the day that the institution will die. Finally, I return to something that Senator Coates said last night which caused me grave concern. I address it to all members of the Australian Labor Party in the Senate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the Clerks are not short of supporters on the other side to speak for them and defend them. That raises a significant point: does it not make the Clerk, and the Opposition for that matter, stop and think, when all the support and defence comes from one side of the chamber?</PARA>
<PARA>It makes me stop and think. It causes me great concern that honourable senators from the Government side are not in here at the moment defending the Clerk, defending the institution of the Senate and defending democracy; because that is what I am on about-the defence of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, fortunately, we have a democracy which we have not had to battle for. It has been handed to us by some very intelligent people and we have managed to maintain it so far. But I am concerned that there are no Government senators in here speaking on this subject. I understand their difficulty because the matter has been raised by one of their colleagues, and another of their colleagues from the back bench will no doubt get up in due course and make some comments about it in this debate. But no-one from the Government side is in here defending this institution; no-one from the Government side is defending the Clerk and his assistants; and no-one from the Government side is in here defending democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what we are talking about in this debate-democracy. If Senator Coates had his way this institution would be deprived of its constitutional powers and would not be worthwhile defending. The day that individual members of this Senate stop supporting the Clerks of this Senate in the promotion and defence of the Senate and stop supporting them for being loyal to the institution of the Senate is the day that this institution will die and, indeed, the day that the fears of Mr Peter O'Keeffe, as expressed in this article, will be realised. </PARA>

I recall, on first coming to this place, being absolutely confused by the debate on the Appropriation Bills. Somebody said, `Well, it's really an opportunity to get up and talk about anything that you want to talk about'. I suppose anybody who has been listening to the debate on the Appropriation Bills today would be equally confused because that is what happens in the context of debating these Bills. The purpose of the Bills, of course, is to allocate the moneys that the Government has chosen to direct to various government departments and, therefore, the debate is a very wide-ranging one indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will do three discrete things in the time allotted to me. First, I will briefly address the issue that has captured the day somewhat, that issue being what we think about and how we react to the way in which our professional officers, the Clerk of the Senate and his staff, are rendering service. I do not object to Senator Coates having used his privilege-I think he has done it with principle-of being critical. I think it is his right to do so. I think he has been quite forthright and courageous in what he has done. The Australian Democrats do not agree with what Senator Coates has done; but we do not deny his right to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be brief in my comments on behalf of the Australian Democrats in relation to this issue. I think that the Clerks, and those listening to the debate, need to be very clear about what our attitude is. We have no criticism whatsoever of the manner in which the Clerks of this place render their service. Indeed, we have nothing but gratitude, admiration and support for them. As a minor party holding the balance, we have to be on our feet frequently and address complex legislation with quite limited resources. We are very dependent upon the Clerks. Through their expertise, professionalism, discretion and loyalty, they render to us quite superb service. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course you do. We have no criticism either of the way in which the Clerks are going about that in the chamber or what they have said elsewhere in professional journals. Secondly, I formally move an amendment on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the second reading of Appropriation Bill (No. 5), realising that it will be voted on at the end of the second reading debate. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate calls on the Government to increase economic activity and reduce unemployment by taking urgent action, including:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) initiating a further one per cent drop in interest rates;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) assisting State Governments to eliminate payroll tax; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) providing accelerated depreciation allowances for productive equipment in the manufacturing section''. </PARA>
<PARA>On the appropriations, as I said earlier, the function of these Bills is to provide money, under various headings, so that the Government can go about its business. One of the things the Government does is administer justice in this country and fund that process. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a more fundamental and important process in our community than the process of administering and providing for justice. I do not criticise those who are responsible for its administration. It is an imperfect process, like all of these processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is presently looking at the cost of justice in this country. Under that general heading, it is addressing itself indirectly, not only to the overall collective cost of justice but also to what it costs individuals when they become involved in the judicial process in their attempts to receive justice before courts. The cost to ordinary Australians of attempting to obtain justice is quite extraordinary and exorbitant. In acknowledgment of that, of course, there is a system called legal aid. Unfortunately, access to that aid is not available to all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, under the reference examining the cost of justice, is looking into the fact that ordinary Australians, under certain circumstances, are often grossly disadvantaged in their attempts to obtain justice. </PARA>
<PARA> I must admit that I was not aware of the full implications of this set of circumstances. I am a fortunate Australian in many respects; I have never been before a court of law. I have never had to seek justice from a court of law. I have never had to bear the cost of that process. It has only been in the course of the last three years-in my pursuit of the banking issue-that I have realised just what an incredible and extraordinarily anomalous situation we have in the way in which we fund the process of justice in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I have brought before the chamber the cases of many ordinary Australians in dispute with the banks and argued them vigorously. Of course, we are looking there at an extreme situation. We are looking at a situation where ordinary Australians-in fact, destitute Australians, by virtue of having been bankrupt on many occasions-are in dispute with institutions, which have unlimited resources and access to the best legal minds in the land and which, by their own admission, pursue a tactic of delay and deliberate obstruction. Ordinary Australians, who are often totally without financial resources, once they find themselves in the courts, find they do not have access to legal aid to pursue their cases in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA> On a number of occasions, when I have brought these cases before the chamber and asked questions, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate)-a man whom I respect greatly-has responded predictably and has said that the appropriate place to have these disputes resolved is in the courts. Try to get a bank before the courts and then try to win: one really has a challenge on one's hands-particularly if the bank has been advised, say, by Australia's leading law firm Allen, Allen and Hemsley, that where the bank is in dispute with clients it should, if at all possible, keep those clients out of the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The leading law firm Allen, Allen and Hemsley advised Partnership Pacific Limited (PPL) and Westpac Banking Corporation in the famous Westpac documents. After a month's struggle, I eventually got those documents before the chamber and tabled. Presumably, the documents have been read at least by some honourable senators because they evoked considerable interest by the time I got the documents here. The letters from Allen, Allen and Hemsley to Partnership Pacific Limited refer to how to handle the massive litigation it could expect in relation to offshore foreign loans. </PARA>
<PARA> Allen, Allen and Hemsley says that its clients will be slow to commence action for a certain number of reasons: the breadth of exclusion clauses and the power of attorney which they are confronted with; the lack of knowledge and how damaging the PPL documents are; the lack of success of previous actions; and the high costs involved. In the Westpac letters, Allen, Allen and Hemsley advise Westpac's subsidiary PPL that it need have little fear as to the enormity of the impact of the potential litigation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion 9, Allen, Allen and Hemsley detail the massive disadvantages in which clients will find themselves in relation to the banks. In putting forward a six-point strategy- `How to beat the judicial processes', if you like-it says, as the second most important point, `Avoid litigation at any reasonable cost'. </PARA>
<PARA> How do banks go about avoiding litigation; in other words, complying with the advice that Allen, Allen and Hemsley in this case gave to Partnership Pacific Ltd? They delay and obstruct to an extraordinary degree. I draw the attention of the Senate to the circumstances of the Aliprandi family. I tabled their case in this place two years ago. They are in dispute with Partnership Pacific Limited and, by sheer coincidence, in the court they are up against Allen, Allen and Hemsley. The Aliprandi family have lost their winery, which was the eighth largest winery in Australia. It was conservatively valued by Partnership Pacific when it financed them at $2.6m. The Aliprandis have lost the winery to the bank. In addition to that, they have lost the family pharmacy valued by the bank at $600,000 and their family home valued by the bank at $250,000. </PARA>
<PARA> They are trying to challenge what has happened to them. In fact, they are trying to do what the Minister for Justice said was the most appropriate thing for them to do-to take the banks to court. Remember that they are trying to take Partnership Pacific Ltd to court. Remember that the law firm representing Partnership Pacific Ltd is Allen, Allen and Hemsley. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aliprandis have attempted on 94 occasions to take Partnership Pacific Ltd to court. I have just read to honourable senators the advice from Allen, Allen and Hemsley in the Westpac letters to Partnership Pacific which said to avoid litigation at any reasonable cost. They do not say what a reasonable cost is, but certainly the Aliprandis have been prepared to wear the cost of 94 appearances before court, in their registered names, in their attempts to get Partnership Pacific before the courts. The cost of those attempts alone has been $40,000. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the Aliprandis confronted with in our judicial system today? They are confronted with a situation where they have lost their business worth $2.8m to Partnership Pacific. They have also lost their family pharmacy worth $600,000; their home worth $250,000; and $40,000 worth of legal fees which they borrowed in the form of personal loans and for which they are personal guarantors. They are broke. After 94 attempts, they still have not been able to get Partnership Pacific before the courts. Frankly, they have run out of money. The only thing they have not run out of is will and guts in their attempts to do what the Minister for Justice has said they should do, that is, to resolve their problems before the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not the only one who is concerned about this. The banking industry Ombudsman and Sir Ninian Stephen, the Chairman of the Bank Ombudsman Advisory Council, in appearing before the banking inquiry in the past three or four days, made this very point. Sir Ninian Stephen agreed that the cost of justice was prohibitive for most people and that alternatives had to be found. In giving his evidence to the banking inquiry, he quoted a friend of his, a Chief Justice of a State Supreme Court-remembering that Sir Ninian was a Justice of the High Court of Australia-as saying that he, the Chief Justice, could not afford to litigate in his own court on his salary. What an extraordinary situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht interjects and asks whether he asked for a salary increase. In due course he may ask for a salary increase. I am sure that eventually he will be granted one. That tends to be what happens with Chief Justices. Nonetheless, the point is still well worth noting that here we have a former Justice of the High Court of Australia and now the Chairman of the Banking Ombudsman Advisory Council appearing before a banking inquiry, and he is saying straight out that the cost of justice is prohibitive. He also quotes a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who says that he could not afford to litigate in his own court on his salary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is something wrong with the way in which the cost of justice is addressed in this country. Today I have written to the Minister for Justice drawing his attention to what I am putting before the chamber now, asking that he, like me, seek to appear before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs cost of justice inquiry in order to pursue this point that all Australians must have access to legal aid where they prove the necessity in order to get justice. Without that aid, they will not get justice; they cannot even approach the courts to seek it. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless we are prepared to acknowledge that, we simply will not be able to deliver justice to Australians, and we have an obligation to do so. Ordinary Australians will not be able to counter giants such as Allen, Allen and Hemsley in its advice to giants such as Westpac and its subsidiaries that are prepared to go to any reasonable cost; and for a bank, a reasonable cost could indeed be millions of dollars. They are advised to go to those sorts of costs to avoid litigation, let alone to see what the outcome of that litigation might be. </PARA>
<PARA> I have written to the Minister for Justice asking him to address this issue. I have written to Senator Schacht who is here in the chamber. He probably does not have my letter yet, but I am grateful to Senator Schacht that he registered. He was the only senator to respond to the Westpac letters. When I sent copies to every honourable senator, he was the only senator, besides my own colleagues, to acknowledge that he even received these controversial documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) sent the letters back. He was not even prepared to face the consequences of opening the envelope that contained the Westpac documents. The Treasurer responded to me over the signature of Senator McMullan who is in the chamber and said that it was not appropriate to interfere as a result of the Westpac letters which I advanced to him. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht was straight on to a significant dimension of those letters-and I am grateful that he was-which cited the fact a deliberate contrivance was being enunciated in these letters to obstruct justice. If honourable senators want an example of that obstruction and the level of it and the extent to which these people are prepared to go, look at the Aliprandi case. There have been 94 attempts to get this matter involving Partnership Pacific Ltd into a court. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are other techniques that can be used by banks. Yesterday, I received a fax from a Mr Peter Blake, whose case I have also tabled before the Senate, amongst the 70-odd case studies that I have tabled in this place over the past 2 1/2 years. Mr Stephen Martin said that McLean has either got to put up or shut up. That is what he said two days after I gave him 3,000 pages of documents which he chose to disregard, despite the fact that, by his own admission to me, he had not even looked at them. Mr Blake's case was one that I have put before this place and it was one of the 70-plus cases that I have tabled here in the past 2 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Blake, besides being in conflict with banks himself, is also, by virtue of the powers of attorney that he has acquired from other people who are in conflict with the banks, pursuing quite vigorously the interests of a number of other clients who are in dispute with banks. By way of a fax yesterday, he drew my attention to the fact that a Mr R.= O. Thomas, who is in dispute with Westpac Banking Corporation, was served a writ on 9 May 1991 to be heard by judge and jury and the serving of that writ precludes Mr Thomas from appearing, as scheduled, before the bank inquiry. He was intending to appear before the bank inquiry in order to elaborate, in a situation where his case was not sub judice, his dispute with Westpac. It is not an inconsiderable dispute for $1.25m, and the timing of the issuing of this writ is quite superb. He will now not be able to appear before the bank inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> These are only two of literally hundreds, probably thousands, of cases of ordinary Australians finding themselves in this situation where they simply cannot get access to justice because they cannot get access to money to fund their appearance before the courts and, even if they could, they cannot even get before the courts. Hopefully, Madam Acting Deputy President, I will now have leave of the Senate to table the documents that I have been citing in relation to the Aliprandi circumstances. I previous circulated them to those who I thought were going to be the duty officers in the chamber at this time but, unfortunately, in the case of the Opposition I sent them to Senator Short. I do not know whether he has communicated his reaction. I have the indication from both the Opposition Whip and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) that there will be no objection. So I seek leave of the Senate to table the documents which substantiate what I have been saying in relation to the Aliprandi circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject I want to talk about in the debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation Bill (No. 5) is the allocation of taxpayers' moneys to the Department of Defence in relation to other departments, in particular its natural partner, that is, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, whose main task is to ensure that Australia's relations with countries not only in our region but globally remain positive. It is a very important task that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has and I do not think it gets enough of its share of the taxpayers' cake to carry out the job that it is entitled to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it quite unacceptable that as we debate the additional appropriations this year, the Government, with the support of the Liberal-National Party coalition, could easily find tens of millions of extra dollars to pay for the country's involvement in the Gulf war. But then it has to be nagged by outraged aid agencies and the public into coughing up more than a token sum for the innocent victims of that war, and now, of course, the unfortunate cyclone victims in Bangladesh. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people revelled for weeks in the media hype of war, fascinated by all the high-tech smart weapons which became everyday household words-names like Scud and Patriot missiles. Then, as the press recently observed, the world became over satiated with human misery and we simply switched off as the pictures from the Horn of Africa, Mozambique, Iraq and Bangladesh shifted in rapid succession across our television screens. </PARA>
<PARA> The total cost of Australia's participation in the Gulf war is currently estimated to be just over $96m. We readily found the money for that in an earlier special appropriations Bill in February this year. These costs are being met out of an additional appropriation on top of the existing military budget of $8.33 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the devastating impact on developing countries and the refugee situation after the war, the Government could only come up with a total of $16.2m to help with reconstruction, refugee work, environmental clean-up and so on-many jobs which remain outstanding in the wake of that war. This figure covered $11.2m channelled through the World Bank, plus $5m for emergency and refugee programs. The money was allocated without cutting back other parts of the ongoing Australian aid program, which is one good thing about it. But still the tally stands at $96m to $16m-a gross inequity; a shortfall of $80m which should be matched by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that there are many other areas in Australian life too where there are great calls for redeployment of taxpayers' funding. But I do not think that we should so blithely go off to war and be prepared to spend $96m on that effort without taking equal responsibility for the clean-up afterwards of the devastation in both personal and environmental terms. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the $400m appeal from the United Nations Secretary-General on 10 April, the Government could only respond with $1m, which it said was all it had left in the emergency assistance fund. This is an ironic contrast to the way in which money was found to pay for the war with additional funds voted through very quickly by both Houses of Parliament. The Gulf crisis has demonstrably contributed to increasing global poverty and environmental degradation, and not just in the region of Iraq and Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> For the record, at least 40 low and lower middle income developing countries are facing the equivalent of a natural disaster in the wake of the war. In terms of population, for what we term destitute countries with a population of 440 million people, or close to 10 per cent of all the world's people, the impact of the war exceeds one per cent of their gross national product (GNP) and for many the impact is considerably worse-for Yemen more than 10 per cent and for Jordan more than 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The total direct cost estimated by the United Kingdom Overseas Development Institute for low income countries is at least $US3.2 billion; when lower middle income countries are included, it is at least $US12 billion. Fourteen of these most seriously affected countries are low income African countries, which were already struggling before the crisis broke. They include Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia and Mozambique, where the world food program estimates some 16 million people are facing critical food shortages. Overall, the World Bank estimates that the war cost the Third World $US38.14 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of the Gulf crisis on the Third World bears the hallmark of a natural disaster as defined by the United Nations (UN). The impact of the crisis exceeds one per cent of the GNP of the affected countries; and is externally generated with its origins beyond the control of domestic policy makers. Many of these countries are affected by increased oil prices. This in turn-through increased transport costs-causes higher prices for food and other goods. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is not easy to quantify the effect of fluctuating oil prices on developing countries, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has estimated that, based on an oil price of $US25 a barrel, developing countries face an average price increase of 110 per cent in 1990. Bangladesh, for example, was estimated to need an additional $254.3m for crude oil imports plus another $317.9m for petroleum products. Fuel prices rose by 75 per cent in Sri Lanka, 94 per cent in the Philippines, and in Mozambique a 40 per cent price hike grounded aircraft ferrying emergency food to the Niassa province. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased oil prices also affect the cost of fertilisers and other products with high energy requirements. Foreign exchange earnings dropped through the loss of remittances from nationals working in the Gulf. About one million people fled Kuwait after the invasion, most of whom were migrant workers. Hundreds of thousands evacuated other Gulf countries and Iraq. In Bangladesh remittances make up one-third of foreign exchange earnings. In Sri Lanka, remittances from workers in the Gulf and Iraq alone constitute 47 per cent of foreign exchange. </PARA>
<PARA> These people work as labourers, technicians, domestics and service staff. Bangladeshis repatriated more than $203.4m each year from Kuwait and Iraq. About 150,000 Bangladeshis working in Iraq and Kuwait lost their jobs. In addition, Bangladesh lost about $1.4 billion in wages, savings and belongings left behind by citizens fleeing the war zone. Each expatriate working in the Middle East supports many more family members at home; between 10 and 15 family members are supported by each worker in the Middle East region and in other foreign regions as well. Remittances comprise 47 per cent of Sri Lanka's foreign exchange and, as Iraq purchased 20 per cent of all the country's low-grown tea, the fall in demand caused tea prices to decline and imposed severe hardship on more than half a million workers in Sri Lanka. </PARA>
<PARA> Yemen, which had two million people working in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, lost about $400m. In addition, Yemen was cut off from $600m in oil shipments and other aid from Iraq and Kuwait. Other countries affected by loss of remittances include Pakistan, India, Thailand and the Philippines. Furthermore, the bulk of resettlement costs is being borne by these countries which are already crippled by debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning migrants, many of whom are unskilled, are trying to find work in saturated job markets. In Sri Lanka they are expected to swell unemployment figures by as much as 25 per cent-hardly helpful in that war-torn country. Migrants are returning to towns, cities and villages where basic amenities are already stretched to breaking point. The social and emotional upheaval among their families and communities caused by their homecoming is tremendous. </PARA>
<PARA> Many developing countries have lost important export markets because of the war. The embargo on trade with Iraq and the loss of trade with Kuwait have been especially damaging. Bangladesh may have lost up to $300m worth of exports. Prices of imported goods rose in most developing countries because of increased shipping costs. The massive reduction in international travel affected tourism earnings and drastically reduced foreign exchange generated by tourism. The President of Egypt reckoned that his country lost $US100m in revenue from tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to Egypt, its neighbour the Sudan has suffered terrible consequences because of its Government's stance on the Gulf war. No-one knows how many Sudanese were working in the Gulf, but maybe it was between 400,000 and 500,000. Given the estimate that between 10 and 15 people are dependent on any single migrant's remittance, about five million people out of 24 million people in the Sudan were dependent on the earnings sent home by those migrant workers, because they send home about 80 per cent of their salary and invest the remainder abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a well-founded fear among poor nations that foreign aid to developing countries is being diverted to the Gulf. Multilateral bodies such as the International Monetary Fund have been about as positive to these needs as Australia has-that is, not very positive at all. Only the front-line states received special compensation, such as the United States decision to cancel Egypt's debt of $US7.1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides the damage to the economies of these countries, there was a lamentably slow response to the plight of the Kurdish refugees fleeing from Iraq to Turkey who died in their hundreds and thousands, while the Australian Government had to be prodded into granting more than a token sum in aid, in contrast to the alacrity with which we managed to find a large sum of extra money for the Department of Defence in February. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the overall cost of the Gulf war to the United States, the White House Budget Director, Richard Darman, said in early March that it would be at least $91 billion, comprising combat costs likely to be less than $41 billion and non-combat costs of about $49.4 billion. If foreign commitments of $70.8 billion were honoured, the United States would have to pick up less than $19 billion in costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The final cost to the United States Government would depend on how many of the munitions it used are replaced, how long United States troops stay in the Middle East, and the accuracy of the Pentagon's estimates which assumed higher fuel costs than the market delivered. Indeed, when foreign contributions, spin-off contracts for the reconstruction of Kuwait, a general boost to the economy and stable long term oil prices are taken into account, the United States could emerge from the conflict well in the black. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a graphic contrast between the cost of one missile used in the Gulf-maybe $1m-and the money now being spent on the victims of war. As with Australia, this situation in the United States contrasts unfavourably with the aid provided for the Kurdish refugees fleeing from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein after having been incited to rise against him. Australia's mean response to the plight of the Kurds was echoed with an even worse response to the victims of the cyclone in Bangladesh when the Australian Government could come up with only $250,000, until it was pushed to increase this to $2m, still a pathetic sum. If this Government can find an extra $96m to pay for the war, it can also find an equitable amount for the victims of the war, and the urgently needed environmental clean-up. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most savage irony was contained in a newspaper article last week to the effect that in the Middle East it was as if the war had never happened. Of course, the main casualties are always the most innocent-the women and children of the region. For them not a lot has changed, except in a negative direction in that things have got measurably worse. Everything was back to where it had been before the war, apart for the people whom we have conveniently forgotten, as we prefer to focus on the returning sailors from the Gulf and the trade opportunities in rebuilding Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also remember the many, many families in the region who lost family members, and the women and children and other civilians who suffered enormous trauma with the nightly bombings. For them life will never be quite the same. But on the ground and on a day-to-day level, obviously nothing has improved; in fact, the conditions of such people are quite deplorable. There is still no fresh drinking water available on tap in Baghdad, for example. Therefore, the health problems in that region are manifesting themselves in a truly devastating way. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I repeat the call that I have made before: that the ratio of $96m : $16m for clean-up or repatriation or helping the refugees is totally unacceptable. There is a shortfall of $80m. We should be able to spend dollar for dollar. Whatever we are prepared to spend on the war, we should be prepared to spend on reconstruction after the war. I urge the Australian Government and all governments which were involved in the Gulf war to match their war budget with a peace budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not intend to make a contribution to this debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation Bill (No. 5) but I noticed last night that in the adjournment debate Senator Bronwyn Bishop made remarks along the lines that in the hearings of Senate Estimates Committee A I chose to make a cowardly attack on the officers of the Senate, namely, the Clerk and Assistant Clerks. I refute that completely. The questions I raised about the performance of the Clerks were raised in Estimates Committee A because the Clerk and his Assistant Clerks would have an opportunity to respond and to defend themselves in respect of any questions I or other members of the Estimates Committee chose to put to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Anyone who reads the transcript of Estimates Committee A will realise that the Clerk and his assistants responded quite openly to the range of questions that I put, Senator Coates put, and even Senator Bronwyn Bishop put to the Clerks about the performance of the running of the Department of the Senate. Senator Bishop's remarks last night were, I suspect, made in a lather of frothing at the mouth, as though she is trying to prove that she is some demented Marie Antoinette trying to eat her own cake. If she had read the transcript of the Estimates Committee's hearing in April, she would find that that was a totally unwarranted attack. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates last night made a speech, which he continued this morning, in which he indicated why he had withdrawn his notice of motion on the activities of the Clerks. He chose the Appropriation debate to explain his position, which I think was a further extension of his remarks in Estimates Committee A on 16 April. Since then some Opposition members have turned somersaults on the back bench claiming that this is the end of democracy, the end of the Senate as we know it, and a terrible attack on the integrity of the Clerks or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the questions that Senator Coates and I raised with the Clerks in Estimates Committee A in April were reasonable. I shall deal initially with the question of political partisanship regarding an article that the Clerks had written. If people read the transcript of Estimates Committee A, they will find that neither I nor Senator Coates accused the Clerks of party political partisanship. We absolutely denied it. However, we did raise, and I certainly still raise, the matter of articles being written, no matter the forum, no matter how obtuse or remote, and no matter how small the circulation the magazines in which those articles appear may be. One article in the Parliamentarian written by Clerk Assistant O'Keeffe states:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been a supine acceptance of these standards by all but a small minority of men and women whom the electorate nominates as its political representatives and law-makers. </PARA>
<PARA>The quite reasonable question I asked of the Clerks in the Estimates Committee-not that that comment was party political between Labor, Liberal or Democrat, but it was a partisan comment on the qualities of various senators-was: who are the senators who are accused of being supine? Those senators could then stand up and make their case heard and argue the case. The senators Mr O'Keeffe might not have accused of being supine-he says that they would be the small minority-might also like to know who they are. </PARA>
<PARA> Once a person starts making pejorative comments in such a manner about a group of members of parliament, whether they are senators or members of the House of Representatives, that person has to expect that some members of the Parliament, including those in the Senate, may object to it, may choose to say, `I want to know why I have been called supine or why I could be included with those who are being called supine'. I think that is quite a reasonable question to ask. I want to make it quite clear that I accept the fact that, in the functioning of this Senate, the role of the Clerks, by its very nature, must be in favour of the Opposition and the minority parties. </PARA>

I believe that, in the very nature of the proper functioning of this Parliament with all the advantages the Government has with its advisers, the bureaucracy and the departmental officers and so on, regarding the drafting of Bills and the provision of advice, it is only natural that the Opposition and the minority parties represented in the Senate will have to rely on the advice of the Clerks who have expertise in the drafting of Bills, motions, amendments and so on. It is only natural that the Opposition will make more use of that advice than will members of the Government who have the assistance of the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Treasury and so on.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Kemp wants to call that proactive, that is his right. I have no objection to his doing so in that sort of process. I have to say that if the Clerks came forward and said to the Opposition or any senator, `This is the way you will destroy the Government's Bill'-irrespective of whether that senator has any particular or genuine interest in the matter-that would be going a bit overboard. But I would always err on the side of generosity towards the function of the Clerks and the Department of the Senate in providing advice to the Opposition and to the minority parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue that Senator Coates and I raise is that when things are suggested, such as descriptions in general, without naming the senators involved and making a quality judgment about performance, it is not unreasonable that some senators may choose to get more information about that and make a comment about it in the forum of an Estimates committee or in the Senate itself. I do not think that in any way is a cowardly attack. </PARA>
<PARA> I said in the Senate Estimates Committee in a number of exchanges with the Clerk of the Senate that one thing that did disturb me about some of the articles-again, it is not a matter that one should die in the ditch for; if we have a difference of opinion between the Clerk and some senators, it will not be the end of democracy as we know it-is that a view is put that, irrespective of the senators who come through this place from time to time, there is some sort of permanent view about the way the Senate should operate and the determination of this is the repository of the Clerks. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is described in one of the articles by the Clerk Assistant as the `clerkly parliamentary agenda'-a mouthful, and a description that is rather clumsily worded. It is quite clear that that means that the Clerks have a particular agenda, which is that they have a perception that this Senate should operate in a particular way. As I say, it is not a matter that one should die in the ditch for in the great debate about the way in which this country is run, but I take some objection to the idea that the people who are elected to this chamber can come and go but there is another group of people who say, `We really know how the Senate should operate'. </PARA>
<PARA> In times gone by, that has been called the divine right of kings, the permanent will. In every case, democracy has rejected those notions and said that, whatever the particular arrangement is, the elected representatives will ultimately decide the arrangement. It may well be that at some stage in the future the people of Australia in a democratic way will choose to abolish the Senate. That will not be the end of democracy; that will not be the end of pluralism in Australia. If the people choose to do that, that is democratic. Many countries in the Western world do not have a senate with the powers of this chamber-they have no senate at all-but we cannot go around saying that those countries are any less democratic than Australia is because they do not have a senate with the powers or the structure of ours or a view that there is a permanent aspect about the way the Senate should operate. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a philosophical debate. To me it is not a matter about which one should get overly excited and froth at the mouth as do Senator Bishop, Senator Austin Lewis and Senator Walters. I must say that having some of those people talk about democracy is a bit like Dracula talking about saving blood at the blood bank. They have not shown much interest, from my observation in my time in the Senate, of being great defenders or supporters of human rights issues around the place. They always seem to be talking about other issues. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that does concern me a little-again, it is not a major point but I think it should be placed on the record-about the performance of the Clerks is that, as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitution Affairs, some months ago we had a request from the Clerk Assistant in charge of committees that copies of the minutes of the Standing Committee be automatically provided to him for consideration. I understand that the Clerk Assistant made this request to all Senate committees. I make no bones about the fact that when that was put before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs I opposed it most strenuously. I do not believe that the minutes of a Senate committee are the property of anybody other than the members of the Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not see any necessity for an officer of this Department to have access to those minutes, other than when the members of that Committee choose to make them available if they want to get some advice on a particular matter. That sort of centralism of administration is unwarranted. Of course, on a number of occasions, minutes of Senate standing committees contain sensitive information and information given in camera. In a couple of cases, such as the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, obviously if it is made available to anybody else it may be prejudicial. It may be a threat to activities of that organisation. The same applies in relation to the access of minutes of the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> That sort of approach by the Senate Clerks is unnecessary. I will always protect the privileges of the Senate committees to be in charge of their own business. If we ever move away from that, we run the risk of affecting the independence and standing of the standing committees of the Senate. I would have thought that Opposition members, who are always trumpeting views about the independence of the Senate, would agree with me on that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer to that very unfortunate incident that has had some publicity; certainly in Estimates Committee A I raised the issue of the resignation of Leanne Craze, the Secretary of the National Crime Authority Committee. She made a number of allegations in a letter that has had some circulation. I understand that the Clerk of the Senate, as he outlined in the Estimates Committee, has arranged for an independent inquiry into those allegations. I do not know whether that independent inquiry has been completed. I do not know whether, when it is, the report will be made available to participants on either side of the allegations. I certainly hope that it is. I certainly hope that Leanne Craze, the union that represents her, Mr O'Keeffe and the union that represents him-I suspect it may be the same union-have a chance to look at that report. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the allegations are quite serious. As I understand it, one of them was that the Clerk Assistant wanted the minutes of the National Crime Authority Committee provided to him without clearance from the Chairman of the Committee. I do not know whether that allegation has been substantiated. I hope that the independent inquiry being conducted deals with those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with one final matter about the running of the Department of the Senate. In the additional information provided to us, there was an outline of an industrial democracy program for the Senate Department. Though it is only a small beginning, that is long overdue. The running and the morale of the Department of the Senate could be greatly improved if there were a much more transparent arrangement about the administration in the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of such incidents as the resignation of Leanne Craze, there is a lot of feeling around about the way the Department is run. I do not accept that all those allegations are true; some may be gossip. But certainly there are morale problems amongst the staff of the Senate Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the industrial democracy program, as outlined in the additional information for the Senate Estimates Committee, can be used to improve the morale and efficient operation of the Senate Department, not just for its senior members-that is, the Clerks-but also for the rest of the staff in the system. I recognise-as I think does every other senator-that we, as senators, need assistance not just from the Department's top level but from all its staff. If they are not happy with the way things are being run, we will not get the best assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I certainly urge that the Senate Department give every priority to implementing that industrial democracy program. As it develops it can be expanded so that we have a department in which people participate in the decision-making process in a much more transparent way than I suspect they are at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a debate that has covered such diverse matters as this, it is obviously impossible to develop the usual role in summing up the second reading; I will not attempt to address all the points raised by various honourable senators. Of course, many of those matters will be pursued further during the committee stage, as they should be. Therefore, I will not go to that. I will spend most of my time referring to the two amendments. The substantial matters here before us are the second reading and the two proposed amendments to the second reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make a brief preliminary comment to acknowledge some matters raised by Senator Watson concerning my area of responsibility. Senator Watson raised a number of questions. He indicated an interest in my views about that. They are not matters to which I intend to respond; I simply acknowledge that he raised them. In the main, those matters will be appropriately dealt with during the committee stage. Some of the others we may deal with elsewhere in debates about forthcoming taxation legislation, et cetera. I want to let him know that his remarks did not go unnoticed. </PARA>
<PARA> Principally, I will deal with the amendments before us today. There are two-one moved by the Opposition and one by the Australian Democrats. I will deal with them in that sequence. The Opposition, with this amendment, continues in its determination to be as pessimistic as possible on all occasions. It is a little unfortunate for it that this debate on the amendment should come forward on the day on which the Australian people have received some economic news that must be remarkably welcome to them. Certainly, in regard to inflation, it is the best news we have had for more than three years. It is news that goes beyond the significance of simply one quarter's good inflation figures, welcome as they are; this news has significant ramifications for the evolution of economic policy in Australia, for interest rates, for inflationary expectations and for the long term economic welfare of Australia. There is the potential for Australia to get on that non-inflationary growth path, which we have sought for 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> In responding to this particular amendment one could rehash the two hours of debate conducted during the matter of urgency. I have absolutely no intention of doing that. Senator Button, when responding to that, made extensive reference to the structural changes achieved over the last eight years, the need to assess the economic record of any government over the eight years and the substantial pluses that need to be put on that balance sheet. He also acknowledged the significant problems of the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been structural changes put in place by the Government over the last eight years and outstanding news concerning inflation was received today confirming the expectation of pundits. The mere publication of figures does not change any objective economic circumstances; they reflect the knowledge that Australians have had that the pressure on the cost of living has declined dramatically over the last several months. I do not think it will continue to receive negative consumer price index figures. That is remarkable and unlikely to be repeated, but we will be on a low inflationary path. We may have broken that cycle of inflationary expectation that has been feeding on itself for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> To some extent, both these amendments carry with them a wish that somehow or other we could abolish the business or trade cycle, that we ought to pass a law to say that Australia will no longer be subject to the business and trade cycle that the mixed and private enterprise economies of the world have endured over the last decades and centuries. I want to turn briefly to some fundamentals in the economy, because they relate to both amendments, and address some particular remarks to them. I will express some surprise and perhaps put some counter arguments because I am advised that the Australian Democrats support the Opposition's amendment, given that I would have thought it flew entirely in the face of their economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at what has changed in the fundamentals over the last eight years that will give us the potential to create low inflationary growth for the 1990s. We do have a situation in which Australia's capital stock is substantially enhanced. This leads to increased capacity in the Australian economy that will enable us to come back on the growth path without the cost pressures that often flow with bottlenecks and a shortage of capacity. Notwithstanding that the levels of investment in plant and equipment have fallen from the record highs we enjoyed through the late 1980s, they still remain high. That continues to create enhanced capacity in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the continuing pattern of export growth and growth in export volumes, notwithstanding the significant problems in our primary export industries. Two of those industries that have carried our balance of payments over the years-wheat and wool-are facing a crisis, yet Australia continues to see an improvement in its current account position. To some extent it is reflected by the decline in imports. Because of the decline in demand with the recession, one must acknowledge that. It is also substantially affected by the continuing growth in export volumes. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth fundamental that needs to be addressed in considering amendments such as these is the structural Budget surplus that has been created. On the best and most recent estimates the Budget is still in surplus for this year. More importantly, there is a structural surplus in place such that, when the particular cyclical effects of the moment wash through the economy, that surplus will be substantially restored. The fifth fundamental is the impact of micro-economic reform-that which went before 12 March, that which was outlined on 12 March and that which continues to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to put something briefly on the record about those fundamentals before turning to the fiscal situation, because that is essentially what the amendment refers to. I will express some comments about the fiscal points of the amendment and then address the reasons why I would have thought the Democrats would be less likely to vote for it than I understand they are. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of course true that the Government surplus will be substantially less than that which was budgeted for. That is due overwhelmingly to the recession; neither of those points is arguable. We do have lower wages and employment, which have sliced about $2.8 billion from revenue, and higher unemployment, which has added about $400m to expenditure. Other factors have affected the surplus. One to which I will refer would be welcome. Others were inevitable and agreed, at least by government and Opposition. Some are certainly not caused by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The factor which was overwhelmingly welcomed by the Australian people and which has changed the level of the Budget surplus is the tax cuts. They have reduced receipts by $400m, have brought lower wages and have made a substantial contribution to the welcomed lower inflation outcome which we gained today. Other measures which have been supported in some instances by all parties and in others by at least the Government and the Opposition and which have had a significant impact on the surplus are the Gulf war and assistance to the wool industry. There are minor ones, but I use those as examples. We have had other instances where the Government's surplus has been significantly adversely affected by decisions of the Senate. I refer particularly to the rejection of the sale of the Pipeline Authority, which has reduced the surplus by $700m, and the disallowance of the assets test for family allowances. As I am advised, the best estimate of the Budget outcome for 1990-91 remains a surplus of around $1.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Opposition's amendment expresses concern about the call on national savings which may be made by the public sector as a result of the loss of the Federal Government surplus, compensating for the demands of the State and local government sectors. Although it is always true that it is better to discharge public sector obligations at the lowest possible cost and with no borrowings if possible, it is hard to see that the economy is suffering from a significant crowding-out of private sector investment intentions by the public sector calls on the capital markets at the moment. As I have said, as the economy recovers, the surplus is expected to be restored. A lot can be said about that; most of it has been said in the matter of public importance. I simply want to put a few of those comments on the record in response to this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental political economic point is that any motion which proposes that during this recession we should retain the level of surplus at $8 billion and express great concern that the surplus has declined is a recipe for economic disaster. Policies to retain the surplus at $8 billion during the recession is a recipe for more recession and a recipe for a deeper and longer recession. If we were to proceed in that manner, it would significantly exacerbate the already serious problems that we have. It would be both irresponsible and dangerous and it would ignore the counter cyclical impact of what is called the automatic stabilisers. In economic terms it is a nonsensical proposal and in social and political terms it is a dangerous and unsatisfactory one. Therefore, the Government will not be supporting it and I urge the Senate to reject it. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to say something about the Democrats' amendment. They called on the Government to increase economic activities and reduce unemployment by taking urgent action. There is nobody who would not like to see increased economic activity and reduced unemployment. The Democrats make three specific points, some of which may have some attraction but none of which would lead to quick changes in the unemployment situation. Some of the proposals are desirable. They may have beneficial long term consequences and they may achieve social outcomes that Australians would welcome. That is not to argue necessarily against them. Some of them may well follow from the inflation news we have had today. But we ought not pretend that any of them will lead to quick changes in the employment situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The first proposal is a further one per cent drop in interest rates. Nobody on the Government side is going to come in here and speculate about what changes may be made to interest rates. All I can say is that significantly falling inflation does create an opportunity or the room for interest rates to fall but it does mean that the cost of capital to Australians can be substantially reduced. That point has been made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It is important that we maintain that pressure on inflation so that that option remains open. But appropriately it is not a matter about which the Senate should speculate and I certainly do not intend to do so beyond that. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of assisting the State governments to eliminate payroll tax is slightly more complicated. It is easy to argue that payroll tax is a tax on employment and, if we could in some manner raise that revenue otherwise, that would be more desirable. But, as Federal members of Parliament we have to acknowledge one thing: the States value this as one of their few independent sources of revenue. If we are going to assist State governments to eliminate payroll tax by proposing to give them tied or untied grants from the Federal Government, that certainly will not be welcomed by the States. It would not be acceptable to the States; they would not be likely to agree to it. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want to assist them to eliminate payroll tax, we have to talk about proposing to give the States a substantial alternative taxation source, which will generate revenues at least equal to the payroll tax and perhaps substantially more. There are no magic wands in public finance. We are talking about taxes on income or taxes on goods and services. One of those would need to go to the States to compensate them for loss of the payroll tax, and this motion does not indicate which it is. At this stage, I do not think that the consequences of part (b) have been considered, and the Senate ought not support it. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of accelerated depreciation allowances for one particular sort of equipment in one particular sector of the economy has significant superficial appeal, but three things need to be said about it: firstly, substantial progress has been made in the area of depreciation as a result of the 12 March statement; secondly, accelerated depreciation allowances will not necessarily increase employment, because it may well be that we are encouraging people to invest in labour saving, labour replacing equipment; and, thirdly, it may not generate growth, depending upon whether the distortions that such a narrowly targeted tax measure would generate would be more significant than the pluses. It may not be beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA> We still have a significant rate of investment in plant and equipment, as I said earlier. In fact, it is near a record level. It is not immediately clear that accelerated depreciation allowances, particularly when targeted in only a narrow area and for only specified sorts of equipment, will necessarily achieve that purpose. It is certainly going to cut across the objective of simplifying the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, the Government is opposing both amendments. In light of the Democrats' stated economic policy, I am surprised that they will be supporting the proposed Opposition amendment. I hope that they will not do so. The Government will be opposing both of them, but obviously I welcome the support that everybody has given to the passage of the Bills themselves. It is a somewhat more fundamental question, which I appreciate. I commend the Bills to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two reservations attached to reports of Estimates committees which, I believe, are not in accordance with the procedures laid down in the order of the Senate of 5 December 1989, relating to the consideration of appropriation Bills and reports of Estimates committees. Senator Crichton-Browne's reservation in the report of Estimates Committee A recommends for further consideration of all matters relating to two of the parliamentary departments, while his reservation in the report of Estimates Committee C recommends further consideration all programs relating to the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I indicated to the Senate in November last year, I consider that such reservations are contrary to the procedures because they do not relate to specific matters and are designed to circumvent the intention of the procedures to limit debate to specific matters recommended for further consideration.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Successive Australian governments have opposed French nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Particularly disappointing is the fact that France continues this testing in spite of the well-known opposition of South Pacific states. As a matter of principle, Australia will continue to protest against each test that takes place in French Polynesia and to make its opposition known at the highest levels. The Government will, in addition, use other opportunities, at the United Nations and other international meetings, to draw attention to the opposition in our region to such tests. France maintains that the nuclear tests it carries out are ``absolutely safe'' and that this removes one legitimate basis for regional complaints. Scientific evidence suggests, however, that while there may be no immediate dangers of contamination as a result of the tests, the longer term risks are real. Australia welcomes the fact that France has recently adopted a more transparent attitude to its nuclear testing practices.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The South Pacific Forum opposes French nuclear testing in French Polynesia, hence its position on the subject coincides with that of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. Australian uranium is supplied to France under bilateral safeguards agreements with France and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). These include safeguards and peaceful non-explosive end use conditions which are fully consistent with Article IV of the Treaty of Rarotonga governing provision by any Party of nuclear material for peaceful purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The possibility of using uranium for the production of nuclear weapons has been clear to the international community for more than forty years. It has been the impetus for the establishment by the international community of an effective non-proliferation and safeguards regime, based on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. In support of international non-proliferation goals, the Government has put in place a stringent safeguards regime for Australian uranium exports to ensure that no Australian uranium is used for military or explosive purposes. These arrangements, which include a bilateral safeguards agreement with Australia and the application of IAEA safeguards, apply to both nuclear weapon states and non nuclear weapon states. Under Australia's bilateral safeguards agreements with France and Euratom, all Australian obligated uranium supplied to France is fully accounted for within the peaceful nuclear fuel cycle. The answer to the second part of the question is no.</PARA>

<PARA> * strongly supports an increase in the provision and quality of language teaching provision, whether taught as mother tongue or a second language, and promises continued support for the Ethnic Schools Program (which was established as primarily a language maintenance program).</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In dealing with the need for greater English literacy provision for Aboriginal people and the need to record and maintain Aboriginal languages, the Green Paper envisages a process for developing detailed strategies in consultation with Aboriginal groups and (on educational issues) with education systems after release of the White Paper. It is expected that these consultations will identify a number of strategies for Commonwealth support to achieve these ends, including, at least in some States, bilingual education programs.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Under the New Arrivals element of the (Schools) English as Second Language Program, the Commonwealth currently pays $2,446 towards intensive school based ESL tuition for any child of a non-English speaking background who enrols in such a course within six months of arrival in Australia (or, where a child is com- mencing in Year 1, within 18 months of arrival). In 1990, 21,908 children were supported under this program at a total cost of $51.003m.</PARA>
<PARA> Children who are ineligible for this funding or who continue to need ESL provision after completing an intensive ESL program may be assisted by Commonwealth funding made available under the General Support Element of the English as a Second Language Program which had an allocation of $46.120m in 1990. It is not anticipated that this level of funding will diminish while our immigration intake continues to have high numbers of children who do not have English as their mother tongue.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Feasibility work undertaken for the Training Expenditure Survey (TES) indicated that collecting data on total training expenditure by type of expenditure and training hours by type of training was likely to be feasible but that collection of expenditure data by gender would provide a number of problems for employers. Consequently, it was decided to pilot the TES in 1989 excluding gender.</PARA>
<PARA> The experience from the TES was that the time spent by employers in providing the information required by the survey was already high when compared to other ABS surveys. Burden on the respondent can seriously affect not only the respondent rate but also the accuracy of the information provided. Employers, generally, do not collect data on expenditure by gender.</PARA>
