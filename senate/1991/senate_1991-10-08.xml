<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to the ongoing tragedy of the civil war in Yugoslavia and the consequent destruction and dislocation in that country. Can the Minister advise the Senate what assistance the Australian Government is making available to the victims of the conflict? What is the Government's current assessment of the situation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1493" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As all honourable senators will be aware, there is a deeply unhappy situation currently prevailing in Yugoslavia. There have been some indications, just in the past few hours, that the Yugoslav Army will observe the cease-fire agreed on 4 October, conditionally at least, for the next 24 hours. But one has to acknowledge that, on the basis of the history of the dozen or so previous cease-fire agreements, there is no great cause for optimism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On behalf of the Australian Government, I want to condemn in the strongest possible terms the air attack on Zagreb which was directed at the official residence of President Tudjman in the past 24 hours. It was only through very good fortune that President Tudjman, Federal President Mesic and also Prime Minister Markovic, I think, with whom he was talking at the time, were spared.</PARA>
<PARA>  In response to the blockade of army installations by Croatian forces, the Yugoslav National Army has been attacking civilian targets throughout Croatia. That is quite contrary to the precepts of international humanitarian law. Moreover, it is the case that Serbian representatives are attempting to take full control of Federal institutions, such as the presidency and the Parliament, in a manner which does seem to be unconstitutional.</PARA>
<PARA>  Having said all that about the Serbian side, I also have to make the point that all sides must bear some responsibility for the continuation of the fighting that has occurred. Certainly there have been a number of occasions when the Croatian side has engaged in very provocative actions against the Yugoslav Army and simply not contributed to the maintenance of an agreed cease-fire. All sides have to understand that they cannot impose a military solution to resolve the kind of ethnic conflict that exists in that country, that conquest is simply no substitute for negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Government continues to support the efforts of the European Community to bring about not only a cease-fire but also sensible negotiations to produce a lasting solution. We have also very strongly supported the bringing of this matter into the United Nations to get the full weight of that body behind the peacemaking efforts. We can only hope that something positive will flow from that.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the past 24 hours, the European Community has threatened to implement certain trade sanctions against Yugoslavia should the parties not prove to respect the most recent cease-fire negotiated by Lord Carrington. I indicate that Australia would certainly wish to support international moves to impose sanctions in these kinds of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>  Having said all that, I can only end with a plea to the leaders on all sides in Yugoslavia to demonstrate a degree of courage and resolve and to find a better way for their people than to plunge them into a civil war that will have catastrophic consequences for them and from which no-one will benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>  The other part of Senator Loosley's question went to what assistance the Australian Government might be able to offer in terms of humanitarian assistance or aid. As the Senate will be aware, the Government announced in early September the provision of $100,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross for relief assistance to victims of the Yugoslav crisis. Currently, the ICRC has an on-ground presence in Croatia and Slovenia, as well as in Belgrade, and therefore, in our judgment, continues to be well placed to reach those most in need. However, some further assistance is, in our judgment, required, and I am pleased to announce today that Australia will provide a further $100,000 for emergency relief. This amount will be available to support suitable emergency aid proposals from Australian non-government and community organisations which wish to assist in providing assistance of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA>  To qualify for assistance, such organisations have to be voluntary, not for profit and identifiably Australian. Decisions on the allocation of the funds by AIDAB will be made on the basis of the capacity of each organisation to deliver needed assistance effectively to those suffering as a result of the conflict. An example might be funds to assist in the transport of needed medical supplies collected by a local community organisation here in Australia. We are aware that various community organisations have indicated a willingness to play a part in the provision of relief assistance. We hope that this latest contribution by the Government will contribute effectively to their efforts.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade a question on Yugoslavia arising out of an earlier answer given by him. In particular, there is some ambiguity in relation to a statement that Australia would support trade sanctions. I ask the Minister whether Australia has urged or will urge the UN Security Council to address now the prospect of trade sanctions and, in particular, an oil embargo against Yugoslavia to add to the pressure that the European Community is seeking to impose in that regard, particularly bearing in mind the effectiveness, sadly, of the arms embargo imposed by the Security Council.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The only proposal on the table at the moment is one from the European Community. It may well be that that will be followed very rapidly in order to secure its international effectiveness should that be implemented by an appeal through the UN for a full internationalisation of any embargo or sanctions economically that the Europeans might impose. I simply indicate that, should that happen, Australia will be happy to go along with that. We will give consideration to taking some initiative in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Until now we have taken the view, which I know has been shared by the Europeans, that economic sanctions are highly unlikely by themselves to have much more than a marginal impact in an environment where tensions are running as high as they are. Nonetheless, there is an argument, particularly so far as oil is concerned, that that is so obviously needed to fuel the engines of war that perhaps a selective and effective embargo just focusing on various strategic materials of that kind might in fact have some degree of effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA>  I do not want to make any commitment about any Australian initiative in this respect; I am simply indicating support for a pattern of response that is evolving in Europe. We will certainly give further consideration to the best way in which we can help.</PARA>

We did take an initiative to bring the whole question before the Security Council. We were the first country to formally raise the issue with the Secretary-General or anyone else in the UN system. We are very conscious of the utility and the role that the UN is capable of playing here. I simply want to give the matter of the potential utility of this kind of exercise some further thought before committing Australia to taking any initiative in this respect. I am not ruling it out; I am just saying that we want to take further advice on what is happening at the moment, what is likely to happen elsewhere, and what we can usefully add to the process.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Would the Minister comment on the Australian Government's response to proposals for sweeping cuts in nuclear arms made recently by the governments of both the United States and the Soviet Union?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1495" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Australia very warmly welcomes both the initial announcement by President Bush, on 27 September, of major unilateral nuclear disarmament measures so far as the US is concerned, and the highly positive response of President Gorbachev in the past few days. The Prime Minister wrote to President Bush congratulating him on the original initiative and he will now be writing to President Gorbachev expressing Australia's appreciation for that swift and constructive response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Rather than burden the Senate with the detail, at the end of this answer I will seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a list of the respective measures that the United States and President Gorbachev have now put on the table. I say, by way of commentary on those measures, that there are very significant convergences between the Bush proposal and the Gorbachev response. It seems that, effectively, President Gorbachev has met all the major unilateral proposals or commitments that the United States made and has indicated a willingness to enter into negotiations on the other matters that President Bush suggested would be appropriate for agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>  There are some matters on which the Soviet Union in turn seems to have gone a little further. One clear such area is in the Soviet's announcement of an immediate unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing. This kind of response to stopping nuclear testing has been a longstanding Australian disarmament objective. We are yet again negotiating a resolution to this effect with the UN this year. We accordingly call upon the United States and all other nuclear testing states to join the Soviet Union--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Including France. We call upon those countries to join the Soviet Union in this moratorium. It is very important that all the nuclear states now commit themselves to the urgent negotiation of a comprehensive test ban treaty which would ban all testing, by all states, in all environments, for all time. The one-year moratorium is certainly a good start and we hope that it will be repeated elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There are a number of other things that are currently the subject of analysis, so far as the effect of these respective proposals is concerned. By way of conclusion, I just say that our own assessment as a government, on the material available to us, is that if President Bush's unilateral commitments are fully matched by the Soviet Union and if the matters which have been identified by President Bush as appropriate for negotiation are the subject of agreed negotiated results, we will see the removal from the field of about 20,000 nuclear warheads. On any view that will be a major achievement, indeed, and a huge step forward towards getting some nuclear sanity into this world.</PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time, as a note of caution I make the further point that that will still leave nearly 30,000 nuclear warheads in existence, including a great many strategic warheads which are matters of huge continuing concern. It is a little early even to say that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the era of nuclear weapons. Notwithstanding that note of caution, this is obviously far and away the biggest step towards nuclear disarmament and arms control that has been taken since the beginning of the nuclear age. It is a step by both sides that Australia unequivocally welcomes and endorses.</PARA>
<PARA>  Mr President, I seek leave to have the document incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA>  Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA>  The document read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>On 27 September President Bush announced that the United States would unilaterally:</PARA>
<PARA>  eliminate all nuclear artillery and all short range ballistic missiles and associated warheads</PARA>
<PARA>  withdraw all tactical nuclear weapons from</PARA>
<PARA>    surface ships</PARA>
<PARA>    attack submarines</PARA>
<PARA>    naval aircraft</PARA>
<PARA>  stand down from alert</PARA>
<PARA>    all strategic bombers</PARA>
<PARA>    all ICBMs scheduled for destruction under START</PARA>
<PARA>  accelerate the START schedule once ratification takes place</PARA>
<PARA>  terminate mobile Peacemaker ICBM and the mobile portions of the single warhead ICBM programmes</PARA>
<PARA>  and cancel the replacement programme for tactical missiles for strategic bombers.</PARA>
<PARA>  President Bush also proposed that the Soviet Union agree to bilateral negotiations which would be aimed at</PARA>
<PARA>  eliminating all multiple warhead ICBMs</PARA>
<PARA>  permitting the limited deployment of non-nuclear defence against limited ballistic strikes (including co-operation in ballistic missile early warning)</PARA>
<PARA>  enhancing co-operation on the handling, control security and safety and destruction of nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA>  Like other governments we are still studying the detail of the President Gorbachev's response. The main elements of that response seem to indicate that President Gorbachev is prepared to:</PARA>
<PARA>  destroy all land-based tactical nuclear weapons and remove all such weapons from surface ships and submarines</PARA>
<PARA>  return all mobile strategic missiles to garrison</PARA>
<PARA>  stand down all Soviet heavy bombers from alert and store their nuclear weapons</PARA>
<PARA>  cut strategic offensive weapons by 50% more than the START Treaty envisages</PARA>
<PARA>  begin immediately a one year moratorium on nuclear weapons testing</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Is the Minister aware of a report in today's Australian newspaper that Memtec Ltd has been forced to take its state-of-the-art waste treatment technology offshore to the United States, France and, possibly, Japan because of our lack of high water quality standards and the uninterest of State governments and because water authorities have kept local demand too low? Does the Minister acknowledge that Memtec's move calls into question, firstly, the new federalism which would institutionalise the process of setting mediocre pollution standards; secondly, the multi-function polis, the promise of which has been unable to convince Memtec to stay in Australia; and, thirdly, the development of Australia as a clever country in which the Government hoped Memtec would play a prominent role? Finally, will the Minister push for the Federal Government to take the lead and set high national pollution standards to benefit the Australian environment and ensure that leading edge technologies can be developed here on the strength of domestic demand?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1497" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have not seen the press reports of what Memtec said about this issue, but I have been familiar with its position for some time; it is nothing new to me. To begin with, might I say that the Federal Government, in one way or another, has been very supportive of Memtec's research and development program. The amount of research and development money which has gone to Memtec runs into several millions of dollars. It is through that sort of assistance that Memtec was able to develop the technology which offers the prospect of very high quality waste water treatment for city and country areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the light of the Sydney sewerage problem, Memtec has received some publicity because its technology offers an alternative to offshore disposal of inadequately treated sewage. I just make the point that Memtec has a subsidiary company in Japan and one in the United Kingdom. There is great advantage in a company such as Memtec, with the sophisticated technology it has, operating close to the market.</PARA>
<PARA>  As I recall it, Memtec has a business association with a number of water authorities in the United Kingdom. It is probably also fairly successful in respect of its business operations in Japan. It is a substantial company with a lot of interest in its technology coming from various sources.</PARA>
<PARA>  With regard to whether this announcement by Memtec calls into question the so-called new federalism policy, the answer is no. Memtec was considering some of these issues well before the new federalism policy was formally on the agenda of the Premiers Conference, and I do not think that any judgment by Memtec has been made on that basis. What Senator Coulter has done--which is not unusual--is to read a subjective view into that announcement from Memtec which he believes might suit his political purpose, having in the last week or so identified a possible new role for his Party as distinct from the traditional role which the Australian Democrats have had.</PARA>
<PARA>  The second point relating to standards which arises from the new federalism point, if I might call it that, is that a number of factors affect the adoption of new technology such as Memtec's in Australia: for example, the extent to which water authorities are required to generate economic returns on their operations; certainly slowness on the part of water authorities in adopting new technology; the difficulties associated with the demonstration phase of new technology from a pilot plant to a full commercial plant, and so on. Memtec has been engaged for some time with a pilot plant at Blackwater and is now in negotiation with the Sydney Water Board on the installation of a commercial scale plant at Cronulla but there have been a lot of delays in negotiating these matters with the Sydney Water Board. My Department has been pursuing the issue with them to see how the tenders can best be handled to support home-grown technology.</PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, it will be a matter of some regret and concern if Memtec does, in fact, carry out the intention which was announced in the press report to which Senator Coulter referred. However, I am sure that Memtec will remain substantially an Australian company. It has been very much supported by the Government in its endeavours and will continue to be so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Senator Button typically obfuscates and deflects the central point of the question. Let me make it clear to him and ask: is it not a fact that Australia has one of the most expensive water supplies in the industrialised world? Is it not a fact that we have one of the poorest standards in relation to water quality? Consequently, in view of the fact that Memtec finds it economic to invest overseas to improve the quality of water there, where the price of water is much lower than here, would it not be fairly obvious that the application of adequate water quality standards in this country would solidly encourage Memtec to stay here?</PARA></TALK.START>

In light of the recent changes announced by the United States and the Soviet Union with regard to deployment of nuclear forces I ask the Minister whether or not there will be any fundamental reassessment of the role of the so-called joint facilities in Australia. I further ask whether there will be any evaluation of the whole rationale for the ANZUS alliance, given that it was signed at the height of the Cold War and as part of the containment of the Soviet Union? Finally, I ask whether the Minister agrees with the assessment that there is now some serious doubt over the relevance of the Anzac frigates as well as the Collins class submarines, and that these programs should be replaced by others geared to combating low level threats to Australia rather than primarily operating with the US Navy anti-submarine forces in the Pacific?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is clear, however, that the joint facilities at Nurrungar and Pine Gap will continue to make important contributions to peace and stability through their missile early warning and intelligence functions, including arms control and verification. It is my view that the importance of these contributions, if anything, will increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On the question of the ANZUS alliance, I simply observe that it has proved its durability and relevance over a period of 40 years of changing strategic circumstances. I am confident that it will prove just as durable into the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, I believe it would be misguided to suggest that the characteristics that we are incorporating in the Anzac frigates and the Collins class submarines were determined by a need, primarily, to operate as US anti-submarine forces in the Pacific--or anywhere else for that matter. As has been made clear on many occasions, the basic requirements of our force structure are determined by priority needs of the self-reliant defence of Australia. To suggest otherwise, one would be guilty of fundamentally misreading the Government's defence policy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The difference is between chalk and cheese. We have a balanced and an orderly system of transmitting the centralised wage fixing system to a more decentralised focus, being supervised by the Industrial Relations Commission, and recognising in that process the legitimate role of trade unions. The Opposition has a policy which is best described as the law of the jungle. The Opposition's policy will mean a wages system which is largely unregulated and pays no recognition at all to the interests and rights of the parties. It is a thinly veiled attempt to denigrate trade unions and is a turning away from the cooperative approach of industrial relations that this Government has developed back to the Fraser era of conflict in industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It resembles the New Zealand textbook proposal in which textbook theories are being played out in New Zealand workplaces to the cost of employers and employees and, ultimately, at high cost to the New Zealand economy. It seems that that type of model is being sought to be transported to Australia.   Our model involves the Industrial Relations Commission playing a central role in hopefully handing down guidelines that enable the transition to take place, and monitoring those guidelines to see that the outcomes are fair to all parties. It recognises a need to preserve a standard core of conditions relating to hours of work, annual leave, sick leave, long service leave and superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA>  On the other hand, the Opposition policy talks about voluntary private contracts as if the negotiations between a single employee on the one hand and a large company on the other can in any sense be equal, and as if an employer saying to an employee in such a circumstance, `If you do not agree with what I am putting to you, you are dismissed', can somehow be the basis of a fair contract and cannot be seen as a contract which, in the classic sense, would be harsh and tyrannical.</PARA>
<PARA>  In an interview reported in the Bulletin, Mr Howard was asked a question similar to that, and he said words to the effect that that would be a problem, that is, a blip in the policy. It seems that the Opposition has no answer to the question of how fairness is to be introduced in a free for all, law of the jungle system. If the New Zealand model is anything to go by, and if the Opposition ever got the chance to introduce such a system, it would wreak on Australia the havoc that has been wreaked on New Zealand. It would be a system that would serve this country very badly indeed.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1500" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It has been the case that the shadow Minister, Mr Downer, in a series of press releases in recent months, has been claiming that the Government's sanctions policy is losing Australia valuable trade opportunities, including the opportunity to sell mutton, lamb and wheat to South Africa. He was at it again yesterday in a further press release saying that we had lost something like $55m per annum worth of wheat sales to South Africa since sanctions were introduced in 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I have to say that, in respect of the export of agricultural produce to South Africa, Mr Downer, as he ought to be by now well aware, is profoundly and comprehensively mistaken. There is no restriction, and there never has been any restriction, imposed by the Australian Government, pursuant to sanctions policy, on the export of any farm products to South Africa. There has been a prohibition on the import of agricultural products. There has been a prohibition on the export of products to governments--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I will come to that in a moment. There has been a prohibition on government procurement activity--things of that kind--but there has been no prohibition on the export of agricultural products. In fact, after being approached by South Africa late last year, the Australian Wheat Board sought and obtained from the Australian Government in December last year confirmation that it could tender for the supply of wheat. The AWB was successful, in fact, in two tenders on 29 January and 5 February this year for up to 99,000 tonnes worth some $24m in total. In fact, South Africa is usually a minor exporter of wheat, so it does not in itself offer a significant future market opportunity. It will commence its harvest around October and is not expected to import any more wheat before then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The South African market for meat certainly exists, as Mr Downer claims, but it has been virtually blocked by the high import tariffs which were imposed by South Africa on 1 November last year on both frozen beef and mutton.</PARA>
<PARA>  As to the broader question of Australian and Commonwealth trade sanctions, we have made our position quite clear--I have made it clear again to Mr Botha during his current visit here--that these sanctions, in our view, must remain in place until the South African Government has taken further substantial steps down the reform path. That position was spelt out and agreed to at the last meeting, in recent weeks, of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa in New Delhi, and it will be considered by the Harare meeting of CHOGM next week.</PARA>
<PARA>  The final point I make is that this is not to say that we cannot do some useful things by way of preparing for a post-apartheid trading environment with South Africa. Indeed, there have been recent expressions of support from the ANC and other black organisations for such preparatory activity taking place. It was with that in mind that we considered sending an Austrade official to South Africa to discuss and explore market conditions there for both trade and investment so that Austrade would be in a better position, upon the removal of sanctions, to effectively advise Australian business as to market opportunities. That visit did not proceed for reasons that were linked with reciprocal conditions that were sought to be imposed.</PARA>
<PARA>  For the record, I want to indicate now that this has been the subject of further discussion in my conversation with Mr Botha yesterday. I am very confident now that this issue will be able to be quickly resolved and that a reciprocal visit will take place shortly between respective trade officials, again not by way of trade promotion but simply by way of market research type activity, which is an important step in preparing ourselves for what we hope will be a very quick lifting of trade sanctions as soon as there is some major progress on the constitutional front.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is not my recollection of the terms of Professor Garnaut's advice. Certainly the point was made in his group's report to the Government that the lifting of sanctions, in particular investment and financial sanctions, was an important precondition to the restoration of growth in the South African economy--a point Mr Botha has made quite vigorously, publicly and privately, since he has been here. We have never been in any doubt about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The question is as to the continuing utility of such sanctions in keeping pressure on the South African Government, in particular to ensure that the process of achieving fundamental constitutional change rapidly comes to fruition. We saw, all too unhappily, the situation in the first half of this year when, flushed with the success of a too rapid easing of sanctions by an important element of the international community, namely, the EC, the South African Government was far from active in its promotion of the reform process during that period.</PARA>
<PARA>  We believe there is a continuing connection between that external pressure and effective constitutional change. I do not understand Professor Garnaut or anyone else advising the Government to take a fundamentally different view of that. In any event, Professor Garnaut's mandate in his trip to South Africa was not to advise the Government on sanctions policy so much as to advise us on how best we could assist black South Africans, who are going to play an obviously important role in government post-apartheid, in preparing for the responsibilities of economic management that would go with that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Government unequivocally rejects the criticism that has been coming from one or two sources that we have not done anything since I signed on behalf of the Prime Minister the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children in May this year. The current overseas aid budget for 1991-92 includes increases in specific sectors relating to our international obligations under the declaration on children, which were commitments made precisely with those obligations in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Those increases exceed the overall increase of one per cent that was achieved in the aid program. For example, UNICEF will receive $4.1m in core funding this year, which constitutes a 7.3 per cent real increase over the previous year; other international children and maternal related programs will receive $4.2m, a 2.1 per cent real increase. I remind the Senate of how impossible it would be to meet those kinds of targets in an environment of aid reductions of the kind that the Opposition is now saying very publicly and shamelessly it will engage in.</PARA>
<PARA>  Other significant aid contributions will be made to maternal and child health projects through a number of bilateral programs. For example, in this year's Budget we will be continuing our contribution to a major maternal and child health project in the Philippines costing $4.9m over four years. Moreover, I am pleased to say--and particularly pleased to say it on the occasion of today, being Universal Child Immunisation Day--that Australia's contributions to UNICEF and to the WHO expanded program on immunisation have been important in helping those organisations achieve the UN goal of universal child immunisation. Later today the UN will announce that it has surpassed its 1990 target of immunising 80 per cent of children against the six preventable diseases: measles, whooping cough, tetanus, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis and diphtheria. Reaching that target is a magnificent achievement, and we certainly congratulate UNICEF, WHO and the developing countries on that success.</PARA>
<PARA>  I add further that the Australian aid program includes a $20m four-year health initiative, a significant part of which is directed to improving vaccines and their delivery. So in supporting UNICEF and WHO programs, the Government is demonstrating Australia's commitment to the goals expressed in the UN world declaration on children. We are examining further proposals in the fields of immunisation, maternal and child health, education, water and sanitation as options for Australia's plan of action under that UN declaration. Funding for that will be further considered in the 1992-93 Budget.</PARA>

With regard to the package which has been put together, the Government has absolutely resisted all attempts by unions and some employers for some 18 months to short-circuit this reform process and provide redundancy packages without reform. Rather than take up any more time of the Senate unnecessarily, I simply assert to Senator Lewis--because he obviously does not know--that the arrangements which were reached in Sydney last week to provide additional redundancy packages are precisely in accordance with the formula laid down in the in-principle agreement that established this waterfront reform process.

Does the Minister concede that the present minimum requirement of 1.5 millimetre country of origin labelling, with no requirement for it to be placed at the front of the label, does not meet the commitment he gave to farmers and consumers for clear and identifiable labelling?  Is the Minister aware that the Australian Food Standards Committee has recommended no change to the pinhead-size labelling on imported food products, ignoring the Minister's previous directions? Will the Minister be prepared to stand up and fight for Australian farmers and consumers and his own considerable integrity by convincing Cabinet that a promise made by one Minister should be honoured by another, even if the responsibility has changed to another portfolio?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The interjection is that I have taken no action. That demonstrates Senator Olsen's profound ignorance in these matters because the Australian Food Standards Committee, at my initiative and instigation, determined in relation, for example, to orange juice concentrate that was flooding into Australia, being diluted with Australian water and peddled as produce of Australia, that in those situations the imported orange juice concentrate was to be clearly advertised as such on the label. I believe that that proposal comes into effect on 1 January 1992, at my initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Again, in relation to unpackaged food--for example, fruit, vegetables, nuts and fish--imported unpackaged food in those categories will have to bear a label indicating that it was derived from an overseas country. I believe that that comes into effect on 28 February 1992. So, at my instigation, a lot has been done to inform Australian shoppers and consumers. However, it is a fact that, in relation to unpackaged food, the label is to be 4 millimetres high.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In relation to unpackaged food it is 4 or 4.5 millimetres. In relation to packaged food, the Australian Food Standards Committee did not take up my suggestion and has determined that 1.5 millimetres should remain the required minimum size. I mention that in relation to the minimum because the fact is that Australian producers of packaged foodstuffs should take the initiative and put `Country of Origin' or `Australian Produce' in much larger lettering, and on the front of the label, if that is what Senator Boswell wants. By that sort of advertising and promotion of Australian produce, they can help Australian shoppers and consumers to purchase foodstuffs, which will in turn aid Australian farmers and orchardists. It is up to Australian producers of these packaged foods to take advantage of that possibility and to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The fact is that that minimum requirement of 1.5 millimetres was taken by the Australian Food Standards Committee to be adequate, as a minimum, as an information standard. In relation to health warnings and so on, of course, the required minimum size of labelling is much higher. These matters have passed out of my immediate control and the National Food Authority, which was the subject of intensive examination in this chamber when the legislation was passed and in the Estimates Committee, now has the question of food standards in Australia under its aegis and supervision. I believe that it would be appropriate for it, as it carries out its first major review and survey of the rules relating to labelling, to examine the matter of print size on labels for country of origin information.</PARA>
<PARA>  I could suggest to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services that he request the National Food Authority in its review to once again undertake that sort of examination of the minimum size of labelling for country of origin information. I believe that Australians do deserve to know what is the country of origin of the food that they purchase. As I say, I will make that representation to the National Food Authority, through the Minister, to further that process.</PARA>

<PARA>  That the time for presentation of the report of Estimates Committee A be extended to 16 October 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Estimates Committee A has sat for about 50 hours on five sitting days so far on the Budget Estimates. It was hoped that the Committee would be able to conclude its scrutiny of the estimates of the five portfolios referred to it in that time. In the event, it became apparent that some senators had a large number of questions for the Australian Taxation Office. It would not have been possible to conclude the Committee's deliberations on the last hearing night without extending the sitting to an inordinate degree. The Committee considered that this would be unfair to the officers of the Taxation Office and might affect the quality of its own scrutiny of the estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>  With the agreement of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, the Committee has rescheduled the estimates of the Australian Taxation Office for Friday, 11 October 1991. This will permit the Committee to table its report on Wednesday, 16 October 1991. I understand that the extension of time sought by the Committee will not cause any disruption to the timetable for consideration of the Appropriation Bills by the Committee of the Whole House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the Committee's report on the Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service, together with a video recording and minutes of proceedings. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the Committee's report entitled Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service. I also present a video on the report produced by the Committee and the Parliament's Sound and Vision Office specifically for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The video deals with those aspects of the report which address ways in which the Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service could be improved to provide better service for those people. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service, run by the Australian Electoral Commission, was set up to provide Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in traditional and remote communities with electoral information and education and to encourage their enrolment. AIEIS differs from other similar programs which preceded it in that it gives responsibility for the delivery of electoral information and education to Aboriginal and Islander people themselves. This is done by educating selected community members, called community electoral assistants, as resource people for their own communities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service was reviewed by the Australian National University's North Australia Research Unit in 1987-88. The NARU report was referred to the Committee of the Thirty-fifth Parliament by Senator Robert Ray, then Minister for Home Affairs. It was re-referred, with expanded terms of reference, to the Committee of the Thirty-sixth Parliament by Senator Bolkus, the Minister for Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA>  The work of the Committee has been greatly assisted by those who made submissions and particularly by the contributions of the many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with whom discussions were held both in Canberra and during two site inspections in north Queensland and Western Australia. These site inspections were a critical source of information to the inquiry and gave the Committee the opportunity to meet the members of Aboriginal and Islander communities and to talk with some of the people who are served by AIEIS and many of the community electoral assistants who work with AIEIS. The site inspections were undertaken so that the Committee could test, out in the field, the observations that were made to it in submissions. </PARA>
<PARA>  A primary question facing the Committee was whether there is a need for the service provided by AIEIS. The inquiry has convinced the Committee that such a need does indeed exist. As a group, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders are electorally disadvantaged. Factors which contribute to this include a lack of general education, restricted access to general electoral education services offered by the AEC, and remoteness of location. We must also remember that compulsory enrolment for Aborigines was introduced only in 1983. It is because of this electoral disadvantage of Aboriginal and Islander people that the AIEIS program is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee has therefore recommended that the program be continued. It has also recommended that the program's name be changed to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Electoral Information Service so as to reflect more accurately its target clientele. </PARA>
<PARA>  The AIEIS program's objectives include both electoral education and enrolment. There has been to date a conflict of views within the AEC concerning the relative importance of these objectives. This conflict has affected relations between AIEIS officers and other AEC staff and, in part, hampered the efficient operation of the program. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the Committee certainly endorses the importance of enrolment, it believes that enrolment is of limited use unless it is accompanied by education. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the AEC formulate a clear policy giving priority to education and information in the AIEIS program. </PARA>
<PARA>  The conflict over the focus of the program is symptomatic of other problems faced by AIEIS. The Committee noted several deficiencies in the AEC's management of the program which are not conducive to the efficient and effective delivery of service. AIEIS has been adversely affected by inadequate staffing, insufficient management commitment to the program, vague lines of authority and poor program evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee has made a comprehensive series of recommendations which address these concerns. They relate to the full and continuous staffing of the program; the demonstration by the AEC's management of an appropriately supportive attitude to AIEIS; administrative changes which will establish clear lines of authority and control; and improvements to reporting and accountability mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another matter of concern to the Committee is that, because of its limited area of operation, the AIEIS program is not reaching the majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. To ensure access to the service provided by AIEIS for all Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, the Committee strongly recommends that the Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service be extended to the States not now covered, that is, New South Wales and Victoria, and to urban areas; and that the AEC seek funding for this from the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee is pleased to be able to report that its inquiry has already resulted in some favourable outcomes in respect of the program's expansion. A submission to the Committee by ATSIC prompted the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) to approach Senator Bolkus concerning the possibility of extending the program. At Senator Bolkus's request, the AEC developed, and has received budgetary approval for, an extension of the program, and extra funding. Sufficient funding will now be available to employ at least two more field officers. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee would also like to see the program's scope expanded to include information on state and local government and the role of political parties, and has made a recommendation to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA>  Certain aspects of the way the program operates in the field could also be improved to make electoral information and education more accessible to more people. The Committee has recommended that there be greater emphasis placed on fostering wider community support for the program and developing greater community participation. There should also be greater use made of visual media such as videos, comics and T-shirts, as these have been identified by Aboriginal and Islander people as valuable educational aids. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the Committee's investigation, it heard much about the role played by AIEIS in the conduct of the first ATSIC regional council elections held on 3 November 1990. Many regional returning officers and ATSIC officials told the Committee that AIEIS played a vital role in the success of those elections and that, in fact, polling could not have gone ahead in many places without the presence and dedication of AIEIS field officers and community electoral assistants. The information, education and enrolment functions of AIEIS were also crucial in preparing people for the elections. The Committee strongly believes that access to electoral information and education is the right of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Only with the provision of such education and information will they become full participants in the government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, this inquiry impressed upon the Committee that in places where AIEIS has operated well there is among Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders a new enthusiasm for democratic processes and an eagerness to participate in them, both as electors and candidates. This has left the Committee in no doubt that the Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service is a worthwhile program. Accordingly, it urges the AEC to address the problems identified in this report and to take steps to improve AIEIS so that it provides all Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders with an efficient and effective electoral information, education and enrolment service. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report embodies the unanimous views of the subcommittee comprising Senator Kernot, from the Australian Democrats in Queensland; Mr Miles, MP, a Liberal from Tasmania; and me. It is unfortunate that when the report was considered by the full Committee it ran into opposition from two members of that Committee--Senator Kemp, a Liberal from Victoria; and Mr Cobb, MP, a National Party member from New South Wales--neither of whom participated in the subcommittee's public hearings and site inspections. </PARA>
<PARA>  Their criticisms are contained in a dissenting report, and they focus on two broad areas. The first is the claim that insufficient evidence is provided to support the report's conclusions, and the second is that the report was unduly critical of the AEC. There is a certain irony in the fact that the dissenting report provides very little detail to support the criticisms which it mounts; in other words, the dissenting report fails to meet the standards which it insists the majority report should have applied. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the question of evidence, I believe that adequate evidence has been provided to support the recommendations made and every effort has been made to refer to transcripts of public hearings, where appropriate, or to information gleaned from site inspections. However, it should be noted that, firstly, committees are not obliged, as suggested in the dissenting report, to respond in their reports to every submission made and, secondly, committee reports are not written like PhD theses. They are more practical documents which, unlike academic theses, we hope people will read. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also worth noting that the recommendations of the majority report are broadly in line with the NARU report, which I have already referred to. In other words, the ANU's northern research unit, staffed as it is by academics, arrived at similar conclusions independently of the Committee. Its findings are regularly referred to in the report. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the dissenting report's criticism of the Committee for failing to provide adequate survey information concerning the enrolment of Aboriginal and Islander people, the following is made clear in the report at paragraph 1.4:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not possible to calculate Aboriginal enrolment levels because enrolment data do not include information on ethnicity. </PARA>
<PARA>The dissenting report also criticises the report for recommending an expansion of the AIEIS program into urban areas without, it claims, adequate information demonstrating the need. I draw the attention of honourable senators to paragraphs 3.12 and 3.13, table 1 and paragraph 4.33, which outline the need to expand the program into urban areas. In addition, it is outlined in the NARU report at page 21 that not providing the program to Aboriginals in towns and urban areas is based on the false assumption that those Aboriginals are taking advantage of sources of information available to all citizens. Many of them are not, because they are isolated socially just as much as the rural Aboriginals are isolated geographically. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, paragraph 3.18 of the report clearly recognises the claim that the Committee has been unfairly critical of the AEC and that it fails to recognise the problem of inadequate resources faced by that body. In paragraph 4.3, it is made clear that the AEC provided inconsistent evidence on the way in which it allowed the operation of the program to be dictated by the program reviews, particularly the NARU report and the investigation carried out by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. </PARA>
<PARA>  In short, I believe that the Committee has made every attempt to be fair and balanced in its view, and has supported the conclusions it has drawn in a manner which is both adequate and consistent with the nature of normal parliamentary reports. I am satisfied that the criticisms levelled in the dissenting report are not matters of substance. I look forward to Senator Kemp and Mr Cobb applying to other parliamentary reports the same standard that they appear to want to apply to this one. </PARA>
<PARA>  To conclude, I wish to thank the Committee secretary, Bev Forbes; Pattie Tancred, who was assigned specifically to this subcommittee; and Frances Coates and Judy Jurek of the Committee staff, all of whom did an excellent job. I commend the report and the video to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As a member of the electoral matters subcommittee, I am delighted to speak to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The subcommittee Chairman, Senator Beahan, has already clearly outlined the reason for the inquiry. He has covered its main recommendations and the response of the subcommittee to the dissenting report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the brief time available to me, I want to focus on some personal observations and to comment on some of the recommendations. My first observation is that it has been very important to give to Aboriginal and Islander people the responsibility for the delivery of electoral information and education. Our site inspections in northern Queensland and Western Australia certainly confirmed this. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the report points out in its introduction, field officers and community electoral assistants play a key role in ensuring that Aboriginal and Islander peoples develop basic electoral skills. The voluntary community electoral assistants we met were competent, enthusiastic and hard-working. They had the respect of their communities and they were very successful in ensuring a good turnout on polling day. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was interesting to note that the majority of community electoral assistants were women. It is worth noting, too, that many of these women already played a very important role in nurturing and educating their communities in health, housing and other matters. Their role in maintaining social cohesion in their communities cannot be underestimated. I think particularly here of the women from Turkey Creek in the Kimberleys. These community electoral assistants clearly recognised and communicated to their communities the link between participation in decision-making and ensuing action. </PARA>
<PARA>  This leads me to my second observation, a matter on which Senator Beahan touched, and which I would call the rekindled interest of Aboriginal and Islander people in the whole electoral process because of their recent experiences in the ATSIC elections. Although there were varying levels of turnout, ranging from 75 per cent in non-urban areas to 10 per cent in some urban areas, the clear impression I gained was that, as ATSIC regional councils have been and are meeting regularly, many Aboriginal and Islander people are determined to be candidates and to participate in the process next time around. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think it is certainly true that the AIEIS program has played a very important role in supporting not only the ATSIC election but also all recent elections in which Aboriginal people have been involved. That is why I think it is extremely important that the program be continued, as the Committee recommends. It is more important, as has been recommended, that the Australian Electoral Commission formulate a policy for the extension of this valuable program into more settled areas, including major metropolitan regions. </PARA>
<PARA>   Aboriginal and Islander witnesses who spoke to the Committee had many constructive comments to make, particularly on how we can communicate more effectively with Aboriginal and Islander voters; hence, our innovative use of the video to communicate the recommendations of this Committee to the various Aboriginal and Islander communities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend the Government for its continued support of this program. I commend the work of the subcommittee's Secretary, Ms Patti Tancred, for her organisation of the very comprehensive site inspections. Although the subcommittee looked specifically at electoral information services, I think it was in a position to note many other signs of progress being made in Aboriginal and Islander communities. We must not underestimate the very important role that the Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service plays in Aboriginal communities in communicating and in improving the communication skills and the participation rate of Aboriginal people. I commend the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to speak briefly to the report. As has been mentioned by Senator Beahan and Senator Kernot, there were some concerns in the Committee about the report. It was as a result of these concerns that Mr Cobb and I filed a minority report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I think that it is worth while briefly going through some of the matters we raised. Senator Beahan, in his remarks on the report, referred honourable senators to the particular concerns which I raised in the minority report and the particular pages in the body of the report and asked them to judge whether the criticisms were valid. On that particular comment by Senator Beahan, I think that is certainly an appropriate course to follow. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we went through the report in the Committee, and when we went through the criticisms which were outlined, I think it was reasonable for us to look and see on what basis these particular assertions and criticisms were made. It became apparent in a couple of areas--and they were in some key areas--that the report had arrived at conclusions which certainly Mr Cobb and I did not feel were sustained by the evidence that was given to the Committee. It was quite right that we were not there as part of all the hearings and we were not there as part of the discussions. This was, as Senator Beahan pointed out, a report that was essentially prepared by a subcommittee. Nonetheless, in view of the fact that the Committee had to turn its mind to the report ultimately and the Committee had to approve the report, it was appropriate that members of this Committee look very closely at the conclusions which were arrived at in the report. Senator Beahan has said that there were conclusions which were made in the report which I found simply could not be sustained by the evidence which I was able to read and which was presented to me. I think that the ultimate test is for honourable senators to read the report, to read the criticisms of the report which Mr Cobb and I have made, and to assess whether the matters that we raised were valid. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems to me that one of the difficulties that the Committee had to address was the key objectives of the AIEIS program. As I read the objectives as laid down by the AIEIS program, one seemed to be particularly important. That was the fourth objective, which is listed in the report at page 7. This objective of the AIEIS program reads:. . .to facilitate, directly or through Aboriginal and Islander communities and organisations, the enrolment of Aboriginal and Islander people and the maintenance of electoral rolls. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a very important and key objective and certainly one which I think all of us in this chamber could thoroughly endorse. </PARA>
<PARA>  The difficulty with this report is that this objective, at least in my mind, was never assessed properly. I think that the Committee and, I regret to say, the subcommittee failed in their work to assess carefully whether that key objective of the AIEIS program was being met. I am sorry that that happened. As I said earlier, it is an important objective and one would have hoped that the subcommittee would look at it very closely and assess the evidence to see how that program was going. </PARA>
<PARA>  This brings me to the next point I wish to make. It was very clear, upon reading the evidence, that there is deep division between at least some of the officers who are involved in the AIEIS program and the officers in the AEC who either had direct management responsibility for this program or were involved with it in some other way. There is no doubt that the AEC management saw this objective as a key objective and was very concerned that, in some areas at least, the officers involved in the AIEIS section of the program had a different view of their role. To my mind, the Committee's report never came to grips with that issue. That fourth objective is an important objective which should have been considered more carefully by members of the subcommittee. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second major criticism we had of the report concerned the proposed major expansion of the AIEIS program into urban areas. Frankly, I do not think the case was well made out for that important and, in my view, extremely expensive proposal. Again, the evidence was simply not presented in the report. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not good enough for people to come into this chamber and state that all of these things are good and worthwhile and should be expanded, without doing the job which they were asked to do which was carefully to assess the program to see where it was performing weakly and to make proposals as to how it could be strengthened, based on hard evidence, not on good feelings. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said in the minority report which I presented, we recognise and, indeed, support the program. Many submissions were made which clearly supported the program and, certainly from my point of view, the objectives of the program are eminently worthwhile and deserve to be supported. The tragedy of this report which Senator Beahan has presented to the chamber is that I do not think the subcommittee looked, in a proper and careful way, to see whether those objectives were being met. </PARA>

<PARA>  That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA>  Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The speech read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>  The Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2) seeks to make three minor changes to the Student Assistance Act 1973. The Act gives the legislative basis for the Austudy scheme and provides a debt management regime for the other student assistance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Appropriations Clause</PARA>
<PARA>  Student assistance schemes are demand driven, with the overall expenditure depending on the number of full time students applying for assistance. It is therefore more appropriate to provide a special appropriations clause in the Student Assistance Act than to deal with the schemes through the normal appropriation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Accordingly, the Bill proposes to insert a section into the Student Assistance Act to appropriate the funds needed to pay allowances under the Austudy, Abstudy and assistance for isolated children schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Cocos (Keeling) Islands</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will also extend the application of the Austudy scheme to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. This reflects the move to normalise the application of Australian laws to the territory, including the phasing in of normal income tax arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Living Allowances for English as a Second Language Scheme</PARA>
<PARA>  A third measure in the Bill concerns the living allowances for English as a second language scheme. This is a small scheme which provides living allowances to migrants undertaking Commonwealth funded courses in English as a second language at TAFE colleges. About 1,400 students were assisted in 1990 at a cost of approximately $3.7m. </PARA>
<PARA>  From 1 July 1991, the scheme has been integrated into the social security payment system, though the scheme is included as a separate budgetary item in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>  In view of the new arrangements, it is no longer appropriate for the debt management regime for the scheme to be provided for under the Student Assistance Act and the Act will be amended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will have no significant financial impact on overall expenditure. The extension of Austudy to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is expected to cost about $20,000 a year. The other provisions are cost neutral and involve improved arrangements for paying the same amount of assistance to students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-During the debate on the Loan Bill (No. 2) 1991 in the last parliamentary session, I was discussing the regrettable sequence of events that had led to the need for a loan Bill and the lack of direction given in the Budget to turn events around. At the time, I had finished discussing the Government's about-face in relation to fiscal policy and will now debate wages policy--or the lack of wages policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I remind the Senate that during the late 1980s the Government frequently arranged wage trade-offs so that employees' wage packets were often increased without the employer having to meet the cost of the higher disposable income which resulted. The Government's idea at the time was to restore profit share--a noble objective--by giving business money to invest in its own business or elsewhere in the business market. So the story went. But that is where the rhetoric ended because, at the same time, the Government introduced a series of measures to bring forward the collection of corporation tax and, through the Australian Taxation Office, set up a system whereby it brought revenue to account earlier than in the past--we had the Coles-Myer decision, for example. At the same time, in some cases the Government tended to deny the deductibility of expenses--or certainly deferred that to a greater period of time. One example was the depreciation regime. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst there is no agreed percentage for wage increases in the Budget, negotiations are certainly taking place outside that context. Unfortunately, in the Budget there is a very substantial increase in the on-costs of employment through the proposed legislative superannuation requirements. I point out to the Senate that this will act as a major disincentive to employment so far as employers are concerned. In fact, the impact could be just as devastating as that iniquitous payroll tax which is levied by the States--a tax on employment in a time of recession. There would be severe criticism of the Government and the Australian mentality if we were to accept such taxes on employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the Government may say it has a wages policy, there does appear to be a lack on the other side of the coin in that there is no policy in relation to jobs. This lack of commitment to jobs is a most stinging criticism of the Government. In fact, this lack of commitment is so strong that it has raised a point of conflict between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Premier of Victoria, Mrs Joan Kirner, and that conflict also extends to some of her Ministers. The threat of retribution from the Prime Minister is indeed a bitter pill to be placed in the mouths of so many Victorians. The threat of cuts to Victoria is a sad reflection of the attitude of a Prime Minister when approximately one million people are unemployed. We on this side of the chamber have drawn attention on more than one occasion to the Prime Minister's appearing to be more interested in the security of his own job than in the security of the jobs of a million other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we come back to the question of monetary policy and the undue emphasis that the Government has placed on it, we find that some few weeks ago the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) announced a one per cent decrease in interest rates. I think the Government is building up the atmospherics for a further decrease in interest rates. But the easing of interest rates runs contrary to the earlier rhetoric from the new Treasurer and the Reserve Bank in the weeks preceding the original announcement, which stressed that lending indicators in the economy were recovering and that easing rates could not take effect until 1992, when the recovery was well under way. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, if we look at the statements of Mr Kerin, we will see that there has been a complete failure to explain to the public why this interest rate drop has occurred. In fact, the Australian Financial Review was astute enough to note that, in tone, interpretation and selection of the facts, the Government's statements are completely at odds with all that it has been saying about this so-called medium term approach to controlling inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In another area, I remind the Senate that the recent surge in the exchange rate of the Australian dollar vis-a-vis the American dollar reflects the very high real interest rates which prevail in Australia. If real interest rates happen to fall--and they could--there is the chance of a chaotic situation with the exchange rate, which could have a monumental impact on the Government's ability to manage the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suggest that these moves in interest rates, which will occur as a result of the move the Government is now contemplating, will now put the Government in very grave danger of throwing away the opportunity to lock in the recessionary fall in inflation. If we closely read the statements of the previous Treasurer, we can believe that he is prepared to sacrifice that fall in inflation. That is part of a continuing saga of conflict between the new Treasurer and the previous Treasurer, which is unfortunate at a time of such severe recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1991 Budget is the Government's third attempt in the past six months to address the economic plight of the country. The first attempt was last year's Budget and the second was the failed March industry statement. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that we do not have a legislative base for any of the items in that statement. Hence, that document was essentially just a pile of rhetoric. It is only in recent days that one feature--the depreciation regime--has been finalised. Even then, the Government failed to acknowledge the need of the asset to have an economic life vis-a-vis a physical life. It is a matter that is certainly recognised in all regimes which are sophisticated and determined to ensure that there is an appropriate deductibility regime for plant in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  In April 1990, the OECD report on the Australian economy suggested that action needed to be taken which would boost export growth, domestic savings and productivity and dampen inflation. On the whole, that advice was basically ignored. This is a tragedy for Australia. We are very cocksure in the way that we can provide advice to other governments around the world. It is regrettable that the Government shunned the economic advice that was given to it by such authorities as the OECD and went full steam ahead on basically a monetary policy that has had such devastating effects on the Australian economy, particularly for jobs and employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the economy showed no signs of recovering in the last half of 1990, the Government decided it should have a second go at getting it right by issuing the March industry statement, which, I must say, ended up being a further disappointment. I suppose the only good news was that, by some means which the Government did not fully explain, inflation dropped. That was a result of the great recession. The emphasis therefore moved from the current account deficit being the primary economic concern to maintaining a low inflation rate. The emphasis now seems to have changed again. It is now October 1991, and unemployment has not yet reached 10 per cent but, by the Treasurer's own admission, it will certainly do so in the not-too-distant future. Inflation has, until perhaps a few weeks ago, been held in check. There are now ominous signs of its rising. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the high sounding urgency of the 12 March industry statement, there is still no legislation. Hence, where is the Government's commitment and where is the Government's priority in trying to change things around?  Where is the Government's priority in trying to get more jobs and in creating a proper business environment that is conducive to employment and job creation? The only activity that the Government really is good at nowadays appears to be kite flying and rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA>  The question that begs to be asked is: where to now? Passing these loan Bills, while legally required and very easily done, is the soft option that this Government has consistently followed. When it attempted to overcome the last recessionary difficulties, it attempted to borrow its way out of the problem. This is reflected in the fact that we had a high interest rate regime as a result of emphasis on monetary policy, and at present we have a national indebtedness of $165 billion or $166 billion. It is a situation that reflects a steady lowering of the standards of living of average Australians. This is the price that the Australian community has had to pay for a government that is not prepared to tackle the hard economic consequences facing Australia, which the world is telling us about but which we choose to ignore. That is, we are burying our head in the sand and are prepared to allow our own kith and kin, our own peoples, to suffer the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Loan Bill is basically the soft option. In fact, I would rather be giving this Government credit for another year of Budget surplus. I think we will find ourselves debating yet a further loan Bill in six months time. This is the tragic scenario that we are getting into. We have taken the attitude that by borrowing money we can spend our way out of trouble. Instead, we are getting ourselves deeper and deeper into debt with consequent lowering standards and little hope for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In speaking to the Loan Bill (No.2) 1991, I simply wish to draw to the attention of the Senate a matter that has caused me some concern since the Budget details were announced, and it is an aspect of the Budget which appears to have escaped the attention of the public at large. A setting down fee has been introduced within the Attorney-General's Department on all matters now being set down for trial before the Federal Court, the Family Court and the various tribunals which come within the jurisdiction of the Federal Attorney-General's Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  At a time when there is a great concern about the costs of justice generally around Australia, this Government has chosen to introduce another fee--a hidden tax--of $500 every time a matter is set down for hearing before any of the Federal courts. That provision was pretty well hidden in all of the Budget Papers. It was so well hidden that, when inquiries were raised about it, it appeared that the notification within the Budget that the amount of $500 would apply to all matters being set down in any Federal court or tribunal was, in fact, not correct. The Budget Papers said that, but on further inquiry at one of the Estimates committees it was ascertained that that did not apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, where the fee was to be only $200. That $200 is, of course, on top of a mandatory $300 filing fee, so I suppose the total payment is much the same. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is one very unfair result. When people wanted their income tax assessments to be reviewed in the old days they were able to ask the review board to reassess the assessment and it cost $2. If several years came up at once, it would have cost $2 a year. As I understand the proposal--although there seems to be a scant amount of information on it--it will now cost a $300 filing fee plus a $200 setting down fee for every single income tax assessment that people want reviewed. That can become an enormous impost, particularly if the amount being argued about is less than $500. That is just one aspect of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  Every single matter that people want to raise before any Federal court now will cost a $500 setting down fee, in addition to other fees. It absolutely amazes me that, in times when everyone is concerned about the cost of justice, when it is so difficult to get before courts and to get before them at a reasonable price, this Government imposes a $500 tax on people before they can seek relief and justice from the courts. </PARA>
<PARA>  What further concerns me is that some of the people who administer the Acts within the Attorney-General's Department and who administer the courts seem to see nothing particularly wrong with loading Federal Government charges onto court fees. It was my experience as a practitioner in the law before I came to this chamber that, to be able to afford to seek justice in the Australian courts at the moment, one has to be either a pauper or a very wealthy national or multinational company. It seems that the middle range of Australians is being excluded. It just becomes impossible for middle Australians to afford to prosecute a case in a court. I raised that concern at the Estimates committee hearing. The officer who was dealing with the matter indicated that he did not agree with me at all when I said to him that people with an income of between $20,000 and $50,000 would find it almost impossible to go to courts these days, but that has been my experience. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am concerned about what some of the officers who deal with and advise the Government, and make recommendations on these matters, understand about the whole range of middle Australians who are now being squeezed out of justice. The examples are myriad where people enter into legal matters but are forced out because of the costs of the system. The court costs of some lawyers--and I emphasise some; it is certainly not all and certainly not the majority--and the way the cases are prosecuted makes it too big a risk to proceed to seek justice. So there is an enormous number of people in Australia, particularly in the middle income group--the middle Australians--who are excluded by economic circumstances from being able to seek justice in Australian courts. </PARA>
<PARA>  The underprivileged and those without incomes are able to prosecute who they like and to continue as long as they like because they are not footing the bill. I do not deny them that opportunity; it is good to see that they do have access to the courts and do have the right to seek justice. But the middle Australians who do not qualify for legal aid--and one does not have to be earning much not to qualify for it--are practically excluded. What has this Government done about that? It has simply exacerbated the situation by imposing another $500 fee on those who want to seek justice before the courts.</PARA>
<PARA>  There has not been a lot of publicity about this. I understand that the fee is to start on 1 October. I do not think too many lawyers have heard about it yet, and that makes me think that I must have the date wrong. I see the Minister is sitting in the chamber; maybe he could elucidate on that later. The matter was raised by me in the Senate Estimates hearings on 5 September but, apart from that, I have not heard much about it. </PARA>
<PARA>  This morning I received a letter from the Law Council of Australia, which has become aware of this matter. It is very concerned at the additional costs that will be imposed upon litigants. The Law Council particularly notes the fee in the Family Court. A person entering an application in the Family Court for relief has to pay the $500 fee every time a determination is sought by the Court. It will be particularly serious in this area, where the breakdown of relationships can often lead to dramatic consequences necessitating more than one application to the Court for relief. For example, is it the case that a fee will be payable every time a spouse needs to approach the Court to seek an order to restrain the other spouse from physical abuse, abusing a child or destroying or hiding property? Will a fee have to be paid on a spouse's application seeking urgent maintenance before his or her case can be heard?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Law Council strongly opposes the imposition of these fees, as I do, particularly as it increases the whole cost of justice at a time when there is a real concern in the community about the cost of justice. It has a more serious aspect than just the economic one. It is getting to a situation where, whilst we as a nation with a common law history brought down to us through our English heritage, place so much emphasis and so much faith on our ability to get before courts and to seek justice, there is now a real danger that the vast majority of middle Australians are being forced out of any remedy they might have to proceed to the courts simply because of the cost. As I say, that is a wider concern than simply the economic one. It does mean that justice is being taken from the vast majority of middle Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise in this debate because of my concerns about the level of unemployment and what should be done to resolve it. We have seen the most extraordinary debate in recent days about welfare and compassion, as if the only way to resolve the disaster of unemployment is to have a bigger and bigger welfare bureaucracy and to throw more and more money at welfare. The reality is that the best way to resolve the problem of unemployment is to create jobs, and that appears to be the last item on this Government's order of priorities. It is certainly the last item on the debate over welfare that takes place in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is remarkable that in that debate there have been accusations that, for example, the Greiner Government in New South Wales lacks compassion. In fact, it is the only State Government that is genuinely doing something about the disaster of unemployment. It has limited enormously the impact of this Federal Government-induced disaster around Australia, so that New South Wales has had the lowest level of job loss and the lowest unemployment rate of all the States. In other words, it is showing practical compassion by trying to keep jobs in existence instead of going down the track of all the State Labor governments which have, apparently quite happily, been prepared to put their political position above the real need, the evident need, for the sorts of policies that will keep the economy vibrant and effective and able to provide jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note the dramatic difference in New South Wales between this recession and the 1982-83 recession. The unemployment rate of about 9 per cent in New South Wales is far lower than in all the other States, some of which have a rate of well over 11 per cent. The average rate of youth unemployment in New South Wales of about 27.6 per cent, while still an horrendous level, is well below the Victorian level of 34 per cent or Tasmania at 30.7 per cent. Compare that situation with the 1982-83 recession, when there was a so-called compassionate State Labor Government in New South Wales: the New South Wales unemployment rate was 10.7 per cent--the highest of all the States. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is remarkable that New South Wales--the normally heavily industrialised State and therefore the most vulnerable State to economic downturn--under a Labor government suffered worse than the other States but in this recession is suffering least. It is not simply a coincidence;  it is a result of much sounder, much more restrained, much more effective policies, and I will deal with those policies and their consequences individually. So we have a total turnaround, a total reversal of the situation in the 1982-83 recession compared with this recession in terms of the impact on New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at the indicators. In 14 of the 15 quarterly indicators of economic activity in Australia, New South Wales performed better on average than the other States. In terms of unemployment, there are over 50,000 more people in jobs in New South Wales than would be the case if New South Wales had an unemployment rate equal to the average level of the other States. There is effective concern for the unemployed--not the phoney concern, if I can use that expression, of those people who see the only answer being in bigger and bigger welfare spending, bigger and bigger welfare bureaucracies, and more and more schemes that are aimed largely at hiding the true level of unemployment rather than doing the job properly, trying to generate greater skills, greater ability and greater job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at these indicators of how New South Wales has performed better than the other States. According to the latest available figures for motor vehicle registrations, the fall in New South Wales was just half that for the other five States, on average. Retail turnover has gone up considerably more in New South Wales: 7.5 per cent in the latest period to July compared with 6.8 per cent for the other States. Residential building approvals in the other States are up by 13.9 per cent, but in New South Wales they were up by 26 per cent in July. The number of unemployed people in New South Wales had fallen by 7 per cent in August compared with August the previous year, as against a 2.9 per cent drop in jobs in all the other States. Bank deposits in the other States have gone up 9 per cent, while in New South Wales they are up 11.9 per cent. Bank loans in other States are up by 6.6 per cent; in New South Wales they are up by 12.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we look at the great bulk of these economic indicators, we see that New South Wales is far outperforming the other States. That does not mean that one should sit back and say, `Everything is wonderful'. Of course it is not. Of course the levels of unemployment throughout Australia are appalling, and they are appalling because of the policies Mr Keating introduced and the recession he deliberately engineered. That is his own expression:  his engineered recession. How extraordinary it is that Mr Keating, having engineered this recession, is now providing gratuitous advice to Mr Hawke and his Government about what should be done to correct the unemployment Mr Keating himself generated, with Mr Hawke's total support. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should remember that the continual promises of Mr Hawke--whom Mr Keating finds sufficiently untrustworthy to say in public that he would not work with a man whose word could not be trusted--about how unemployment would fall have been shown to be totally, consistently false. Last year Mr Hawke said that it was not a prospect that unemployment would reach 10 per cent. We now know that to be false as the figure approaches 10 per cent--it is now 9.8 per cent--and further figures will come out on Thursday of this week showing the level of unemployment for September. </PARA>
<PARA>  We look forward, unfortunately with nervous anticipation, to what will happen to unemployment levels when the school leavers start coming into the labour force in the new year. We have an unacceptably high level of unemployment. The only way to resolve that high level of unemployment is to undertake the radical reforms--particularly of labour reform and economic reform and certainly of tax reform--that the coalition is proposing and has in fact been proposing for some time. This Government has chosen continually to ignore the warnings of impending disaster if it persisted with its failed policies and to dismiss the policy initiatives that the coalition has continually said are needed. The Government has continued to ignore those policies by failing to introduce our initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is particularly galling to the Opposition is that, having created a disaster, the Government, and particularly those of its supporters in organisations whose structures are financed by it, are saying that the Opposition lacks compassion and is hard-hearted in its policies when it has been demonstrated that these policies are the only way to provide what the unemployed really need, which is not handouts, more schemes or bigger bureaucracies but jobs. Our policies are jobs and growth oriented--</PARA>

When we look at a coalition government at work in New South Wales and see at the time of this recession an enormous reversal of what happened in the previous recession, when Mr Wran and his Labor cohorts were in power and New South Wales was the worst State--it is now the least worst State--we see that management is a vital part of any effective delivery of a compassionate policy aimed at reducing the burdens on Australians, particularly those whose jobs are either lost or at risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The way to solve the problem is to create more jobs and to follow the coalition's very determined and complete package of radical reform. The coalition's reforms to the tax system are an essential and central part, as most of the Labor leaders recognised, of course, when they were arguing in favour of them in 1985. The present Government is failing in its duty. It has failed its major area of support, which is the working people of Australia. It has generated this disastrous level of unemployment and has deliberately engineered an economic recession. The coalition provides the only way out of this mess. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on Loan Bill (No. 2) 1991. I will refer in a moment to the amendment moved by Senator Short and spoken to by others and also to the comments made by some of the later speakers. However, I want to deal first with some of the questions asked by honourable senators in the course of the debate and some of the substantive points that they raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Loan Bill is intended, purely and simply, as a means of financing a prospective shortfall in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Loan Acts have been used by governments of all political persuasions since 1911 to fund such shortfalls. There is nothing particularly unusual about the requirement to have two such Bills during the same calendar year. For example, there were two in each of 1962, 1966, 1968 and 1982, and in fact three in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Loan Bill is, as Senator Short pointed out, a machinery financing measure which is required where payments from the CRF are expected to exceed moneys available to that fund. During the debate Senator Spindler sought an explanation as to why expenditure from the CRF must not exceed money available to it. The reason is that legally the fund is a collection of moneys. It is inherent in the nature of a fund that it cannot consist of a negative amount. In effect, the Government can spend only as much as it has in the bank. If the Government requires more money, it  must borrow it; hence the requirement for the Loan Bill now before this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>  The main components required to fund the estimated deficit of $10.2 billion in the CRF are identified in table 4 of Budget Paper No. 2, the Commonwealth Public Account. This shows on the payments side the $5.5 billion in defence expenditure estimated to be charged to the loan fund and on the receipts side $4.7 billion estimated to be received from the loan fund. These payments will be authorised by parts 2 and 3 of the Loan Bill respectively. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Watson asked for details of receipts and payments of the CRF which, because they are classified as financing transactions, do not impact on the Budget outcome. These amounts are shown in aggregate in table 1 of Budget Paper No. 2 and amount to some $3.1 billion of payments and $4.9 billion of receipts. I will detail these transactions in the same order in which Senator Watson sought the information. The major components of the estimated $3.1 billion CRF payments are, firstly, $3.1m to discharge the principal component of loans originally issued by the former Canberra Commercial Development Authority; and, secondly, a $1.7 billion payment to the national debt sinking fund to finance the repayment of securities issued on behalf of the Commonwealth in accordance with the provision of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966. As it is estimated that there will be no surplus in the CRF this financial year, it is not anticipated that any funds will be transferred to the loan consolidation and investment reserve. In addition, $1.3 billion will be paid in superannuation payments to former employees of public trading enterprises and $72m for Comcare benefits to employees of public trading enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>  The major receipts of the CRF are expected to be $3m from the investments of former superannuation schemes; $4.7 billion from the loan fund under the provisions of part 3 of the proposed Loan Act (No. 2); $118.6m in superannuation contributions from public trading enterprises; and $57.7m for Comcare premiums from public trading enterprises. This Bill becomes a necessary part of the Budget strategy and reflects the fiscal responsibility in the face of current economic circumstances. For that reason, we reject the amendment moved by Senator Short and spoken to by some of his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA>  One can see that the Opposition is feeling somewhat dogged by the emergence of some economic good news. It is clutching at the remnants of the bad news as the economic recovery commences. The amendment is internally contradictory, as were some of the arguments put in support of it. The Opposition feigns concern about unemployment, yet it seeks to cut outlays in the manner outlined by the shadow Minister for Finance, the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), which would lead to the loss of 46,000 jobs. As is usual with the conservatives, those opposite exhibit their concern about unemployment by getting rid of jobs, just as they exhibit their concern about inflation by putting up prices. The amendment talks about a reckless deficit, a concern that Government expenditure is too high and a concern that we should not even allow the automatic stabilisers to work to cushion the effects of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have in this amendment and the arguments for it the underlying rationale for the attack on ACOSS, which is an organisation made up of some of the most respected, responsible and decent citizens in Australia. It is being attacked because there is a concern that it may--I am quite confident that it will--deliver a message when the Opposition's package of measures is outlined, expose the inadequacies of that package and show the ice-cold heart of the Opposition, which is trying to shoot the messenger before the message can be delivered. I regret to say that that is not exactly elevating the standard of debate in Australian public life. I am pleased to say that it will fail. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not believe that the amendment ought to be carried by the Senate. It is not going to break anyone's heart if it is carried, because it is a statement of pious views by the Opposition which is so transparent that nobody would be concerned about it. We will be supporting the amendment to that amendment because it is a minor improvement. It seems to me that the Democrats have actually missed the point of some parts of Senator Short's amendment or they too would be opposing it. That is their concern, not mine. We will vote for their amendment but, of course, we will oppose the Opposition's amendment, even should Senator Spindler's modification of it be carried. I thank honourable senators for their support of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Aussat Repeal Bill is an important Bill which comes at an historic moment in the reforms of the telecommunications industry in this country. It is also historic in the sense that it brings to an end the Aussat satellite service as a service in its own right. As a result of this Bill there will be a legislative regime put in place to prepare Aussat for sale, with Aussat becoming the core of the second carrier. As a result of the selection procedure that has been devised, an applicant for the licence will be required to buy Aussat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In other words, this is yet another example of the contortions and distortions that have flowed from the original decision by the Government to pander to Telecom Australia and to its unions and to ignore what at least some in the Government, including Senator Cook's patron, Mr Keating, believed was the right course and one which we certainly adopt. That course is that Telecom should have been competing against the Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (OTC) and Aussat--not simply going down the path of creating a mega-carrier, one which combines an efficient OTC with a very inefficient and pampered Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a result of that artificial combination, we now have the other side of the coin. In other words, in order to establish a second carrier to provide some sort of viable alternative, not only did the Government have to countenance the entry of foreign carriers--and we now have two consortia, both of which have substantial components of American carriers providing the expertise, with Australian companies more or less bringing up the rear--but we would not have got even to that stage unless the Government had forced the pace in a sense by structuring the entry conditions so that Aussat had to be bought in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no doubt that no-one in his right mind would have been interested in buying a carrier such as Aussat which has been so unproductive in terms of profit-making that its debt at the current time is around $689m and by June next year is expected to be in the vicinity of $800m. That comes about not because Aussat has been inherently uncompetitive or overtaken by new technology, but quite the opposite. Once again it is the result of the disgraceful manner in which the Government has continued to favour Telecom, as a result of an incestuous arrangement whereby it not only continued to hold 25 per cent of the shares in Aussat but also its managing director and another director were on the Aussat board and therefore privy to all its decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time that they were nobbling Aussat from within, they were ensuring from without that Aussat was never able to compete on fair terms. Aussat was thoroughly constrained, was not able to enter into switched services, which resulted in something of the order of 90 per cent of the potential market in that area being denied to it. Telecom even went to the point of contesting vigorously a court action in the Northern Territory whereby the local Aboriginal communities had the temerity to want to get access to the best carrier service in the shortest possible time, but were told that they had no right to treat with Aussat. They simply had to get in the queue and wait their turn and Telecom would decide when and where it would lay ground cables through to those communities. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is simply one small example of the way in which Aussat has been constrained from the outset, has been hidebound by political compromises and has been squashed by Telecom whenever the opportunity arose. I find it deeply disappointing that Telecom not only felt no shame during that period, but has shown no remorse since. While it has now been forced to face up to market realities, it has certainly been dragged screaming and yelling to that position. At no time did Telecom even concede that there was a potential conflict of interest. Indeed, it clumsily threatened anyone who had the temerity to suggest that there might have been a compromise or a conflict of interest. That again is an indication that at the highest levels of Telecom management there was not only a lack of appreciation of the virtues of competition but also a desire to pander to the government of the day and not to have any concern in terms of the national interest as to whether Aussat should survive. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are now brought to this sorry point where the Government, realising that it could not give Aussat away with a debt burden of the order of $600m to $800m, is effectively to pay out the debt by allowing it to be absorbed by the Commonwealth and then to insist that any applicant for a second licence buy Aussat and presumably make whatever it can of its existing satellite technology. The bulk of the debt was incurred because Aussat had the foresight to come to the view that it could participate in the delivery of pay television and as a result that it would be necessary to contract for the B series satellites. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having done that, the Government is still dithering over pay television, which has now been on its agenda ever since it came to office. We are probably somewhat closer to it than we have been in recent times, but a succession of Ministers for clearly political reasons have declined to introduce any form of pay television to date. I think that technological forces  ultimately will overwhelm political resistance and that the Government will be forced to a position where pay television becomes a reality in this country. Once we are in that situation one would expect, but could never take for granted with the way in which the Government politicises these decisions, that the acquirer of Aussat would then be in a position to take advantage of that new market opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is this Bill which brings to an end the Aussat satellite service as we have known it. Aussat has had this debt burden around its neck virtually since its inception in 1981, but in particular since this Government came to office in 1983. That debt burden has never been addressed until the present time, thereby further crippling Aussat's efforts to expand its market coverage. All that happened in that regard is that last year the Government made a decision to provide $100m to Aussat to keep it operational because technically it was almost bankrupt. The directors were not prepared to sign Aussat's accounts unless a decision was made by the Government to ensure that it had a reasonable capital base. Again, it was only when the Government recognised that Aussat was in such desperate financial straits that it was prepared even to bail it out to that extent, but merely as a holding operation. </PARA>
<PARA>  What we see in this Bill is the result of a series of politically flawed and politically motivated decisions, which have resulted in the Government coming up with, at very best, a second-best alternative in terms of restructuring the arrangements for telecommunications services in this country. It is a solution which does not meet any of the recognised criteria for micro-economic reform and one that simply creates a duopoly environment with the potential to compromise the development of a truly competitive telecommunications sector. I suspect that the combination of new technology and the demands of consumers for a much higher quality of service than they have had available to them to date will transform the environment and there will be some significant price offerings by the new carrier. I certainly foresee a much better quality of service than we have had to date from Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has been one of the great disgraces of the history of government business enterprises that an outfit such as Telecom, with the sorts of massive profits it has been able to make year after year, has never felt obliged to take account of customer concerns in any respect. By way of example, in my home State one of the busiest suburban shopping centres is  Burke Road, Camberwell. Saturday morning sees every shop in that shopping strip open for business except the Telecom shop. It, of course, is open only from nine to five. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is exactly what will happen. In other words, people will not be able to get the service they want and the only service that will be available is the one that they do not want. They dial in on the circuit and may then have to listen for five minutes until the item they are interested in comes up. In other words, it is just another example of Telecom being interested in making mindless profits rather than having any real concern for the customers. I hope that this new environment will go some way towards forcing Telecom into the new realities. Hopefully, the new carrier will be able to bring in a whole series of new initiatives which we have not seen in this country to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Aussat Repeal Bill will bring about some significant changes. In many respects, we will still not see the most made of the satellite systems in this country. We will have to await the initiatives of the new carrier in that regard. There is still a great deal of uncertainty about the interconnection arrangements that will apply and operate in relation to the new carrier. That will impact very significantly on the extent to which it is able to make use of the satellite services. Whilst we do not oppose this Bill, I will be moving a second reading amendment, which I understand has been circulated in my name.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My interest in the financial details of Aussat is reasonably well known. It is my belief that the Aussat Repeal Bill 1991, which appropriates $800m to cover Aussat's debts, should come with an apology to the taxpayers of Australia, who are now expected to foot this $800m bill for a service that we did not need and which, we have said in the past, we have had imposed upon us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Having said that, I indicate that the Australian Democrats will be reluctantly supporting the appropriation. I think it is time to get Aussat off the taxpayer's back. We acknowledge that we have lost the major battle. As none of the fundamentals of Aussat's operation have changed and the satellite would only continue to lose money, we think that the burden might as well be passed on to the second carrier. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before I take a moment to put on the record yet again the details of Aussat's history, I want to deal with another matter arising from this Bill. Since the Government first floated its concept of telecommunications micro-economic reform back in 1989, the Minister has argued that the establishment of a telecommunications duopoly was not a front for unburdening the Aussat debt. I have to say that I remain unconvinced by protestations to the contrary. Sure, it was not the only reason, but it was a significant reason for the decision. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first section of this Bill paves the way for Aussat to be sold unencumbered to the second carrier. The second section, dealing with telecommunications, paves the way for the Minister, without parliamentary scrutiny, to arrive at some private agreement over licence conditions with the new carrier, be they complex technical regulations or on the level of foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats are not happy to accept the proposed new section 407 which, if enacted, would allow for the application, adoption or incorporation, with or without notification, of `matter contained in any other instrument or writing whatever'. The theory of what the Government is attempting to do is fine. Certainly, Parliament's time is too valuable for it to be bogged down with changes, adoption and incorporation of technical specifications and regulations, especially in the fast paced area of telecommunications development--and we accept this position. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Government introduced the Telecommunications (Regulatory) Bill exposure draft, consumer organisations and the Minister's advisory panel pointed out that the Bill needed to discriminate between second carrier licence conditions that impact on the lives of the community and those secondary conditions that relate specifically to updating regulation. It was the Minister's decision not to separate the licence conditions into two specific categories or to give them separate priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Senate was faced with allowing the Minister absolute discretion over the determination of the licence conditions, it voted to subject the licence conditions to parliamentary scrutiny. I suspect the Minister may have been slightly annoyed that we had done so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Not Minister Collins; Minister Beazley. I do not object, obviously, to the Government's attempts now to rectify a problem it may have added to in the first place. The Democrats will accept that instruments under this Act may provide for matters by reference to any other instruments. However, we are not happy about what we see as issuing the Government with carte blanche to write any instructions it likes to the new carrier without parliamentary scrutiny, especially since the network carrier licence is watertight and cannot be revoked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills report on this Bill highlights, it is important for people in a democracy to know or to be able to ascertain what the law is. If there is to be scope for, say, international standards to apply `as they are in force from time to time', can the Minister tell us when and how these will be notified to those to whom they apply?</PARA>
<PARA>  Aussat exists because of some bureaucratic wish to dish it up to Telecom Australia and the Telecom unions, right or wrong. However, it must not be forgotten that the decision to launch the first generation satellites was a grandiose vision of the Fraser Government. As early as 1975 the Government of the day was warned by Telecom's predecessor that expensive satellite technology would have been superseded by cheaper telecommunications. It was warned that satellite systems for national applications in a country of Australia's demography and geography were not economic. But did the Government listen?  No. </PARA>
<PARA>  If Aussat had been a commercial enterprise and not simply a matter of expediency or misjudgment, the A-series satellite would never have left Earth. Some eight years and $800m of taxpayers' money later, Aussat has managed to capture less than 2 per cent of Australia's total communications market. Where are the itemised accounts to show which particular drain the $800m fell down? In passing this Bill, I suspect the Government thinks it can bury its mistakes and get away from any focus on its incompetence in managing the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA>  What went wrong with the projections that indicated that between 1989 and 1992 the system should earn sufficient revenue to cover the costs of the first generation satellites and provide a $300m surplus for reinvestment?  The projections were in error because of the assumption that the transponder take-up leases would be very rapid: 100 per cent of the 12 high power transponders by 1986-87 and 100 per cent of the 33 low power transponders by 1989-90, they said. In fact, the actual occupancy was 72 per cent in October 1988.  The assumption of rapid take-up of all transponders seems curiously imprudent. Was it really feasible that 100 per cent of all high power transponders would be yielding standard revenue within one year of satellite launch? This ignores normal marketing margins, particularly given the institutional decision making and technical lead times of users. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1987 financial background briefing which supported the request for tender for the second generation systems also made some outrageous predictions of $15m dividends by 1992-93. The first generation satellite system was not economically viable on any realistic assumptions, but this Government was prepared to give Aussat a Treasurer's guarantee.  Thanks to the work of many, but particularly Dr Sam Paltridge at CIRCIT, we now know that these preposterous occupancy estimates in some ways reflected the heady prospects we saw in television networking and distribution before the industry troubles became visible after the 1987 share market crash. In other words, this Government made precisely the same mistakes as Messrs Skase, Lowy and Bond--and we know what happened to them. But unlike them, this Government has Consolidated Revenue to bail out its mistakes. Instead of using the $800m to do something else with--and people often point to job creation, hospital funding and public sector housing--for our $800m we got what I think is an almost useless piece of space junk. </PARA>
<PARA>  What concerns me is that the full extent of the Government's bad management and lack of supervision is still not known. At Senate Estimates committee hearings earlier this year we tried to ascertain some of this information. I do not believe we were successful; in fact, I think we were fobbed off. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since the sale of Aussat without debt is going to be the entry price for the new telecommunications carrier, it is only right and proper that Australian taxpayers know how Aussat's finances got into such a deep mess. Aussat's original bad planning cannot be laid at this Government's door, that is true, and I am happy to repeat that; but in 1986, when the expensive designed B-series was planned, the Hawke Government could have pointed to the Fraser Liberal Government's folly of pursuing this and walked away with only a minor debt--some suggest less than $100m. It did not, and the Hawke Government compounded the mistake by pouring good money after bad. </PARA>
<PARA>  Against all expert advice, the second generation satellites were commissioned and ordered at a cost of $440m to the taxpayer. Can we now assume that the bid from the new telecommunications carrier will reflect the $800m appropriation we are agreeing to today or is the Government going to base its decision on the second carrier on a broader range of concerns other than strict commercial viability?  After all this time, we are still left wondering what is the true value of gaining entry into Australia's lucrative telecommunications market. The fact that we are still left wondering is clearly most unsatisfactory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Aussat Repeal Bill appropriates $800m to pay out Aussat's outstanding debts and ensures that any new owner cannot claim tax losses. From what Senator Kernot said, it is obvious that she lives in a high population area and not in a remote area where satellite technology is necessary for telecommunications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, since the Aussat satellite was put into action by the Fraser Government its usage and return on capital has not quite come up to expectations, as was ably pointed out by my colleague Senator Alston. Aussat went into action with one arm tied behind its back. There was no way in the world it could compete with either Telecom or anyone else under the conditions on which it was allowed to operate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia is the ideal country for satellite technology. Probably no other country in the world needs satellite technology as much as Australia, with the exception of Canada, with its extensive remote northern region, and Russia, with its enormous area. However, Aussat, with one hand tied behind its back, was not able to make use of the technology available, which was advanced technology at the time. I believe that the Fraser Government made the right decision to put up those satellites in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA>   Then, of course, we had the Telecom fiasco; it made sure the Aussat system did not work. Of course, Telecom in later years was greatly helped by the advent of optic fibre so it did not have to build such expensive landlines as it used to. It was able to completely take over the communications in Australia so many years down the track because of that optic fibre. Unfortunately, that is how things have gone. We are debating this Bill to give Aussat $800m to wipe off those debts. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to move away a little from Aussat into the modern-day light satellite type of system. There was a conception by which Motorola Electronics Australia Pty Ltd and Transfield (Australia) Pty Ltd were to launch some light satellites at Woomera. Last week, as part of a committee, I visited the Woomera area where this opportunity provided by Motorola and the Transfield corporation to launch those light satellites was lost. Unfortunately, without help forthcoming from the present Government, that has gone by the wayside. </PARA>
<PARA>  The idea was to launch, say, 11 in seven bands, making 77 of these light satellites that would virtually then bring us into another phase of mobile communications whereby one could use a cordless phone type of operation in remote areas at any time of the day or night. Of course, that would be much cheaper than the first generation Aussat and the second generation. Unfortunately, in one way or another, the Government failed to realise the opportunity and here we are again with another opportunity having gone out of the door. </PARA>
<PARA>   Of course, we could have gained a lot of export income by carrying on with getting the light satellite system off the ground. I do not believe that we have lost the technology forever though; I believe that other corporations will, in time, come along and take over where Motorola and Transfield left off. I am wondering whether Telecom played a part in Motorola and Transfield not getting off the ground, just like it did with Aussat. </PARA>
<PARA>  While we looked at Woomera last week, I could not help noticing with concern the run-down state of the Woomera rocket launching range. Woomera still has a population of 2,000 people who are in highly skilled professions. It has about 600 Americans living there, servicemen and families, and the Australian construction corps is there as well. I observed from our visit that the Government has certainly let the range run down. I know there are problems because there were some joint ventures with the British Government which has not been too forthcoming in helping to clean up what happened in the past. But I think the Government has to look at getting Woomera back on stage again so that it can be used in the launching of these light satellites. I believe this is a technology that the whole world has to have, not just Australia. Then, we can--whether it is at this place or at the one in north Queensland, at Cape York--launch satellites. The satellites launched at Cape York would be travelling in an east-west direction, whereas the ones launched at Woomera would be the polar ones. </PARA>
<PARA>  I call on the Government to have a good look at Woomera again and see what can be done. I believe that the allocation for this space office was only $5m in the last Budget, as it has been for many years. It is time the Government greatly increased that if we are to make the best of opportunities. As I said, Woomera and Cape York are ideally situated to take part in the coming technology. I support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It has been said in this Parliament on a number of occasions--and it was alluded to by Senator Kernot--that Aussat Pty Ltd was, in fact, the only telecommunications initiative that the previous conservative Government ever did launch. I think it would be fruitless to spend any unnecessary time debating the pros and cons of that decision or indeed what may or may not have affected the final result of Aussat's profitability. I will ensure that Senator Panizza's comments about Woomera are drawn to the attention of the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   In response to Senator Kernot's inquiry about how there will be public dissemination of these changes, that explanation is contained in the letter from the Minister that has been sent to the Chairman of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, Senator Cooney. Point 3 of the letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the Telecommunications Act 1991, Austel's technical standards are disallowable instruments which must be published in the Gazette. Public comment and review form a major part of the process of disseminating information to relevant individuals and organisations on any changes to standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel and various other interested parties are members of CCITT work groups and any changes to international standards are notified to the relevant parties in Australia. Austel would be the main disseminator of such information in its capacity as ITU signatory. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I indicate that the Government will be opposing the second reading amendment moved by the Opposition. Clauses B and C, of course, make the Opposition's motives in moving this very clear. We are well aware of its `let it rip' philosophy so far as telecommunications is concerned. We disagree. We think the staged and careful approach that the Government is proposing to provide competition to Telecom is the appropriate way to go at this period of time. I know and accept that the Australian Democrats do not accept that should be done at all. But we certainly believe that the Opposition's `let it rip' approach is not appropriate for Australia at the current time. For those reasons, we will be opposing the second reading amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the new clauses to be moved by the Government to the Aussat Repeal Bill 1991. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>After clause 5, page 3, insert the following new clauses in Part 2:</PARA>
<PARA>AUSSAT not within the shield of the Crown</PARA>
<PARA>  "5A. To avoid doubt, AUSSAT:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) is not, does not form part of, does not represent, and is not an instrumentality or agency of, the Crown; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) is taken never to have been, formed part of, represented, or been an instrumentality or agency of, the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA>Clarification of AUSSAT's status for income tax purposes</PARA>
<PARA>  "5B. AUSSAT is not, and is taken never to have been, a public authority for the purposes of paragraph 23(d) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.". </PARA>
<PARA>During negotiations with bidders for the sale of Aussat, which are currently under way, doubts have been raised about Aussat's status, both in terms of its relationship with the Crown and as a taxpayer. These doubts are based on the argument that, notwithstanding the fact that Aussat Pty Ltd was incorporated as a company in 1981, the subsequent passage of the Satellite Communications Act 1984--now the Aussat Act 1984--either transformed Aussat into an emanation of the Commonwealth or made it a public authority exempt from income tax under section 23 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. If the doubts are correct, past claims by Aussat under taxation provisions dealing with everyday matters such as trading stock, depreciation, deductibility of expenses and repair costs may at some time be reassessed by the Commissioner of Taxation and disallowed. In addition, claims by third parties arising from arrangements entered into with Aussat on the basis that it is a taxpayer also risk reassessment and disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no question that since Aussat's incorporation it was always the Government's intention that Aussat be a taxpayer and it has always been treated as such by both the Government and the Australian Taxation Office. While the Government's legal advice is that Aussat is probably not an emanation of the Crown, the Attorney-General's Department considers that its tax status under section 23 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 does require clarification. </PARA>
<PARA>  In any event, unless both matters are put beyond doubt now, continuing doubt on the part of bidders for Aussat may impact adversely on the sale price for Aussat as they seek to make provision for the risk of reassessment and disallowance. With the Aussat Repeal Bill currently before the Senate, there is an opportunity to remove this doubt quickly and effectively and with no delay to the Aussat sales process. I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I note that under clause 6 of the Bill Aussat's tax losses, presumably accrued, are not able to be carried forward by the purchaser. What is meant by Aussat never having been a public authority for the purposes of section 23(d) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936? The supplementary explanatory memorandum says that bidders are concerned that they may not obtain the benefit of taxation provisions dealing with trading stock, depreciation, et cetera. Presumably they want to obtain the benefit of certain deductions. If the provisions are not in relation to tax losses, what are they? Are they existing deductions that have already been claimed by Aussat that it is feared might somehow be removed from Aussat in the future?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am advised that there is a difficulty with third parties that have contracted with Aussat in the past on the assumption that Aussat is a taxpayer, which is how it has always been treated by the Government and the Australian Taxation Office. It will not affect the situation that Senator Alston has canvassed. It is simply designed to remove the risk that subsequently the point could be made that Aussat was not a taxpayer. That would open up the possibility, potentially, of putting the past treatment of tax in doubt and perhaps being reassessed by the Taxation Office--if there was a legal determination requiring that--even though the Taxation Office to this point has always been treating it as a taxpayer. It is simply designed to clarify that situation and to put it beyond doubt that Aussat is not tax exempt.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Senate has before it today the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1991, which has arisen as a result of an announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in the Budget Papers. The intent of the Bill is to amend the wholesale sales tax to change the current exemption for certain goods and motor vehicles for use by people with disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition supports the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill. This Bill is based on a report tabled by the Industry Commission on 18 July 1990 entitled Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities. The Minister said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has already made decisions on the Industry Commission Report . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The measures in this Bill deal with the sales tax issues considered in the report. The Bill implements the majority of the Industry Commission proposals but with some variation in detail and extension. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first of the Commission's sales tax proposals is that, in view of the confusion amongst participants as to the rules concerning the sales tax treatment of particular goods, the ATO should publish a leaflet explaining the available sales tax exemptions for people with disabilities and claiming procedures. The ATO subsequently advised the Commission that it was in the process of publishing a leaflet which it intends to distribute widely. I have not come across such a document personally. I would be interested to hear from the Government whether the leaflet is available and the manner in which it has been distributed. Perhaps the answer could be given at the conclusion of this second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commission's second proposal is that exemption on motor vehicles in item 135A be limited to vehicles which cost less than the luxury car threshold under the current income tax arrangements, and that an exemption should not be approved if the person concerned has received an exemption in the previous four years. The Government has taken up the first part of this recommendation, extending it to include items 135 and 135A, but it has not taken up the second part relating to the four years. Items 135 and 135A provide wholesale sales tax exemptions conditional upon the type of user. Item 135 provides exemption for the purchase of motor vehicles to be used by veterans who have lost the use of a leg or both arms. Item 135A concerns vehicles purchased to transport to and from gainful employment persons who have lost the use of one or both legs to the extent that they are permanently unable to use public transport. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a result of this Bill, items 135 and 135A will be renumbered as 135(1) and 135A(1). The Bill does not amend the wording of the former items in any way. Thus, I anticipate that the Australian Democrats will be moving to amend the proviso in item 135A regarding limitation of transport for the purpose of travelling to and from gainful employment. We have yet to see the nature of those amendments, but earlier signals indicated that this was to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA>  Items 135(1) and 135A(1) place a limit on the sales tax exemptions available for new motor vehicles. Sales tax exemptions under these items will be available only for motor vehicles with a wholesale sales value which is equal to or below the luxury motor vehicle threshold of $30,505. For the purpose of these calculations, the sale value is to be the value prior to any modifications required expressly to adapt the motor vehicle to enable the person specified to drive or to be transported in that vehicle. Thus, the limit on sales tax exemption places a cap--that is, a maximum sales tax benefit--on purchased vehicles covered by items 135 and 135A. This cap will be equivalent to the sales tax payable on a motor vehicle with a wholesale sales value equal to the luxury motor vehicle threshold. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind the Senate that in 1991-92 there will be a cap of $6,101, which is the tax payable at the rate of 20 per cent on a motor vehicle with a wholesale sale value of $30,505. Those persons who qualify under item 135(1) and item 135A(1) by buying a vehicle which has a wholesale sale value in excess of the luxury threshold will pay sales tax equal to 30 per cent of the wholesale sale value less the cap amount of $6,101. As a result of this amendment, the financial implications, as estimated by the Government, will be a revenue gain of $0.5m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>  At its initial public hearing, the Commission received evidence from people with disabilities replacing their cars every two years. Using the sales tax exemption to offset the depreciation of the vehicles, they are able to exploit the concession. Thus, in the Commission's view, it saw increasing the period of exemption from two to four years as removing the opportunity to use the concession for unreasonable personal benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has chosen not to pursue this line in this Bill. I would be interested to learn whether it intends to pursue this line at all and its reasons for not pursuing it in this Bill. Many participants in the Industry Commission inquiry called for a broadening of the sales tax exemption to cover certain goods not specifically designed for people with disabilities but considered necessary to enable them to enjoy a more independent lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA>  Participants there argued that this is an unnecessary tax on people with disabilities, that it impacts most heavily on the lower income groups and that it deters people from acquiring goods which would make a significant difference to their independence or well-being by partly ameliorating the effect of their disability. For example, electric beds and hoists were said to be necessary for some people with disabilities, such as those suffering from motor neuron disease, but they are classified as general use goods for taxation purposes. A letter sent by the Australian Taxation Office to a Mrs Lindupp is quoted by the Commission. In its report the Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the Tormo electric adjustable bed offers therapeutic relief for people suffering from spinal problems and other body ailments, it is considered to be goods of a kind ordinarily used by persons not suffering from a disease or disablement. Accordingly, the Tormo electric adjustable bed is taxable . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Lindupps appealed that decision but were told by the ATO that:</PARA>
<PARA>From the literature forwarded by your supplier, the product is designed to provide greater comfort for normally healthy people in addition to use by persons suffering from sickness, disease or disablement . . .   Whilst the bed is distinguishable from a `normal' bed, the distinguishing characteristics--its adjustability--are not expressly designed for disabled people but rather to enhance the bed's general level of comfort--to provide more comfort, less stress, more relaxation and more versatility . . . Item 123 as it is worded is limited in its application by both the use of the word `expressly' in the context of the design and manufacture of the goods and by the qualification to exclude `goods of a kind ordinarily used by persons not suffering from sickness, disease or disablement'. Both of these factors preclude exemption applying to the Tormo bed. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not surprising then that the Industry Commission's third proposal suggested amending wording such that goods `designed and manufactured expressly for use by people with sickness, disease or disablement' had added to them `but occasionally used by others' and goods `not ordinarily used by persons who are not suffering from sickness, disease or disablement' be altered to read goods `of a kind predominantly used by persons with sickness, disease or disablement'. </PARA>
<PARA>  The change of emphasis from comparing the use of goods by healthy people to those who are sick, diseased or disabled, would make a significant difference. Obviously, the Government also felt that there was some cause for change. Hence, in the Bill as originally proposed, paragraph 4(b) omits from subitem 123(1) the second part of a two-part test which goods had to pass in order for them to be included for tax exemption. However, I understand that proposed paragraph 4(b) is to be rescinded by a Government amendment due to a perceived wider impact than originally intended. As a result, this Bill will make no change at all to item 123. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commission's fourth and final proposal arose as a result of several participants requesting that computer equipment required to operate electronic communications aids be exempt from sales tax. These are costly items necessary for profoundly disabled people to ameliorate the effect of their disabilities. The Commission noted that most communications equipment which is specifically designed for people with disabilities is already exempt under item 123. Notwithstanding this fact, it recommended, firstly, limited extension to the list of goods eligible for sales tax exemption by adding, to item 123(1), computer equipment used as or in conjunction with electronic communications equipment where certification is provided by a doctor or a therapist. Secondly, it recommended that a time period should be specified during which the exemption may not be claimed again. </PARA>
<PARA>  The equipment which the Commission recommended this exemption should cover included the computer and other items of related hardware such as the disk drive, the printer and the mouse. This recommendation has not been dealt with by the Government in this Bill. Yet again I seek from the Government's representative an indication whether it is its intention at some stage in the future to address this recommendation. No doubt my colleague Senator Patterson will further this argument. </PARA>
<PARA>  One amendment which the Government has made in this Bill, without any recommendation from the Industry Commission but no doubt with some pushing from some other quarters, is to item 42C. Item 42C currently covers components or parts, such as special foot and hand controls, which are incorporated in a new or second-hand motor vehicle to permit it to be driven by somebody with a disability. It is conditional in that it applies only to goods for use in modifying vehicles. The effect of this Bill, if passed, will be to extend the exemption to include goods to be used in the modification of a motor vehicle solely for the purpose of adapting it for transporting a passenger suffering from a physical impairment. The example given in the explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an exemption would be available for a general purpose tailgate loader or hoist installed in the rear or the side of a second hand passenger van solely to allow access for a passenger in a wheelchair. Similarly, heavy duty springs and materials used to reinforce the floor of the van because of the additional weight would be exempt. Clamps and brackets fitted to the vehicle to hold the wheelchair in place would also be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government anticipates that this last amendment will come as a cost to revenue of $4m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>  Any honourable senator who has familiarised himself or herself with the Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities report and the associated correspondence which has been circulated with regard to this Bill, would be aware of the issue of sales tax exemption for the conversion of vehicles by taxi companies for transporting disabled persons. Despite this issue being discussed at length in the Industry Commission's report, no recommendations arose. It has been put to me that, as a result of this amendment to item 42C of the existing Bill, which will occur as a result of this legislation being passed, the cost of the modifications of vehicles to make them suitable to transport disabled people will now be sales tax exempt and that this exemption applies to vehicles such as taxis as well as to private vehicles. I therefore ask the Minister in charge of the Bill whether this is, in fact, the case. The net cost of the proposed changes in this Bill will be $3m for 1991-92 and $3.5m for a full year. The Bill is said to apply to any taxable dealing that occurs after 3 p.m. on 20 August 1991.  The measures contained in this Bill are designed to remove a number of anomalies in the sales tax treatment of various goods and motor vehicles designed for people with disabilities. The measures are welcome in themselves in that they do improve the operation of a small area of what is, generally speaking, an extremely inefficient and discriminatory wholesale sales tax system. This Bill is only one of many tax Bills that, under this Government, we inevitably seem to pass each year in a vain effort to patch up a very unsatisfactory wholesale sales tax system, particularly in the area of exemption for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commission noted that, for those exemptions that are conditional upon the type of buyer or on the number of items bought, the Australian Taxation Office's administrative costs and the private sector's compliance costs in observing these exemptions are extremely high. High compliance and collection costs are amongst the major problems associated with the wholesale sales tax system generally but more particularly with the income tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission has also made the important point that sales tax exemptions are `not the optimum way to provide assistance to people with disabilities'. Direct cash assistance would be a far more efficient way to compensate people with special needs who are reliant on these goods. However, since we are stuck with the wholesale sales tax system under this Hawke Government, and this system is widely used for social welfare purposes, it is necessary to ensure that sales tax laws operate in the most equitable way possible for people with disabilities and those in other special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  What this Bill really does is to highlight the need for the wholesale sales tax system to be scrapped lock, stock and barrel and be replaced with a broadly based goods and services tax. The wholesale sales tax system has virtually become antiquated and an inefficient means of raising revenue. From our position in politics we recommend the approach of direct assistance that was put forward by the Industry Commission. I therefore move an in principle amendment to the motion for the second reading of this Bill in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>  At end of motion, add ", but the Senate condemns the Government for its ramshackle and inefficient wholesale sales tax system, and its failure to replace it with a fairer, broad-based goods and services tax". </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has increased the amount of revenue raised through sales tax from $3.5 billion in 1982-83 to $9.4 billion last financial year. This figure would have been much higher had it not been for the recession, which has served to depress sales such that sales tax collections last year were down 7.6 per cent on the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The impact of the Government's sales tax grab on households has been particularly severe. Sales tax receipts under the Hawke Government have increased in real terms by 53 per cent per adult since 1982-83, the year it came into office. Of course, average weekly earnings have declined in real terms over that same period. Under the wholesale sales tax system, Australians are significantly worse off than they were in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>  The wholesale sales tax is a hidden consumption tax on the purchases by all Australians. Few consumers are aware of which goods are taxed under this system or at what rate they are taxed. Accordingly, sales tax was described by Tony Thomas in the Business Review Weekly some years ago as `the sneakiest weapon in Treasurer Paul Keating's arsenal'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sales taxes are levies on a narrow range of goods at three separate rates of 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. These differing rates apply to a small range of goods and severely distort production and consumption decisions, particularly because the commodity listings in the rates and exemptions schedules have failed to keep pace with changing consumer preferences. The fact that the Australian Taxation Office was asked to provide special schedules for the purposes of disabilities indicates the confusion in that area for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  Items that were once deemed luxuries and so worthy of a high rate of sales tax are now considered to be necessities for which Australian households are forced to pay through the nose. Although wholesale sales taxes are levies on only a small range of goods, many of these goods are everyday household items which make up a relatively large proportion of a family's weekly budget. Sales taxes are also levied in a highly inequitable way. For example, caviar, mineral water and oysters go untaxed while chocolate biscuits, soft drink and ice-cream are each taxed at one of the various sales tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  The important point is that the trend under the Hawke Government has been for the operation of the wholesale sales tax regime to become even more inequitable, not fairer. Dr Neil Warren, from the University of New South Wales, has examined the changing incidence of Federal indirect taxes since 1975-76 in a paper prepared for the Economic Planning Advisory Council. His conclusions about the changes in the incidence of wholesale tax that have occurred since 1984-85--in other words, under this Government--are particularly damning. His paper concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>The changes to the wholesale sales tax appear to have increased the regressivity of this tax, both through changes to the effective rates of the tax and from changes in other factors. </PARA>
<PARA>This conclusion exposes the hypocrisy of the Government's scare campaign against the coalition's proposal for a broadly based goods and services tax. While the Government has been running around scaring little old ladies and others about the alleged inequities of a goods and services tax when it does not know the full details, it has been hitting those very same people with an alarmingly inequitable sales tax regime and has been significantly increasing sales tax collections year after year. The wholesale tax is also a major burden on Australian businesses which along with households are labouring under the effects of the recession. Sales tax falls heavily on goods that many businesses use in their production processes. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a study entitled `A Broad-based Consumption Tax for Australia' conducted by the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University, it has been estimated that nearly half of all sales tax is levied on intermediate business inputs. In other words, the wholesale sales tax is a significant addition to the costs faced by many businesses. Another 14 per cent is levied on sales of investment goods, adding to the cost of capital growth, while only 37 per cent is paid by final consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>  The same report found that some 10 per cent of the final incidence of the wholesale sales tax, equivalent to about $9 billion, falls on goods for export. This translates into an average export tax of 2 per cent at a time when improved export performance has never been more important. The study concludes with this particular observation:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a general consensus that the wholesale sales tax system has also lost any economic merit it may once have had and remains only as a politically expedient but economically inefficient revenue raiser. </PARA>
<PARA>The Hawke Government stands condemned for ignoring the consensus against the wholesale sales tax system and in favour of a broadbased goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  Every major business organisation one cares to name basically supports a broad based goods and services tax. There has not been a single major newspaper in Australia that has not, at some time in the last 12 months, editorialised in favour of a broad based goods and services tax. The Government deliberately ignores the massive weight of opinion behind the concept of a goods and services tax in favour of what it considers to be an opportunity to launch a shameless scare campaign at the next election and in the interim, based on our proposals for comprehensive tax reform. It is imperative that the wholesale sales tax system be scrapped as part of any attempt to reform the tax system in this country. The coalition is committed to a complete overhaul of the Australian taxation system as part of a much larger package of economic reforms which are designed to return Australia to sustainable economic growth over the longer term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill 1991, which is before the Senate, provides a degree of recognition to the additional costs borne by people with disabilities. The most important benefit people with disabilities will derive from this Bill relates to the extension of the motor transport related exemption from wholesale sales tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Previously, the exemption for modifications was only applicable to those vehicles which were actually being driven by the person with the disability. This Bill will extend this exemption to motor vehicles used to transport people with disabilities. It will mean any modification made to a motor vehicle to be used to transport a person with a disability will be exempt from the payment of wholesale sales tax. My understanding of the Bill is that this exemption applies to the modification of commercially run motor vehicles, such as taxis, as well as privately used vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill will also restrict the sales tax exemption available on the purchase of new motor vehicles for personal transportation of people with certain disabilities in certain circumstances. The total exemption will apply only to vehicles which have a sale value below that which the Government deems to be the sale value of a luxury vehicle. If the unmodified sale value of the vehicle is above the luxury vehicle sale value level of $30,505, which is indexed, two-thirds of the sale value of the vehicle up to the threshold will be exempt from the tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  Previously, an open-ended wholesale sales tax exemption was available on the cost of motor vehicles used to transport certain veterans as well as people who had lost the use of one or both of their limbs. This open-ended exemption applied only in certain very specific circumstances and to certain specified disabilities. A veteran had to be totally and permanently incapacitated, to be blind or to have lost the use of a limb. If the person was not a veteran, he or she had to have lost the use of one or both legs and be unable to use public transport. In the case of a non-veteran, the exemption was available only if the vehicle was used to transport the person with the disability to or from that person's place of work. </PARA>
<PARA>  The wholesale sales tax exemption on the cost of the vehicle, as it is being amended by this Bill, will still apply only in these specific circumstances. It will be available only for work related purposes for non-veterans. It will apply only to people with certain specified disabilities. The only change that is being made in relation to the wholesale sales tax exemption on the unmodified cost of vehicles used for the transport of people with disabilities involves the placing of a cap under which 100 per cent sales tax exemption will apply. This cap is set at a retail value of $45,462. </PARA>
<PARA>  Originally, the Government sought to use this legislation to make a third amendment to the current wholesale sales tax treatment of people with disabilities. This amendment would have removed one of the two tests that a product which is designed and manufactured expressly for people with disabilities would have to satisfy if it were to attract a wholesale sales tax exemption. It would have removed the so-called second test, which required that the goods must not ordinarily be used by persons who are not suffering from sickness, disease or disablement. However, the Government has reneged on this amendment because it is concerned that the removal of the second test would have opened a Pandora's box of sales tax exemptions on everyday goods such as microwave ovens, televisions and fridges. </PARA>
<PARA>  Obviously, the Opposition supports the thrust of the changes that the Government is making in this legislation. The Opposition has always contended that people with disabilities should be provided with real and tangible incentives that will assist them in establishing themselves and remaining actively involved in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition has openly advocated the extension of the mobility allowance to areas of activity which are not related to employment. The coalition policy is based on the premise that people who have disabilities should be encouraged to participate fully in every facet of community life and not just employment. While the Opposition and I remain disappointed that the Government has not seen fit to extend the mobility allowance outside the employment arena, we applaud the increase in the allowance which accompanied the recently legislated disability reform package. </PARA>
<PARA>  When debating this Bill it needs to be recognised that, just as the mobility allowance is a means of providing incentives for people with disabilities through the welfare system, these initiatives are examples of incentives that can be provided through the taxation system. As well as being positive incentives for people with disabilities, these initiatives also recognise the fact that the living expenses of a person with a disability are often higher than those of someone without a disability. Both the mobility allowance and these taxation incentives provide some recognition of the additional financial costs borne by people with disabilities in their employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  While applauding the general thrust of these initiatives, I believe that this Bill raises two very important issues in the ongoing debate about government recognition of the needs of people with disabilities. The first is the vital issue of the extent to which government should subsidise the additional living expenses which emanate from a person's disability. In the last few years there has been the Cass report, the Ronalds report and the inquiry of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, all of which have looked at the financial cost of disability. There is now a departmental inquiry looking at the same issue. From all of these reports, reviews and inquiries, as well as from the State-Commonwealth disability agreement that was signed on 1 July, I sincerely hope that the Government can find a sensible and coordinated approach to the treatment of the additional costs experienced by people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  While this Bill is a step in the right direction, because it recognises some of these costs and provides a degree of incentive to people with disabilities, it does not resolve the central issue. For instance, it fails to resolve whether government subsidisation of the cost of disability should be widened to non-employment related expenses. I believe that the Australian Democrats will move an amendment to extend the wholesale sales tax exemption to vehicles used for reasons that are not employment related. While the coalition is sympathetic towards the wider recognition of the costs of disabilities, we cannot support this amendment because it is absolutely necessary to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the practical and financial implications before such an extension is supported. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill fails to resolve the complex question of what financial benefits the Government should provide through the taxation system to businesses which offer their services to people with disabilities. An obvious example is the modified taxis that transport people with disabilities, particularly those who are restricted to wheelchairs. At present, the owners of these taxis receive no sales tax exemption for either the basic sale value of their vehicles or for any modifications made to them. It is quite valid to argue that these taxis offer a much needed community service to those people with disabilities who often cannot afford to own their own car. </PARA>
<PARA>  With the onset of an ageing, more disabled society, this service will become more and more important. Its growing importance can be measured by the fact that all London taxis are now required to provide wheelchair access. On the other hand, we must also recognise the countervailing equity argument of whether commercial enterprises should be provided with preferential treatment by the Government simply because they manufacture a product or provide a service which is used by people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  My understanding of the effect of this Bill is that the owners of modified taxis will now be able to claim a sales tax exemption on these modifications. To an extent, granting this exemption could set a precedent whereby any costs borne by an enterprise in modifying a product to suit the special needs of people with disabilities could be subsidised by government. I am not saying that that is a good or a bad thing, but it possibly sets a precedent. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second major question that this Bill raises is whether the wholesale sales tax system is an appropriate and practical means through which the Government can recognise the additional expenses that are borne by people with disabilities. This Bill does not come to grips with the general question of whether goods that are manufactured specifically for and used by people with disabilities should attract a wholesale sales tax exemption under the sales tax Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the 1990 report titled Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities, the Industry Commission alluded to the problem of goods required by people with disabilities that are classified as `general use' goods for taxation purposes; for example, the Tormo electric adjustable bed. I will not go into the detail of that because my colleague Senator Watson outlined it most ably and in very great detail. The argument that is put forward to extend the sales tax exemption to the Tormo bed can be made in relation to items such as computers, as Senator Watson said, air conditioners and other equipment which is required by people with disabilities if they are to have the opportunity to lead a normal and fulfilling life. </PARA>
<PARA>  In an attempt to solve the problems of people with disabilities not being able to claim important material aids such as the Tormo bed, the Government sought to do away with the sales tax Act requirement that goods must not ordinarily be used by people with disabilities. However, it has now reneged on this proposal because of the loopholes that it would have opened up. By maintaining the status quo, the Government has refused to recognise that many items which may be considered luxury items for people without a disability may well be necessities for someone who has a disability. </PARA>
<PARA>  By dropping the amendment, the Government has admitted that it is unable to solve this problem by way of the current ramshackle wholesale sales tax system except by opening up another myriad of anomalies and inequities. The clear message from the Government's back-down on the removal of this exemption requirement is that the unfair, anomalous and unintelligible wholesale sales tax system is not an appropriate mechanism through which to recognise the additional cost borne by people with disabilities. Thankfully, this silent tax, to which Senator Watson referred and which has crept up on unsuspecting Australians and increased almost threefold since 1983 to $10 billion, would be abolished by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is a matter that is not talked about. Labor mentions the imposition of a goods and services tax, but those opposite do not mention a reduction in personal income tax and the abolition of a wholesale sales tax, or ways of ensuring that people in lower income brackets, on fixed incomes or in receipt of welfare will not be disadvantaged. None of those things is talked about. We hear only that there will be another tax--not about tax reform in toto. Fortunately, after the next election this ramshackle wholesale sales tax will disappear and a more equitable and just tax system will be put in place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Today we are debating the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1991. Once more the Senate participates in the annual ritual following a Federal Budget of tinkering with our outdated, unjust form of consumption tax--the wholesale sales tax. It is true that this year we are simply ratifying a very minor and generally beneficial adjustment, but the significance of the Bill lies in the fact that it changes so little.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We were very hopeful that the Government would take up some of the issues that we have now been raising for many months about the punitive nature of the wholesale sales tax, the tax on exports and the tax on business inputs. But the Government has refused to bite the bullet and has taken the soft option. The coalition is not opposed to the exemption from sales tax of a range of goods purchased by disabled Australians. However, we register our opposition to a system that is subject to continual adjustment in legislation and where, once again, the Hawke Labor Government has avoided necessary reform. It is at times like this that we should all remember the words of the former Treasurer on 5 June 1985:</PARA>
<PARA>  It is now well recognised that the Australian tax system is unfair. It is also widely appreciated that it encourages inefficiency and is extraordinarily complex. Clearly there is a need for action: for reform. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said by the then Treasurer, Mr Keating. He claimed that the current taxation system was unfair, that it needed reform, that it was inefficient and extraordinarily complex. We have agreed--and for nearly two years now Dr Hewson has offered this Government bipartisan support to reform the tax system, to take away the unfairness, to clear up the inconsistencies and inefficiencies and to make it less complex--that we should have a real reform package. But this Government has walked away from that offer time and again. Obviously, it is up to the coalition to do it and to do it on its own, and to make sure that Australia has a tax system that the former Treasurer was hoping for on 5 June 1985. </PARA>
<PARA>  With regard to the former Treasurer's wonderful words back in 1985, the rest is history. The Hawke Labor Government missed its own declared opportunity for reform of indirect tax in 1985 and will now resort to cheap politicking. It was the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who in February 1985 said that income tax marginal rates were too high, that they created disincentive and must be brought down through `a substantial increase in indirect taxation'. Of course, he has done that: he has increased dramatically the indirect taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other component of dramatically reducing levels of personal income tax has not been brought about. He has the bonus of increasing the hidden consumption tax, the wholesale sales tax system, but he has not given one cent to the hardworking PAYE taxpayer and he has not given any compensation packages to those on welfare. But, as my colleague Senator Patterson said a moment ago, the Government has had the temerity to have sales tax at the level of nearly $10 billion a year. But has this Government given any compensation to anybody? The answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before somebody from the Government side of the Senate has the gall to say that certain levels of personal income tax have been reduced, let me make the point crystal clear that those opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that they have given reductions in personal levels of income tax to offset the dramatic increases in sales tax and then also say that they agreed to those reductions in personal levels of income tax in lieu of wage increases--another grubby little deal done with the ACTU and Mr Kelty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Bolkus can only have it one way; he cannot have it both ways. Did this Government decrease personal income tax levels as a trade-off for wage increases or to offset the increased burdens of wholesale sales tax? Senator Bolkus does not know the answer because he is tax illiterate, but that is understandable. It is now more than six years since the Prime Minister said that personal levels of income tax had to be reduced, and over three million taxpayers are paying marginal rates of 38 per cent or more once they earn more than the princely sum of $20,700 a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It was not so many years ago that before taxpayers paid the top marginal rate of income tax they had to be earning some 14 times average weekly earnings. But now people have to earn only about 1 1/2 times average weekly earnings before they are on the top marginal rate of taxation. Surely that indicates that there is something wrong with Australia's tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australians are also spending between $2.8 billion and $3.8 billion just for the compliance costs of personal income tax, as much as 11 per cent of total revenue, yet this legislation reminds us that in one respect the Prime Minister did carry through his undertaking in February 1985 by making sure that we all paid far more indirect tax. Since this Government came to office, its receipts from wholesale sales tax have risen dramatically. Unreformed sales tax, because of its lack of visibility and the comparative ease of legislative manipulation, has been a valuable source of revenue at the expense of the economic health of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government and the media have the audacity to say to us, `Will you give a commitment never to increase the goods and services tax once you bring it in?'. Members of the Government never ask themselves, and the media never asks this Government, `Will you never increase the wholesale sales tax system again, as you have done over the past eight years?'. Up until the last Budget the Labor Government had increased it by 206 per cent. An increase of 206 per cent in hidden consumption taxes is a fair increase, yet those opposite still say to us, `Will you ever increase it?'. The difference is that, if ever we increase the goods and services tax by 0.1 of a percentage point, the whole world will know about it. The Labor Government has managed to increase it, up to the last Budget, by 206 per cent and virtually no-one has known about it. Most in the Australian community still do not know what they are paying in hidden consumption taxes. This Government has been able to increase it on many goods that were previously untaxed, and still members of the community do not know about it. Why does this Government not come up front and say, `We also will do what the Prime Minister and the Treasurer said back in 1985: we will have a fair tax system and take away the inefficiencies and complexities'?</PARA>
<PARA>  In considering this Bill, we should take note of the Budget Papers as they concern sales tax. As I said before, it is a fact that receipts for 1990-91 total $9.4 billion rather than the projected $10.6 billion from last year. It is highly significant that, among the reasons given for reduced sales of goods, a clear indication of the effects of the recession we had to have is a shift away from items on which 30 per cent tax is paid, because people simply have not been able to afford to buy goods. The recession has hit the purchasing power of ordinary Australians and they simply have not been able to buy the goods they would otherwise have bought. Another reason given is the failure of the 1990-91 experiment of a 50 per cent punitive rate on luxury vehicles. We said from the word go that it would not work, and it did not work. Such a manipulation of indirect taxation is ultimately self-defeating in its effect on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>  While this Labor Government continues to oppose the reform of indirect taxation, $5 billion continues to be paid on business inputs. The Government had opportunities in the March statement and in the August Budget to review the huge cost of $5 billion on business inputs, but it has chosen not to do so. Australians are entitled to ask: how deep is Labor's commitment to economic recovery and export growth with exports carrying a sales tax burden of $1 billion per annum? The Government had an opportunity to change that and has walked away from it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our trading partners do not have such an imposition on their exports. Is it any wonder that we are not competitive? Is it any wonder that our balance of payments continues to be a problem, that we are importing more than we are exporting? This Government is determined to make sure that it imposes its hidden consumption tax on exports to the tune of $1 billion. Under a coalition government, the taxes on both business inputs and exports would be removed along with the wholesale sales tax. They would be replaced by a broad-based goods and services tax. Business would be able to flourish. Exports without a tax attached to them would be more attractive to overseas buyers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Telecom, an institution that Labor professes to support, paid $375m as a conservative estimate in sales tax on its capital equipment purchases in 1990-91, including $346m on plant and equipment and $24m on motor vehicles. Under the coalition's goods and services alternative, the goods and services tax that replaces the sales tax paid on such equipment will be rebatable; thus, the consumer will no longer be picking up the hidden tab for $375m, amounting to $50 a year for Telecom's eight million subscribers. Every subscriber of Telecom pays an additional $50 just to cover the cost of sales taxes paid by Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>  We hear enough from the Australian Labor Party about those who are supposedly evading tax, but in one more Budget it does nothing to combat the cash economy, estimated at $40 billion, through the means of a broad-based goods and services tax such as the one the coalition is advocating. Labor periodically tries to convince us that it cares about small business, yet once again it leaves in place a sales tax designed for administration by larger business. Business pays the price of holding costs for stock on which sales tax must be paid. Having come from the business sector, I know what an impost that is. </PARA>
<PARA>  When one buys goods and 21 days later has to pay the sales tax on them, invariably one has to borrow the money to buy the goods in the first place. Many companies borrow the money to pay the sales tax, and they are paying interest on the borrowings for both. The goods may well sit in the warehouse for many months, not sold, but business has already paid the sales tax and the Government already has its money. That would all change under a coalition government. The coalition would have businesses at least buy their products, sell them and collect the tax before they had to remit it to the Government. Businesses would have collected much of the tax before their returns were necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>  In contrast, the goods and services tax of the Liberal and National parties will give business a positive cash flow advantage through the lag between collection of the goods and services tax and the submission of returns. We have just seen an example of wishful or, one might say, muddled thinking by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) when he told Parliament that sedans and motorcycles used primarily in farming were sales tax exempt. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is exactly right. As my colleague Senator Panizza says, he would not have the faintest idea of what he was talking about. Most farmers would say, `If only it were true'. Only certain four-wheel drives and specialist bikes are exempt. The fact is that most necessary items used on farms, such as vehicles, are not manufactured specifically for agriculture and are therefore taxable. Only this idiotic system of sales tax would exempt a chainsaw from sales tax if it were to be used only for cutting fence posts and not for clearing fallen timber. There is another anomaly, just like the other crazy anomalies at the moment whereby a pornographic magazine can be tax-exempt, yet 20 per cent has to be paid for a baby's teething ring. How much more absurd does the situation have to get?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The coalition is glad that disabled Australians will pay less for some necessary items under this Bill, but I remind the Senate that this Bill and the whole Budget will still result in Australians paying 30 per cent tax on television sets; 20 per cent on tool boxes, cassettes, talcum powder, detergent, pet food, tourist maps, bicycles and aluminium foil; and 10 per cent on all household furniture, toasters, cutlery, linen and bathroom fittings. This is from a government that says that we do not have a consumption tax. It is rot!</PARA>
<PARA>  We have the most insidious form of consumption tax, which goes on and on and spreads its tentacles throughout the whole community. The selection is totally random, but what all these items have in common is that they are necessities to a great cross-section of Australian families. Indeed, 72 per cent of the gross sales of goods subject to sales tax is at the 20 per cent rate. In 1989-90, Western Australians paid $400 per head in sales tax, a contribution of $650m to tax revenue. That is in addition to their super-high levels of personal income tax. Of this, $211m was collected on vehicles and parts; $42m on machinery; $34m on building materials and tools; $35m on furniture; and $25m on household appliances and furnishings. This all comes from a government that says that we do not have a consumption tax, but we do. It is known as the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even those foodstuffs on which sales tax is not directly paid have their price affected by its application to the transport system that delivers them and the packaging around them. Even so minor an alternation to the sales tax as in this Bill is another reminder that Australia is overdue for indirect tax reform and a change towards consistency and logic. It is absurd for this Government to say that the less well-off will be worst hit under a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  The more well-off people can quite easily get on a plane, travel first-class to anywhere in Australia and not pay tax. They can stay in five-star accommodation and not pay tax. They can go for a harbour cruise and not pay tax. They can go to the opera and not pay tax. They can have a wonderful meal at a gold plate restaurant and not pay tax. But a less well-off guy buys a motor vehicle and pays 30 per cent tax. If he buys a four-wheel drive, he will probably pay 40 per cent tax. If he buys a caravan, he will pay 30 per cent tax. The tyres have a tax of 30 per cent on them. If the television is his form of entertainment and not the opera, he pays 30 per cent on that. Instead of having a meal at a gold plate restaurant and paying no tax, he will sit in front of his television with a can of Coke, on which there is a 10 per cent tax, and a bag of potato crisps, on which there is another 10 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  Is it right that we do not have a consumption tax at the moment? No, it is not. It is about time this tax system was reformed and that Australia had an opportunity to have a fair and equitable tax system that makes sure that all Australians pay less tax and that it is not just the PAYE taxpayers who are hounded to the ground. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill proposes to implement some sales tax decisions announced in the Budget. There were originally three matters dealt with in the Bill which concern the exemptions available to disabled people in respect of goods used in modifications of motor vehicles to transport disabled people, goods designed and manufactured expressly for people with disabilities, and new motor vehicles purchased by disabled people. However, the Government amended the Bill in the other place to remove the proposed modification to subitem 123(1), which is the general exemption provision for goods designed and manufactured expressly for people with disabilities. I will return to this matter later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Currently, an exemption is available for goods used to modify a motor vehicle for driving by a disabled person. The law is to be liberalised by allowing an exemption for goods used to modify a motor vehicle to transport a disabled person. This is a very worthwhile initiative and it has the full support of the Australian Democrats. In addition, the Bill proposes to exempt from tax that part of the value of a motor vehicle purchased by a disabled person or veteran which relates to modifications made to the car to transport the disabled person. The Australian Democrats strongly agree with this measure but think that it should be extended. Again, I will be moving some amendments to achieve this in the committee stage of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second amendment that I will be moving deals with the modification of motor vehicles to transport disabled people. The Bill does address this topic, but only in a limited way. The Bill exempts from sales tax the goods used to modify a motor vehicle for disabled people. We completely agree with this provision, and I think support for it is unanimous in this chamber. However, where a significant structural alteration is made to a motor vehicle, that process is considered to be manufacturing and is therefore subject to sales tax at the rate of 20 per cent. Senator Patterson, who spoke earlier on this Bill, stated that she believed that modifications such as those made to taxis by firms such as SPV were to be made exempt by this Bill. I do not believe this is correct. I am not criticising her for saying that; this is a particularly complex law. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no doubt that serious structural alterations of cars to allow for the transportation of disabled people are taxable at 20 per cent and that tax applies to both the goods used in the modification and the labour and other costs associated with the modification. This has been confirmed to me by Australian Taxation Office staff. Indeed, the Taxation Office treats such modifications relatively generously by imposing sales tax only on the value of the modifications made instead of on the total value of the modified motor vehicle. I commend the Tax Office for this approach. However, we believe that such modifications should be exempt from sales tax altogether. It appears that the Opposition agrees with this exemption and that it may have misunderstood the actual situation. I ask Senator McMullan to confirm this for the record. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also thought that such modifications were all to be made exempt by this legislation, although we now know that further amendments are needed. Paragraph (3) of subclause 4(c) of the legislation provides an exemption only for modifications to vehicles to which items 135 and 135A of the first schedule apply; that is, no exemption is available to a taxi company which modifies its vehicles in this manner. I ask Senator McMullan to confirm this for the record as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  My second amendment also contains a related proposal to insert into the principal Act a new section 6AG, which will exempt from tax altogether a motor vehicle which has been modified for transporting disabled people where the cost of such modification exceeds the tax that otherwise would have been payable on the new motor vehicle if that new vehicle had not been modified. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has not been possible for us to cost the two proposals contained in our second amendment, but we think they would be minimal--probably less than $1m per year. There is no way that they can be rorted by the general public. I apologise for the fact that our amendments have not yet been distributed. There are some obvious reasons why this has happened. The Opposition might like to move for an adjournment of the debate to give it time to consider our proposals, because I think it misunderstood the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Interestingly, the suggestions concerning the broadening of the existing exemptions came from the Government. They were not amongst the recommendations of the Industry Commission Inquiry into Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities. The amendments address the fundamental question for disabled people, and that is one of access to transportation. It is this principle which should be paramount in all our law making in the area of tax concessions for the disabled. This is why I am again putting forward a further amendment to the existing exemption provision, which I will deal with more fully in the committee stage. The amendment proposes to remove the current limitation that disabled people may buy a car exempt from sales tax only if they use that car to get to and from work. The other amendment in the Bill seeks to limit the currently unlimited exemption which applies to the purchase of new motor vehicles by certain disabled people. Item 135 provides an exemption for the purchase of cars used by veterans who have lost the use of an arm and a leg or both arms. </PARA>
<PARA>  Item 135A provides an exemption for the purchase of cars for transport to and from work for disabled people who are not able to use public transport. The Bill proposes to limit the exemption to those cars which are non-luxury; that is, those with a retail value below $45,000. This appears to us a reasonable proposition. There is justification for the Government to assist disadvantaged people with access to services such as cheaper transport but not to luxury services. However, we would argue that all tax exemptions on new car purchases should be examined using a similar criterion. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a variety of organisations which are still entitled to unlimited sales tax exemptions, such as universities, Commonwealth, State and local government departments and the Reserve Bank. The Australian Democrats believe that these exemptions should be retained, but we believe that they should be similar to those proposed for disabled people; that is, the other organisations currently entitled to an unlimited exemption should also be subject to an exemption cap in respect of luxury motor vehicles. This exemption is currently valued at $6,106. This should boost the non-luxury car market, the bulk of which is supplied by local industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission report dealt with a large number of issues apart from sales tax, such as an exemption from import duty for wheelchairs, which the Government implemented on 1 January 1991. The report's recommendations are slightly different from the Government's proposals. Firstly, the Commission recommended that a further sales tax exemption be granted in respect of certain communication equipment purchased by disabled people. This has not been acted on by the Government because it claims the proposal was too imprecise and that the target group was not sufficiently well identified by the Industry Commission. It has not been rejected by the Government but it has been referred to the disability task force for further consideration. I ask Senator McMullan to inform the Senate what progress, if any, has been made in respect of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, the Commission recommended that the exemption for luxury vehicles be terminated completely, whereas a fixed rate of exemption of over $6,000 is proposed for future luxury vehicle purchases. That is, the Bill is much more generous in its treatment of a luxury car purchase than the Industry Commission recommended. The reason for this departure has not been adequately explained by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another recommendation by the Industry Commission was to alter the existing practice of allowing a disabled person or veteran to purchase a motor vehicle exempt from sales tax every two years to allowing an exemption only every four years. Whilst we are not advocating the proposal, the Government has not explained why this recommendation was rejected. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commission also recommended an alteration to the wording of the general exemption for goods designed and manufactured especially for disabled people. This was picked up by the Government. However, the proposed amendment to subitem 123(1) was removed from the Bill. The Government has apparently been advised that a significant loophole would have been created if the proposed amendment had been proceeded with. The Australian Democrats have previously moved an amendment to achieve this objective, and we are concerned that the existing provision is still too complex and too restrictive in its application. Again, I ask Senator McMullan to explain what further action the Government intends to take to rectify this problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reaction to the Budget announcements from the disabled groups within the community was very positive. Disabled Peoples International (Australia) congratulated the Government on the Budget initiatives. It is disappointed at the Government's amendment, which maintains the status quo. However, it expressed concern that an exemption that is designed to benefit people with disabilities should not be abused and should not be available to people without disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  One method of tackling the problem of modifying goods to gain exemption would be to introduce a general anti-avoidance provision into the sales tax legislation. This has been a longstanding policy of the Australian Democrats, and I hope the Government will consider this in its review of the tax. Such a measure would also attack other tax minimisation schemes and would yield significant revenue to the Government.  The Australian Democrats support this legislation, although we propose to try to improve upon it in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also refer to the Opposition's second reading amendment, which calls upon the Senate to condemn the Government for the existing wholesale sales tax system and to introduce a goods and services tax. There is a real inconsistency here. The Bill deals with amendments to exemptions from sales tax, exemptions that exist to assist the most vulnerable people in the community. The Opposition supports this legislation, yet it will not be providing any exemptions in its proposed new tax, and that is the inconsistency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I support my colleagues who have spoken on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill, which deals with exemptions for vehicles altered for disabled people, a measure the coalition supports. With regard to the so-called luxury tax threshold, I should like Senator Kernot to define a luxury vehicle. No-one else seems to know what it is. The Government set a level of $30,505 wholesale or $45,462 retail above which anything would be classed as a luxury vehicle. However, there is no definition of a luxury vehicle. There is merely a 30 per cent sales tax on any vehicle above the $30,505 wholesale price.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  During the last election campaign, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) introduced on the run a super-jealousy sales tax of 50 per cent on those vehicles to finance the black spots, as they are known, on roads, mainly in New South Wales. The Government saw the folly of its ways because, rather than increasing its sales tax take, that measure decreased it. So the Government made the best of a bad job and eliminated that tax some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is a luxury vehicle?  Other vehicles, whether passenger vehicles, utilities or trucks, are taxed at 20 per cent. I believe that this is an additional tax. Why should a car worth $30,505 attract a higher rate of tax? I wish someone could define such a vehicle. Aside from the jealousy tax aspect, all I can see is that it is a tax on high class engineering. The better engineered cars, that is, those cars that are safer in a roll-over or whatever, tend to be in that price of over $30,000 wholesale or $45,000 retail. </PARA>
<PARA>  Four-wheel drive vehicles are necessary in remote areas. I do not know of a decent four-wheel drive passenger vehicle that comes in at much under $45,000. It is a necessity; it is a safety vehicle, yet it attracts a 30 per cent tax. I cannot understand it. This is a tax on safety. The Government imposed it as a jealousy measure, but no-one has explained the reason for keeping that tax differential. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unless my memory fails me, quite a few other sales tax measures that were announced in the March statement have not seen the light of day. I should like the Government to inform me when those measures will come through. The Government got the kudos for what it said in that March statement it was going to do, but a lot of the legislation seems to have been forgotten. I believe that sales tax is the wrong way to go. The goods and services tax would be a better way to go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Brownhill is well aware of the situation in country areas, where four-wheel drive vehicles are needed for safety. I believe that they are needed for safety even in the high density traffic of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth, but particularly in the bush. However, if one tries to set oneself up in a safety mode, one is taxed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Senator Kernot mentioned early in her speech that the Australian Democrats believe that there should be a cap on the threshold for sales tax exempt vehicles. There are a lot of categories where sales tax on vehicles can be exempt, including exemptions for persons who are incapacitated, exemptions for schools and universities, as Senator Kernot pointed out, and exemptions for bodies such as the Reserve Bank of Australia and public transport authorities. To the present moment I have no argument with this, but it may be different under a goods and services tax. But she was saying that we had to have a cap on some. I presume that she meant the cap of $45,000. These exempt ones, or the ones which may be exempt, are mainly used in agriculture and in mining. They are the ones. </PARA>
<PARA>  How can anyone tell me that one can have for use in a mining site a reasonable sort of four-wheel drive vehicle that comes under that figure? If one needs a four-wheel drive on a mining site or a pastoral lease it has to be a substantial vehicle. Is a person then going to get under that threshold and not pay sales tax by running a two-wheel drive Commodore utility around the mine site? I wish the Australian Democrats would answer this question. </PARA>
<PARA>  More so, I wish they would tell the mining, pastoral and agricultural industries exactly what they mean by that statement. It is all very well to make a bland statement that there should be a cap on the allowable sales tax exemptions on vehicles. One just cannot buy under that cap a decent vehicle that will stand up to the rigours of a mining site, a pastoral lease or a farm developed 100 years, for that matter. One would only get a toy in its place. I wish the  Democrats would tell those industries exactly what they mean. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, I believe the goods and services tax is the only way to go. At least it is straightforward and is at one rate. Everyone knows how it is going and what it is on. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Watson, Senator Knowles and Senator Patterson very ably pointed out the advantages of the goods and services tax as against the out of kilter sales tax. We need a total reform of the tax regime if we want to get Australia moving again. We know that, despite the balance of trade figures trotted out the other day by the Government which tell us we are out of the recession. Are we out of the recession just because exports went by up one per cent? The balance of trade figures look better because the Government has removed any hope the Australian consumer has of being able to afford to pay for any imported goods. If one looks at those figures more closely, one will find out that non-importation in the month of August was because machinery used in the transport and resource sectors, the mining sector, was not imported because we cannot afford the machinery. This Government will not allow resources to get off the ground to use that machinery. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know I have digressed a bit, Mr Deputy President, but that is the situation. We need a total tax reform if Australia is to get moving again. To the uninitiated, those balance of trade figures may look very well on paper, but do they stand up to scrutiny?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill probably epitomises the problems that lie with the whole of the wholesale sales tax system which we call, and I call, `the Government's own GST; the Government's secret tax'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Here we have it, a two-page Bill. To accompany it, we have a 12-page explanatory memorandum. Not only that, we have a supplementary explanatory memorandum. In other words, what is set out to be supposedly a simple amendment to a very complex form of legislation has pages and pages to attempt to explain what is meant by the Bill itself. </PARA>
<PARA>  Is it any wonder then that we have hundreds of public servants who spend all day every day trying to deliberate upon what is meant by things that are covered, things that are exempt and whether it does or does not fit a category? Indeed, when one reads exactly what the Bill says, one realises what a complicated, illogical and inequitable form of taxation it is. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us take a look at some of the things that it says. It says that currently many cars are taxed at a 20 per cent rate under the fourth and fifth schedules of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935. Then there are those vehicles classified under subitem 61(1) of the second schedule which are luxury vehicles and are subject to a 30 per cent rate. The threshold for what is a luxury vehicle is determined by a formula, set out in 61(2) of the second schedule. But it does not end there. This formula is determined with reference to the current motor vehicle depreciation limits under section 57AF of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Once that calculation occurs, those vehicles exceeding the threshold are subject to a 30 per cent sales tax, while those vehicles below or equal to the threshold attract a 20 per cent rate. </PARA>
<PARA>  One could be forgiven for saying that that sounds pretty much like gobbledegook. But it gets worse. There are exemptions for those vehicles above the threshold and thus attracting the 30 per cent rate. Subitem 61(3) of the second schedule provides that subitem 61(1) does not apply to vehicles specially fitted out for transporting people with disabilities while seated in wheelchairs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then, to complicate this further, there are the changes that are brought about by the Bill itself. Clause 3 of the Bill inserts a new 6AE in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act to provide that sales tax is not payable on a proportion of the sale value of certain motor vehicles for people with disabilities. Clear?</PARA>
<PARA>  Clause 4(c) of the Bill amends items 135 and 135A of the first schedule to provide new paragraphs which provide that the exemption is no longer available for vehicles above the threshold. For these purposes the sales value will be reduced by the value of certain modifications to enable a person with a disability to drive or be transported in the vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, clause 5 amends subitem 61(3) of the second schedule to apply the same treatment to motor vehicles specifically fitted out for transporting disabled persons while seated in wheelchairs where those vehicles are in use by certain veterans and the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA>  Pardon me for reading that diatribe on the complexities of the Bill, but expecting the ordinary citizen to comprehend that and then apply it in a logical or equitable manner is asking too much. </PARA>
<PARA>  Such is the complexity of legislation, which raises $10 billion a year out of $90 billion raised by way of taxation revenue. But the really staggering figure is that we raise $50 billion of the $90 billion by way of personal income tax--right out of the taxpayer's pocket. It comes out at source, with the exception of those poor people who have to pay provisional tax when the tax man usually gets the benefit of the taxpayers' money for 12 months before he deigns to give it back as a refund at the end of the year. Quite clearly, the tax mix is wrong. Quite clearly, the incentives to save are negative and the incentives to spend are positive. Quite clearly, there is a need to move away from direct taxation and towards indirect taxation, but by a fair, equitable and clearly understood method. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our proposals are about tax reform: to lessen the amount of direct income tax that is paid and to use more fairly and equitably an indirect tax, which we call a goods and services tax. But first we would abolish the cumbersome wholesale sales tax. It is interesting to look at the evidence that we gleaned from the Estimates Committee hearings. When the Department of the Treasury appeared before Estimates Committee A--we are yet to have the joy of the Australian Taxation Office--we discovered two things. On the instruction of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), the Treasury has developed a model. It is a model through which it can test the costs which the Opposition says are associated with the goods and services tax, and how it will impact upon the economy. In other words, the Treasury admitted to Senate Estimates Committee A that it was constructing a model for party political purposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is exactly what they said. Furthermore, it may well be because they felt incensed that they are being made to do paid party political work that, when I asked for all the reports which had been commissioned by the Tax Office into the wholesale sales tax--surprise, surprise--I actually got them. That was a truly memorable occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Having ascertained that the Australian Tax Office had spent some $5m of taxpayers' money on consultancy fees in the last financial year, and having ascertained that one report by Quantum Market Research--which was a survey--cost $75,497, when I read the report I found that in it there was evidence which indeed showed that the only way to solve the taxation problems of this economy was to move to a broad-based consumption tax. I will read from that report. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>There appears to be a range of complexities and rulings which make compliance with the sales tax laws quite difficult. It was in this context that a number of respondents during the initial research stage saw the ultimate solution as being the introduction of a consumption tax rather than a modification of the current system. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on further to say that nearly one-third of survey respondents were experiencing at least some degree of difficulty with compliance under the sales tax system. It said that the major causes of difficulty associated with compliance were difficulties in determining the appropriate calculations to be made and the level of taxes paid, given variable rates and exemptions; rules which were seen to be confusing, difficult to follow, hard to understand and overcomplicated; imprecision in tax guidelines; difficulties experienced in obtaining sales tax exemptions; and the time and paperwork associated with compliance under the system. </PARA>
<PARA>  When asked to comment on particular problems with the sales tax system, respondents again referred to the matters listed above and, in addition, mentioned problems associated with the timing of the tax payments in relation to cash flow. In other words, when retailers were obliged to pay the wholesale sales tax it was often the case that they had to go to the bank to get a loan--on which they paid high interest rates, forced upon this economy by this Government--in order to pay their tax. They would not get that money back until they finally made a sale for the particular goods on which tax was incurred. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the other hand, our value added type of system would mean that those same retailers would be able to get a refund of the tax that had been paid at the previous level up front, irrespective of when or if they finally sold that particular item. In other words, to small business it will mean an increase in cash flow--a direct benefit to the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  But no doubt Mr Secretary will come back and say that somehow I have misinterpreted this report for which the taxpayers have paid $75,000. Indeed, when Mr Secretary attempts to use that curious argument--and we will have an opportunity to look at it more thoroughly on Friday--we will be able to analyse just why he thinks he is able to spend $75,000 of taxpayers' money and then treat it with contempt. In other words, if it does not suit the Government's political purposes, the money is deemed wasted. That is the way this Government responds. </PARA>
<PARA>  The final details of the survey will help us to understand. The survey was mailed to 3,900 people and 964 interviews were conducted. The survey was across all sections of business:  42 per cent were small businesses employing fewer than five employees, 41 per cent employed between five and 20 employees, and 17 per cent employed more than 20 employees. Overall, 73 per cent were family concerns. The survey came in two parts:  qualitative and quantitative. When asked whether they felt that the taxation system worked equally across all types of business, nearly half--45 per cent--of respondents said this was not the case, 26 per cent declined to comment, and only 29 per cent felt that the tax system was working with equity. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind Mr Secretary that of those surveyed only 29 per cent of people--less than one-third--felt that the current tax regime was equitable. Those involved in retailing were relatively strong in their belief that some businesses were being disadvantaged. The survey further found that the major area of commitment was to a perceived disadvantage of small business versus large companies, particularly in their access to professional advice on tax minimisation. It is well to remember that when that interesting document, the tax guide, was first published the number of people who used, or were forced to use, a tax agent rose to 70 per cent. In other words, many taxpayers took one look at the tax guide and it frightened them to death. They went straight off to their tax agent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Quite clearly, the cost of the need for complicated legal and accounting advice adds to the overall cost of doing business. The survey further found that larger businesses could afford expert advice on tax matters. On the other hand, the impact on small businesses was primarily negative in terms of cash flow, time involvement and incentive to effort. The survey stated finally that, `The real solution to the complexities is the introduction of a consumption tax'. That was most important information revealed by the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are many and varied reasons why it is necessary to have tax reform. Our package seeks to reduce the rate of marginal tax rates--that is, reduce the dependency on direct taxation--and abolish the wholesale sales tax and replace it with the goods and services tax, understanding that there is now a tax component in every item we deal with. If one averages it out one will find that it is about 7 per cent on every transaction. Even in baby food and bread there is a tax component, because only things which are an aid to manufacture--as defined by rulings of the Tax Commissioner--are exempt. Once they get into the transportation and wholesaling areas they are no longer exempt. </PARA>
<PARA>  So the fork-lift that might be tax-exempt in the baby food factory has tax paid on it when it is in the warehouse moving the same baby food around for purposes of transportation. The baby food is moved in a truck which has wholesale sales tax paid on it and the truck is filled with petrol on which excise is paid. There is no such thing as an item with no tax component. The only thing is that people have not known it. Therefore, before we bring down the final details of our package, it has been necessary to let the electorate know that it is already paying the Government's secret tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to make a point about why it has taken so long, in some people's view, for us to get the details of our package released. Let us take a look at what material we have to work with. I have already said that we do not have access to the Treasury and to use public servants for paid party political purposes. We have only been able to use the figures that are on the record and then use paid consultants to interpret and work on those figures with us. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us take what figures were available. When we announced that we were to have a goods and services tax as part of our overall tax reform package, there were at least two Government Budgets to be had before we got to an election. People should realise that Budget announcements are merely estimates and remember that, in its 1990-91 Budget Estimates, the Government compounded an error of at least $6.2 billion, a figure that the Opposition did not see until the Estimates for the Budget for 1991-92 were brought down. Had we worked on the figures that were put out by the Government for the 1990-91 Budget, we would have also been out by $6.2 billion. It is only now that we have any real, actual figures to work with so that we at least have a base. We still have another Budget to go, but we cannot wait that long. At least we have some concrete figures to work with, which came out only relatively recently. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are determined to ensure that, when we bring down our package, it will be a package that is worked out with a degree of accuracy and a knowledge of the difficulties that have to be dealt with so that it is clear, coherent, logical and equitable. The Government will come back with its attacks, using government figures that are worked out by public servants, just as it did in the last election campaign when Senator Walsh, the then Minister for Finance, used the Department of Finance to work out figures to attack our economic action plan. So anyone who has any doubt about the truth of my statement that the Government will abuse the process of using public servants to do what ought to be paid party political work has only to look at the way in which the Department of Finance was used on the last occasion to know that, when the figures come out from this Government, they will have been obtained at taxpayers' expense and will be distorted to the taxpayers' disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  I said right at the beginning that the Bill to which we are speaking epitomises the inequities, the illogicalities and the difficulties of the Government's secret tax, otherwise known as the wholesale sales tax. This is a two-page Bill with a 12-page memorandum and a supplementary explanatory memorandum. It will be the subject of various rulings of varying thicknesses. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suppose that my favourite part of the Bill deals with mineral water. If I am somebody who likes to drink still, natural spring water, I pay no sales tax but, if I am somebody who likes to drink natural spring water which has natural bubbles in it or which is carbonated, I pay 20 per cent tax. If I like to drink still natural spring water and published on the label is the fact that it has minerals in it, I pay no tax but, if I like to drink natural spring water and published on the label is the fact that it has those minerals in it and also the words `Mineral water', I pay 20 per cent tax. The bottom line is that I pay 20 per cent tax on home-grown mineral water with bubbles but, if I like to have an imported still spring water with no bubbles, I pay no tax. Where is the logic, equity and sense in any of that, particularly when people who like Coca-Cola, Fanta or any other soft drink pay 20 per cent tax?</PARA>
<PARA>  Clearly, the option is that there has to be tax reform. As the Government's own report has said, it is not acceptable to tinker with what we have. There has to be dramatic and important tax reform. As I said, the opportunity to speak on yet another tinkering Bill, which may or may not achieve the aim that it thinks it sets out to do because it is subject to interpretation, is just a splendid example of why we desperately require equity and logic in our tax system and why we need a change of government to ensure that tax reform takes place. </PARA>

However, I assure him that I will get the Hansard and give him a considered response to those that I cannot respond to now. I will follow that up as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want to raise some of the points raised by Senator Watson, Senator Patterson and Senator Kernot. I will deal with the amendments in detail at the committee stage. Senator Watson and Senator Patterson, if I recall correctly, asked why we were not implementing the Industry Commission recommendation to exempt computer hardware used to operate communications equipment. That is a matter that is under investigation. But at this stage we do not want to make a decision to deal just with computer hardware used to operate communications equipment. I cannot at this stage follow the rationale of the Industry Commission's position of isolating it. We are looking at the position of computer equipment for all uses by people with disabilities. That is being assessed at the moment. It has been referred to the disabilities task force. When the response comes back from that, we will try to give a more comprehensive response. I cannot indicate the nature of that response but at this stage we are looking at it more broadly. </PARA>
<PARA>  The question regarding the position of specially modified vehicles for use by taxi companies was raised. Let me make it clear that the Bill does not exempt these vehicles or the modifications undertaken by manufacturers. Those vehicles receive concessional treatment in that they are not subject to the 30 per cent rate; they are taxed at the standard 20 per cent rate. It is not our view that it would be appropriate to exempt manufacturers modifying goods such as these, regardless of who uses the goods. It is not readily apparent why they should be distinguished from modifications to other goods which would make them more useful to people with disabilities but which might be used one per cent, 2 per cent, 3 per cent or 99 per cent of the time by people without disabilities. It is really then just a subsidy for modification rather than assistance to people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to come back to this question of the ability of the wholesale sales tax to discriminate with regard to these matters. It is a discrimination which needs to be used in a targeted manner so that the benefit flows to the people for whom it is intended. That is why the Bill exempts parts for use in modifications which are not so extensive as to constitute manufacture. This will deliver the exemption to people with disabilities and to their carers rather than more generally to those who modify vehicles that might be used otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is the rationale for the distinction. We have a situation in which the wholesale sales tax does have a capacity, which we are exercising, to discriminate between different types of goods and to tax them at different rates either because of their nature or because of their use. That is a desirable thing, but it is something that needs to be used in a targeted manner. Senator Kernot was correct in her earlier comments about that. I simply want to reinforce that point. </PARA>
<PARA>  Notice has been given of a number of amendments--I am not talking about the second reading amendment--and, as I said, I will deal with those in the committee stage. It is sufficient to indicate now that the Government will not be supporting any of those amendments, although we can see some need for further examination of at least one about which there has been some correspondence between the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and the previous Australian Democrats spokesperson on this area. There will be further examination of some of those things, but we will deal with that in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission has made a substantial contribution to the debate on this issue. It has been informative and has put some facts into the discussion. That is always useful. The debate is better for that. That does not mean, as with any other Industry Commission report, that the Government, the Opposition, the Democrats or anyone else will accept every recommendation that the Industry Commission makes or accept all the conclusions to which the Industry Commission comes. That is not the purpose of advisory bodies such as the Industry Commission, but those bodies do enhance the level of public debate about these issues. I welcome its report, for that matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are some other Industry Commission recommendations about which the Government has made a different decision. In each of these instances, the decision has been made in a manner which is more beneficial to people with disabilities than would have been the case had the Industry Commission's recommendations been adopted. For example, the Industry Commission recommended full removal of the wholesale sales tax exemption for vehicles above the threshold, but the Government has only partially removed the exemption, otherwise it might have been too harsh, and we were not prepared to go as far as the Industry Commission. This is a more moderate position. The Industry Commission recommended that the two-year requirement for ownership should be extended to four years, but the Government has decided--I think correctly--to maintain the two-year requirement. That general requirement is in other sections of the legislation and, in the interests of consistency, we decided that we would retain that two-year requirement. </PARA>
<PARA>  I make that general response to the specific issues raised during the debate. I welcome Senator Kernot to the arcane world of the tax debate. It was her first contribution on behalf of the Democrats in her new role. It tends to be a fairly specialised debate and I am sure she will enjoy her participation in it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I must turn briefly to the Opposition's second reading amendment. It is not one on which I think the Senate would welcome my wasting a great deal of its time. It is simply an assertion of the impending Opposition policy; it will be debated in many forums. Quite clearly, the Government rejects the amendment, as it rejects the proposal for a goods and services tax and as it rejects the package within which the goods and services tax is embedded: the cuts to public expenditure, the abolition of capital gains tax and cuts to the top rate of income tax to provide benefits to those who are already privileged. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fundamental elements of our opposition come down to two things:  we do not believe the proposal for a goods and services tax is fair;  we do not believe the proposal is in the interests of Australia's future. For those reasons, we will not be supporting it. Simply put--the arguments are long and the debate will go on for a long time;  this is not the time to rehearse them all--the proportion of income spent by people with lower incomes on goods that will be taxed more highly or taxed for the first time under a goods and services tax is much higher than the proportion that is spent by people with higher incomes. Therefore, the impact will be regressive: poor people will be hit more strongly than the wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA>  This can be summed up when we look at the simple question:  what will be cheaper and what will be more expensive?  Luxury cars will be cheaper;  basic services, such as health services, will be more expensive. That is what makes it fundamentally unfair. That unfairness in itself would be sufficient, but I believe in 1991--and probably at any time in our future--nothing could be less in the interests of this country than the introduction of a tax that will lead to a massive one-off surge in inflation and destroy the achievements of the Government in breaking the cycle of inflationary expectation that has bedevilled Australia for two decades. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other arguments that are asserted about the goods and services tax and which were thrown around rather like confetti in the course of this debate concern a theory which tends to continue, notwithstanding facts to the contrary. Of course, Senator Bishop said that it will bring about a massive increase in the incentive to save. I have heard that argument. I understand the economic theory underpinning it. There are two things wrong with it. There is not a skerrick of evidence to support it. When we look at other countries, we either do a vertical or a horizontal analysis. In one country, over the period in which it introduced a value added tax of the type advocated by the Opposition, there is no evidence of an increase in the savings ratios. </PARA>

<PARA>  When Dr Hewson was shadow Treasurer, he said in an outbreak of honesty, `A lot of people have been asserting this for years, but there is no evidence to support it'. He was right then, but he has since changed his tune because he wishes he was wrong. He was right then, and it remains the case that there is not one scintilla of evidence. It is like the Opposition's wish list about the amount of money it will get from the black economy. We can all understand the theoretical argument that says it ought to happen. The trouble is that, when Roger Douglas and the fellow from Canada were brought to Australia, they unfortunately stood up and said, `There is no evidence to support the position;  it didn't happen'. </PARA>

<PARA>  We also had this absolute nonsense about the compliance costs of a wholesale sales tax for small business. Notwithstanding the silly assertions made by Senator Bishop, the honest representatives of the Opposition--and there are some--know that all the evidence of expert analysts, including supporters of a goods and services tax, shows that compliance costs are higher under a goods and services tax than under a wholesale sales tax, and that they fall disproportionately on small business. That is quite clearly the evidence and members of the Opposition want to make assertions contrary to the evidence because the facts are uncomfortable. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will deal with Senator Bishop's arguments about that piece of market research at the Estimates Committee hearing on Friday. All I will say today is that her public position is the most gross misuse of material made available by the public that I have seen in 20 years of public life and 20 years of dealing with market research. Quantum, which is not renowned as a Labor oriented organisation, has made it clear to Senator Bishop as well as to the Tax Office and to the Government that it does not support the analysis she has made. She knows that, but she continues deliberately to distort and misuse the material. The only thing which can be said in mitigation is that, from the way she explains it, it seems that she does not understand that she is misusing the information because she does not understand what it says. </PARA>
<PARA>  The last point I want to make about the second reading amendment is simply this: this is the starkest example of an inappropriate amendment of any piece of legislation to come before the Parliament. Here we have evidence of the capacity of the wholesale sales tax, for all its faults, to discriminate in favour of goods of a socially worthwhile nature. Here we have the Parliament, I think unanimously, passing a Bill to extend a sales tax exemption to assist people with disabilities. The problem with the goods and services tax--the value added tax--is that it does not have the capacity so to discriminate, and the cost of these things for which we are providing an exemption here tonight will go up. </PARA>
<PARA>  The capacity to discriminate in favour of people with disabilities, in favour of environmentally desirable goods and in favour of institutions which require and deserve the assistance of the taxpayers will disappear with the goods and services tax as proposed by the Opposition. The hospitals and other bodies which buy sales tax exempt vehicles will lose the capacity to do so. It is arguable what will happen with regard to State and local governments because we do not yet know, but those bodies such as hospitals and schools which receive sales tax exemption at the moment will lose that benefit because the goods and services tax does not have the capacity so to discriminate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Obviously, the Government rejects the second reading amendment. I would be delighted to have the opportunity to make a longer contribution about this matter on another occasion, but now is not the time to do so. The Government will not be supporting any of the other amendments moved by the Democrats, but I will deal with those in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA>Amendment No. 1 proposes to amend clause 3 of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1991, which would insert a new section 6AE into the principal Act. This clause grants a partial exemption from sales tax, currently valued at $6,101, in respect of purchases of luxury motor vehicles by the people covered by the provision. The only people covered in the Bill are certain veterans and other disabled people who qualify for sales tax concessions under items 135 or 135A of the first schedule of the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  This amendment proposes to extend the partial exemption from sales tax in respect of the purchase of luxury motor vehicles to a variety of organisations. These organisations include item 63A, schools and universities; item 63B(1), organisations promoting the interests of schools and universities; item 74, Commonwealth or State government departments or authorities; item 76(1), the Reserve Bank of Australia; item 77, public transport authorities; item 78, local government, harbour boards or trusts and fire brigade boards; and item 81(1), public and non-profit private hospitals, public benevolent institutions and organisations established and maintained for the relief of unemployed persons. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although this amendment grants concessional treatment to these bodies, it must be remembered that amendment No. 3 proposes to eliminate the current unlimited exemption which these bodies enjoy with respect to luxury motor vehicles. The rationale for this amendment is simple: if disabled people are to be subject to a cap on the amount of sales tax relief they are entitled to, we believe a similar limitation should apply to other persons or organisations which also benefit from sales tax exemptions. These proposals were distributed to the Government and the Opposition weeks ago. The Treasurer (Mr Kerin) replied to them and I seek leave to incorporate his reply in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator S. Spindler</PARA>
<PARA>Senator for Victoria</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA  ACT  2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Spindler</PARA>
<PARA>CAP ON ALL SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR MOTOR VEHICLES AT THE LUXURY THRESHOLD</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for your letter of 11 September 1991 seeking the Government's support for your proposed amendment to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1991. I understand that you wish to extend the cap on the value of sales tax exemptions, which under the Bill would apply to exemptions under Items 135 and 135A, to all sales tax exemptions for motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree that in principle the sales tax system should not subsidise the purchase of luxury motor vehicles, and acknowledge that there are some arguments in equity for your proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>However, I cannot offer you the Government's support for your amendment in these sittings, since the range of sales tax exemptions for motor vehicles is too varied to be subject to a blanket application of a cap. The initial advice that I have received indicates that there are some 27 categories of users that are eligible for an exemption for motor vehicles under the sales tax law alone. In addition exemption is provided to diplomatic and consular staff under separate legislation--the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act and the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Separate issues arise for each of these classes of beneficiaries, and it would be prudent to investigate these issues more fully before making a decision. For example:</PARA>
<PARA>.  many hospitals and other bodies eligible for sales tax exemption on motor vehicle purchases do not buy luxury vehicles but rather high-valued specialised vehicles, such as ambulances--these would be hindered by an indiscriminate cap;</PARA>
<PARA>.  to remove the exemptions for State and local governments, and their authorities, without negotiation would hinder the vertical fiscal imbalance agenda of the Special Premiers' Conference;</PARA>
<PARA>.  the legality of taxing the cars purchased for use by the Governor-General and the State Governors is questionable--since they are the representatives of the Crown, the doctrine of sovereign immunity might apply;</PARA>
<PARA>.  it would be unacceptable for the Australian Government to remove unilaterally the benefits to the diplomatic and consular corps--this could be a breach of treaties;</PARA>
<PARA>.  there are also some technical questions such as:</PARA>
<PARA>  -  whether to exclude from the cap other specialist industrial road vehicles, such as buses, and dump trucks used in mining;</PARA>
<PARA>  -  to ensure that the cap does not impinge upon exported luxury motor vehicles which are exempt under Item 110. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that you can understand that this matter needs a more careful analysis than that afforded by the present passage of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1991. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is what I said. However, we would argue that the Treasurer's reply is wrong. My amendments do not propose, as he says, a cap on all 27 categories of users. Of course, there are other considerations, such as obligations under international treaties and the special reciprocal arrangements which apply to foreign military, political and trade establishments operating in Australia. We acknowledge that. There is no proposal to end the exemption provided for ambulances, dump trucks or exported vehicles. They are in no way remotely affected under the distributed amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Furthermore, the reference in the Treasurer's reply to the Governor-General's car is a furphy, and is inaccurate in the assumption that the amendments cover that case and the doctrine of sovereign immunity. This Parliament enacted legislation in the late 1980s which removed the general sales tax exemption available to the Governor-General and his staff. I commend these amendments to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think some of the issues that have been raised by the Australian Democrats in the debate on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill highlight the problems inherent in a wholesale sales tax type regime. The emphasis is directed to the goods which have to correspond to certain specifications in order to be eligible. A more humane approach would certainly be to focus on people who require certain types of aids to make their lives more meaningful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The reading of the background to the Industry Commission report was interesting. A lot of the participants urged a widening of a tax exemption to cover certain goods which are not necessarily specifically designed for people with disabilities but which are, nevertheless, considered necessary to enable them to enjoy a more independent lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA>  I emphasise this because I gained some encouragement from the comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) at the conclusion of the second reading debate. I thank him for responding in detail to issues raised during speeches. Not all of the vessels of charity remain on the Government side. I was heartened by the responses. For that reason, I raise this question about the need to improve the lot of people with disabilities to enable them to enjoy a more independent lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA>  The sorts of issues that Senator Kernot raised have a great deal of validity. We acknowledge a concession to provide a ramp into a taxi, but the person with the disability really needs the bubble on the top of the car in order to move with some dignity from place to place. It seems just a quirk of the definition inherent in the sales tax procedures that we have run into this particular problem. Therefore, I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that perhaps we need a system that acknowledges the needs of people with disabilities rather than particular exemptions of goods which have a peculiar adaptation for persons with responsibilities. I think that distinction is indeed important. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, this debate has been used to criticise the Opposition's goods and services tax. A number of the participants have overlooked the fact that it is possible, under a GST regime, to either exempt or zero rate certain categories of people, perhaps those with disabilities. A lot of false assertions have been made when the Opposition has not released the full details. Therefore, much criticism has been levelled at the Opposition's goods and services tax for political expediency and principle. Unless the full detail is there so that people can really evaluate that they are going to be better off in terms of having a higher disposable income with the GST, that criticism is based on false premises. </PARA>
<PARA>  The central thrust of the Opposition's proposal for a GST is that people will have a higher disposable income after all taxes. To achieve that purpose there will be reductions in income tax at levels which will recognise the needs of people most in need. There will be compensations for those people who are less fortunate in society, including pensioners. I think it is unfortunate that this debate has provided something of a forum for some ill-conceived criticism based on prejudice and political expediency. That is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time, I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's acknowledgment that there are certain features that the Government is prepared to investigate thoroughly. In regard to the items that I listed, would it be possible to table the ATO publication that was mentioned at the Industry Commission inquiry?  The inquiry was told that the ATO was working on it at the time. I presume that it would be ready by now. If it has been finalised, would it be possible for it to be tabled? Could the Parliamentary Secretary give us an indication of how widely that document in relation to the problems of people with disabilities would be distributed? This whole area of sales tax is a real Pandora's box for people with disabilities. I would welcome such a pamphlet. Anything we can do to make the lives of these people much more tolerable, pleasant and humane is to be commended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) to clarify something for me. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill says that sales tax will not be attributed to the modification of a motor vehicle solely for the purpose of adapting it for transferring a person with a disability. If a taxi is modified with a hydraulic lift or hydraulic ramp to enable access for a person in a wheelchair, is that modification sales tax exempt?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Parliamentary Secretary, in response to the speeches in the second reading debate, said that a manufacturing modification would not be exempt from sales tax. If I were to buy a standard vehicle and take it to a body builder and have a modification made to it to enable a person in a wheelchair to be transported sitting up in that wheelchair, would that modification be exempted from sales tax?</PARA>
<PARA>  It seems to me that there might be an anomaly if somebody asks for it to be done by a manufacturer and it is not exempt from sales tax whereas, if somebody buys it and has a modification made, it will be exempt from sales tax under the Act.

<PARA>    `6AF In spite of anything contained in any law relating to sales tax, where a motor vehicle has been modified solely for the purpose of:</PARA>

<PARA>      (b)  adapting it for transporting a person with a disability;</PARA>
<PARA>    and the modification would otherwise constitute manufacture and be liable to tax pursuant to a law relating to sales tax, such modification shall be deemed to not constitute manufacture.'.". </PARA>
<PARA>4.  Clause 4, page 2, line 20, after paragraph (a) insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>    "(ae)  by omitting from item 135A `to and from gainful employment' after `transportation';". </PARA>
<PARA>In moving these amendments, I would like to continue to speak on amendment 3, which proposes to amend clause 4 of the Bill. This clause eliminates the exemption from sales tax which would otherwise apply to certain veterans and disabled people under items 135 and 135A of the first schedule of the principal Act. The clause also ensures that the value of any modifications to the vehicle which relate to making the vehicle fit for driving or transporting a disabled person is to be excluded from the sale value of the car. </PARA>
<PARA>  Amendment No. 3 proposes to eliminate the sales tax exemption which currently applies in respect of the purchase of luxury cars by the organisations I have previously mentioned. In conjunction with amendment No. 1, this will have the effect of limiting the sales tax exemption on luxury cars to the cap of $6,101 which the Government is imposing on the disabled in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats are not advocating the removal of the sales tax exemption which currently applies to these bodies--far from it. We totally support charities being exempt from sales tax in general. Indeed, this is one area of the Opposition's proposed consumption tax that disturbs the Australian Democrats. This measure would result in a net gain in tax to the Commonwealth, although the exact quantum is unknown. </PARA>
<PARA>  Amendment No. 4 is concerned with item 135A of the first schedule of the principal Act. This provision grants an exemption from sales tax to disabled people who have been certified by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services as being unable to use public transport. However, the exemption is available only in respect of a motor vehicle purchased to transport the owner to and from gainful employment. The amendment proposes to remove the necessity for the vehicle to be used in connection with travel to and from work. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reason for the amendment is that the Democrats believe that we should be assisting all disabled people who cannot use public transport--not merely those who enjoy gainful employment. These people still need access to transport to go shopping, to visit the doctor and to conduct like activities. The issue is really one of mobility, and hence quality of life. Tax concessions should not be limited to travel to and from work. </PARA>
<PARA>  We think there is no doubt that this amendment would involve a cost to Commonwealth revenue. The exact amount is unknown, as we have said. The Industry Commission report quoted a Taxation Office estimate of the cost of the concession at $2.3m in 1988-89. This was about 750 exemptions, each with an average value of $3,000. The amendment would increase the number of eligible people who could benefit from the exemption, but it is unlikely that there would be very many people who do not have a job who would be able to afford to purchase a new car. There would be some people who have retired who have some superannuation or other savings. There would also be people who obtained some compensation payments who would be assisted, and there may be others who will be assisted in purchasing a car by their families. </PARA>
<PARA>  All these examples are ones which the Democrats believe should be assisted by the Commonwealth. We as a parliament should ensure that disabled people are granted access to transport as easily as possible, and this is one way in which we can assist. It will cost money, but the amount will be a few million dollars a year. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind the Committee that the reduction in the luxury car tax, which is agreed to by the Government and the Opposition, has a cost to revenue of $45m a year. I ask what kind of priority this shows if the Committee will not agree to contribute significantly to the quality of life of the most disadvantaged of Australians at a fraction of the cost of the relaxation of the luxury car tax rate. I also remind the Committee that I am proposing to raise some revenue by extending the luxury car exemption cap to other exempt taxpayers, which would raise some revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>  With reference to Senator Watson's statement, I understand that the Opposition will cut $3 billion from the Commonwealth Budget. One has to ask why Opposition members say that cash grants are the best way to go if they cannot give us some assurance that the disabled would not be part of that trimming operation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Perhaps I may deal with a couple of general comments before I deal with the amendments that are before the Committee. Senator Watson asked me about tabling a document from the Australian Taxation Office concerning issues related to this matter. I do not have a copy with me now to table, but I shall happily table one tomorrow in order to make it available. Indeed, it is a publicly available document, available now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In dealing with the generalities in some of Senator Watson's points on these amendments, I share his view--a view that has been expressed in this chamber on several occasions in the past by many people, including me--that it is often the case that it is much better to deal with assistance to people in need, whether by virtue of their disability or otherwise, by expenditure measures rather than by tax assistance, because it is often possible more directly to target that and to focus on those in greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a general statement of principle, that is true--and it is something which the Government has generally applied in its approach--but I do not think that should be extrapolated to an argument that there should be no such taxation assistance. I endorse the general point, but he did not extend it--and I do not wish to extend it--to the point that there should be no such use of the tax system. It is one of the things which, by its nature, create complexity. As soon as exemptions and special classifications in differential rates dependent upon criteria defined in legislation are introduced, there are arguments about where boundaries arise, and why it applies to A and not B, or A and B and not C. Those arguments are always lengthy, subjective and difficult. Nevertheless, this is an endeavour upon which we should embark, notwithstanding its difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA>  With regard to the Australian Democrats' amendments Nos 1 and 3, as Senator Kernot has incorporated the letter from the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in response to Senator Spindler's approach to him on this matter, who am I to add anything to that argument? The amendment as now before us is somewhat more limited than that to which the Treasurer was responding, so I will make some brief reference to that in additional comment. I reiterate a key sentence of that letter from the Treasurer which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I agree that in principle the sales tax system should not subsidise the purchase of luxury motor vehicles, and acknowledge that there are some arguments in equity for your proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is a proposal not without merit. It is an extension which the Government is prepared to examine but, for a variety of reasons which are understandable and not the fault of anyone in particular, the specific proposal is not one that we are ready at this stage to endorse or approve. It has some merit, but it takes the issue a little further than we would be prepared to take it. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are not absolutely sure that the public hospitals provision, for example, in the way that it is dealt with here will achieve the outcome that we would wish. There are also concerns about the fact that many of the bodies referred to in the list are funded by State or local government. We are likely to find those State or local government bodies coming back to the Commonwealth seeking some sort of compensation for the cost to them of the changes, and we might wind up in a vicious circle. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is the principle that there should be a cap on the application of benefits to people with disabilities, in this instance, and in other instances to those in public benevolent institutions, for example, so that they cannot get benefits designed to help the needy on luxury vehicles. This has merit, but the amendment is not at this stage in a form that we are prepared to endorse, although I am happy to give an undertaking that it is a matter that we will not let rest; it is something we would wish to pursue. That deals with amendments Nos 1 and 3. It seems logical to deal with them in that sequence. </PARA>
<PARA>  With regard to amendment No. 2, this is probably the appropriate point at which to deal also with Senator Patterson's concern. There is not the anomaly of which she speaks. If the modification made by a person subsequent to sale was of the same order of magnitude as that which would have been made by the manufacturer in the first place, it would be deemed to be a modification equivalent to manufacture and would still be taxed at 20 per cent and not exempt. Every time a boundary is drawn, people can debate whether it is in the right place. I accept that. There would be an anomaly if identical processes performed in different factories were taxed at different rates. That would be a problem. That is not the case. A line is drawn about the nature of the modifications that apply. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendment as proposed would create major problems in the sales tax law in its attempt to exempt the full sale value in this way. We start to get some anomalous situations, and we would undoubtedly immediately get representations to extend similar exemptions to modifications for all sorts of goods where those modifications may be of assistance to people with disabilities but may also be used, and would be likely to be used, by anybody and everybody, whether or not they are people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  It comes back to the argument that the use of the tax system is a bit of a blunt instrument. It is not always the best way to provide this sort of assistance but we try, by virtue of targeting and definition, to focus it as precisely as we can so that the benefit flows to the people for whom it is intended. The more we extend it, the more we create the possibility that the cost to revenue will not be commensurate with the benefits because the benefits tend to flow more widely, to a wider audience than the target audience, and a substantial proportion of the assistance will not assist the people for whom it was intended. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not an amendment with which we are in sympathy; nor is it one that we wish to support. It is always possible--and it has been done--to mount an argument every time any amendment to the wholesale sales tax legislation comes forward, as it is every time amendments to the income tax legislation come forward, and to say, `The exemptions and concessions in this legislation are all well and good but why not, instead of giving those three, give concession Nos 4, 5 and 6 as well?'. </PARA>
<PARA>  On questions of public revenue and public expenditure there are always more worthy causes than there is money to go around to finance them. If that was not the case, the management of public policy would be a much easier task and none of us would have such a harrowing time. We would not have to make difficult choices. We do have to make them, and that is one of the dividing lines that has to be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have debated amendment No. 4 on the gainful employment test in the chamber before. I do not have much to add to those things which I have said previously. The disability task force may well want to come back and say something to us about that, in which case we would look at it. At the moment, the situation is that this is an item designed to encourage and facilitate access to employment. It is worth while and limited in that manner and it is noteworthy that, as far as I can ascertain, the Industry Commission did not recommend any change to this proposal. As I say, nothing has changed since we debated it in the Senate the last time, as I recall. The Government does not agree with that or any of the other amendments. We hope that we can deal with the committee stage expeditiously and pass the Bill so that the benefits in the legislation can flow to the people for whom they are intended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) for his answer. I find it rather strange that there can be sales tax exemption for a modification designed to get people into vehicles, but when they get in they do not fit if they are sitting in wheelchairs. It seems to me to be a bizarre situation. I need to be convinced on this and challenge the Parliamentary Secretary on it. When the vehicle is adapted to transport a person who is suffering from a physical impairment, it does not seem to me that it is said anywhere that if the modification is of the same magnitude as that undertaken in a factory, it is not exempt. If Senator McMullan could explain where that appears in the explanatory memorandum or wherever, I might be more satisfied. It does have budgetary implications and places me, as a member of the Opposition, in a difficult situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I cannot imagine any taxi company modifying a taxi by elevating the roof to make it look more beautiful or for any purpose other than transporting somebody with a disability. It will cost more. It will mean that the company's costs of transporting people without disabilities will be increased or that the profits will be reduced. I cannot see any benefit to a company in doing that other than for the purpose of transporting someone with a disability. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to look carefully at this matter again. He may come up with some sort of alternative suggestion or give an undertaking to take this anomaly to the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) for his consideration. It seems very odd that one can have all sorts of adaptations to a vehicle except that of lifting the roof so that a person in a wheelchair can sit in a taxi. I do not understand it, and it seems to me to be inconsistent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I do not want to extend the debate, so I will be very brief. If Senator Patterson has more queries, I will drop her a note outlining the rationale and where it fits in the legislation. I am not saying it is not an important issue; it is just not an issue we need to debate backwards and forwards here. We can pursue it otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The amendments to the legislation essentially deal with the exemption of parts used in particular modifications. The parts, if used by a manufacturer, would be exempt as an input in the process, as an aid to manufacture. What we are saying is that, if individuals who are not registered as manufacturers use those parts for such a modification, they could also get an exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know that there are other points that Senator Patterson is concerned about. I certainly do not want to brush aside issues that people raise in trying properly to deal with benefits to people in need. Therefore, if Senator Patterson wants to outline any other elements of her concern subsequently, rather than now, I will happily give her a considered response. But I do not think they are going to change the nature of, or the Government's response to, the particular amendments before us now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator McMullan has made much of the costs involved in this matter. I reiterate that we said that the package may well be revenue positive. We do not know for certain, but I did suggest looking at a general anti-avoidance provision in the sales tax law, which we think would be revenue positive, and Senator McMullan did not address that. I ask him whether the Government would consider using such a provision to fund what we are suggesting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The question of general anti-avoidance provisions, their applicability and the way in which other legislation should be modified to take account of that--I will come to the question of what we do with the revenue that might flow from it in a moment--is one that is under a lot of debate both in the sales tax area and in the income tax area. It is often argued that we could deal with a lot of the complexity of the income tax legislation by relying more on general anti-avoidance provisions and the fact that we now have a High Court not so disposed to interpret every tax avoidance scheme in the interests of the avoider, as it did in the Barwick era.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That may well be a general question worthy of further pursuit, but as it relates particularly to the wholesale sales tax there is a simplification review under way. One of the elements of that is how we should deal with avoidance issues. It may be that emerging from that there will be consideration of a general anti-avoidance provision. We are certainly not going to be in a position--and I know that Senate Kernot is not proposing it--to put one in the Bill at this late stage. Therefore I do not want to spend too much time at the committee stage dealing with something that is not before us. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a very complicated matter. We are obviously sympathetic to cracking down on schemes designed to avoid tax in whatever form--wholesale sales tax or otherwise. Whether a general anti-avoidance provision is the best way to do it is not yet a settled question. But I could not give a guarantee, even if we introduced such a clause--and I agree with Senator Kernot that we would assume that that would generate revenue--that this would be the priority to which that revenue would be put. It would go into the pool of revenue that would be considered at Budget time when we decided how the extra revenue ought to be allocated in accordance with Government priorities. It may be that this would be one of them; it may well be that it would be expended on many of the other competing priorities that we all share. I cannot give the assurance that, even if we introduced such a provision--and that will not be decided for a while--this would be given priority in relation to the way we would spend that revenue. </PARA>

<PARA>EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE</PARA>
<PARA>CORPORATION BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill will re-establish the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) as an independent statutory corporation offering competitive export credit facilities for Australian exporters. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill stems from a report to the Government by the Departments of Industry, Technology and Commerce, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Primary Industries and Energy, Treasury, Finance and Prime Minister and Cabinet on the effectiveness of EFIC and its export finance and insurance services. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's March 12 "Building a More Competitive Australia" statement, recognised the need for Australian exporters to have access to competitive financial facilities to be effective, especially in Asia-Pacific markets. The Government announced its intention in the statement to re-establish EFIC as a separate entity to Austrade, with greater visibility and an extended range of services for exporters. As part of this restructuring, a $200 million dollar callable capital facility is to be provided to supplement EFIC's existing reserves of some $160 million. This will ensure adequate financial backing for its insurance, guarantee and lending operations. </PARA>
<PARA>A $50 million performance bonding facility and the more aggressive use of interest subsidy arrangements through Australian dollar financing and the provision of lines of credit to off-shore banks, which were also announced in the March Statement, are now in operation. The performance bond facility already stands to provide vital assistance for projects worth over $200 million. </PARA>
<PARA>In considering the Bill, it will be of benefit for members to understand a little of EFIC's background, its core activities and its relationship with Government. </PARA>
<PARA>EFIC's services are broadly comparable to those available to our overseas competitors through similar Government backed export credit agencies. It insures exporters against the risk of non-payment by overseas buyers and provides a range of guarantee and bonding services. EFIC covers around 10% of Australia's trade and in 1990/91 supported exports totalling $4.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>It also insures off-shore investments by Australian companies against non-commercial loss caused by exchange transfer blockages, expropriation or war damage. Cover on investments totals $490 million. </PARA>
<PARA>Concessional finance is available for exports of capital goods and related services on internationally competitive terms within trade finance rules set by the OECD. EFIC's lending program presently totals some $1,640 million. Lending is supported by an active program of borrowing on international capital markets. These funds are on-lent, often at subsidised interest rates. This year's Budget provides $14.7 million to meet interest subsidy costs. </PARA>
<PARA>EFIC, in one form or another, has been in operation for 35 years. Interest subsidy aside, EFIC's business has been at no cost to the taxpayer. For the past 5 years, EFIC has been a part of the Austrade organisation. To better equip EFIC for today's competitive export climate requires it operate in a more commercial and accountable way. In the Government's view, this will be best assured by establishing EFIC as a statutory corporation, structured along Government Business Enterprise lines. It will continue to fill a market gap by providing services which are not normally available from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>EFIC also undertakes transactions which the Government considers to be in the National Interest. These are usually high risk and involve important industry, trade or political considerations. Total exposure on the National Interest account is around $1.3 billion, of which the greater bulk relates to commodity exports, particularly wheat and wool. The UN sanctions on Iraq resulted in substantial calls on the Budget last year to fund claim payments to the Australian Wheat Board. A further $255 million has been provided in this year's Budget for this purpose. Although recovery of these debts is expected, this may be a protracted process. </PARA>
<PARA>Returning to the Bill. Although structured along Government Business Enterprise lines, EFIC is clearly not a commercial operation in the normal sense and will remain dependent on the Government's ultimate guarantee of its operations. </PARA>
<PARA>The provision of a $200 million callable capital facility is a key element of this restructuring. EFIC must have adequate capital to enable it to take-up worthwhile business while observing a proper prudential ratio between capital and reserves and contingent liabilities. Although EFIC has accumulated substantial reserves of around $160 million, independent advice indicates that its total contingent liability requires a more substantial capital base. The $200 million facility will be fully assessable for capital adequacy purposes. However, it will only be drawn upon when EFIC is no longer able to meet expected claims or losses. Provision has also been made for the return of such funding to the Government once the need for it passes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's control over EFIC will be limited to broad policy oversight. This will mainly occur through the corporate planning process and will include financial targets and accountability for results. Day to day control will rest with the EFIC Board and the Corporation's management. The composition of the Board is an important consideration requiring a blend of expertise in finance and exporting. A number of intended appointments to the new Board with these skills have been announced.  The Government has been fortunate to obtain the services of Mr Reg Nicolson, recently retired Deputy Managing Director of the ANZ Bank, to head-up the new Board. To ensure that linkages between EFIC and Austrade are maintained, provision has been made for cross membership of Boards by the Managing Directors of the respective organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>In terms of direct financial impact, the Bill is neutral. However, the $200 million callable capital facility contained in the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill is supported with a mechanism for EFIC to access the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This would only occur if, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, it is determined that EFIC's money and other assets are insufficient to meet expected liabilities, losses and claims. It is not anticipated that EFIC will need to call on this facility. </PARA>
<PARA>EFIC's overall operations are governed by maximum contingency liability and loan limits. These are prescribed in Regulations. The maximum contingent liability for insurance and guarantee business is $3,600 million. For overseas investment insurance it is $750 million. The maximum amount of loans is set at $1,900 million. Regulations maintaining these limits will be promulgated under the EFIC legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, EFIC will continue to work with the financial sector and not in competition with it, to provide Australian exporters with access to competitive credit insurance and export finance facilities. This is an essential part of the international trade environment and especially of the Asia Pacific region. EFIC has proved itself to be an efficient and cost effective organisation. In an increasingly complex global trading environment its financial record is exceptional. It compares favourably with most, if not all, other Export Credit Agencies. The independent and flexible structure proposed in this legislation will enhance EFIC's capacity to match competition from its overseas counterparts and meet the needs of Australian exporters into the future. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill complements the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill by providing transitional arrangements necessary to preserve continuity as export finance and insurance matters are transferred from Austrade to the newly constituted EFIC. The Bill also transfers assets, liabilities and staff associated with export finance and insurance activities from Austrade to EFIC. </PARA>
<PARA>Existing provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985 relating to export finance and insurance are repealed. The opportunity has also been taken to effect administrative changes to the existing Austrade Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Consequential amendments to other Acts are covered in the Schedule to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This Bill, the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill, is in itself a routine measure but it draws our attention to the whole area of government policy on overseas students and on the export of education services. The Bill, in fact, sets the charges for</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>overseas students who are studying in Australia under the former subsidised program. Of course, there have not been any new enrolments under the subsidised program either this year or last year because that program is being phased out and fewer students are in fact paying overseas student charges as defined by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition has no difficulty with the terms of the Bill which are in the form of and according to an index that has been determined and used for several years now. So the Bill's passage has our support. What we do not support is the blundering inadequacy of government policy and administration in recent years over the arrangements which now and in the future provide for overseas students. This has been a disaster area for Australia while the Labor Party has been in power. I can only repeat what is now increasingly well known: despite the pleas in this chamber from the Opposition, the Government still continues with its policies which are inflexible and which are totally inadequate to meet not only the needs of overseas students in higher education but also, with much more pain to us, the needs of Australian students. </PARA>
<PARA>   Honourable senators perhaps need to be reminded that the problems caused by government misjudgments over the mechanisms for regulation of the education export sector are entirely wrapped up with this inflexibility that Ministers Dawkins and Baldwin have shown. Indeed, we had a detailed debate earlier in the year on the special legislation which the Government introduced to deal with this export industry--education. </PARA>
<PARA>  The legislation was so badly flawed that it took a Senate committee inquiry over several months and further work by the Opposition to produce by a large number of amendments a Bill which could be sensibly workable. Even then, we in the Opposition added a sunset clause that the whole legislation eventually be withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA>   We have seen Australia's reputation badly damaged abroad by sudden changes in policy--such as the sudden tightening of visa requirements at one point--and then the consequent hardship for intending students in other countries who have had an entitlement to refunds of prepaid moneys of the slow pace of repayments. Even now, the repayments to those students have not been completed. It is gross maladministration by this Government, and it has put, most unfortunately, the overseas student program in such bad light around the world, especially in Asia where we do have a market for students to enrol in Australian institutions and where we, in fact, can give positive assistance to so many students from Asia. This is a very real indictment of Mr Dawkins, Mr Baldwin and the Government's decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the most significant developments for Australian higher education in the export education area has been the growth of full fee paying courses for overseas students. In fact, this program has replaced the subsidised program. As of the passage of this Bill which is now before us, those students who remain in the subsidised student program will be paying 55 per cent of the cost of providing a university course, whereas full fee paying students are required to pay an estimated 100 per cent of the average cost of providing a course. With the payment of a full fee there are fewer restrictions--there is not so much of a quota on enrolments--and it has widened the options for those who can pay to come to Australia to gain educational opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>  In great contrast to this opportunity afforded to overseas students, the program is not available to Australian students. This is the major criticism that the Opposition has levelled at the Government for several years. It is prepared to afford a benefit to overseas students--and it is a real benefit--but not one part of that benefit is afforded to Australian students, with the exception of a few postgraduate certificated courses in some universities, the full fees of which are paid for mostly through industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to all undergraduate courses and the great majority of postgraduate courses, this option for overseas students is denied every Australian student. That is unfair, and the Opposition has been calling for a remedy which will open the door and provide an opportunity for such a program to be made available to Australians. I hasten to add that the Opposition's program would not involve any lessening of the amount of real money that is made available to higher education in this country. This program will not be substituted for any of the current value of Commonwealth funding for higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, this has provided substantial growth in enrolments for our educational institutions and they are very much in favour of it. Increasingly--especially in the last 12 months--they have been calling for the kind of new options which the Opposition has been calling for. It opens up a market-based approach to the provision of education services in stark contrast to the stubborn refusal of this Government to contemplate such an approach for domestic students. The Government's whole approach to higher education has been to centralise and bureaucratise policy making. It has wanted to control higher education institutions and restrict their autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Thus we have Mr Dawkins's so-called `unified national system' controlled by Canberra, that is, controlled by the Minister and his bureaucracy. We have the whole process of education profiles which institutions must negotiate with the Federal Department. We have the process of forced amalgamations, many of them not willingly entered into and not able to be justified on educational grounds. This whole centralised approach is rejected totally by the Opposition. When in government, we will allow genuine autonomy to the educational institutions around Australia. We will allow them to enrol students on whatever basis they see fit, and that would include a comparable and equitable basis such as the overseas student program to which I have referred. Indeed, it has been said that the elements of market orientation make the education export sector seem like an island in a murky sea of excessive government regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I now refer to the report put down on 26 September by the Industry Commission. This report was called for by the then Treasurer, Mr Keating. The Commission was to examine every aspect of the important area of the export of education services. In referring to the report, I note that it says a lot of things which the Government ought to take very seriously. I want to highlight a few of these things. One of the report's early observations on page 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the grafting of a market-oriented export sector onto a highly regulated, largely government-funded sector, has brought tensions to the surface. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to explore the broader issues about the funding of student places. On pages 8 and 9 it makes the observation:</PARA>
<PARA>Higher education has been gradually evolving towards a system in which demand can play a larger role in the allocation of places. </PARA>
<PARA>For example, most domestic students now contribute towards the cost of their courses through the higher education contribution scheme--the current contribution is about 22 per cent--and there are also some full fee postgraduate courses, which are the specialised courses for the minority to which I have referred. However, emerging pressures arising from budgetary constraints are being reflected in growing levels of unmet demand for university places by domestic students. Added to these problems has been a high level of over-enrolment by institutions, as acceptance and re-enrolment rates have risen. The Government will not provide additional funds for these students, requiring their places to be financed from within already agreed allocations.  There is this very significant conclusion to the report:</PARA>
<PARA>The current arrangements for funding higher education for domestic students are flawed. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope the Government heard this conclusion. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Without a mechanism which takes better account of the costs and value to society and to the students of education services, decisions by Government and institutions as to how many places there are and how they are allocated will very likely be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission recommends that the Government accept the need to alter current arrangements so that qualified domestic students are not precluded from a place in public universities. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the position which the Opposition has been advocating for the past seven years. It is about time that the Government responded. I think the only way ahead will be a change of government when our policies can be put in place. In drawing to a conclusion, I again quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission also recommends that it be sent a further reference on appropriate means to rectify the current system. The Commission sees the main focus of an inquiry as the means by which government and student resources should be allocated to the higher education sector, the need for a better matching of the demand by applicants with the availability of places, and the most efficient means of targeting assistance to meet concerns about access to higher education by disadvantaged groups. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to say that, in the absence of such a reference, the Government should immediately implement one of the options for reform set out in the report--the one to which I have referred, which is, effectively, the Opposition policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  In short, this document is a massive indictment of the Government's approach to funding higher education and its blinkered, ideologically driven refusal to allow domestic students the option of places in full fee courses over and above the places provided by the present funding system. I urge the Government to pay attention to the Industry Commission. So far, however, the indications seem to be that the Government is reluctant to do so and is refusing to consider a review of funding arrangements. This is very short-sighted of Mr Dawkins and Mr Baldwin. Let me make it quite clear that the Opposition would welcome a further public inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>  In chapter 8 of the report the Commission sets out the options it believes should be considered as the means of increasing the number of places available for Australian students. These options cover full fee places in addition to the Government-funded places. These full fee places can be paid for up front or, alternatively, paid for through a HECS mechanism, through varying the HECS charge for different courses or having an approach based on some form of voucher. That the Commission is considering alternatives to the present system is very much to be welcomed. It further fortifies the reforming approach I have outlined, which the Opposition has been proposing for some years. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, put simply, the present Government has made a monumental mess of its policies towards overseas students and education exports. The Industry Commission has produced a report that is a devastating indictment of present arrangements. Clearly, only a change of government will lead to the policies that Australian higher education needs to get it right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This topic of overseas students, the export of education and the charges we make to people from overseas who wish to participate in our education program has been the subject of a number of debates, a number of reports, legislation, amended legislation and discussion in general in this place. Quite often during these debates it has been possible to agree with the sentiments expressed on behalf of the coalition by Senator Teague. Little has changed in this instance because I find that Senator Teague has said much that I can agree with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Australian Democrats see no reason to oppose the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1991. As Senator Teague did, I wish to take this opportunity at least to remind honourable senators of the sorts of issues that arise from the topic of export of education from Australia. The Government cannot be proud of its record in administering a program to sell Australian education to overseas students. Since at least 1987 problems have been identified and inequities have operated to the great disadvantage of many people who have made substantial payments to Australian tertiary institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>  Normally, an important benefit to be derived from conducting a program of inviting overseas students to study in Australia would be the goodwill and the social or cultural exchanges that would take place during those study visits. I speak as a parent participant in the AFS exchange program, which is well known to me and my family. The basis for the existence of many similar programs is the fostering of enhanced international understanding and cooperation. This benefit and benefits like it have been compromised, if not ignored, by this Government's performance in the area of export education. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia stands guilty of great inequities brought about by the limp, jittery and uncertain administration of the program. Australia cannot be proud of its overseas reputation in this area. We can be accused rightly of being unreliable, untrustworthy and even inhumane in our administration of this program. Foreign students could be forgiven for thinking that Australia is more interested in their contribution to our balance of payments than in the intellectual and cultural aspects of such programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The failings of this program have led directly to the Government's pathetic patch-up attempt that we recently witnessed in the form of the legislation introduced to try to bring some stability and reliability into the program. That legislation was sent to a committee, which conducted an inquiry where numerous witnesses were heard and innumerable amendments proposed. Still that Bill, which was introduced in an attempt to bring some stability and reliability, did not contain a code of practice that could be adopted nationally. In other words, there was no indication of the standard of service overseas students could expect if they ventured into the purchase of Australian education. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even after the inquiry, which raised a great number of uncertainties about the status of students' financial contributions to Australia, the Bill did not contain sufficient guarantees about the status of students' money. There was mention of the establishment of trust accounts, which were not real trust accounts but were described as such in the legislation. In the end, I share with the other Australian Democrats the inability to believe that the financial investment made by students would be secured by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The legislation did not satisfactorily resolve the problems that had been identified previously in our export education program. These problems were also identified in the September Industry Commission report. Again, as Senator Teague has noted, one problem was that, in the words of the Industry Commission quoted by Senator Teague, the grafting of a market oriented export sector of higher education onto a highly regulated, largely government funded sector was bound to create tensions, if not absurdities. The Industry Commission report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Currently, numbers of Australians who qualify for entry are turned away from institutions because allocated government funding is not sufficient to provide them with places. To preserve the academic requirement of uniform entry standards, overseas students with similar ability are not admitted. As a result, the market for overseas students is restricted. It can be seen that the Government's regulation of the domestic market for education is also inhibiting the growth of the overseas market. </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats cannot accept the coalition's assertion that that anomaly could be dealt with by enabling government institutions to set their own charges, to determine their own entry requirements and to have the option of charging fees for unfunded places. We argue that the answer is to fund sufficient places to meet those 30,000 or so Australian post-secondary students who are qualified to attend; in other words, to recognise the community benefit to be derived from proper investment in education, to recognise education as the priority it should be, and, I suggest, to match the rhetoric of Government statements about the clever country with actions that will ensure that the cleverness of this country does not continue to be squandered. I believe that this legislation does little to achieve that. Nevertheless, we will not oppose it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-When I visited Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia earlier this year with an overseas parliamentary delegation, a lot of interest was shown by educational authorities for education within Australia. They were interested in education opportunities in regions that have the same climate as they do, particularly Singapore and Indonesia. Some of the educational authorities commented that some of the students who ended up in the more southern universities felt some difficulty in adjusting to the climate. For that reason, they were particularly interested in the James Cook University of North Queensland, which is based in Townsville as you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would know, and which also has a campus in Cairns. Currently, 355 overseas students study at James Cook University, compared with 126 students attending five years ago and only 90 attending about 10 years ago. In other words, in just 10 years there has been an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of overseas students at James Cook University.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Whilst the number of students at James Cook University has grown from 3,737 in 1986 to just under 7,000 now, the percentage of overseas students has increased steadily from 3.4 per cent in 1986 to 5.2 per cent now. There is a very distinct focus in attracting students from Australia's near neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region, with 324 of the 355 students, or over 91 per cent of all foreign students, coming from either the Asian or the Pacific countries. The majority of these students are at James Cook University to take advantage of Australian education in commerce, economics and science. Of the overseas student population, a significant proportion--about 27 per cent--are engaged in postgraduate studies. </PARA>
<PARA>  The principal attraction of JCU most often cited by foreign students is the climatic and geographic proximity to the Asia-Pacific region. However, there are other reasons why students are choosing James Cook University which are more related to the reputation it has developed in certain fields of study: for example, many overseas students come to James Cook University specifically because of its worldwide reputation in marine biology. It is expected that the reputation of the university will be more significant in the  future in attracting foreign students, particularly by way of exchange schemes involving various specialist research centres developed recently at James Cook University:  for example, the Tropical Freshwater Research Centre and the Coal-seam Gas Institute. </PARA>
<PARA>  Currently, all overseas students are based in Townsville, principally due to the limited range of courses on offer and the lack of college support facilities at Cairns. However, as new courses are offered and the Cairns campus expands, that city will play a larger role in the export of Australian educational services. Currently, the breakdown of JCU's overseas student population in the four categories of overseas students is: 140 students sponsored by specific countries in specific disciplines whose fees and living expenses are met to a significant degree by Australian aid programs;  30 subsidised students paying an overseas student charge to the Commonwealth revenue and whom this particular piece of legislation affects;  and 121 private fee-paying students and five exchange students and occupational trainees. </PARA>
<PARA>  Next year it is expected that there will be well in excess of 400 overseas students at James Cook University, and the majority of them will be full fee-paying students. Most of these students have been drawn from Asian countries, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines as well as a substantial number from Fiji. James Cook University is very cognisant of the relationship with its near Asian neighbours. In fact, as I was told during my visit to Singapore, the Chancellor and Vice-chancellor of James Cook University conducted a graduation ceremony in Singapore at the end of the last student year. </PARA>
<PARA>  James Cook University is leading the way in developing an international student community on campus. The educational and cultural benefits will be profound for both Australian and overseas students studying at JCU. The university's international student program also contributes financially to the development of the north Queensland university. As my colleague Senator Teague has said, we support the Bill, which in itself is uncontentious, and we support the transition towards a focus on full fee-paying students, a transition which will enhance efforts by our institutions to compete for valuable overseas benefits to be gained from the sale of Australian education.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Were I to stand here this evening to tell the Senate that I had in my hand a report which showed that only one young person in every 100 in Adelaide--99 in every 100 not matriculating, not attending a technical and further education college, college or university--received any education after the age of 16 years, it would be a page one scandal around this country. It would attract national media interest and attention for weeks, if not months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Instead, I have a report which shows that only one young South Australian in every 100 who lives outside metropolitan Adelaide accesses any form of education after the age of 16 years. I know without any doubt that that dreadful statistic will raise only a whimper across Australia. I know that because two weeks ago I released that particular statistic in Adelaide. There was little media interest and only two radio stations ran the story.  The local morning and evening papers both ran a short mention some days after the event, so small that it could be missed by many readers. There was no anger and no real concern from anyone. It was a typical dead issue as far as the media was concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Very little from Senator Bolkus, as we have come to appreciate and understand. At present we have a crisis on the land which is so great that, for every hour of the day, somewhere in Australia a farmer closes his gates for the last time. It is a crisis so great that 99 out of every 100 children brought up in the real Australia of my home State of South Australia are being denied what is surely every Australian child's right--access to a full education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Other States have nothing to be complacent about. While South Australia's figures are by far the worst, Tasmania and Western Australia are not far behind with an 80 per cent  figure, Queensland with 65 per cent and New South Wales and Victoria each with 40 per cent. The latest statistics are contained in Towards a National Education and Training Strategy for Rural Australians, a report by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. What this report uncovered is no less than a disaster for the future of rural Australia and particularly South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Rural Australia is not just a few hundred families scattered across the backblocks; it is almost one-third of our population, and almost every one of them is in some type of trouble. We have proof in black and white that a whole generation of rural South Australians is being forced to abandon education before they reach a level which would provide them with the basic trade skills, never mind a profession. In other words, we will not have rural raised doctors, vets, lawyers, architects, accountants, pharmacists or dentists. But, even worse, neither will we have those who make up the very core of those communities' self-sufficiency. I talk of carpenters, mechanics, plumbers, electricians and so the list goes on. We will not have hairdressers, bakers or butchers in our country towns; our country towns which act as the servicing network for the agricultural producers of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who provides the skills in the long term to keep these communities functioning? What of the teenagers who should be aiming for agricultural college to ensure that our properties are run by the most up-to-date methods, embracing technological change? One generation deprived is more than enough, but if policy is not addressed urgently to ensure that our rural young can attend a TAFE college, matriculate or advance to university, it will become two generations, and what then?</PARA>
<PARA>  We talk consistently with disgust about racial discrimination and with dismay about age and sex discrimination, but right in our backyard is massive evidence of geographical discrimination. Who mentions that? When has this angle of discrimination even been the subject of heated debate? More than two years ago the Hawke Government declared that its goal was to increase transfer rates of rural students from school to higher education to a level comparable with metropolitan areas. Instead, as farm incomes have dropped--in many thousands of cases to zero during the current rural crisis--the Government has stood idly by doing nothing as rural students have been forced to give up education in their droves. </PARA>
<PARA>  So much for the aim of the clever country we hear so much about. It is not that those students want to stop learning--they do not. Both they and their parents talk of what has happened with frustration and great despair. Usually, the situation arises when a rural student is advised to leave the local area school because it cannot provide the necessary subjects--that is, there is no curriculum guarantee--or the student needs a TAFE college for a trade. </PARA>
<PARA>  For a city student that situation means no more than a mere change of bus route, plus some extra travelling time, if unlucky, but for a country student it signals a whole new and expensive way of life. Country students must move to the city and pay for accommodation, food, general education costs, books and city travel. At present, more often than not their parents simply cannot afford to provide that opportunity. Why?  Because the Government considers most farming families to be asset rich and so they cannot access Austudy. Yet their so-called assets of land and machinery are no longer accepted as collateral by banks, they cannot borrow to educate their children on those tools of trade and they cannot sell because nobody wants to buy a property which, more often than not, has a negative income. </PARA>
<PARA>  These families have little or no cash flow, no assets which can be considered of any value except on paper and no government help to educate their children. That is what this report is telling us clearly in black and white terms. Their choice is one of no choice. Their teenagers must drop out of the education system, and they are doing that. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is worth pointing out that the latest report is not the first to be critical of the present attitude to rural education. The first report, entitled Student Financial Assistance, was released in March by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and was severely critical of the declining opportunities available to rural students. Significantly, the Government members on the Committee agreed in total with the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has also ignored the coalition's proposals, which were passed in the Senate, for hardship provisions to be included in the Austudy regulations to give some recognition and relief to these families and some financial encouragement to access education in the metropolitan areas. Such provisions would go a long way towards helping the rural community access education by investigating fully the real, as opposed to the paper, value of family assets and providing help accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need the rural community. It literally provides us with our daily bread. This should not be forgotten, but unfortunately it is. It seems that most of Australia's city dwellers, the media and certainly the present Government have forgotten how vital the rural community's survival is to our own. There is an urgent need to address this problem. It behoves every member of parliament to recognise the problem and to ensure that the geographical discrimination is removed so that the most urbanised state in the most urbanised country in the world is able to reach out to all of its people and give them all equal access to education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I shall focus in this adjournment speech on the continuing nuclear perils, notwithstanding the welcome initiatives by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev in recent days. On another occasion I will pay attention to the many worrying nuclear weapons programs still under way. The note of caution expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in Question Time today is certainly valid. There are many programs still apace, including the Trident submarines, ICBMs, the stealth bomber and the star wars programs which, on the nuclear weapons side of the ledger, are very worrying indeed. Tonight I will give an update of a closely related partner, the nuclear power industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Despite the decision of the Australian Labor Party not to change its illogical three mines policy at the Hobart conference in June, the uranium mining lobby is continuing its hype about the virtues of nuclear power, seeking to take advantage of the economic recession and fallacious arguments about the greenhouse effect. What all these arguments seem to ignore is the growing crop of warnings from around the world as we learn about the legacy of reliance on the nuclear industry and the long term effects that the safe energy movement has forecast for many years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Parallel to these warnings come new developments in safe energy which point us on the road not taken, as Amory Lovins put it some 15 years ago in the United States. Thankfully, his voice is being heard a lot more now than it was then. I would like to cite a few examples and draw them to the attention of those who still believe in the benefits of uranium mining and who continue to propose more uranium mines, uranium enrichment facilities and nuclear waste burial sites in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  From India comes a horrific report of birth defects, mystery illnesses and deaths among villagers living near a crippled nuclear power station in Rajasthan in the north-west. Private doctors and nuclear experts conducted a two-week survey of 3,000 villagers living within 10 kilometres of the plant. Village elders and midwives allege that the number of children born with deformities, including paralysis or missing limbs or organs, has doubled in the past two years. Those who conducted the survey believe that scientific analysis of the results will reveal serious radiation contamination and that radiation leaks have damaged people's genes, doubled the number of spontaneous abortions, made at least half the men impotent and many women infertile, caused chronic tiredness and killed thousands of cattle and goats. </PARA>
<PARA>  India's Atomic Energy Regulatory Board admits that one of the plant's two reactors has had leakage problems since the early 1980s and that the reactor has had to be shut down at least 250 times in its first decade. Predictably, the same regulatory board denies that the villagers' problems are caused by the nuclear plant. Many of the villagers have been hired as temporary workers and claim that they have been left in contaminated areas at times of radiation leaks. They are paid at three times the normal rate to work in areas where the permanent staff refuse to go. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Rajasthan plant was the prototype copy of a plant built at Douglas Point in Ontario, Canada, which was closed in the mid-1980s after spewing 2,700 litres of heavy water into a nearby lake. The arrogance of nuclear experts is the same all over the world. Despite many accidents and other problems at nuclear plants, such as the Tarapur reactor, which scientists say is the world's worst performing and most polluting nuclear power reactor, India is building 10 more nuclear power plants. Another six are planned after that, including two being purchased from the Soviet Union. I doubt that many people would be confident about Soviet nuclear technology post-Chernobyl. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have the legacy of nuclear power in eastern and central Europe. The President of Bulgaria has recently said that his country could not afford to close down its sole nuclear plant, even though it has been declared unsafe by experts. After inspecting the plant in June this year, International Atomic Energy Agency officials said that the reactors were in a very poor condition, with a number of safety-relevant deficiencies. The IAEA spokesman said that his agency had recommended that the four reactors be closed. Two of the four reactors had been shut down and the third was working at half capacity because of oil leakage. Of course, the whole plant has not been closed down. </PARA>
<PARA>  Further north, Austria is worried that a nuclear station at Jaslovske Bohunice, just inside Czechoslovakia, is in such a dangerous state that Vienna is at risk from a Chernobyl-style meltdown. An Austrian expert commission says that the station is obsolete and a serious security risk because it was built in the 1960s with a design life of 25 years. As a result, there is no full containment of the reactor in the modern sense and there are no secondary backup systems for electrical circuits, which are essential. Radioactivity has also caused embrittlement of the steel reactor pressure vessels. The experts are particularly worried about weak joints, which they say are virtually impossible to repair. There is insufficient fire protection in the building and the reactor was not built to withstand earthquakes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Czechoslovakia claims that it has no money to renovate the plant and has appealed to the European Community for funds to do the job. There was an accident at the plant in 1990 when underground drinking water was contaminated after radioactive waste leaked from a storage tank in the plant, which had already been shut down temporarily after two serious accidents. An investigation was carried out after it was discovered that the liquid had seeped into subterranean streams. The number of people affected in the area is still unknown. The threat of an accident is of sufficient concern to the Austrian health Ministry that it will be, or is already, distributing potassium iodine tablets free to children, pregnant women and nursing mothers. Czechoslovakia has begun providing pills within a 32-kilometre radius of the offending plant in southern Slovakia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Former East Germany's only reactor at Griefswald has been closed down. Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria are now faced with a growing pile of highly radioactive waste that they cannot handle as they do not have long term storage facilities. The Soviet Union will no longer take back spent fuel without charge. None of its former satellites can afford to pay the commercial cost of reprocessing now that the Soviet Union has ended trade with eastern Europe on the convertible rouble basis. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Soviet Union, too, has more than its fair share of nuclear problems, particularly with the legacy of Chernobyl. We have become aware of this legacy in Australia with the visit of the children from Chernobyl, including those who came to Parliament House earlier this year. In April this year, Soviet scientists who had visited the Chernobyl complex reported that the biggest danger to nearby people is caused by the declining condition of the reactor and its protective concrete shell. If part of the reactor or shell were to collapse, hundreds of tonnes of radioactive dust would be released into the atmosphere, with heavy pollution of the surrounding area, though probably not on the international scale of the original disaster in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>  The IAEA-World Health Organisation report on the impact of Chernobyl, which did not contain data for the 30-kilometre exclusion zone or for the emergency workers, painted a picture of little impact from radioactivity, although the severe psychological impact was stressed. The nuclear industry, of course, jumped on the report as proof that the world's worst nuclear accident had little effect. Anecdotal evidence of massive casualties among the liquidators continues to reach the West. </PARA>
<PARA>  My research officer was in Japan in August this year. He met with one of the Estonians who was sent to Chernobyl as a liquidator in 1986; that is, the army of workers forced to control the disaster, many without protection or monitoring equipment. This man reported many problems amongst those from the Baltic states and other Soviet republics who were sent to Chernobyl in 1986. That is why he was with a Baltic states delegation visiting Hiroshima. That city has finally recognised the victims of Chernobyl as hibakusha, or nuclear victims, despite efforts by the authorities in Japan to make a distinction between the victims of the nuclear power industry and the victims of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. This is for obvious reasons: Japan has a number of nuclear reactors. </PARA>
<PARA>  This year is also the year in which Japan's boast of the best maintained nuclear industry in the world has been shattered by a near meltdown at the Miahama No. 2 reactor and revelations of a further series of incidents at other reactors around the country. On 9 February, Miahama No. 2 came close to a meltdown when a steam tube fissured and emergency equipment failed to operate. In a frightening parallel to the Three Mile Island accident, the control room staff were unprepared for the situation and had to operate outside known scenario training. Operators had ignored repeated warnings of rising levels of radioactivity for one and a half hours and continued to run the reactor at full power. At the critical moment, safety valves failed to operate. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has come to light that a steam tube failed and leaked radioactivity. The main steam isolation valve failed to shut down under operator control and was closed manually seven minutes later. The emergency core cooling system failed effectively to cool the core, raising the cooling water temperature to boiling point and thus rendering the coolant totally ineffective. Radioactive steam had to be vented to reduce pressure in the reactor. </PARA>
<PARA>  Japanese authorities at first denied that the coolant had boiled, although there were reports that escaping radioactivity was detected. No information has been released on the state of the fuel assemblies. Kansai Electric, the plant's owners, have said that they will not inspect them unless instructed to do so by the Government. Initial investigation found that the steam tube failed because its anti-vibration bar had been incorrectly fitted--in other words, the human error factor, which is common in most of these reactor problems. The most recent reports have shown that a Mitsubishi heavy industries employee had sawed through the bars, not realising their importance. Mitsubishi has since accepted liability for the accident. </PARA>
<PARA>  Kansai Electric also operate the No. 2 reactor at the Takahama plant in Fukui Prefecture, 320 kilometres west of Tokyo. It was shut down on 21 March after a total of 163 damaged steam generator tubes were found in a regular inspection of the plant. Of the 163 damaged tubes, apparently corroded by chemicals, 133 will be repaired and the others plugged up, a common practice in the nuclear industry. The new work will bring the number plugged to 1,571, or more than 15 per cent of the 10,164 steam generator tubes at the Takahama plant, which began operation in 1975. Steam generators are regarded as the Achilles heel of pressurised water reactors. Despite the seriousness of these accidents, the nuclear industry is still reluctant to be open about these problems. The authorities concerned have released important facts only a few at a time, sometimes long after the accidents have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are those who argue that all this proves that nuclear industry is still okay in the advanced industrialised countries, because we have learned from mistakes earlier on and accidents only happen in the Soviet bloc and developing countries where safety standards are not so strict, even if the reactors are designed by North American or European companies. Yet we have only to turn to France, the United Kingdom and the United States to see how they are now being troubled by problems within their nuclear industries. Plagued by generic faults, the pressurised water reactor program of the French nuclear industry has failed to deliver long-promised economies of scale. The Super Phoenix fast breeder reactor has proved to be a complete economic failure. It has been demoted from commercial demonstration status to experimental full scale status. </PARA>
<PARA>  The industry continues to groan under the weight of its debt. While it claims that its debts are no greater than those of fossil fuel based systems, Electricite de France has been unable to reimburse even a fraction of the $43.8 billion debt contracted for the construction of nuclear power plants. This is a figure worth noting by those who, like the Liberal Party in Western Australia, want to build nuclear power plants in this country. They are enormously expensive. These people fail to recognise the cost involved in paying for a reactor that would have to be imported, thus adding substantially to our balance of payments deficit and the national debt, about which normally they like to rubbish the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  As for the coalition's commitment to expand the uranium industry, it too might care to note that the French nuclear giant, Cogema, is to close another uranium mine. This is in line with the company's policy of withdrawal from mining because of the world surplus of uranium and low profitability of French mines. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the United Kingdom, it having been finally acknowledged that the nuclear industry is not a profitable concern, it has been recently revealed that levels of radioactivity in the lake next to the Trawsfynydd nuclear plant in north Wales are higher than anywhere in Britain, apart from the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria in the north-west of England. </PARA>
<PARA>  A confidential report by the Central Electricity Generating Board revealed that radioactive caesium 137 levels were 10 times higher than previously thought. The report was prepared as part of a feasibility study for a pressurised water reactor at the site. The necessity to drain the lake and enlarge it for a pressurised water reactor would have released caesium and plutonium dust and allowed it to blow about. Local people eat fish from the lake and it is also used as a source of power for the Maentrwrog hydro-electric power station. </PARA>
<PARA>  The British nuclear industry has also decided to create a national nuclear waste dump at the infamous Sellafield nuclear complex, despite the fact that the local geology is widely acknowledged to be unsuitable. Radioactive waste will be stored there for 10,000 years and beyond, and the nuclear industry ultimately envisages the storage of up to 1.4 million tonnes of low level waste and 600,000 tonnes of intermediate waste. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sellafield was chosen because it already produces 60 per cent of Britain's nuclear waste, and transport costs to other sites considered in northern Scotland would have been prohibitive, adding more than $2 billion in transport costs over 50 years. Conservationists pointed out the irony of the fact that Sellafield was discovered to be so suitable for storing nuclear waste, given that it produces two-thirds of the country's nuclear waste in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA>  Another enormous forthcoming expense for the British nuclear industry will be the cost of decommissioning the eight Magnox stations which are all due to shut down before the end of the century. The cost of surveillance alone at a shutdown Magnox station runs at around $1.5 million a year, and no-one can calculate the full cost of decommissioning such a reactor.  Decommissioning costs around the globe are about to explode. This cost has never been counted or calculated in any way by the nuclear industry. It is never counted as part of the cost of establishing plant, in the same way as disposal of the waste is never counted as a cost when the economics of nuclear power are so promoted by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the United States, following an accident in August at the Nine Mile Point nuclear power plant in New York State, officials declared a site area emergency, the second highest level of urgency under federal guidelines. A month before, there was an accident at the Oyster Creek power plant in New Jersey, and a number of analysts have continued to argue that the US nuclear industry is doomed, because of public opposition and high construction costs, even though the nuclear industry continues to wage a relentless campaign to promote nuclear power, arguing that it is non-polluting, would cut United States reliance on imported crude oil and that it has a proven safety record. At the moment only about eight plants are under construction and not one has been ordered since 1978. </PARA>
<PARA>  The major headache for the US nuclear industry at the moment is the continuation of problems that have come to light around the nuclear weapons production complexes at Hanford, Savannah River and Rocky Flats. The US Government has doubled its budget to repair and modernise the Savannah River site alone, spending more than $2.5 billion this year to do it up, and having spent well over $2 billion to repair three old reactors since late 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>  The US Energy Department has proposed a huge program, estimated to cost $200 billion to $300 billion and to take at least 30 years, to take old nuclear weapons plants out of service, clean up hundreds of square miles of ground contaminated by chemical and radioactive wastes and to build a more compact nuclear weapons industry. That is all rather worrying, despite the fact that President Bush has made some very welcome cuts to the nuclear weapons arsenal in the last week or so. The latest Bush Administration proposal outlines cuts of 30 per cent to 85 per cent over the next 25 years, reducing production to possibly as few as six or seven sites, instead of the current 13 major facilities scattered over 12 states. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn to another disastrous aspect of the nuclear industry. In September this year an IAEA report showed that nuclear weapons or material had been lost at sea more than 30 times over the past 40 years. Reactors or components from submarines and spacecraft, along with missiles that could carry nuclear weapons, were among items involved in maritime accidents. The draft report, an inventory of 31 radioactive accidents or losses since 1950, was prepared for the International Maritime Organisation. It lists nuclear weapons aboard the British warship HMS Sheffield, sunk during the 1982 Falklands-Malvinas war, and a Polaris missile lost off the coast of Florida in 1985 by the Royal Navy submarine HMS Resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>  A few days earlier Soviet experts were expressing concern about a Soviet nuclear-armed submarine which sank off the coast of Norway in April 1989, and which they say will have to be raised from a depth of 1,700 metres because it could begin leaking radiation. The submarine sank after catching fire, and slammed nose first into the seabed, damaging its bow and the compartment housing two nuclear-tipped torpedoes. In the same week, on 24 September, a Soviet member of parliament from the northern port of Murmansk alleged that the Soviet Union had dumped radioactive waste in leaky containers into shallow waters off its north coast for more than 20 years, while publicly claiming it was being stored on land. </PARA>
<PARA>  The dumped waste included the damaged core from the Lenin, the nuclear-powered icebreaker which suffered a meltdown in 1966 or 1967, though the records are not quite clear on that. Andrei Zolotkov said that documents showed that containers used to dispose of nuclear waste in the 1960s and 1970s tended to float so `they punched two holes in the sealed containers, the water filled them and they sank'. One container giving off high levels of radiation was washed up on the island of Novaya Zemlya in 1984, but was thrown back into the water. </PARA>
<PARA>  A British nuclear engineer, John Large, estimated that the Soviets had dumped 6,750 tonnes of solid waste and about 16,000 cubic metres of liquid radioactive waste, although the Soviet military had consistently stated that it had stored all its radioactive waste on land. However, they refused to permit independent inspection of the facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  In recent weeks we have been hearing a lot about Iraq's nuclear capabilities, although it is interesting to note that there has been little coverage of how Iraq acquired this technology during the years when Saddam Hussein was a good guy and supported by the West as well as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait when he took on the Ayatollah Khomeini's regime in Iran between 1980 and 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>  Concern about the revelations from Iraq of the extent of its nuclear program has heightened the need for tougher safeguards on the other nuclear research going on in many other countries. What shocked the United Nations team in Iraq was the ease with which Iraq was able to hide so much, despite IAEA inspections. If Iraq could do this as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, then so could any other country. The IAEA estimates that there are more than 300 research reactors around the world. New nuclear and other technologies, large scale plutonium reprocessing plants, laser isotope separation technology and the spread of super-computers all threaten to make guarding against nuclear proliferation more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another worrying trend is that near-nuclear weapon states such as Argentina, Brazil, India, Israel, Pakistan and South Africa can now export a wide range of nuclear materials and plants. Therefore, the pattern of developing states acquiring technology from developed non-proliferation treaty signatory states might well be breaking down. </PARA>
<PARA>  All this would be bad news if it were not for exciting new developments in alternative safe energy in Australia, which also offer export potential. The main problem seems to be the time warp that older politicians and a handful of mining executives and scientists seem to be caught in, refusing to acknowledge that nuclear power has no future and that the world cannot afford it and does not need it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last month there was exciting news that Australian solar energy scientists had scored a breakthrough in materials design that could revolutionise the world's power industry by the year 2000. For the first time, the material will allow the mass production of high efficiency, low cost solar collectors. These will produce steam for power generation at a cost below that of many fossil fuel or nuclear systems. The collectors will also generate power at half the price of the world's most economic solar power station in California. With this advance, solar energy would go from being merely a promising line of research to an economically viable alternative to coal, natural gas or nuclear power. It would also provide one solution to the global impact of burning fossil fuels and respite from the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unlike solar cells, which use silicon to transform sunshine directly into electric power, the new material--dubbed `high efficiency surface' or HES--is an example of solar thermal power because it absorbs the sun's rays to produce steam. Australia now has the world's most efficient solar thermal collector and the most efficient solar cell. For these developments I would like to pay tribute to Dr David Mills, the solar cell's co-inventor with Mr Qi-Chu Zhang, and I wish all the best to these partners in the consortium, who plan to develop the technology further--and they should get full government backing for their project. </PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier this year in April, Gerald Braun, Research Director for California's Pacific Gas and Electric Utility, which has 12 million customers, told a Canberra workshop on energy efficiency and renewable energy that Australia looks to be in a good position to develop an early market for alternative energy generation technologies, with major global significance and therefore major export potential. He pointed out that Australia's need to move energy to a sparse population over vast distances could be a very expensive proposition in conventional terms and in such cases localised use of renewables such as wind and some solar technology could very clearly be the most economic choice. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia really has an opportunity to develop that market internally and then turn that industry's attention to the tremendous markets in parts of the world where the conventional energy distribution grid is not well established but there is still a need for power for development. </PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting that the Pacific Gas and Electric Utility used to be strongly committed to nuclear power in the 1970s but is now committed to both conservation measures and renewable sources of power, such as wind, solar and conversion of waste heat, as both cost effective and environmentally sound. As Mr Braun told his audience:</PARA>
<PARA>We decided to be part of the solution, rather than fighting it. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be inspiring if some of those people still committed to the nuclear option in Australian politics were prepared to admit that times have changed and, like Mr Braun, to take this exciting new energy path into the next century. What we have to note is that the momentum has changed, with new technologies becoming cheaper and conventional sources, for a variety of reasons, more expensive. As Mr Braun pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>Over the next 10 years with more stringent environmental legislation that trend will accelerate. </PARA>
<PARA>There will be those who still argue that we could sell uranium to developing nations such as Indonesia, but they should realise how inappropriate the nuclear option is for these countries as well, particularly when safeguards are not so stringent and when they run into massive debt paying for nuclear reactors that now cost up to $1 billion each. We only need to look at the Philippines to see how much its nuclear power plant is costing it in interest repayments, and the nuclear power plant at Bataan did not even come on stream to produce energy. There are many exciting new developments that Australians could be researching, such as hydrogen, now emerging as the latest dark horse to alter the betting odds in a field dominated by fossil fuels. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another related area for Australia is our future as a supplier of clean food. I quote the Executive Chairman of ICM Australia, Doug Shears, who told the recent Grains 2000 conference in September that Australia has a marvellous opportunity staring it in the face. In a world that has been contaminated by Chernobyl, acid rain, polluted waterways and overuse of chemicals, Australia is relatively environmentally clean. The National Farmers Federation is beginning to understand the opportunity, and I think it should be promoting even harder than it is the fact that Australia's food is uncontaminated. Of course, it would be on really strong ground if it could claim that our produce was organically grown. Chemical-free food is a huge growth area. Examples of what I am driving at are a packet of Uncle Toby's organic Vita Brits and David Williams, who farms 700 hectares at Breeza, near Gunnedah. He is a biodynamic farmer who got $200 a tonne for his 300 hectares of wheat last year while his neighbours got only $75. There is a very good market for organically grown grains. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia needs men and women of vision to get out of this reliance on an old and discredited technology and who are prepared to take advantage of exciting new trends that will create the jobs and export opportunities that we so desperately need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Just one month ago when the Senate was last sitting I raised what I considered to be a grave injustice that the Australian Taxation Office was perpetrating against the taxpayers of this country. Various articles and evidence led me to believe that the ATO was using its press releases to give an incorrect impression of people and companies in question. I referred to a number of articles printed in the Australian voicing Mr Boucher's comments on the auditing of Australia's top companies and in particular to an incorrect press release, No. 20 of April 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This press release was being used by tax commentators in this country as a way of informing taxpayers to be aware of using false tax file numbers or of lodging incorrect tax returns. The press release in question intimated that prison sentences and hefty fines would be imposed if the aforesaid occurred. At the time, I pointed out that the ATO needed to be careful of the implications of its comments, that the press release referred to in my speech had been proved to be incorrect and that the ATO had been informed of this in no uncertain terms. Yet at the time no retraction was forthcoming, and my adjournment speech called for a retraction. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to say that the ATO has heeded those words. On 30 September I noticed in the Examiner, a newspaper published in Launceston, that a letter from Mr V. T. Mitchell, the First Assistant Commissioner of Tax Audit, was published. This letter retracted the aforementioned press release. I quote the last paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>This error is the result of a mistake in a press release issued by the Tax Office on April 30, 1991. Since that release, the Tax Office checking processes have been tightened to ensure that similar mistakes are not made again. </PARA>
<PARA>However, on perusing the various Tasmanian papers and the various taxation, accounting and business journals that came across my desk and my staffer's desk, I have not found that letter in any other publication. I would like to ask Senator Button, who is the Minister representing the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), whether he could investigate the matter further and inform this chamber as to the procedures followed by the Australian Taxation Office in having the retraction more widely circulated. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that there is a need to maintain a good relationship between the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian taxpayer because it is a matter of grave importance under a system of self-assessment, and again I say how pleased I am to see that retraction. However, as we all know, self-assessment implies a trust given to the taxpayer. This trust should be returned by the Australian Taxation Office and should be displayed by the same honesty that it expects from taxpayers. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The Government was aware of the intention of Mr Warren Anderson and Indonesian interests to set up a new joint venture company (in which Mr Anderson would hold a 49 per cent interest) which would establish and operate a cattle feedlot in Indonesia. The Government was also aware that the parties proposed to export cattle from the Northern Territory cattle stations to Indonesia where they would be fattened and slaughtered in accordance with Moslem rites.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The Government expects all taxpayers, including foreign investors, to refrain from making use of any profit shifting arrangements, whether by transfer pricing or other means, that could reduce their own proper Australian taxation liabilities or those of Australian enterprises. The provisions of Division 13 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to determine that an arm's length consideration will be substituted for income tax purposes in place of that adopted in a profit shifting arrangement. Subject to powers of remission, a statutory penalty is also imposed where Division 13 is applied.</PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, for a number of years, the Government has been implementing significant and strategic taxation initiatives to stamp out profit shifting including:</PARA>
<PARA>    1 July 1987--the introduction of the thin capitalisation rules which deny deductibility of interest payments by companies, trusts and partnerships where certain debt:equity ratios are exceeded;</PARA>

<PARA>  Will the Minister reconsider the recent draft ruling by the Australian Taxation Office which intends to apply withholding tax to the computer industry for the sales of shrink-wrap software, which could cost the industry $50 million a year and may have a backlash effect, with other countries attempting to impose their own withholding tax for software, which might damage the export potential for Australian software houses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Commissioner of Taxation is responsible for administering the tax law and ensuring that taxpayers pay the correct amount of tax. Taxation Rulings are issued by the Commissioner to assist taxpayers by advising them of his view of the law. Prior to their issue a draft of the Ruling is circulated to interested parties so that their views can be considered in coming to a final decision. The draft ruling on computer software is currently being reconsidered by the Commissioner's officers in the light of comments made by industry representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Commissioner advised that the draft ruling is primarily concerned about the nature of receipts from the marketing of computer software including shrink-wrap software. The draft ruling, broadly speaking, states that it is the nature of the agreements between the parties which determine the nature of the receipts and the tax consequences which follow.</PARA>
<PARA>  If the agreements reflect a licence arrangement between the parties, receipts under the agreements are royalties. In this case, where the licence fees are being remitted to a non-resident, the payer must retain and forward to the Commissioner a part of the fees to meet that non-resident's tax liability. The non-resident's actual income tax liability will be refunded. The non-resident will also get a credit in its home country for any Australian tax paid.</PARA>
<PARA>  If, on the other hand, the agreements reflect sale of the software between the parties, the receipts will be the proceeds of the sale of goods. In that case the arrangements are structured so that no Australian tax liability will ordinarily arise in the non-resident's hands because the income for tax purposes would be derived from overseas sources where the sale occurred.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Commissioner, after meeting industry representatives on 24 May 1991, is awaiting a submission from the Australian Information Industry Association before he reaches his final and concluded view on the issue.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The table at Attachment 1 provides information on the number of SkillShare projects in each State and Territory. Data on the types of agencies which operate projects is not collected within the management information system for the SkillShare Program. I asked the Department of Employment, Education and Training to manually categorise project sponsors by type of agency as requested by the honourable senator and was informed that, of the 366 SkillShare projects in 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) 27 SkillShare projects are sponsored by local government sponsors;</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) 46 SkillShare projects are sponsored by identified church bodies; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) the remaining 297 (81 per cent) projects are sponsored by non-church, non-government welfare bodies.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The Department has allocated ASL of 106.9 in 1990-91 and 106.9 in 1991-92 to SkillShare, which has been supplemented by 9.5 ASL associated with the enhancements announced in the 12 March 1991 Statement.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The average length of time spent on SkillShare courses by 93,500 participants in 1990-91 was 116 hours. Of these, approximately 25,750 participants were in receipt of the formal training allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) SkillShare Sponsors are funded to operate projects at one of several core levels for each calendar year and may also additionally receive one or more funding modules of fixed amounts to conduct specific supplementary services.</PARA>
<PARA>  Sponsors are required to sign a formal SkillShare Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Commonwealth before the release of the first instalment of SkillShare funds.</PARA>
<PARA>  The MOA requires, inter alia, that the Sponsor provides the Department within 21 days of the end of each quarterly funding period, with a satisfactory Program Performance Quarterly Report which incorporates a financial income and expenditure acquittal statement, certified as correct by an authorised project officer.</PARA>
<PARA>  The MOA further requires that within two months after the end of the annual funding period the Sponsor furnishes the Department, through the Area Director, in respect of that funding period;</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) a statement of receipts, including interest earned on bank accounts, and expenditure, audited by an independent Auditor,</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) a certificate signed by an Authorised Officer certifying that SkillShare funds received for the funding period were expended in respect of the project and in accordance with the MOA and a statement from an independent Auditor that, in the Auditor's opinion, the certificate is accurate,</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) a statement of Contributions in Cash and Contributions in Kind obtained during the funding period prepared by the Sponsor and a statement from an independent Auditor that in the Auditor's opinion the statement is correct; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (d) a statement of assets purchased wholly or partly from SkillShare funds and assets purchased with SkillShare funds which were disposed of during the funding period and a statement from an independent Auditor that in the Auditor's opinion the statement is accurate.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) At the time of signing the SkillShare Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), the Sponsor negotiates an annual program of activities and agreed level of performance, and other conditions, for each project with the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The agreed areas of compliance apply to the following areas of operation:</PARA>
<PARA>  (i) the delivery of courses and activities offered by the Project;</PARA>
<PARA>  (ii) the minimum number of participants to be assisted; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (iii) the per cent Successful Placement Rate, where this measure indicates the number of participants assisted by the Project who obtain employment, or go on to further education or training.</PARA>
<PARA>  Projects are required to provide regular progress reports in these terms, (as specified in the MOA), to the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>  Continued payment of grant instalments to the Sponsor is dependent upon continued satisfactory performance by the project on a pro rata basis compared with the agreed levels of performance.</PARA>
<PARA>  Other matters which are taken into account in assessing project performance are:</PARA>
<PARA>  (i) other courses/activities planned for the remainder of the year;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Within the diverse range of programs delivered within the transport and communications portfolio it is often difficult to establish the exact extent to which a program benefits a discrete group, such as people aged 60 years and over.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian National</PARA>
<PARA>  The Federal Department of Transport and Communications reimburses the Australian National Railways Commission (AN) for the provision of free and concessional fares and freight on the non-urban rail services in South Australia in accordance with the terms of the transfer Agreement (1975) between the South Australian and Commonwealth Governments. In the 1990-91 financial year an amount of $4.5 million was appropriated for concessions.</PARA>
<PARA>  AN receives reimbursement in the following categories; VIPs, War veterans, disabled veterans, freight (parcel) concessions, pensioners and sickness beneficiaries. People aged 60 years and over would primarily access pensioners concessions.</PARA>
<PARA>Waterfront Industry Reform Authority</PARA>
<PARA>  Under the provisions of the Waterfront In-Principle Agreement (IPA), an early retirement/redundancy package has been provided to rejuvenate the age structure of the stevedoring and international container depot industries. This package is targeted at stevedoring employees over 55 years of age and will enable restructuring of the industry. In applying the package priorities are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>  employees 60 years of age and over with 25 or more years of service</PARA>
<PARA>  employees of 58 and 59 years of age with 30 or more years of service</PARA>
<PARA>  employees from age 64 in descending order of age to 55 years with priority in any age group being based on years of service.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the 1990-91 financial year the actual appropriation under the IPA arrangements was $17,238,000.</PARA>
<PARA>Shipping Industry Reform Authority</PARA>
<PARA>  The sub-program contains appropriations which include the Government's financial assistance towards the cost of voluntary early retirement schemes for crew reductions under the Government's reform initiatives for the shipping and towage industries. The Government agreed to contribute $24,000 per retiree, up to a maximum of $24 million and $4.6 million for the shipping and shipping and towage industries respectively, in the three year period 1989-90 - 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the 1990-91 financial year 132 shipping industry personnel received packages under the scheme with Government contributions amounting to $3.216 million. The towage industry in this period accounted for 7 persons amounting to $168,000.</PARA>
<PARA>  While not directed towards any particular age group, the voluntary early retirement schemes allow those with the longest service to leave the industry first. In general these have been people aged 60 years and over.</PARA>
<PARA>Road Safety</PARA>
<PARA>  The Department of Transport and Communications is maintaining an ongoing road safety campaign aimed at pedestrians. The Older Pedestrians Campaign was funded in 1989-90, however, it continues as an active program aimed at the increasing the safety of pedestrians over the age of 60.</PARA>
<PARA>  Through the campaign information on pedestrian road safety is made available through State Government Transport Organisations, Hospitals, Shire Councils and the Police.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Broadcasting Commission</PARA>
<PARA>Radio--</PARA>
<PARA>  People aged 60 years or over constitute 33% of the Radio National audience nationally in terms of audience reach and over 25% of the ABC FM audience. The Metropolitan radio stations are particularly popular with this age group, with a national reach of over half a million people aged 60 and over, with news and information programs attracting the largest audience.</PARA>
<PARA>Television--</PARA>
<PARA>  On TV people aged 55 and over constitute the largest percentage of the ABC's audience based on average share of the 1991 year to date figures for the 6pm to midnight evening slot.</PARA>
<PARA>Concerts--</PARA>
<PARA>  The long established day-time Great Classics series and the new Friday morning series Tea and Symphony performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, attract a particularly large following amongst those aged 60 and over.</PARA>

The ALS engages private practitioners in civil cases where the disputes are between Aboriginal parties.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) On 10 February 1991, a Cessna 550 aircraft VH-KTK made an emergency descent and landed safely at Bathurst following a reported engine fire. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) Sydney Field Office's `Summary of Occurrences' confirmed that there was no evidence of fire, but smoke and fumes did enter the aircraft cabin. The Major Defect Report of 25 February 1991 submitted by Pacific Aviation Pty Ltd, the maintenance organisation associated with maintenance of VH-KTK, advised of smoke in the cabin of the aircraft on 10 February 1991 and that the engine had been shut down in flight.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) I am advised by the CAA that, when failures like this occur, the owner's representative is required under Civil Aviation Order 100.8 to prepare a Major Defect Report and this was done.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am also advised by the Authority that, the Order also provides for the CAA to see the engine in question prior to its being dispatched for repair. In this case that was not done.</PARA>
<PARA>  However, the CAA has stressed that this is an advisory note and does not have legal effect, ie. the provision is not mandatory. In practice, the applicable legal requirement is contained in Civil Aviation Regulation 53, which provides that an investigation into an aircraft defect may be carried out and that such a requirement be made by notice in writing. The CAA has advised that it does not normally have to take this action and no such notice was given in relation to this particular defect.</PARA>
<PARA>  Therefore, the CAA's advice was not deliberately ignored, nor was its investigation thwarted. It is, in fact, quite common for engines that experience similar problems to be returned to the manufacturer for repair. Appropriate liaison channels exist with manufacturers to enable a full report on the outcome to be received by the CAA. In this particular case a report was provided by Pratt &amp;Whitney, Canada, to the CAA and the CAA now considers, for all practical purposes, the matter closed.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) I am informed by the CAA that there was a report of metal particles in the oil prior to the accident. However, this is not unusual. The particular maintenance organisation concerned (Pacific Aviation Pty Ltd) made a judgement that the contamination was below limits and, provided the oil was regularly monitored for any adverse trends, the engine could continue to operate.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) Yes, the owner of the aircraft is Dick Smith Adventure Pty Ltd.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The 1987 Defence White Paper, "Defence of Australia", states:</PARA>
<PARA>    "The ADF undertakes some basic training in NBC defensive and protective measures, but such training does not command a high priority.  A scientific competence in NBCD matters is maintained to advise on policy and to give direction to ADF training."</PARA>
<PARA>    Maintaining a scientific competence in biological warfare defence in Australia is limited to keeping a watching brief on developments.  Australia does not conduct any research into such measures.  Consequently, Australia does not cooperate with its allies on biological warfare defence research under The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP).</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The TTCP Subgroup which covers biological warfare matters is Subgroup E - Chemical Defence. Australia is represented on:</PARA>
<PARA>    Technical Panel 1--Treatment of Chemical Agent Poisoning</PARA>
<PARA>    Technical Panel 5--Detection/Monitoring &amp;Identification of Chemical Agents</PARA>
<PARA>    Technical Panel 7--NBC Protective Equipment</PARA>
<PARA>    Technical Panel 8--Contamination Control</PARA>
<PARA>    Action Group 35--Toxicological Testing of Agents that Affect CBW Filter Performance. (No laboratory activity has occurred under this Action Group in Australia)</PARA>
<PARA>    In addition, as part of keeping a watching brief on biological defence research developments, an Australian is nominated as point of contact to receive the minutes of the meetings and papers from:</PARA>
<PARA>    Technical Panel 4--Biological Defence Technology</PARA>
<PARA>    Technical Panel 9--CB Hazard Assessment</PARA>
<PARA>    In the 1970's a TTCP Technology Liaison Group (TLG) existed which covered Biological Defence.  Australia's involvement with this TLG was limited to the nomination of an officer to be a point of contact for the receipt of correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA>    Some forms of protection are common to chemical and biological warfare defence.  Australia has collaborated with other TTCP countries, through an Ad Hoc Study Group, on the design of chemical protective measures, which incidentally would provide some protection against biological materials. Australia has been concerned with chemical protection only.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Since there is no cooperation under TTCP on biological defence research, there is nothing to disclose under Article X of the Biological Weapons Convention.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) There are no biological warfare defensive studies conducted in Defence laboratories within Australia nor does Defence fund such studies in external laboratories.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) None.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 September 1991, Senator Archer asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, a question and supplementary question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Can the Minister explain why firms which employ staff on commission are not permitted to claim expenditure for the time spent by such staff attending eligible training programs even though, when calculating the training liability of the business, commission payments made to the same staff are deemed to be part of that firm's payroll?</PARA>
<PARA>  If the Minister is going to produce this information, will he please tell the Senate what the difference is between earnings paid by way of salary and earnings paid by way of commission to people such as vehicle and machinery agents, insurance and real estate salesman, all direct sellers and all retail staff where bonus commissions are payable?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA>  Similar questions have been addressed in correspondence and discussions with the Real Estate Institute of Australia, involving my office and officials of my Department and the Australian Taxation Office. Commission payments to staff are not `directly attributable' to training, as required under s.25(1) of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990. Unlike salary or wages paid to employees during their period of training, commission payments are only incurred during periods of work (eg sales activities) and are not a cost to the employer while the employee is in training.</PARA>
<PARA>  On the other hand, commission must be counted in the employer's payroll, for purposes of determining the training obligation of the employer, as required under the definition of `salary or wages' in s.4 of the legislation.  It is wholly reasonable to</PARA>
<PARA>include commission in payroll as this is an alternative to other forms of remuneration (such as wages). It would be inequitable to employers in other industries if employers in commission-based industries had a much reduced or no obligation to train because commissions were excluded from payroll.</PARA>
<PARA>  Salaries and commissions are both forms of remuneration to employees and therefore form part of payroll for purposes of the Training Guarantee. The essential difference is that salaries are paid to employees during their training and work periods whereas commission is only payable when the employees are in a working situation.</PARA>
