</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2755" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I will not. In doing so, I will be quite different from Senator Parer who, a few weeks ago, selectively leaked documents which can only be termed commercial-in-confidence-much to his own personal gratification at the time but much, I think, to the chagrin of the people involved in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am accused by Senator Parer of a cover-up. In order to put the matter straight, I think I should give the Senate information on this matter. It might take me an extra couple of minutes, but, in order to ensure that we do not go on wild-goose chases this afternoon, it is important for the Senate to understand what has been involved. The policy objectives that I have pursued in contracts have been essentially threefold: first, to ensure the best value for government; secondly, to ensure a fair tendering process; and, thirdly, to ensure that our policy of purchase Australia is given teeth.</PARA>
<PARA> In this particular case, the cheapest tenders were not, in all cases, accepted. This was the result of the methodology used; this was the basket approach that was adopted. The average price of four products was assessed without weighting being given to items likely to be procured in greater volumes. In fact, in Nashua's case-the case that got some publicity-one of its products which failed to get on the contract was in fact 35 per cent cheaper than another supplier's successful product. By any measure, that was a sign that the taxpayer was not getting the best value for money and the best price.</PARA>
<PARA> I should also indicate that, despite the misinformation at the time, what we are talking about here is not a contract; we are talking about a standing offer. A government purchasing officer can choose to buy from any of the suppliers on the panel, but there is no guarantee that inclusion on the panel will result in a sale. That was a deliberate piece of misinformation that was perpetrated by the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, price was a factor. I have also said that the Government has a purchase Australia policy. It was not taken into account in assessing tenderers. Purchase Australia does not require Australian companies to be included on supply panels, but it does require suppliers to give every consideration to Australian suppliers, especially those like Nashua, which is a long term government supplier and, I must say, of products of high quality. In fact, I am informed that one of the products it was tendering was nominated for Australian quality awards for two years in succession.</PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that my sins in this area are that I committed the sin of supporting Australian industry and I also committed the sin of wanting the best value for money goods on the panel, in line with government purchasing policy.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, there was some publicity at the time. I must make it clear that at all times it was clear that Nashua's original bid in relation to the two particular diskettes would have been successful if selection had been based on value for money of various items, especially high volume items, as opposed to the basket approach.</PARA>
<PARA> It has to be understood also in this context that suppliers can and do change their prices after these standing offers are issued. This is specifically provided for in the tendering document. I am advised that Nashua, as a previous supplier, had often reduced its prices in favour of the Commonwealth during previous contracts, as have other suppliers. I am advised that such price reductions are proper.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has worked from a couple of selectively leaked documents. It is typical of the approach it has taken; it is typical of the approach that the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, is showing in this area. It is noteworthy that it has opposed consistently the purchase Australia campaign. It has opposed our meet-the-buyer fairs, and now it is opposing moves to improve government tendering.</PARA>
<PARA> We have seen Senator Parer raving on the issue. Is he asking us to believe that, had he been in the same position, he would not have acted to improve the system-he would have let the tendering system be compromised? Are we being asked to accept that he would have ignored clear problems in the tendering process? Are we also being asked to accept that he would have ignored reasonable representations from local business, which has raised this matter with a number of people? I think it is appropriate that Senator Parer may not get a chance at this job.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer asks about the report. I am not inclined to release the report. Senator Parer irresponsibly brought commercial-in-confidence information into the public domain. Senior officers of my Department came to see me after reviewing the information and themselves indicated that there should be further investigation. I must say that the Secretary to the Department thought that there ought to be a review of the tendering process generally, including a review of this tender as one example of where concerns had been raised. Without my involvement, he chose a review team, and that review was undertaken. The team reported to the Secretary in relation to the tender.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me itemise a number of points that that review team made. It stated that planning for the process was inadequate and that market knowledge was partially deficient. It also said that the approach to specifications was sound-that is accepted as well; that the tendering process would have benefited from a post-tender negotiation; that the methodology was not sufficiently disclosed to the tenderers; that the evaluation could have been better done; and that the Australia-New Zealand supply policy had no material effect on the process.</PARA>
<PARA> Also importantly, the review team reported to the Secretary that, although these problems had occurred, it did not believe that the value of correcting the deficiencies warranted cancelling the contract. The Secretary and other officers considered this advice and, on their own assessment, advised me that leaving the matter as it was, taking the `do nothing' option, was inappropriate. I met with the Secretary and other senior officers yesterday. I was informed of the results of the review and of their own consideration of the issues and was advised, both in writing and verbally, that I should act and not let the status quo continue.</PARA>
<PARA> Consequent upon that and after considering the options available, as assessed and as given to me by my Department, I was advised to put Nashua on the panel as well as several other suppliers disadvantaged by the methodology of the tendering process. Those suppliers will go on for the products for which they are price competitive. I accepted that advice after balancing both equity and cost arguments.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, as the responsible Minister in this area, I have to ensure that the process is fair and effective. I was concerned that there had been no post-tender negotiations with Nashua and others, although one supplier was given a second chance and was subsequently put on the panel after the close of tender. The Secretary to the Department has advised me that the review team will continue to review the tendering processes to ensure that similar problems do not occur in the future. I agree with that decision as well.</PARA>
<PARA> Our aim as a government is to encourage world class, internationally competitive Australian industry. It is imperative that we use selection criteria that do not exclude competitive local suppliers on arbitrary grounds. What we are doing is something that the Opposition has consistently opposed: we are giving teeth to our policy of encouraging Australian industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What was the outcome of recent discussions with employers and unions concerning the Government's waterfront reform program?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2757" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the flu, so I ask honourable senators to bear with me; I am not my usual sparkling self. Nineteen hours of inhaling the Prime Minister's cigar smoke has destroyed all my antibodies. In answer to the question, last week negotiations on waterfront reform were held with the parties involved. An agreement was reached which provides a certain wages outcome for the remainder of the reform process-something which the employers are rather pleased about. Captain Richard Setchell described the increases as realistic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time we succeeded in overcoming what I publicly described last year as a structural weakness in the process. Whilst incentives had been built in for those workers leaving the industry, on an enterprise by enterprise basis, no consideration had been given in the original process to providing incentives enterprise by enterprise for the workers who were remaining and working under the new conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the crisis caused by the national wage case decision, we took the opportunity of negotiating with the unions-and it was a difficult negotiation-to overcome that structural weakness. For the first time in the process, we now have an agreement whereby none of these award payments will be made unless the agreements are in place in that particular enterprise. That involves the first increase of 2 per cent being paid in July and the subsequent increases being paid in January and July next year, which will carry it through to the end of the reform process. They will only be paid conditional upon the actual productivity provided by those enterprise agreements being put in place.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the non-stop interjections from those opposite about resignation-not that this will be any news-I ask them to at least get the date right. I know that they are all running on John Sharp's statement that the deadline was 6 May. I said earlier that John Sharp is distinguished by not yet having issued a public statement-and his record, I can demonstrate, is impeccable-that has not been factually wrong. He is continually talking about 6 May. The deadline that I set myself was 4 April of this year. Laurie Oakes got the date right in the Sunday program and even that failed to impact on the understanding of the shadow Minister for shipping and waterfront reform. The date of 4 April came and went without a blink from the Opposition. The date was not 6 May; it was 4 April. Mr Sharp is not very sharp at all.</PARA>
<PARA> I said last year-and it remains the case-that enterprise agreements are the fundamental plank upon which the Government's program of waterfront reform rests, that is, breaking down the current system of a national pool of labour to that which is employed enterprise by enterprise. It was essential, despite the idiot industry commission assertions of Mr Sharp, that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission be involved in this process, despite his assertions that it had nothing to do with it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise a point of order. I submit that it is not parliamentary for a senator to call a member of the other place an idiot or to say that he is making idiot industry commission assertions. It is unparliamentary to say that he is an idiot. I ask that you require the Minister to withdraw that assertion which defames Mr Sharp, who is in the other place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have withdrawn if I had had to; my resistance is low today. Mr President, despite those assertions, the Industrial Relations Commission was an absolutely essential part in the process in that the agreements-if they were to be implemented and given force, rather than simply being framed and hung on the wall-had to be ratified in the Commission under the award. The difficulty was that there was no recognition of the enterprise agreements in any of the 20 existing awards in the industry, and that had to be overcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The force of what I said last year was that the enterprise agreements had to be implemented and the award had to be restructured to give force to this implementation. I must say that this is no news; I said it publicly on a number of occasions at the time. An interim award writing in these new conditions was successfully negotiated in July last year. On 21 December last year, the National Terminals (Australia) Ltd agreement was ratified in the Industrial Relations Commission under the new provisions of the award that were necessary to be put in place to give effect and force to the implementation. In fact, the deadline was met, as I said at the time, on 21 December last year. In conclusion, if the Opposition wants to continue to call for this resignation, at least it should get the date right: it was 4 April; not 6 May.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. No doubt the Minister is aware that the Western Australian Government has announced that it will proceed with the building of the new coal-fired power station at Collie in Western Australia (WA). Is the Minister also aware that the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), in assessing the State Energy Commission of Western Australia's proposal for a 600-megawatt coal-fired power station, described it as `one of the least preferable options' from an environmental viewpoint and recommended that conservation and efficiency improvements, use of renewable energy sources, or use of gas-including combined cycle-turbines be adopted before a coal-fired power station? In view of the Commonwealth Government's decision to adopt the target of a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2005, and the fact that the power station is to be built by Transfield Mitsubishi, is the Government prepared to use its constitutional powers over foreign investments to ensure that a decision by the Western Australian Government does not overturn Commonwealth efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?</PARA></TALK.START>

Clearly, all the States and their energy Ministers, plus the Federal governments over the next 15 years, will be working to achieve it. I doubt very much if an announcement made very recently for a 15-year program can now be held up to investigation to see the progress; that will take some time. The announcement that was made about the program was a serious one. The Federal Government is absolutely serious about its implementation-so are the States-but we have to give this some time to achieve results.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to a statement made several days ago by Paul Leventhal, President of the Nuclear Control Center in Washington, that Iraq has slightly less than 50 pounds of highly enriched uranium that could be fashioned into a Nagasaki-sized bomb by a fairly competent team in about one year. How much highly enriched uranium did Iraq have before the outbreak of the Middle East war? How much does Iraq now have? Is Iraq a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)? From which country or countries did Iraq acquire this uranium? Is that country or those countries signatories to the NPT? Has Australia supplied uranium to that country or those countries? Could any Australian uranium have found its way to Iraq? Could there be any Australian uranium among that which Iraq still possesses?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2759" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To our knowledge, Iraq had about 24 kilograms of fresh highly enriched uranium fuel before the outbreak of the Gulf war, all of which was and is subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. Under its NPT safeguards agreement with the IAEA, Iraq has to account for the same amount of nuclear materials as it did before the war. The location and condition of that material will be subject to a special IAEA inspection in conjunction with the United Nations (UN) Special Commission on Iraq in the next week or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the third question as to whether Iraq is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, yes, it is. Regarding the question of from which countries Iraq acquired its uranium, the answer is France and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). As to their status in relation to the NPT, France is not a party, but the USSR is. As to the final question regarding Australian uranium, Iraq is not an approved destination for Australian uranium exports and no nuclear safeguards agreement exists between Iraq and Australia. Under the stringent safeguards arrangements applying to Australian uranium exports, no Australian obligated nuclear material is in Iraq or could have found its way to Iraq.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is simply a matter of confidence in the particular context of the UN special commission on Iraq which has now been set up, the chemical dimension of which will be headed by a very senior and highly regarded Australian. Were it just those provisions applying in the abstract without the enforcement mechanism of the UN special commission, endorsed and set up under the peace treaty arrangements, maybe one's degree of confidence would be a little less, but the fact that the IAEA safeguard exercise is being conducted under those auspices does give us some good grounds for confidence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to the ongoing political violence in South Africa and the deadline of 9 May set by the African National Congress requiring the South African Government to stem such violence, failing which the ANC would consider withdrawing from negotiations. What is the Minister's assessment of the current situation in South Africa and the prospects for further progress towards dismantling the apartheid system?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2760" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has to be said that the current period in South Africa is really one of crucial importance in that that country is facing perhaps the most serious crises to threaten the reform process to date. In the first place let me comment on the progress that has been made in relation to the surmounting of the so-called obstacles to further negotiation. It is a matter for disappointment and concern that the South African Government has failed to meet in full the commitments that had been agreed upon with the African National Congress for conclusion by 30 April in relation to the release of political prisoners and the clearing of the way for the return of exiles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far as prisoners are concerned, according to the South African Government itself on 30 April, 933 prisoners had been released or were in the process of being released. On the same day the Human Rights Commission, which is a very well respected South African non-government organisation, estimated that just over 900 identified political prisoners were still in detention. Again, on 30 April the government announced that indemnity had been granted to 4,530 exiles out of a total of 5,872 applications dealt with so far. The total number of exiles is still unclear, with figures varying between 20,000 and 40,000, not all of whom would be expected to return but clearly a large number of applicants do remain.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the remaining obstacles in addition to those are concerned, it was promised that there would be a review and repeal of repressive security legislation. In that respect, on 2 May-just a few days ago-President de Klerk did foreshadow significant amendments to the Internal Security Act. Although the extent of changes to be made remains unclear, it may well be reasonable to assume that here, and with the prisoners and exiles matters, the remaining issues will be capable of being resolved in the next few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, as to the remaining preliminary issue, that is, the repeal of the three legislative pillars of apartheid so called-the Group Areas Act, the Lands Act and the Population Registration Act-although a number of questions have arisen about the details of some of that legislation, including in particular the Lands Act, again I do not think there is any room for great pessimism at this stage. It is likely, in other words, that this legislation will be through the parliament, as promised, by the end of this legislative session. So on these issues the record is mixed; not terribly happy so far as the 30 April deadline is concerned, but not a cause for enormous alarm, either.</PARA>
<PARA> Where there is ground for very serious concern is the continued high level of political violence: 771 people have been killed as a result of political violence so far this year, with over 100 killed in the past week alone. On 5 April the ANC issued an open letter urging the South African Government to meet, by 9 May, various demands regarding political violence, failing which it would consider withdrawing from negotiations. This cannot be regarded as an empty threat and the figures I have quoted indicate the tragic dimensions of the situation that currently exists.</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly no side in this is blameless but I must record the Australian Government's particular concern about persistent reports of the complicity of police and other security forces in acts of violence. It is essential that the South African Government demonstrate a genuine commitment toward ending political violence. While all parties must be prepared to take immediate steps toward controlling violence and restoring public confidence in the administration of law and order, the South African Government has a particular responsibility for ensuring the security of its citizens.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has over recent months consistently welcomed progress made toward dismantling the apartheid system, and I am very pleased to note that President de Klerk has acknowledged the constructive approach we have taken. But he and his colleagues must also be aware that the support of governments such as our own for the reform process cannot be taken for granted in the absence of concrete and decisive action towards stemming the tragic violence now taking place, and the creation of the necessary political conditions so that a peaceful negotiated settlement to South Africa's political problems can be achieved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have in fact already answered this question in answering a question from Senator Faulkner. I am pleased at the encouraging sign of personal advancement from Senator Campbell: at least the question was not about Western Australia Inc. I am glad he has broadened his horizons somewhat in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year in an interview that I gave in May I did identify, as I have already said, that the fundamental plank of the Government's reform program was to secure enterprise agreements, enterprise by enterprise, in ports around Australia in order to deliver the much needed reform on the Australian waterfront. Essential to that process was the implementation of those agreements. As I have said in the Parliament many times before, there is not much point getting an agreement if it cannot be implemented in the workplace. To give legal force to those agreements, the in-principle agreement provided for those enterprise agreements to be ratified in the Industrial Relations Commission-despite the nonsense from Mr Sharp last year when he said that there was no mention of the Industrial Relations Commission anywhere in the process. In fact, it is an absolutely essential part of it.</PARA>
<PARA> Last year when I gave that interview I discussed the question of award restructuring because the 20 awards that existed at that time did not have any provision for the ratification of enterprise agreements as such a creature had never existed before. Therefore, there had to be a restructuring of the awards so that they could be ratified in the Commission. Because of the difficulty with human resources which occurred last year-and all this has been said in the Senate before-it was clear that it would be difficult to advance simultaneously the negotiations on enterprise agreements whilst negotiating the award.</PARA>
<PARA> But at the same time I went to Bill Kelty with this problem-the reason I went to him was that it was essentially a union problem-and I said, `Well, we've got a difficulty'. The original thought in my mind when I went to Bill Kelty was that perhaps the Australian Council of Trade Unions could provide additional human resources to carry out the award restructuring component of the reform process whilst the unions themselves got on with what they had to do, which was the enterprise agreements.</PARA>
<PARA> His response was to come up with a better idea-and all of this is contained in the Senate Hansard-of an interim award which specifically corrected the award restructuring problem and gave the opportunity for these agreements to be ratified in the Commission. That award got up as a consent agreement with the employers in July last year-and, again, that was advised publicly to the Senate then. The deadline that I had set myself in May was met-as I have also said before publicly-on 21 December last year when the National Terminals agreement was ratified under the new award provisions in the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> All of this fuss seems to have been made since the interview that I did on the Sunday program. Nothing that I said on the Sunday program was new; it had all been said before. The only conclusion I can draw from all of this is that news has not actually happened until it is reported on the Sunday program. Perhaps that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA> That deadline was met and I might add-in order to correct once again the mistake which has just been perpetuated by the honourable senator opposite-that the deadline was in fact 4 April this year, which came and went without any response from the Opposition, not 6 May. But the target that I set myself was in fact achieved on 21 December last year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the first question about targeting of our customers by the United States, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has estimated that the price discrimination effect of the United States export enhancement program (EEP) has cost Australian wheat growers between $A127m and $A174m in 1990-91 in terms of forgone income. Subsidies up to $US50 per tonne have been made in recent months under this program. In addition to this cost, Australian growers' export returns have been further eroded by the general global price depressing effect of the United States export enhancement program. This effect is more difficult to quantify but, clearly, it substantially increases the overall cost of the export enhancement program to the Australian wheat industry. For example, prices in some subsidised markets have recently been discounted to as low as $US65 to $US70 per tonne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of competition from the European Economic Community, the impact of the EEC's export subsidies on export restitutions is more difficult to quantify than the impact of the export enhancement program, because the European Community export restitutions is just one element of a complex and interrelated support structure of the European common agricultural policy (CAP). The other major elements of the CAP are domestic intervention prices and import barriers. Separating and quantifying the specific impacts of these three elements is not easy. However, given that the European Community's export restitutions are currently prevailing at some $US150 per tonne, European Community export subsidisation is clearly having a substantial depressing effect on world prices and, therefore, the returns to Australian wheat growers.</PARA>
<PARA> The last question concerned the short term prospects. As the world price for wheat is bid down in the aggressive trade war between the United States and the European Community and as Australian markets are depressed by subsidies, the Australian wheat industry is, of course, forced to accept lower prices in order to deliver tonnages into these markets. The impact of this on grower returns is only too obvious. The Australian Wheat Board's estimated pool return for 1990-91 has fallen to $A115 per tonne, which will generate significant hardship to many in the Australian wheat industry. Against this background, the Government has announced an extension of the Government guarantee of Australian Wheat Board borrowings by around $100m for this season. In addition, the Government has protested strongly to both the United States and the European Community about the current aggressive level of export subsidisation.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate will know, a joint parliamentary delegation led by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett, recently visited Washington to register strongly Australia's concern at the EEP and to highlight its impact on the Australian wheat industry. The Australian Government will continue to register our strong objections to both the United States and the European Community export subsidisation practices at every available opportunity and will continue to seek the winding back of subsidies and other trade distorting measures in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.</PARA>

<PARA> In September 1988, on the advice of my Department-which, pre-empting Senator Hill, I am happy to table as the Prime Minister will in the other place in response to this same question which he had just a few minutes ago-I agreed to Mr Burke's request that he be given a continuing role in respect of Australia's trade with eastern Europe.

In terms of the balance of Australian national interests involved, given the particular character of the assistance that he was arguing he would be able to render, assistance which was carefully evaluated by my Department and on balance agreed to by me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That visit-and he made only one such visit to eastern Europe-was made on the basis of certain conditions that I specified with some precision. It was only an approval to travel in his capacity as an official of the Australian Government. He had to give advance notice of his travel to my Department and to relevant posts to ensure effective coordination.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the visit to eastern Europe in April 1989, he made a visit to Geneva in September 1988 to meet Mr Hancock and Soviet representatives, but his visit to Romania in April 1989 was for discussions with senior Romanian Ministers. On the latter visit he was accompanied, as I told the Estimates Committee, by the Australian Ambassador to Romania, who is resident in Belgrade, and the Australian Trade Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1990 when the issue came up again, I decided that in the light of developments in eastern Europe as well as the new role that David Charles, formerly of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, was playing in terms of developing and encouraging trade with that region, the arrangement involving Mr Burke was no longer required, and it was brought to an end. There was absolutely nothing secret about this arrangement. Again, as I told the Estimates Committee it was raised with my office by Mr Peacock's office in January 1990, and my understanding is that full details were then given, but Mr Peacock was unable then or is unable now to make anything of it.</PARA>
<PARA> As for the Prime Minister's involvement in that, I think there may have been some passing reference to him by me about my intention to respond in this particular way, but it was not a subject which was substantively discussed, as I recall, and certainly not a matter on which the Prime Minister expressed any particular view. He left it to my judgment. I table that document.</PARA>

A relevant consideration might be whether the operation of the account in question was an active political exercise or whether rather, for example, it was simply a belated endeavour to divest himself of previous responsibilities in a way that we might think unwise but nonetheless raises questions different from active political involvement. It is that kind of fact that remains to be resolved. The question, however, and let me address it-if there was active political involvement, would it be appropriate behaviour for a serving ambassador?-is one that, of course, I have had regard to.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are simply no formally applicable or codified clear-cut standards in this area. We do have the Bowen code of conduct governing public officials and we do have Public Service guidelines, neither of which are technically applicable to ambassadors but which I would regard as appropriately applicable to them. None of them, however, in any way expressly rule out the question of active political involvement by serving public servants, however senior, in any way that would be regarded as directly applicable to the kind of circumstance we are dealing with in Dublin. If anything, they endorse and give an imprimatur to an appropriately judged level of political activity by the people in question. There is certainly no absolute ruling out of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I do acknowledge that, while it is difficult to codify the standard of behaviour expected of officials in these circumstances, the standards applicable to an ambassador may in some circumstances differ from the standards which are appropriate to public servants and office holders generally. I have taken all of those considerations into account, and it does seem to me that certainly such activity, if it did involve active political activity by a serving ambassador, would be both imprudent and inappropriate. I am in no doubt of that. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is in no doubt of that, and has given me advice to that effect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. What is the significance of the Antarctic Treaty parties' agreement reached in Madrid last week to conclude an environment protection instrument which will prohibit mining in Antarctica?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2769" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The outcome of the Madrid meeting is extremely gratifying, a very fitting culmination to the intensive diplomatic campaign which was initiated by Australia and France just two years ago. The Madrid meeting agreed to a draft legal instrument which prohibits mining in Antarctica and which establishes a comprehensive regime for the protection of the Antarctic environment. It will provide the most comprehensive environment protection possible and marks a quite major breakthrough in prohibiting mining indefinitely. The prohibition of mining has been central to the package of stringent environment protection measures which are advocated by Australia and our co-sponsors-France, Belgium and Italy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The mining prohibition provisions are extremely tight. Only after 50 years could any party to the Treaty call a review conference on the instrument generally. Any amendments to the mining prohibitions emerging from such a conference would require the agreement of all current consultative parties, of which Australia is one. Thus it is the case that Australia and the other 25 current consultative parties effectively hold a veto on mining in the future. The draft negotiated in Madrid now goes back to the Antarctic Treaty governments for formal agreement. Australia expects that governments will not have difficulties in endorsing the outcome of that meeting. We are urging governments to move quickly so that parties can finalise the negotiations at the next meeting, scheduled for June in Madrid.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it was only in May 1989 that Prime Minister Hawke announced the Australian Government's decision not to sign the Minerals Convention but to seek a permanent ban on mining activity and a comprehensive environmental protection regime for Antarctica. Given the intense initial international opposition to this approach from so many powerful countries-not least the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Japan-to get to the present point in just two years represents an extraordinarily successful exercise in Australian diplomacy. I pay tribute to the dedicated efforts of the Australian team drawn from three Government departments, led by my own. Their work is of major importance not only to Australia today but to future generations of the whole international community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Government to clarify its new Industrial Relations and Occupational Superannuation policies in the light of its espousal of enterprise bargaining and the rejection of the central role for the IRC. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has brought forward this matter of urgency today because of the extraordinary degree of conflict and confusion which the Government has created as a result of its own policies relating to the industrial relations system and occupational superannuation following the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the national wage case on 16 April this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The degree of confusion since then has been remarkable, with quite evidently different views being pursued by different Ministers and the matter largely being taken out of the hands of the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook. However, before I detail to a greater extent those aspects of the matter, I would like to make it perfectly clear that, as is stated in the urgency motion, the Government's espousal of enterprise bargaining and its rejection of the central role of the Industrial Relations Commission are movements in the direction of the Opposition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition strongly supports the establishment of true, genuine enterprise bargaining in our industrial relations system on a purely voluntary basis, of course, which I do not know that Senator Cook fully understands. The fact of the matter is that in this Senate on 18 December last year there was a debate in which the Opposition put forward the details of that policy. I simply want to reiterate the fact that the Opposition regards that as the centrepiece of its industrial relation policy. It has been developed steadily over the years that we have been in opposition, but it was fully established as long ago as 1986 and there have been certain refinements to it since then. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy on voluntary agreements being made at enterprise level between employer and employee, subject only to the need for minimum hourly rates and the observation of health and safety conditions, does not require further approval by the Industrial Relations Commission, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) or any group of Ministers who may be self-appointed guardians of that system-a development which now seems to be occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is certainly not here today to criticise those aspects of the Government's debate which seem to be moving-although not really very clearly-in the direction of true and genuine enterprise agreements, agreements voluntarily entered into by employer and employee governing the terms and conditions of employment in a particular enterprise. To that extent, in so far as we can give any very clear indication at all about Government policy, we would certainly welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the stand that we take in relation to major reform of the industrial relations system, inevitably there is in our policy a change in the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. Obviously, if our policy works fully as, indeed, we are determined it should, the role of the Industrial Relations Commission will be reduced and certainly will be a very different role from that which it has played traditionally under a centralised industrial relations system-the sort of system of which Senator Cook has been one of the most ardent advocates. It is the advocacy which he has pursued in relation to the central role of the Industrial Relations Commission that has added to the confusion which we now see. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it perfectly clear at the outset of this debate that the Opposition is not opposed in any way to the developments which seem to be occurring, in which there may be some hope that the Government itself, in reconsidering its own position, will move much closer to and, indeed, adopt the views of the Opposition on this vital subject. </PARA>
<PARA> However, what is of such concern and such urgency is the fact that the Government seems to be in a state of confusion, with conflicting views being expressed about the way in which it sees enterprise bargaining being brought into effect and about the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. The reason for this confusion is that the Industrial Relations Commission did not allow itself simply to be a doormat and a rubber stamp for the Government and its accord. We in the Opposition would not agree with many aspects of the Commission's decision of 16 April. But the Government, which has been strongly supporting the Industrial Relations Commission and its role, has now refused to accept what Senator Cook has constantly maintained in debate in this chamber, that is, that the umpire's decision has to be obeyed. </PARA>
<PARA> In so far as the Industrial Relations Commission is an umpire, the Opposition, under its industrial relations policy, strongly supports the decision of the umpire. Where we fundamentally differed from the Government in the past was our belief that the jurisdiction of that umpire should not be all pervasive and that there should be this very major role for voluntary agreements. But where there is not a voluntary agreement, where there is conflict and where the parties go to the Industrial Relations Commission, as they will be able to under our policy, the umpire's decision must be respected. Not only is the Government not respecting the umpire's decision but also it is repudiating it and proceeding with its own employees to enter into a totally different agreement from that of the umpire. It is conspiring with the ACTU in its endeavours to undermine totally the umpire in this particular case since 16 April. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go back to some of the reasons for this confusion and conflict on the part of the Government on this vital matter. If one looks at the accord mark VI entered into by the Federal Government and the ACTU on 21 February 1990, one sees the pre-eminent, central role that is accorded the Industrial Relations Commission. Paragraph 3 of accord mark VI states:</PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly the parties have agreed that the focal point of the wage system must continue to be the National Wage Case. The National Wage Case should consider-</PARA>
<PARA>a number of things, including-</PARA>
<PARA>The principles upon which enterprise agreements would be determined. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Government has now said that it will not accept the views of the Industrial Relations Commission on enterprise agreements, and it is proceeding to cobble together some sort of policy of its own. I hope the Minister will be able to enlighten us today about the way enterprise agreements may be determined. As far as the Government is concerned, they certainly will not be determined by any principles that the Industrial Relations Commission lays down in a national wage case, which the Government's own accord says is the way it should be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord also records that the unions have given a number of commitments to facilitate restructuring, including commitments required by the Industrial Relations Commission. It goes on to say that these commitments will be honoured by the union movement. These commitments are being totally repudiated by the union movement led by Mr Kelty and Mr Ferguson, the President. As I said, in conjunction with the Treasurer (Mr Keating), they are proceeding along a totally different route from the very accord under which the Government has said it has been operating. One of the first questions must be where the Government is going in light of the fact that it is repudiating not only the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission but also its own accord. </PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of Senator Cook until 16 April, or in fact until a few days after 16 April, in relation to the Government's policies on the industrial relations system-I might add that my colleague Senator Alston will deal with the subject of occupational superannuation and I propose to address myself simply to this question of the policies relating to the industrial relations system-was shown in his response during the debate on an urgency motion in the Senate on 18 December last which, on that occasion, was:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Parliament to enable employers and employees to make voluntary agreements to determine the conditions of employment in their own work place without the intervention of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook got terribly excited about the proposition that we put forward: that anything should be done without the imprimatur of the Industrial Relations Commission. Senator Cook went so far as to say:</PARA>
<PARA>What this urgency motion does is a most scurrilous and unprincipled thing . . . it attacks the umpire. It says, `The umpire has no place; the umpire is out of court; it should not apply; the umpire has no standing'. </PARA>
<PARA>That was of course very wide of the mark in answering the Opposition's case. But the fact is that Senator Cook went to great lengths to reiterate this central role of the Industrial Relations Commission as recently as 18 December last. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The process of conciliation and arbitration was founded in this country in 1904 . . . It has served this country well. It is highly regarded . . . It is passing strange that the party that aspires to be the government of this country should now want to undermine the central institution which guarantees good industrial relations outcomes in this country . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, that is the very thing that this Government, in conjunction with the ACTU, is now doing itself in relation to the conciliation and arbitration system. The position of the Government at the moment is totally at odds with that which Senator Cook so strongly, indeed if not violently, espoused as recently as December last year. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not only in the Senate that Senator Cook had this to say about the Industrial Relations Commission. On the AM radio program the next morning he was interviewed by a person named David Burgess who said to him:</PARA>
<PARA>If you can't get agreement with the unions, what should happen to the SPC deal?</PARA>
<PARA>That was the debate that was going on at the time, which we all remember so well. Senator Cook replied:</PARA>
<PARA>It should go to the Commission, where it's intended to go now, and the Commission should arbitrate. And when the Commission makes a decision, it will be the right decision. There is an independent umpire; we support the system of arbitration in this country. We should simply, when there is a problem, step back and let it do its job. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is now doing everything in its power to stop the Industrial Relations Commission doing the job which the Government itself had assigned to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook made a number of other statements to a similar effect at about this time. I will not repeat them, but I simply report that he is on the record, time and time again, as having spoken in that vein about the central role of the Industrial Relations Commission. Of course, we now know about the decision which so offended the Government because it so hurt its pride. The Industrial Relations Commission had the independence, which I understood the Government thought was a good thing, but once it exercised its independence and did not rubber-stamp the Government's submission and what was said to be the application of the accord-although it is doubtful whether the accord would have allowed for this-the Government went along with the ACTU in really rejecting the system that it had supported for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> The President of the ACTU, Mr Ferguson, has also made remarks about the demise of the centralised system. We know clearly that Mr Kelty is the one who is leading the charge against the system as a result of the ACTU losing its case before the Commission in the national wage case. </PARA>
<PARA> The major changes to the role of the Industrial Relations Commission now foreseen by the Government are being espoused by the Treasurer himself, Mr Keating, who is relegating its role to a very minor one indeed. When addressing the Economic Planning Advisory Council on 19 April, he concluded with these remarks:</PARA>
<PARA>Within the Accord framework we intend to press ahead with the achievement of a more decentralised system of wage determination . . . It is a framework we hope the Commission may find its way to embrace for the Commission will continue to have an important role to play in providing a safety net for the lower paid and in the settlement of industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very attenuated role. The role assigned to the Industrial Relations Commission, recognised by Senator Cook himself in an interview with Michelle Grattan reported yesterday in the Age, is a minor one compared with the role of the Government to determine within the accord the major wages policy for the nation-not the Commission. But there seems to be great confusion as to how far that will go. Will it be done entirely at the political level between Mr Keating and Mr Kelty, or whoever holds the roles as Treasurer in the Government and Secretary of the ACTU? It is certainly not a role that has been assigned to the Minister for Industrial Relations, who in recent weeks seems to have been assigned to a bit player's role in this whole exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) does not seem to be particularly happy with the Keating role or the Kelty claim, if I may put it that way. He seems to be seeing some sort of halfway role between the traditional one of the Commission, which has been so strongly defended and supported by Senator Cook in the past but maybe not so strongly now, although that is not clear. The Prime Minister seems to be looking for a role for it, as he recognised in the waterfront agreement. We have this confusion, this conflict between a very different industrial relations system which is foreseen by the Treasurer, Mr Keating; a more traditional role which has been referred to by Senator Cook; and some sort of halfway role in the system, which seems to be that which has been referred to by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of all this is confusion-confusion which must be cleared up by the Government as soon as possible in such a vital area as this. Not only the waterfront but also the metal trades and the whole of the industrial relations area are confused and unable to understand what is expected of them. Then there is the Industrial Relations Commission itself, which must be in a state of total misunderstanding about the role which is expected of it. I refer finally to the Minister's remarks in the debate in December when he said, `If you do not have a wages policy, you do not have an economic policy and you cannot govern'. That applies to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an urgency motion under the signature of Senator Durack, which claims that the Government needs to clarify, to quote the words of the motion, `its new industrial relations and occupational superannuation policies'. This motion must fail on the grounds of that assertion alone. There is nothing new in what the Government is saying or in what it is doing in industrial relations. There may be confusion, as Senator Durack has said, but if there is, it is confusion for him. There is no confusion for the Government. Anyone who wants to see the thread of continuity between our position prior to the national wage case and now need only turn to the national wage case submission put on behalf of the Commonwealth. That sets out more clearly than any other document the philosophical and policy view of the Government on wages and wage fixation, and follows through many of the arguments that Senator Durack held in his speech to the Senate a moment ago as being matters of confusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to clear up one of the confusions that Senator Durack has mentioned. He said that there is an apparent move by the Government in the direction of Opposition policy on industrial relations. That is just not true. The Opposition policy and the Government policy on industrial relations is one of the great divides in Australian politics. It is one of those things that separates a Labor government from a conservative coalition. We are not moving to Senator Durack's policy whatever. We are moving, consistent with our mandate achieved at the last election, on the directions laid out in accord mark VI, to decentralise the centralised wage fixing system, and to do so through the agency of embracing what I will call, for the sake of making the distinction, company level bargaining rather than Senator Durack's term, in current usage by the Opposition, enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great distinguishing features about a Labor policy on industrial relations is regard for people who have weak bargaining power, who have little industrial muscle and who therefore cannot, by the exercise of industrial muscle, obtain outcomes on wages that are fair and reasonable. Our policy recognises that there is a rational case in many of the examples of people in this sort of situation, and they need to have access to an industrial relations commission to be able to argue why, despite their lack of industrial muscle, wage justice in their case should apply. The decision should be based on the rationality of the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest anyone jump to a conclusion that I am advocating use of industrial muscle in other areas, let me disavow that immediately by saying that we are talking here about a framework created by the accord which enables moderate wage outcomes to be achieved; which enables living standards in the broader community to be protected; which enables Australia to turn itself, in the face of our industry statement, in reducing tariff protection and exposing industry to greater international competition; and which enables Australia to become a more competitive entity. They are not things contemplated in the Opposition's industrial relations strategy. We have a wages policy and an accord with the Australian trade union movement which enables us to implement that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has a collection of theories and a list of wishes and bigotries about industrial relations that blinker its members. That is not surprising, given that the architect of Opposition policy is someone who, in his ordinary working life, has been a solicitor; who is now a politician who has not spent any time in the real life of an Australian workplace; and who paints an idealised picture of what an outcome might be. That idealised picture is meant to be a feelgood picture-let us all feel good and nice about what this lovely outcome would be-but that picture never ever explains how one moves to that fuzzy, lovey outcome from the present set of circumstances. What are the transitional steps? How does one manage them? What are the adjustments one needs to make? It is a picture that never ever explains where else in the world there is a model to which the Liberal Party in Australia aspires so that we can look at a working model and examine how it operates and test the theories and assertions about the Liberal policy against real life. There is nowhere else in the world that the Opposition can point to as a living, working example of what it means. It is an invention of its own. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has another fatal defect; that is, it is not able to manage wages policy in this country with any degree of certainty of what the aggregate wage outcome will be, as a macro-economic management tool, for the wider economic management of Australia. It has no way of saying how, under its policy, that can be obtained and how a wages policy can work to the national good. There is no element of explanation. The inquiries as to how that is to be done are passed off while this vague image of what a new future might be is explained. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy is a proven policy. It is a policy which enables the aggregate wage outcome to be set. In the eight years that this Government has been in office, every time we have set it in our Budget we have reached it or in fact overachieved and undershot that level of aggregate wage outcome. It is a policy which has enabled unit labour costs in this country, over the eight years of our administration, to fall by 10 per cent. It is a policy which has enabled the level of industrial disputes in this country, comparing the Hawke years with the Fraser years, to fall by 61 per cent. If the Greiner Government of New South Wales had had a more enlightened industrial relations approach, and if New South Wales did not drag down the average for Australia and distort it because of the higher levels of industrial disputes than in other Australian States, that figure would have been better. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a policy which has led to a massive increase in employment. Even now, in the midst of a recession, the record of this Government over that of the Fraser years is an increase in employment of 1.4 million people. That is a significant achievement. It is a policy that has meant that the inflation rate in Australia is below that of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average and is trending even lower. They are the achievements of our policy. </PARA>
<PARA> To compare our policy with that of the Opposition is to go back to the Fraser years when Mr Howard, now the Opposition spokesman, was Treasurer and when Dr Hewson, now the Leader, was economic adviser to the Prime Minister. If they are the people holding themselves up as an alternative, what was their record? Their record was massive disputation; Australia divided; Australians versus Australians; double digit inflation; double digit unemployment; negative economic growth and a wages explosion which blew out to 18 per cent in the last year of their term. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, our policy is proven-but so is theirs; it is proven as a failure. Ours is a policy which, at base, tries to evolve a cooperation model in the industrial workplace of this country, not a conflict model which is so typical of the Opposition. I might also say that ours has worked and the Opposition's has failed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four central issues that need to be understood to bring clarity of thought and precision to the discussion of what is happening in industrial relations at the moment. Those four issues are, first, that the accord between the Australian Government and the trade union movement provides a framework through which moderate wage outcomes can be achieved, can be spread fairly in the community, will be linked to increasing productivity and will devolve in a managed way to company level bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major issue that needs to be understood is that for us the role of the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) is still vital; but the role must change. It was always a role which would change as the system decentralised. Honourable senators should bear in mind that accord mark vi, negotiated in January 1990, proclaimed a move to a decentralised system. Back then, it was a role of a commission in a more decentralised structure that must change, and I will say more about that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing that needs to be understood is that because of the nature of the national wage case decision it has become unworkable. I say that for this reason: one needs to be precise now because we are talking about actual words in a decision and the actual way in which industrial relations operate as opposed to the gloss or the broad assumptions erroneously made by many Opposition commentators. Let me be precise with language: the national wage case decision put on offer an up to 2.5 per cent wage increase, subject to unions volunteering a no extra claims commitment-that is to say, not to ask for any more than that-subject to unions continuing award restructuring and subject to unions doing a number of other things, at the company level, to generate greater productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The wage case decision invited unions to come forward and to give those commitments in exchange for 2.5 per cent. We have seen the unions of Australia say, `Well look, we do not wish to volunteer for up to 2.5 per cent and give those claims'. The Commission's decision did not award guidelines for us to pursue company level bargaining to generate productivity in a more decentralised system that we wish to share in. The national wage case decision did not award superannuation, which was part of the claim, which would enable a safety net to be put under the superannuation entitlements of ordinary Australians and meet a retirement incomes policy for the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> But the invitation in the decision was for the unions to come forward and give those commitments. For the decision to work, it requires the unions to voluntarily accept those terms. The fact is that they do not choose to voluntarily accept those terms because they want to rely on the accord framework, which guarantees tax cuts and which guarantees not just wages but living standards; under the accord we are not negotiating simply wages, but the whole incomes environment of a family. We are talking about wages, about tax cuts and about other provisions in the social wage; there is a whole section in the accord about family child-care. We are talking here as well about commitments by the Government on industry policy, to use wages policy as a lever to generate more productivity in the economy. The unions say that they do not wish to accept the Commission's invitation for an up to 2.5 per cent increase because it does not provide them, after taking from them some of the key elements, with a fair deal in the context of the restraints on them. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of that, they approach employers for the purposes--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators should understand this point, which is a central point, if they understand nothing else of what I say: unions are invited to voluntarily accept the terms of the decision and to give commitments. Unions are saying, `We do not like the terms of the decision, so we will not volunteer'. No-one can tell them that they should or should not accept those terms. They have proclaimed that the terms are not acceptable; they have not volunteered; and they now wish to negotiate with employers directly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators should also bear in mind that the fundamental objective of the Commission is to prevent and to settle industrial disputes. In this case, no industrial disputes have been referred at this point of time to the Commission because of the direct negotiation between unions and employers. There are continuing reports that some of these direct negotiations have resulted in agreements. One could not gainsay the importance of having the parties at that level achieve those agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point that needs to be understood is fundamental. It is that the coming recovery of the economy from recession to growth, and how that is managed in an orderly way so that in the course of that recovery we transfer into a more productive society, is central to this decision as well. I say that because the key element here, as union bargaining power now is weak but later will become strong, is to make a transition so that that union bargaining power is not exploited to the full for what the market will bear but, rather, is curbed in the national interest to achieve a moderate wage outcome and to achieve structural reform in the Australian economy at company level in negotiations where unions, workers and employers sit down to work out together how they plan strategically in a particular company to achieve a greater productive environment. They must plan strategically to see that the benefits of that higher productivity are taken in the form of, in the first instance, the community interest-that is, lower prices for the product offered by that company-and, in the second and third instances, in the form of wages as an enduring incentive to continue to make the productivity leaps that are necessary and, in return, profits on the company side for return to shareholders and reinvestment. </PARA>
<PARA> The four points that need to be understood are these: the accord is absolutely fundamental in an incomes policy environment to provide a framework for continuing moderate wage outcomes and managed, calm and orderly devolving from the central to the decentralised system; the role of the IRC, which is a constant in our lexicon but not in the Opposition's, continues, but it is less the central player and more the decentralised player, more the dispute settler; the national wage case decision that has come down is unworkable because unions do not wish to volunteer to make those undertakings, and are thus free from the terms of the decision if they do not accept those terms-if they wish to negotiate another outcome, that is their right; and our concern as a government is to manage the recovery of the economy in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that the accord is not a wages policy. The accord is about living standards. It is not narrowly focused simply on wages. We are not looking here at an environment in which there is a wage increase partly eroded by a tax bite and partly further eroded by a pushing up of prices. We are looking here at a way in which we manage outcomes for families by balancing wages with tax cuts; with efforts to try to contain prices through the Prices Surveillance Authority; and by putting into place a whole mechanism of social wage-benefits provided out of taxpayers' money by the Government to the community, particularly for the less well off in the community, to provide a decent living standard for them. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this is linked to an industry policy geared at making Australia more productive. That is not well understood, but it is essential to the ability to deliver an aggregate wage outcome which makes this economy much more manageable and for which there is no answer from the Opposition. The framework of the accord does all of those things. This particular decision failed on the basis that it did not answer essential elements of the accord and, therefore, the unions withdrew. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the enduring role of the Industrial Relations Commission exists and will continue under our Government. Whether that is the case under an Opposition government of the future is doubtful if one looks at the words of many of the Opposition spokespersons. Indeed, its own spokesperson has said that he will legislate for minimum wages and has thrown into doubt whether the Commission will exist at all. For us it is important that the Commission exist so that workers who wish to have award coverage can apply for it and achieve a wage outcome that is a minimum rates award for them, and if that is an industry-wide award, so be it. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of an industry-wide minimum rates award which now applies extensively in the private sector, there is a capacity in our policy, with and through the Commission, to look at enterprise-based or company-based bargaining, build on that minimum standard for the particular industry on a company-by-company basis and achieve, with and through the Commission, the enterprise focus that the accord speaks of. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said in this place many times, section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act enables both companies and unions to opt out of the system and construct an arrangement that suits both of them. If that arrangement is found by the Commission to be struck between equals and regarded as fair, they are perfectly at liberty and at large to do so. I would like to see that situation achieved more often. I would like to see now, as well, in the newer emerging environment of a more decentralised system, a commission more attuned to being a facilitator to achieve in workplaces the type of cultural shift that is necessary to create the productivity basis of which I have spoken. That is an important element in the future role of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that it is essential that the accord package which has served this country well serves it again, lest the recovery from this current recession simply leads to a wages break-out and not a moderate outcome, and in order that the living standards of this community are not simply pushed up in terms of what maxima are achieved, but that there is a steady evolution of the economy rather than it being subject to undue wage pressures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is often said that hope springs eternal. We all hope for many things. Two things that we all hope for are a secure income now and a secure income in our retirement. Australians have traditionally looked to governments to support us in achieving these two hopes. There are few things that are more important to the average Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that ordinary Australians have every reason to feel insecure about these two hopes and to be confused about how both governments and oppositions intend to assist them in the fulfilment of these dual aspirations. Certainly, since the wage case judgment last week, we have seen at least what appears to be confusion in some camps. I acknowledge the contribution made by Senator Cook in clarifying what the Government's position is, because the Democrats have no option but to accept the essence of the proposition before us that, in fact, there has been confusion. The whole process that we are debating today is, indeed, inherently confusing. It is inevitable that it will cyclically go through periods of clarity and periods of confusion. It is difficult to argue that the last eight or so days have not given ordinary Australians reason to feel confused about the position of, frankly, both Government and Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook's observations concerning the wording of the motion are quite correct. There is a turn in the wording which tends to suggest that the Government's position has shifted. Perhaps it has not. Perhaps the value of this motion is that it has provided the Minister, and indeed the Opposition and the Democrats, with an opportunity to clarify their positions in light of the wage case judgment of last week. Of course, that not only confuses the mechanisms in relation to wage determination, but also throws some doubt upon the future of superannuation. Indeed, tomorrow, my colleague Senator Spindler will give notice of motion calling for a national summit to address the whole question of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the specific intention of the urgency motion before us. The Democrats interpret it in its round terms rather than in its specific wording and, therefore, we will support it, in that it fundamentally suggests that it is appropriate that confusion be clarified. We accept that. I believe that there is reason and justification for ordinary Australians to feel that the Government, perhaps, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) have been ambivalent in their position in relation to the Industrial Relations Commission. Perhaps they have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Government and the ACTU have wanted a strong and independent Industrial Relations Commission. As I said last week when the Commission brought down its judgment, it would appear that that is indeed what we have: an Industrial Relations Commission which has sent out quite clear signals that nobody is its master. In that respect, the Australian Democrats welcome those signals. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we do not welcome some of the specifics of what is in that judgment. We do not welcome the 2.5 per cent increase mechanism. We agree that that impacts adversely upon low income earners in this country, and that is not good. Nor do we welcome the fact that there will not be provision for the additional 3 per cent superannuation that was sought. Nor do we welcome the fact that the Industrial Relations Commission has turned away from the accord as the fundamental mechanism by which wages have been stabilised and wage grants have been held in place over the last six to eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we do, however, welcome signals of a strong, independent stance on the part of this Commission. We welcome the suggestion on the part of the Commission that much more homework needs to be done before it is prepared to accept the fact that enterprise bargaining should become the prime mechanism of determining what average Australians receive from their employers. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of the Australian Democrats is quite clear. We accept the role of enterprise bargaining. However, we have always said that we would require the outcomes of such processes to be registered and monitored by a strong, independent industrial relations commission. We have always acknowledged that we prefer the centralised model of industrial relations to the decentralised model. Why should ordinary Australians be confused about the position of both the Government and the coalition, that is, the alternative government?</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past three years, very important industrial legislation has been enacted by this Parliament. In 1988 the Government put in place a new model of industrial relations. It put aside the model of arbitration and conciliation, which had become worn out. It was more than 70 years old. It had been amended in excess of 50 times-sometimes major amendments. It was time to put it aside and to put a new model in place. That occurred by way of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990 that Act was built upon by the introduction of major amendments. The primary thrust was to create a strong industrial relations commission. It is ironic that today we have in the chamber legislation which strengthens and consolidates the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. Today we heard Senator Durack state that the Opposition sees a pivotal role for an industrial relations commission where agreements cannot be reached by alternative processes. I have interpreted his comments as meaning that the Opposition acknowledges the need for a strong and independent industrial relations commission. We will have the opportunity to support legislation in this place today and tomorrow which will ensure such a commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Ordinary Australians have reason to be confused by the fact that both the Government and the ACTU walked away from rulings and judgments of the Industrial Relations Commission eight days ago. The statements which emanated from the ACTU special conference were very strong. I think ordinary Australians have reason to be confused as to which of the two points of view-the Kelty or the Keating-will prevail. There have certainly been mixed messages emerging from that special forum. Despite its supposed unanimity, there were mixed messages in the air going out to ordinary Australians, even within hours of that conference having supposedly arrived at a unanimous rejection of the decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The long and short of it is that there is an enormous amount of game play occurring at the moment. New Acts are in place, new procedures are settling down and the major players-the Government, the Industrial Relations Commission, the ACTU and the peak organisations of employers-are playing out their roles. Ordinary Australians are seeing and are being confused by what is little more than political game play and the realities are yet to emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> One reality is that, should there be a change of government, there would certainly be a massive upheaval in the area of industrial relations. The confusion of May 1991 may well pale into insignifi- cance alongside the confusion that would prevail for some years should there be a change of government and an attempt to make the quantum leap, in quick time, from the centralised to a decentralised model. Little wonder therefore that ordinary Australians are feeling insecure about their dual hopes and aspirations for a just and adequate wage now and a secure, assured income in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I am no less confused about the statements that the Opposition has placed before both the Parliament and the constituency at large in the past three years in which these significant matters have been debated. I was in this place to hear former Senator Chaney, as the former shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, respond and argue in a way that left me with no doubt that he shared the attitudes and the value set of the present shadow Minister, Mr Howard, and the present Opposition Leader, Dr Hewson, that should there be a change of government the Industrial Relations Commission would be dramatically weakened. I do not believe that it is possible to read the Hansard and arrive at any conclusion other than that, if the decentralised model were put in place, a weakened and less independent industrial relations commission would result. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the Howard imagery of recent days of the new generation of unemployed, such people would be putty in the hands of employers in the context of a decentralised model where enterprise bargaining carried the day. Therefore I welcome the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission that a lot more homework needs to be done and a lot more confidence and credibility has to be established before enterprise bargaining becomes the fundamental process determining wages in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia and the Confederation of Australian Industry, in their recent newsletter Business Background, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>While the decision rejected the Accord, it did not reject a move towards enterprise negotiations. What it did propose was for the ACTU, Government and employers to have consultations to try and resolve the differences which exist over how the concept would operate. </PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that there are enormous uncertainties about how these alternative processes would operate. There is not the degree of confidence in them that we are sometimes led to believe by the Opposition. If we look at the two experiences of enterprise bargaining, namely, the airline pilots dispute and the recent negotiations regarding conditions and pay on the wharf, we would not have much confidence in that process at all. On both occasions, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was called into the action and that is hardly evidence of the fact that this process is one in which ordinary Australians should have a great deal of confidence. In the case of the airline pilots dispute, the matter was referred to the International Labour Organisation-an external world organisation-for its opinion on the process of enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that there is a great deal of confusion and that there is reason for ordinary Australians not to have confidence in the light of what they have heard and seen in recent days. Therefore, we reject the semantics of the objections that we have heard to this motion and we accept it in its round terms, but there is need for clarification. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak to this urgency motion. I note that the Australian Democrats seem to be supporting it, despite the fact that most of what Senator McLean said seemed to be concerned with how confused all the people he talks to are on this issue. I think that is simply an indication that he and those with whom he has contact have not yet come to terms with precisely what the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at the reaction of Senator Cook because, if ever there has been an unbridled exercise in hypocrisy, it is his reaction to the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission. The Government has treated the Commission as the holiest of holies for as long as it has been in government; it has always regarded the Commission as the central player; it has always paid-at least until now-lip service to its importance; and, on many occasions, it has said things such as this:</PARA>
<PARA>The system has become a significant and truly independent influence on economic policy making, not just confined to preventing and settling disputes. It would be impossible nowadays for a government to control a national economy without having regard to the systems wage fixing function. The process has only been possible because of the commitment of the Commission and the high regard in which it is held in parties to the process. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, on 19 December, Senator Cook said:</PARA>
<PARA>You're asking me what is wrong with ignoring one of the major institutions in industrial relations in this country. I mean, commonsense would say that you do not ignore one of the main players, because if you do they may want to exert their role and rights in the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>There he is, again on record, pointing to the centrality and primacy of the Commission-this is the high water mark of the hypocrisy of which I speak. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>When the Commission makes a decision it will be the right decision. There is an independent umpire. We support the system of arbitration in this country, we should simply, when there is a problem, step back and let it do its job. </PARA>
<PARA>I could go on, and I am sure my colleague Senator Durack has effectively demonstrated the forked tongue with which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has spoken on this issue. He is not alone, because all of his acolytes in the trade union movement have said pretty much the same in the wake of this decision.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw the remark. I suppose it is a tribute to Senator Tate's exquisite sensitivity. I am not sure whether Senator Cook would have the gall to pretend that he speaks other than in different ways at different times. I think that what prompted Senator Tate to rise was the exquisite contradiction between those sorts of expressions about how important the umpire is and how important it is to abide by the decision and what has been said in recent times. I once more highlight the absolute hypocrisy of this stance: in the Government's national wage case submission, over which Senator Cook had control, after arguing long and hard for the accord-which the Government is perfectly entitled to do-he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Ultimately, however, it is a matter for this Commission to determine these issues on the merits of the submissions from all parties and interveners. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is not hypocrisy, I do not know what is. The fury of the rejection of the decision clearly makes nonsense of those sorts of words. What Senator Cook has subsequently said bears that out. He makes it clear that it will only be whilst the Commission rubber stamps the accord that the Government will accord it any recognition. If that is relying on the decision of an umpire, then I do not understand the meaning of the words. </PARA>
<PARA> What I found most disappointing in Senator Cook's contribution was his abject failure to deal with any of the significant issues that arise in the area of superannuation as a result of the Commission's decision. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have been concerned about some of the problems which were raised in the June 1986 national wage case decision. That concern is only increased by issues raised in the submissions of a number of the parties and interveners, including the Commonwealth Government in these proceedings. Because of these concerns we consider it essential that a concentrated attempt be made to deal with these issues at this stage of development of award based superannuation, otherwise its further development may be flawed to the point of frustrating its contribution to an improvement of adequate national retirement income system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission went on to request the Commonwealth to convene the national conference-which the Government has studiously avoided doing for the last six months; indeed, it has not even had the courtesy to respond to written requests from the Business Council of Australia and it simply adjourned the proceedings. That was a fundamental rebuff and I can understand its fit of pique; but I would have thought that if this Government considers itself to be responsible in any way at all, it would have had the decency to then respond by at least pointing out how it proposes to deal with some of these manifest inadequacies-and they are legion. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of non-compliance is probably the most burning one and has the greatest capacity for embarrassment for the union movement. The facts are that on the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, only about 56 per cent of the work force is covered by superannuation-or is receiving it, I should say, because there is a vital difference. People such as Senator Cook like to pretend that because there is award coverage, somehow people have got superannuation. I am sure that Senator Cooney knows the facts. The fact is that in the private sector only 40.6 per cent of workers are currently receiving any superannuation at all-not just award superannuation. There is a massive non-compliance problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) will tell us it has a strategy in place that will make this a non-issue by the end of the year. I am waiting to see that. It has not been successful since 1986 in significantly reducing the non-compliance problem. I cannot for a moment imagine how it is going to be able to get out to the back blocks and pick up those hundreds of thousands of employers who are simply not complying with award obligations. It is a very serious problem-we all know that-and it imposes legal liabilities on employers which will, in some circumstances, be catastrophic for their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact remains that those workers are not getting that superannuation payment and the Government simply ignores it as a problem. It is not even prepared to talk about a realistic target. The Business Council said, `10 per cent by the year 2000'. I think one can say that that figure may well be generous in the circumstances and that we may not need to go that high; but the Government has refrained from setting a target. Most importantly, it has not addressed the fundamental criticism, that the award superannuation has evolved in a way so that it has simply become an industrial relations solution to a wages claim. </PARA>
<PARA> That is manifest in a number of ways, the most significant of which is that instead of ensuring a minimum level of superannuation entitlement, it is simply a 3 per cent add-on across the board. Where we have, say, in the public sector, people with 20 per cent plus who do not need any more superannuation, where we have most of the constituency of the Business Council getting in excess of 10 per cent and, therefore, do not need another 3 per cent, we have, nonetheless, had this commitment to imposing it across the board. This is all part of the managed approach that the accord partners have to industrial relations. This has nothing to do with delivering an effective and appropriate superannuation outcome for those whom they purport to represent. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever we have been misled it is when people like Mr Keating have the gall to say that this is all about extending superannuation to those who have never had it before. The fact is that, unless one is in the trade union movement, one misses out altogether. In the private sector, about a third of workers belong to the union movement and about 40 per cent get superannuation. In the public sector, 75 per cent belong to unions and just over 90 per cent get superannuation. That is where it starts and finishes. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no incentive for any trade union organiser to go out and flog superannuation to those who are not getting it. The trustees of many of the industry funds have no interest at all in seeing commission paid to commercial agents-be they solicitors, accountants or anyone else-to try to encourage people to come within the system. There will not be any progress made on that issue; the same group of people will get more superannuation and the disparity between the haves and the have-nots will become even greater-quite the opposite to what the Government professes to stand for and quite the opposite to what the ACTU should be on about. </PARA>
<PARA> The other outstanding deficiency of the current arrangements is the nonsense that has been put in place on a piecemeal basis by way of tax concessions for employees. The category a person is in-whether one is getting some award superannuation, is getting no award superannuation, is self-employed or has modest levels of employer support-determines whether that person gets a rebate or a deduction in the first instance, whether limits are placed on that or whether the person is disqualified altogether. It is an absolute nonsense and everyone knows it. It is impossibly complex and clearly deters employees from wanting to invest any more in their own superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe that suits the Government's agenda fine because at the end of the day it sees this measure as taking money out of the pockets of employers, not encouraging employees to contribute and therefore having some responsibility for their own savings during their working lives and their own levels of retirement income. In other words, it is all about forcing the employers to cough up and nothing about self-reliance. We think that that is a flawed model. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I would have thought that the Government should have at least been prepared, in the weeks that have passed since the national wage case decision, to spell out where it stands on these sorts of issues. Is it in favour of legislating? We do not know. All we have is selective leaks to journalists in the Australian and the Australian Financial Review, with front page stories saying that the Government is thinking about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is probably that this measure is simply in terrorem stuff to try to intimidate the Commission on the one hand and bring the unions into line on the other. It does not seem to be driven by any work that has gone on in the relevant departments. It would seem to be just another kite to distract attention from the fact that the Government does not have an alternative agenda and does not want to spell out how it intends to approach the issue. It simply wants to lock arms with the trade union movement and get out in the field and into that other 3 per cent, irrespective of the fact that the Commission and every other responsible commentator has demonstrated that there is just no capacity to pay at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> This 3 per cent, the second round, was cobbled together in a pre-election environment in February last year which took no account of even the possibility of a recession. It was simply assumed that employers would be able to afford to pay, or that at least those who had already been paying-as we know, they are only a relatively small proportion of the total in any event-would be able to continue to do so. It is light years away from current circumstances. Yet once again the Government is not prepared to acknowledge that; it is simply out there wanting to go for broke. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at statements from Mr Kelty, Mr Ferguson and all the others. They could not give a damn; they are only interested in enforcing that accord by hook or by crook. They do not have a skerrick of concern about whether it is affordable, rational, sensible, or counterproductive. It is likely to be counterproductive because many employer funds will simply be folded into industry funds. No doubt that is part of the Government's agenda. But the end result is that those workers will not be any better off at all. There will be massive disobedience on the part of the small businesses simply because they cannot afford it, whether they already have substantial liabilities under existing award obligations or not. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole host of problems with the current system. The Government has just refused to address them. Once again Senator Cook has turned a blind eye to them. I just hope that Senator Cooney, with his background in industrial relations, will have the ability and the foresight at least to deal sensibly with some of these real problems which everyone else recognises but which the Government is simply keeping its head in the sand about. </PARA>

<PARA> I refer to the statement that the Government has rejected the central role of the AIRC. I take it that that is based on the following evidence: that following the latest national wage case decision, the Government has expressed disappointment with the implications that arise from that decision. The fact that a government, or indeed anybody, expresses a disappointment with a particular outcome does not mean, and cannot be held to mean, that there has been a rejection of the central role of the AIRC. Indeed, the evidence to the contrary is that, the waterside problems having been solved among employers and employees, unions and government, that solution has been taken to the Industrial Relations Commission. That indicates that all those bodies have nothing but the highest respect for the Industrial Relations Commission. I say in passing that the three Ministers-the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), Senator Cook and Senator Collins-involved in the solution to the waterside problem need to be thanked by the community and this chamber. Had that solution broken down, quite disastrous consequences could have followed generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution to that problem shows how important it is that employers and employees, unions and government are able to go forward together on an agreed basis. That is really what has been done through the accord. It is a fair and proper debating point to say that the Government has expressed some disappointment about the Industrial Relations Commission and therefore it has changed its policies and left things confused. I have explained that that is not so. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now explain why the Government, quite rightly, was disappointed with the outcome from the Commission. For example, the figures indicating the industrial disputes in Australia since 1972 and the working days lost per thousand employees show how great a service has been paid to this nation by the accord and the concomitant features of the accord, such as the coming on board of the employers and the good relationships that have come to exist amongst government, unions, employers and employees compared to what went before. One sees, for example, that, in 1976, 773 working days were lost per thousand employees; in 1980, 649; in 1981, 797; and in 1982, 348; followed by a dramatic fall. In 1983, 249 days were lost; in 1984, 248; in 1985, 228; in 1986, 242; in 1987, 223; in 1988, 269; in 1989, 190; and last year, 1990, 216.</PARA>
<PARA> If there is a substantial threat to the existing agreements between the various parties in industry-that that relationship will break up and that there will be a return to the old days when industrial disputes were much more prevalent, when relationships between those groups were much more soured than they are now and when the workplace culture has been changed, that change occurring in 1983-then, quite properly, this Government should do something. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission is an august body that we must follow and obey. However, if the Government perceives that a decision of that body would prejudice the work of a decade, the Government should quite properly say so and explain to the unions and employer groups that the Government does not agree with a decision that would return industrial relations to a time which, fortunately, has now largely passed. </PARA>
<PARA> In responding to a situation where disaster might well befall the workplace, the Government should express disappointment with the decision and signal to the various parties in the industrial relations field that it understands such problems. To save what has been at times so excruciatingly purchased and hard earned is to act responsibly. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion calls on the Government to clarify its new industrial relations and occupational superannuation policies. There are no new industrial relations and occupational superannuation policies. While in office, this Government has been motivated to develop a policy aimed at ensuring that every person in the community has a decent standard of living, a sense of dignity, and is accorded due respect and not treated as some automaton but as a person who is afforded proper respect by the Government and every other section of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion implies that somehow a person's labour and place in the workplace is simply another factor to be taken into account by economists in the same way as machinery, investment capital and marketing plans are. That is not the case at all. The Government acts to look after not only workers but also the unemployed, those in need of social security and those who are retired and in need of superannuation. The Government has pursued policies on all those fronts. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston spoke about superannuation and described the superannuation scheme as having some `blips'. There are blips in the scheme. But the Government has produced a superannuation scheme that will prove ultimately to be one of the greatest achievements of its time in office. If we had not been in government, we would not be hearing complaints about some defects that have not been smoothed out in the superannuation scheme. Rather, we would be talking about the very absence of such a scheme. The Government has put into operation a superannuation scheme which within a short period of time will be a magnificent one. Such a scheme would never have eventuated if we had not been in office. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston also said that unions generally are not interested in superannuation and that it is used merely as a bargaining chip. But there are unions that conduct good superannuation funds. I refer to the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union in Victoria, which runs an outstanding superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the concept-it comes both from the other side and economists generally-of work practices. Legislation was introduced recently in New Zealand which pursues a course similar to the industrial relations policies espoused by the Opposition. The introduction of that legislation in New Zealand brought forward a comment from the New Zealand Catholic Bishops Conference led by Cardinal Williams of Wellington. That conference produced a document which states:</PARA>
<PARA>According to Government the purpose of the proposed legislation is to create flexible labour market practices so that production efficiencies will be encouraged; they in turn will lead to economic growth. The legislation dismantles the national award system and promotes new forms of work place bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA>The document later says:</PARA>
<PARA>It redefines the internationally understood terms, freedom of association and right to organise in trade unions, thus hampering the right to form unions. It also restricts the right to strike. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This legislative change is not simply a technical issue. It involves ethics and morality. The question must be asked what the new legislation does to people and society, to human dignity and the common good. As Bishops of New Zealand we must speak against this proposed legislation as its underlying ideology is contrary to the social doctrines of the Church. Pope Paul VI teaches that, `All social action involves a doctrine. The Christian cannot admit that which is based upon a materialistic and atheistic philosophy'. The underlying ideology of the new industrial legislation is unacceptable for two reasons: firstly, because it emphasises free choice without balancing this concept with concern for the common good. </PARA>
<PARA>I leave out the next part. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The legislation assumes that the free pursuit of his or her interest by the private individual automatically leads to the public or common good of society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In support of this urgency motion I shall quote a number of statements that have been made by a number of Ministers, to emphasise why there is confusion about the current situation in industrial relations in this country today. All these statements have been made since 26 November last year, which is only a few months ago. I shall begin by reading the motion before us which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the Government to clarify its new Industrial Relations and Occupational Superannuation policies in the light of its espousal of enterprise bargaining and the rejection of the central role for the IRC. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what this matter is about. The first statement I wish to refer to was made by Senator Cook in answer to a question of mine on 2 November. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The best course of action in cases like this is to allow the Industrial Relations Commission to do its job. That is far and away the preferred position of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The following day the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>Unlike Senator Crane's Party when it is in government, this Government will not stand over and interfere with the Commission, nor will we dictate to the Commission as to its rights.</PARA>
<PARA>Further down my list I see that in answer to a question by Senator Calvert on 7 March, Senator Cook stated:</PARA>
<PARA>That umpire is the industrial relations system. It works well in this country and should be used in the event of the parties not being able to agree. </PARA>
<PARA>In an article in the Australian newspaper of 1 May 1991 the Treasurer, Mr Keating, was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Does the Cabinet formally support the ACTU decision to reject the national wage outcome?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes. Because the decision is in substantial measure a rejection of the elements of Accord Mark VI which were entered into in good economic faith and are built on tax cuts already paid, enterprise bargaining, award restructuring and occupational superannuation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>You're giving a vote of ``no confidence'' in the IRC?</PARA>
<PARA>Treasurer Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA>No. Not as an institution. But we're giving it a vote of ``no confidence'' in this decision. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating was further asked:</PARA>
<PARA>You want the IRC to change its ways?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>The IRC, no, no. Australia has changed and will continue to change. The IRC will be left in its wake unless it changes also. </PARA>
<PARA>On the one hand, Mr Keating is saying that the position has to be changed but, on the other, he is saying that it does not. </PARA>
<PARA> This highlights very succinctly why there is confusion today: the Treasurer has one position, Senator Cook has another. This Government is in disarray in the industrial arena. Its umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, has made a decision regarding the national wage case. The Government has now become the umpire and has given the Australian Industrial Relations Commission out. Is it the Government that has made the decision or is it, in fact, the Australian Council of Trade Unions? Let us look at what the President of the ACTU said. An article in the West Australian on 2 May 1991 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> ACTU president Martin Ferguson issued a warning to employers, saying industrial reform could stall as unions turned up the heat in the quest for the accord. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same article the Secretary of the ACTU, Bill Kelty, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it was a sad and emotional decision, but even in a recession workers would rather fight than accept the 2.5 per cent offered by the commission. </PARA>
<PARA>This highlights that the main players, when the umpire makes a decision which is what they want, agree and accept it; but when the umpire makes a decision which is not what they want under current industrial law in this country, they take the law into their own hands. One must conclude from these statements that both players would prefer to put more people on the unemployment scrap heap than address the excesses of Australia's fundamental work practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The real question is: how high will the Government jump when the ACTU refuses to abide by the Government's own appointed umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission? Should we be asking: what has the ACTU told the Government to do with regard to future industrial relations policy?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Government's own employees, the Public Service. Public Service employees operate under paid rate awards. In other words, they have to be paid precisely what the Industrial Relations Commission determines as the maximum. The Government has committed itself by statutory declaration to the Commission that no higher rates will be paid. The breach for breaking the provisions of a statutory declaration is gaol; therefore, in offering to pay the accord package contrary to the Commission's decision of 2.5 per cent, the Government will place itself in breach of an undertaking to the Commission by maintaining paid rate awards. Or will the Government have one set of award setting arrangements for public servants and another for the remainder of the work force? The Government has lost its way. Inconsistency is the order of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the first foray into the new order of this policy: the waterfront. I want to quote a couple of paragraphs from the final settlement proposal which has gone back to the Commission. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) the first adjustment to be $12 per week from the first pay period on or after 16 May</PARA>
<PARA>(b) an aggregate 6.12% adjustment in three equal instalments consistent with the agreed classification structure</PARA>
<PARA>The document goes on to deal with implementation from 1 July 1991 and from 1 July 1992. In terms of this document I have to ask: if this is the new order, why have not the excesses which exist on the waterfront been addressed? If this is the new line that the Government is going to take, surely those work practices-those things which exacerbate Australia's economic position-should be addressed?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the excesses and situations which exist-and this is just a small sample of them. Firstly, the gross average weekly earnings for a general class waterside worker are $824 a week for an average week of 27 working hours. Can honourable senators believe it-27 hours! In some of the smaller ports around Australia the figures are worse. For example, in Thevenard in South Australia the worker averaged $360 per week for an average week of six working hours. The waterside worker enjoys five weeks annual leave with a 27.5 per cent leave loading. The waterside worker enjoys 10 sick leave days per year. In addition, these can be accumulated over a period of time and cashed in after 10 years of continuous employment. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia free taxis are provided for workers to travel between Fremantle railway station and the Fremantle wharf. Workers who choose to drive rather than take a taxi from the railway station are paid for five minutes travel time. Those involved in the transport of container cargo were paid a weekly consolidated disability allowance of $11.20 to compensate them for dirty working conditions under which they might be forced to work. Those not adversely affected by the conditions still get the allowance. Workers who earn overtime for more than one hour also earn a meal allowance of $9.15. Tradesmen on the wharf earn an average of $977 per week for working 31.7 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> In this, the first foray by the Government into its new industrial regime, none of these things are touched. The list goes on. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to deal with them all today, but I shall refer to a couple more. In regard to live sheep loading, the manning levels are excessive. Currently, approximately 12 men are required to load one ship. Most consider that two men and a dog could do the same job. Currently, there is a rumour that a group in Tasmania tried to enrol a dog as a member of the local Waterside Workers Federation to increase productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the agreement that has been put in place, none of these things will be addressed before 1 July next year, and they may not be addressed then. We are looking at reform in the workplace-reform of the industrial practices that we have in this country, and a new order. But the Government has achieved nothing in terms of this agreement. It is an absolute tragedy. All that this agreement does now is give a pay rise. The excesses continue, unemployment rises and the recession we had to have rolls on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wants the matter to go back to the Commission. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) does not, as I have already indicated, and Senator Cook wants two bob each way. I wish to quote Senator Cook once again to demonstrate the inconsistency of his position in relation to this issue. On 18 December 1990 in the debate on a matter of urgency Senator Cook said:</PARA>
<PARA>I look at Senator Winston Crane on the other side of the Chamber, who just last week asked me, as a Minister of this Government, to intervene and to tell the umpire to do certain things in a particular dispute. He wanted intervention in that dispute. I was asked yesterday by Senator Durack, who has propounded this item, whether I would intervene in this particular dispute. I am not going to intervene in this dispute, as I was not going to intervene in the other dispute. The Government is not butting in. The Government is not saying, `We are Big Brother; We know best'. We are simply saying, `If the deal is fair . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But just a few days ago a press report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In an unusual move, Industrial Relations Minister Peter Cook issued a statement saying cabinet had reaffirmed the key role of the accord in wagefixing over that of the IRC. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that it was `over that of the IRC'. It is obvious that in the national wage case he sides with the ACTU against the umpire. In the case of `Meatgate', which is before the Harrison inquiry at present and which Senator Cooney referred to before in his comments about superannuation, the Minister will not do anything which is effective in bringing the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) to heel. The activities of the AMIEU in this particular dispute-as I have outlined before in this place-have now cost somewhere in excess of $250m in lost export earnings. They have also sent a number of export abattoirs in this country broke. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that confusion reigns supreme? Is it any wonder that we have had to bring this motion before this place today in order to have the Government's position clarified? The Government has become very inconsistent in its dealings with regard to these particular issues. It is quite clear to me that there is much disagreement about the position which is being adopted by the various players within the Government. In the case of the waterfront agreement we saw the Prime Minister having to move in over Senator Collins. We see Treasurer Keating adopting a position which is different to that of other Ministers in the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by making a few observations in relation to enterprise bargaining. I also support what Senator Durack said earlier: enterprise agreements will become a fact of life in this country as we move towards the next decade. But enterprise agreements will not work, be effective, or provide the real benefits which are required unless the legal rights rest with the employer and the employee without intervention; unless closed shops are abolished; and unless there is legislation for enterprise unions. The Government should clarify its position. Today it has failed to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In listening to the contributions of those speakers opposite, and particularly that of the last speaker, Senator Crane, we could be forgiven for asking why the Senate was presented today with an urgency motion relating to superannuation. There has been a lot of talk from those opposite about the industrial relations systems and about the recent decision of the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) but, frankly, there has not been a lot of comment-particularly with regard to the substance of the matter of urgency-about superannuation, and that is what we are here to debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We had the contribution from Senator Crane about the need for the Government to get back on track. But those opposite were not even on the track when it came to superannuation, and I will detail more about that later. We heard a lot about freeing up the labour market and enterprise bargaining and I will also make some comments about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the election of a national Labor government, the record of those opposite on the issue of superannuation was very patchy, ill-conceived, ill-planned and ill-thought out. Until the election of a national Labor government and the policies that we have implemented with regard to superannuation-which I will comment about-there was no national retirement plan for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> A very small proportion of workers in this country enjoyed superannuation. It tended to be concentrated on those workers who were better paid and who were male. Vast sections of the work force, such as females, those in lesser paid occupations, and those who worked on a casual or seasonal basis, had no superannuation at all. They had very little to look forward to except a pension which, given the demographic changes in this nation, meant less and less in real terms. Those opposite had developed no policies and had done absolutely nothing about providing an effective retirement package for people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, to rub salt into the wound of those who did not have superannuation in this country, there was a tax deduction for those who did have superannuation. So, in effect, those people who were well off and who enjoyed superannuation were being subsidised through the tax system by those people who were less well off and who did not have superannuation. That highlights the inequities that existed in the area of superannuation under the previous national Liberal Government. Nothing had been done in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are debating a matter of urgency which is a call to clarify the new industrial relations and occupational superannuation policies in the light of enterprise bargaining and the rejection of a central role for the IRC. When I saw the text of this matter of urgency I realised very quickly, from the way it was worded and the basic contradictions contained in it, that those opposite do not have a very great understanding of superannuation policy or, indeed, of the way in which the IRC operates, or of the way in which enterprise bargaining has operated in this country for the last 90 years and the way in which it will continue to operate. Maybe enterprise bargaining will take a more central role in our industrial negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the election of a national Labor government. It moved immediately to implement a sound, comprehensive, consistent, long term and responsible economic approach to superannuation and retirement policy in this country. What did our Government do? Firstly, it ensured that all workers in this nation had access to superannuation. Along with the union movement, it presented a case to the Industrial Relations Commission for the implementation of a 3 per cent productivity award for all workers in this country-not a selective few as had occurred when those opposite were in government. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it encouraged the establishment of industry superannuation funds rather then personal superannuation funds. The important advantages of that for workers of this country are that industry funds are portable, and that people can move from occupation to occupation, from employer to employer and they do not lose their money. Employees can rest assured that the moneys that they have accumulated in the funds are their moneys to be collected when they retire. That is not what occurred when there was individual or company dominated and company-sponsored superannuation. That is one of the important changes that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> The massive size of these industry funds also ensures that the administrative charges are minimal. With regard to personal superannuation or the old employer superannuation, the administrative charges ranged from anywhere between 2 to 5 per cent of the total contributions. The administrative charges of the industry funds are, in real money terms, much lower because the funds are much larger and they are operated much more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government through the tax system has also encouraged employees optionally to contribute to these industry superannuation funds. In legislation that I spoke to last year, this Government has also changed the Industrial Relations Act to ensure that there is greater enforcement of the superannuation provisions within industrial awards in this country and to ensure that for those workers who are legally entitled to their superannuation, which in many cases is not being paid by employers, it is legally enforceable and able to be collected. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, that has been the policy approach of the Labor Government in this country, which stands in stark contrast to the policy of those opposite when they were in government. Our policy is an activist policy and a fair policy. The policy of those opposite was an inactive policy, a `do nothing' policy which lacked planning and forward coordination. </PARA>
<PARA> In the latest accord, accord mark VI, the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) intended that a further 3 per cent should be added on top of the 3 per cent that already exists. The reason for doing this is that, in this country if a person is to have a reasonable income on retirement, the equivalent of 10 per cent is needed to be saved and put aside for that retirement. The Government, quite rightly, saw it as necessary for the long term incomes policy in this country that additional contributions should be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, the Industrial Relations Commission did not consider that the 3 per cent staggered in one per cent payments should occur. Instead it said that in November of this year there should be a national conference of the various parties to consider the future of superannuation. That was the decision that was made. But that does not mean the end of occupational superannuation policy and, frankly, it does not mean any change in this Government's attitude or policy on superannuation, as this urgency motion suggests. It does not mean the end of a coordinated approach on superannuation. There is no inherent contradiction between occupational superannuation that is being pursued by this Government and enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> We can still have enterprise bargaining and national occupational superannuation. This is where those opposite do not have any fundamental understanding of either the industrial relations system, enterprise bargaining or superannuation. If one has enterprise bargaining then what is important is the issues that are bargained at the enterprise level. So far as this Government is concerned, superannuation is not one of those issues that are going to be bargained at enterprise level and left to the option of the employer to implement if he or she so wishes. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certain minimum standards that this Government has set and intends to improve on in the area of occupational superannuation. I do not think that those opposite have considered the role of superannuation in the enterprise bargaining process, should they ever be elected to government. Those opposite have suggested, in their fairly brief industrial relations policy that has so far been detailed, that through enterprise bargaining everything should be bargained between the employer and individual employees except a minimum wage.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, last night, the industrial relations spokesperson for the Opposition, John Howard, when talking about changes in New Zealand said that the only minimum would be a minimum wage set by the Industrial Commission. Everything else would be negotiated and I assume he includes superannuation. This is where those opposite have not thought out their policy approach on superannuation. If superannuation is one of those things that are to be bargained between the employer and the employee under the policy as enunciated by those currently in opposition, should they ever get into government and it is put into practice, I suggest that there would not be any national cohesive superannuation policy for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I know what I would do if I were an employer and I had the power that the Opposition is going to give employers; if there were no check; if there were no independent adjudicator through the Industrial Relations Commission; if the employer had the absolute right to hire and fire; and if the employer had enormous bargaining power because he was flanked by industrial advisers, lawyers, accountants and security firms. I know what would happen to the individual employees in that sort of bargaining process. I suggest that their ability to bargain for improved superannuation benefits, let alone hold onto what they have, would be minimal. In fact, workers in any sort of individual bargaining process without any protection, which is what the Opposition is advocating, would very quickly lose what they have at the present time-whether it be annual leave, sick leave, superannuation or weekend penalty rates. We would lose any sort of coherent and national superannuation policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of individual bargaining, which has been advocated by those opposite during the debate, is not the same as enterprise bargaining and this is where those opposite have a fundamental misunderstanding about industrial relations negotiations. Bargaining can take place at the enterprise level and, indeed, it has taken place for some 90 years. Overaward negotiations have occurred at most workplaces in this country on a variety of issues. So, enterprise bargaining has taken place and will continue to take place. But if we are to ensure equity and justice for workers in this country, enterprise bargaining must take place with an industrial relations system where there is an independent authority, such as the Industrial Relations Commission, to determine what is fair and what is just. One can continue to have enterprise bargaining provided that one has certain minimum protections for workers in the way of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> The rejection by the Industrial Relations Commission of the package that was negotiated between the ACTU and the Government is but a temporary setback in the pursuance of both national superannuation for all workers in this country and adequate superannuation protection. By `adequate' I mean sufficient money to ensure that all people when they retire from the work force have a decent income to live on, which stands in stark contrast to the absolute nil record of those opposite when they were in government. This will continue to remain one of the central policy options of this Government. In my view, one of the greatest achievements of this Government is that we now are starting to have a national superannuation policy providing for adequate protection for all workers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission will continue to play a very important role in the establishment and development of superannuation. It will continue to play that role because superannuation minima are provided for in almost all industrial awards in this country. They are required to be registered before the Industrial Relations Commission and therefore that Industrial Relations Commission role will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say that our policy stands. Whilst there has not been implementation of the second 3 per cent, we have ensured that there is a fair tax system in respect of superannuation and that there are productivity funds which ensure that all workers can have access to portable superannuation. We have established the 3 per cent minimum, although many workers receive more than that. Those opposite have done absolutely nothing in the area of superannuation. Their only answer is vague terms and cliches about free collective bargaining, enterprise bargaining and removing the shackles of the Industrial Relations Commission. This urgency motion should be rejected. It is totally inconsistent. It is typical of the stand of Opposition senators on the issues of industrial relations and superannuation. They know not what they are talking about. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Recycling is the fastest growing waste management technique employed by governments worldwide. For any waste management strategy to be successful, it must have the support of the public, industry and State, local and Federal governments. It is good to see in the two volumes of the Industry Commission's report on recycling suggestions as to what the Government should do. Volume I of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . local governments influence recycling indirectly through their waste disposal policies and directly through their collection systems; State Governments influence recycling through their environmental and industry development initiatives, their own purchasing policies and their controls over local government. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Commonwealth Government, of which we are a part here, can have an influence through its coordinating role in environmental matters and its powers over customs and excise duties and sales tax. The report is very comprehensive and far-reaching, and I have picked up a number of points from reading volume I. The report makes the following point:</PARA>
<PARA> When alternatives to recycling are apparently cheap there is little incentive to participate in recycling. This will be the case when councils charge for garbage disposal through general rates, subject to rate pegging, and fail to pass on the full costs of disposal through `user pays' charges. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If disposal choices are based on private costs which fail to reflect all the costs of using the community's resources, as in the case of illegal dumping, there may be a bias against the supply of recyclables. </PARA>
<PARA>It further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The use of recycled materials in manufacture depends not only on their relative costs but also on the demand for the products of the manufacturing process. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that we in Australia are on the road to doing not a bad job in recycling. For example, 31 per cent of the 325,000 tonnes of aluminium consumed in Australia each year is recovered for reprocessing or exported as scrap. In regard to lead, about 36,000 tonnes or 60 per cent of consumption was recovered in 1989-90. However, 20,000 tonnes were exported as scrap in that year. About a fifth of all the copper consumed in Australia is recovered for reprocessing, equivalent to some 24,500 tonnes. Around 26 per cent of the steel consumed in this country is recovered as scrap. So a great deal of our materials are recycled and used again in Australia, which is a great achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> Plastics account for 8 to 11 per cent by weight of the household waste stream of Australia's three largest cities, around one million tonnes of plastic resins are consumed in Australia each year, and some 450,000 tonnes of plastic products are discarded annually. There is some concern that, while around 15 per cent of plastic waste is recovered and reprocessed, this consists mostly of industrial and commercial scrap. Only 1,000 to 1,500 tonnes or less than half of one per cent of plastic in household waste is recovered. </PARA>
<PARA> This report contains some other interesting facts. One relates to the recycling of disposable nappies, a matter of great concern to many people. People just throw disposable nappies in garbage cans which sit around and create a problem in terms of hygiene and in other ways. I believe that that area has to be looked at. Madam Acting Deputy President, things have changed a lot since you and I were babies and there were no disposable nappies. There is a problem there and it is something that all countries and all Australians should be looking at. Underneath the plastic, the inner or absorbent part of the disposable nappy is made up of woodchips, which are a reusable resource. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be severely criticising the Industry Commission in relation to this two-volume report on recycling, but before I do so I would like to say that, accepting the present economic model as an immediate market assessment, this report contains some very useful information. But it is precisely in that area that the major criticism must lie. Quite clearly, one cannot have a continuation of the present market system which simply looks at instantaneous prices and costs and determines whether materials should or should not be, or whether they can profitably be, recycled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the subject of recycling, we have to remember several things. We must remember that the materials which a modern industrial society uses can be divided roughly into potentially renewable materials, such as the food we eat, the fibre that we use in making paper and so on, and non-renewable resources such as copper, other metals, glass and so on which come from finite resources. The bottom line in all this is that we live on a finite globe and that resources are indeed finite. There are limits to the extent to which resources can be used and strict limits to the extent to which resources can be recycled. Those limits are set by the availability of energy. Energy is the primary determinant in the recycling process because energy itself can never be recycled. Energy is a non-renewable resource; once used it is gone forever. That is essentially the basis of the second law of thermodynamics. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the way in which this analysis has been done, no value has been placed on resources in situ-on non-renewable resources in the ground. One of the constant complaints of the conservation movement is that, while we assiduously measure gross domestic product and the rate at which resources are used up, which is what GDP really measures, we do not keep any measure of the capital value of resources in situ. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were to put a reasonable value on resources in the ground, such as lead ores, zinc ores and sand on our beaches which is mined to make glass, the way in which that material is depleted would show up in our national accounts as a reduction in the capital account and a transfer of value from the capital account to the cash flow account. </PARA>
<PARA> Going through these reports, one finds that no value is put on resources in situ. Therefore, all of these economic analyses contained in these reports, in terms of the environmental requirements-that, I point out, is a requirement which is placed on the Industry Commission specifically within this reference and generally under its legal charter-are quite deeply flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, at the other end, while the reports repeatedly mention land fill, no consideration is given to the value which future generations may attach to land which, because it has become an area for land fill, with many of the materials being toxic, will therefore be precluded from use for other purposes. While the Commission mentions these things all of the way through, it purports to give an unbiased and comprehensive economic analysis of recycling. But it cannot do that because it accepts this very deeply flawed economic model on which our present industrial civilisation is built. If we do not redress that, we cannot ever move towards a sustainable society. Only by putting proper values on those non-renewable resources, which are finite in their sources, can we ever build a truly sustainable society. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Because there are four reports this afternoon from the Industry Commission, I have reserved for this one a more general criticism of the Commission and the way it is reporting. When the Government moved to change the Industries Assistance Commission to the Industry Commission, honourable senators will recall that I moved two amendments which were accepted by the Government. The first amendment was that the Commission contain a commissioner who was experienced and knowledgeable in the area of the environment. The second amendment which the Government accepted was that a constant reference of the Industry Commission should be the environmental consequences of whatever other references it was considering.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the passage of the legislation, Dr Thor Handlo, an environmental economist from Griffith University, was appointed to the Industry Commission. Dr Handlo is a former member of the Australian Conservation Foundation and clearly is somebody who fulfils the requirement of the first of those amendments. However, a large number of references have now been given to the Industry Commission. It is quite clear that there is no way that the Industry Commission can properly fulfil its charter under the second of those amendments-that is, to properly take into account environmental consequences in every other reference that it has-unless the environmental membership of the Commission is substantially increased. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a number of reports coming from the Industry Commission. We have seen some important draft reports. I guess that we will see the definitive reports later in this session of Parliament on such things as electricity generation. </PARA>
<PARA> One can only remark that the Industry Commission is simply not fulfilling its legal charter. That is, to some extent, not a criticism of the Commission because with only one person on it with that background, that experience and that responsibility, it is impossible for that person to sit on every one of those references. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, the Government has a responsibility to see that the Commission fulfils its charter. It can do that only by expanding the representation on the Industry Commission and by providing suitable backup staff. Given the remarks that I made a moment ago in relation to the recycling report, one strongly suspects from the sorts of references, and the source of those references being the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and the nature of the reports that are coming back that there is a deliberate attempt to downplay the significance of the sustainable economy and the industrial development of this country-the sorts of industries that we further, that we promote, that we support in various ways-and to discourage other industries using sustainability as the criterion. That has not been given proper weight by the Treasurer. Neither the Treasurer nor the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) is fulfilling the terms of the legislation which this Parliament passed in relation to the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we need to take this matter up in greater detail with the several Ministers responsible and ensure that that charter-which was accepted by the Senate, as I said earlier, on an amendment which I proposed-is fulfilled. Only then will the Industry Commission be able to properly fulfil its job and to serve the very important function that it should be serving. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to say that the topic of this Report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence in Australia, Racist Violence, demonstrates very clearly a very sad fact about Australian life. It is something that we cannot move away from; that is, that Australia is a racist society. Here is a document, 535 pages long, which proves it. It is a very great shame that that is the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> This report will be a very valuable document for those of us who wish to promote racial harmony in this country and better education about racial issue because there are so many clear examples given in it of racism in so many different areas of Australian life. It really is very important that this document is noted, that it is read and that it is considered carefully, particularly Chapter 8 `Drawing Conclusions from the Evidence', Chapter 12 `Strategies to Confront Racism' and, of course, the 67 recommendations which really ought to be noted. I hope that they will be noted by the Federal Government with great speed. There is a matter of urgency about these situations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee looked at racism in many different aspects of Australian life: towards our indigenous people, the Aboriginal people; Asian people; Middle Eastern people of Muslim extraction; Middle Eastern people of Jewish extraction and non-English speaking people. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make my remarks today mostly about the Aboriginal situation because it is one that I have followed very closely. It does not mean that I am not as concerned about racism that has been directed against other Australians in the groups that I have mentioned. It is all bad and it has all got to stop. </PARA>
<PARA> Appendix 14 is particularly illuminating. It contains 57 pages listing some of the evidence. Many people who testified before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission did not want their particular circumstances and names to be known, for fairly obvious reasons. They have been subject to racist attack and, therefore, were not prepared to allow their names to be published. There is a great deal of confidentiality about some of the material that went before the Commission, but there are 57 pages listing in a shorthand version, if you like, the incidents which were brought before this Commission. They are pretty horrendous. </PARA>
<PARA> On the topic of Australian attitudes towards our real history of contact with indigenous people, we will never have justice in this country unless we recognise the dark side of our history. That needs to be looked at in two ways. There is the proud side of the dark side of our history-that is, the Aboriginal side. Aboriginal people ought to be able to tell their own story and non-Aboriginal Australians should be encouraged to learn to appreciate and to respect Aboriginal culture. That is beginning to happen and a great deal has changed in that respect in the last 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the other side, the side of violence which is perpetrated against Aboriginal people, is endemic in the community. I quote from the Commission report to highlight this:</PARA>
<PARA>The Inquiry considers that racism permeates the day-to-day lives of Aboriginal people either through direct acts of violence, intimidation and racist abuse, or through the more insidious process of discrimination. Discrimination in this context is particularly significant because it operates often through the threat or use of violence, and because it underpins the structural and institutionalised violence which is part of Aboriginal life. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a day-to-day fact of life for Aboriginal people. Any honourable senators who have contact with Aboriginal people will know that to be true. One witness said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . what I am saying to you is that the very foundation, the very bureaucracies, the very infrastructure . . . is fundamentally racist . . . I guess it is called institutionalised racism . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A person testifying before the Committee in Perth said:</PARA>
<PARA>Most Nyoongah [Aboriginal] lads, or adults for that matter, when they see the police, instead of seeing them as someone there to help us in this society, people duck for cover and run away. I am making the point that racial violence is only allowed when society allows it to happen. </PARA>
<PARA>There are so many examples of this attitude. I do not want to be seen as having a bash at the police. I know that in most States now there are education programs to correct the imbalance of information given to police trainees about Aboriginal culture, but a great deal more needs to be done. I also recognise that often the police are faced with very difficult situations, particularly when they are called in to deal with domestic violence involving Aboriginal communities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contents of the Report of National Inquiry into Racist Violence in Australia have been commented on at some length since its release. The depth of the problem is illustrated simply by referring to a couple of the findings of this report. The inquiry found that racist violence is an endemic problem for Aboriginal and Islander people in all Australian States and Territories. Like Senator Vallentine, that is the one aspect that I have chosen to concentrate on. The report also concluded that racist attitudes and practices, both conscious and unconscious, pervade our institutions, both public and private. We need to know no more than this to conclude that this is a problem which must be addressed before it widens and further scars our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst there has been a deal of comment on and controversy about some of the report's findings, there has been little debate over the important recommendations it provides as indications of what should be done to deal with the problems identified. I wish simply to emphasise some of these recommendations and to call on all political parties and groups to consider supporting their implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the recommendations are legislative in nature, focusing on implementation or tightening of laws aimed at preventing or appropriately penalising racist harassment, racist violence and intimidation and incitement of racial hostility. Other recommendations are aimed at making our legal system more accessible and effective through, for example, guaranteeing access to interpreters well versed in the judicial system and enabling a more representative composition of juries. </PARA>
<PARA> The report recognises that it is vital that appropriate training for many professions, including police, educators, journalists and clerical workers, is developed to counter more effectively racist stereotypes and attitudes and to encourage greater awareness and sensitivity of cultural differences between Australians. The role of government instrumentalities is also vital. All areas which provide assistance or service to the public, such as housing, welfare, training, immigration and industry, must be administered and delivered in an anti-racist fashion. The report provides many recommendations to enable this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> There are quite a number of recommendations for the media, too, in this report. I notice that, whilst the media has made much comment on the report's negative findings about the police and others, they have been strangely silent about the report's criticisms of the media. Some of the report's recommendations would not be hard to implement, and they would have a significant impact. These include: encouraging the recruitment of Aboriginal, Islander and non-English speaking journalists; developing a detailed code of practice for journalists reporting issues relating to race and ethnicity; and ensuring that cultural and inter-racial issues are included in journalists' training. I hope that the media consider adopting the report's recommendations, as this would surely help to provide a much more balanced and less sensationalist approach to the reporting of race related issues. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the issue of resources. I know that it is fashionable to want to restrict government expenditure at every opportunity, yet this report shows that we have a clear responsibility to ensure that those members of our community who are subject to racial violence and vilification have access to effective support services. Currently, migrant resource centres and Aboriginal and Islander legal and community centres play a vital role in this, but their effectiveness is hampered by a lack of resources and-as this report makes quite clear-by a lack of support within government and the legal system. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already touched on the recommendations which call for our social structures to be more accessible to enable racial problems to be addressed more effectively. This costs nothing and may save money through greater efficiency, but the fact remains that financial support is also needed to allow those working within the affected communities to address the problem more effectively. Similarly, community relations and education programs do not exist on goodwill alone. They need a firm commitment of funding from all tiers of government. Many of the recommendations are not difficult to implement if there is the political and social will to do so. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . political will and leadership are crucial in addressing concerns expressed to the Inquiry . . . about the commitment of government authorities to deal with the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>When we consider this report in conjunction with the findings of the many reports on Aboriginal deaths in custody, it is absolutely obvious that we can no longer find excuses to delay urgent action in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment briefly on the Report of National Inquiry into Racist Violence in Australia. Firstly, I believe that we owe a great debt of gratitude to the Federal Race Discrimination Commissioner, Irene Moss, and indeed the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for placing this document before us and the community. The report, consisting of 535 pages, documents in great detail the problems that we as a society face. It is up to us now to take action to remedy these matters, which are a blot on our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to address briefly one particular aspect that is covered in this report-that is, the relationship of our police force with the Aboriginal population. The responsibility of the police force is to guard our civilisation and certainly to guard law and order. But I believe that the responsibility of the police force goes further: it should be our guardian, ensuring the fair treatment of all people who come in contact with the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the evidence in this report does not bear that out. There are numerous instances where Aboriginal people have been mistreated by police in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. The time that is available to me does not permit me to go into detail but the evidence is, indeed, horrific. There is evidence of physical mistreatment, treatment that is psychologically cruel and treatment that simply disregards the human status of Aboriginal people as they are caught up in our legal system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that we take action to remedy some of these matters. During a recent visit to Western Australia I discovered that in that State there is no independent police complaints authority. It seems to me that it is essential, on the basis of the evidence of this report alone-also on the basis of many other reports that have come from that State-that we ask the Government of that State to institute an independent police complaints authority, to ensure that people who cannot obtain justice when they have complaints about the treatment that they have received at the hands of police can do so. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>The ANAO reviewed the agreements for liaison and referral of fraud matters from Commonwealth agencies to the AFP and found that there was generally a lack of consistency in agreements and inadequate administration . . . the relationship between the AFP and the Agencies could be improved to ensure that the best use is being made of AFP resources. In some cases the lack of an effective relationship had impeded the investigation of serious matters. The ANAO made a number of recommendations designed to encourage co-operative and effective relationships . . . the corporate plan did not clearly direct AFP activities to the priorities indicated by the Minister. The ANAO considered there should be a clearer nexus between administrative and policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General, on information systems, says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in general, the systems reviewed by the ANAO were found to be inadequate as the basis of decision making. The ANAO has recommended a series of changes that will improve the quality of management information. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>. . . the ANAO noted that the AFP does not adequately direct its fraud resources toward large scale fraud which is identified as a priority by its Minister. A significant proportion of AFP resources are utilised in the investigation of fraud with relatively low value despite the recommendations of the review of fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, this is ludicrous. Apart from the fact that it is obviously a misuse of resources, it is not following ministerial direction. The report continues on to staffing of investigations involving fraud under $500,000 and says:</PARA>
<PARA>The ANAO analysis indicated that the AFP had an excess of staff in this area. However, the ANAO also noted that the adoption of some of the recommendations and changes to legislation would require additional staff resources which would, at least in part, absorb this excess.</PARA>
<PARA>On the management of major fraud investigations the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the ANAO found that the AFP did not adequately control or supervise major fraud investigations and this may have had a negative effect on the success of investigations-</PARA>
<PARA>that seems to follow naturally-</PARA>
<PARA>The ANAO recommended the adoption of a number of measures to standardise procedures and investigative methodology. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . the ANAO found that there was evidence to support the view that fraud investigation units did not have adequate administrative assistance or access to technological support. The ANAO recommended a review of this area. </PARA>
<PARA>These are all very serious comments which are backed up later in the report. I want to raise briefly a couple of those conclusions. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>* there was evidence the `large scale' fraud investigations had not been adequately managed in terms of proper direction to junior staff or supervision of investigative activity</PARA>
<PARA>* although the co-operation and assistance of agencies was frequently vital to a successful police investigation, the ANAO noted situations where the lack of co-operation by Commonwealth agencies with the AFP impeded the effective investigation of serious criminal offences</PARA>
<PARA>* `large scale' fraud investigations frequently take a considerable period of time and in the AFP this has, on occasions, led to a high turnover of case officers. It is the view of the ANAO that staffing changes can result in inefficient or inconclusive investigations</PARA>
<PARA>* the ANAO noted a lack of consistency in administrative practices and a wide variation in the approach to investigations. The ANAO is of the view that an investigation methodology (as is currently observed in the NOD investigation teams) and standardised administrative procedures would greatly enhance the potential for the management of investigations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then we come to a particularly serious one-</PARA>
<PARA>* the ANAO was concerned at the low `success' rate in investigations and the frequently protracted period of investigation required in `large scale' fraud matters. Whilst the success of an investigation is in part outside the control of the AFP, the ANAO noted instances where the AFP may not have taken all the available steps to conclude an investigation. It was also apparent that some matters were left for significant periods whilst (presumably) higher priority matters were investigated. These delays would not improve the likelihood of a successful outcome for investigations.</PARA>
<PARA>These matters, along with the various recommendations, are of some substance. I think we should commend the Auditor-General for his comments. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, however, there is one question we have to resolve: what is the estimated level of fraud against the Commonwealth? There have been suggestions that the identified value of fraud against the Commonwealth has been in multi billions of dollars. In 1986 the Special Minister of State referred to cited estimates of the value of fraud against the Commonwealth ranging between $1 billion a year and as much as $30 billion a year. He went on to say that these assessments could be exaggerated. Either we are pursuing only a very small proportion of these matters, or the earlier estimates of the value of fraud against the Commonwealth are significantly overstated. The identified value of fraud against the Commonwealth, according to the Auditor-General, is something like $55m a year. Of this figure, prosecutions involving fraud offences valued at $42m were completed in respect of matters referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions by the AFP. This represented prosecutions involving large scale fraud valued at $38m and prosecutions of other fraud valued at $4m. As I mentioned earlier, I do not intend to spend much time on this as Senator Bishop wishes to proceed with the matter. I commend the Auditor-General for this most useful report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Audit Report No. 25 1990-91 on the Australian Federal Police, I too would like to commend the Auditor-General for the manner in which he addresses some very important points. There are two with which I would like to deal specifically-the Cash Transaction Reports Agency and the privacy legislation. The Cash Transaction Reports Agency and the legislation which created that Agency and determined how it was to operate were heralded by the Government as being an important tool to detect major crime, following Costigan's idea that one should follow the money trail. Yet, this report from the Auditor-General says that all those sorts of aspirations and hopes that were held for this legislation simply are not being fulfilled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Auditor-General found that there were several aspects which required his criticism. I will deal firstly with 2.4.9, where the Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA>At the time of audit all reports referred to the AFP by the CTRA related to suspicious transactions and the majority involved transactions with a value of less than $10,000. </PARA>
<PARA>The figure of $10,000 was originally touted as being a crucial sum-that it was this amount and amounts above that which would lead us to major criminals. In relation to the concentration on suspicious transactions, the Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA>As a result the AFP was investigating matters that were not high priority in terms of the Ministerial Direction. It was also conducting the initial investigation of possible fraud occurring in agencies. This activity was identified in recommendations of the review of fraud as the prime responsibility of the agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General pointed out that the result of all of this meant that, in a way, people who were reported pursuant to this legislation via this agency were treated in a discriminatory way as opposed to those people who were investigated by the agency which had the responsibility for the area where the fraud was taking place. The Auditor-General went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The current arrangements will lead to inequities in the treatment of cases of fraud. It was accepted by Government that minor instances of fraud should be dealt with administrative remedy wherever appropriate. Under current CTRA legislation the AFP must deal with the matter itself and, as it is unable to apply administrative sanctions-</PARA>
<PARA>it simply has no power-</PARA>
<PARA>either it will not investigate the matters, due to other priorities, or alternatively it will prosecute them.</PARA>
<PARA>That same matter, if dealt with by the agency responsible, could have been dealt with in an administrative way. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The ANAO is of the opinion that this inconsistency in the treatment of routine instances of fraud arising from CTRA reports should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>I will deal with the need to address that question and compare it with the requirements of the privacy legislation and the problems that are posed by accepting the Auditor-General's suggestion that perhaps minor matters should be able to be referred to the agency, that is, that they should breach the Privacy Act 1988 principle 11 and pass on information so that it can be dealt with in an administrative matter. The worry I have is that that opens up a loophole in the privacy legislation which, in my view, is far from satisfactory anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the heading, `Cash Transaction Reports Agency' on the question of privacy, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>The AFP has had some difficulty in maintaining confidentiality of the source of the referrals. Legal opinion has been sought to determine whether the method of dealing with CTRA reports was in breach of the privacy provisions of the Act. The opinion of the Counsel General was that the AFP was acting to enforce Commonwealth law and was able to reveal certain information in respect of these enquiries to an agency (such as the Department of Social Security) where the referral related to that agency. However, the AFP was required to retain control of the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a dilemma in that we have two possible interpretations of a privacy legislation which was designed to be the safety valve to prevent the misuse of information that has been gathered pursuant to the Cash Transaction Reports Agency and indeed other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the section headed, `Privacy legislation', on page 16 of the report, the Auditor-General sets out a very useful paragraph where he simply says that:</PARA>
<PARA>Privacy legislation was enacted in 1988 and established a number of privacy safeguards for the treatment of information. In general terms, the principles deal with the methods of collection of personal information, the storage and security of personal information, the accuracy of records, the use of personal information and access to their own personal information by individuals.</PARA>
<PARA>Privacy principle 11 of the Privacy Act, which restricts the disclosure of information, subject to five exceptions, is then set out. Exception 1(e) of that principle relates to the disclosure and says that it is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The word `reasonably' was put there for a deliberate purpose. This has been interpreted by the Privacy Commissioner to require that a reasonable suspicion has been formed that an offence has been committed. </PARA>
<PARA> But this interpretation is apparently not one shared by the Attorney-General's Department, which has expressed the view that law enforcement includes activities of detection as well as investigation. We already have, by way of opinion from Crown law officers, the exceptions whereby people are forbidden to share or hand over information, which has been gathered pursuant to various pieces of legislation, to other agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the recent Estimates hearings, we have heard many instances-they are starting to form a growing list-of concerns where the privacy legislation is being breached. For example, we have heard that officers within the Australian Taxation Office are creating and selling tax file numbers, and that evidence given before the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales has shown that customs officers have been to information swapping parties and broken the law by handing over information. We have heard reports from the Auditor-General that security in the Tax Office is far from satisfactory. As well as those blatant breaches, we have identified in this most useful report of the Auditor-General definitions of the provisions concerning privacy being broadened and extended to the detriment of the protection of privacy of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>The interpretation is important to the AFP, in that it directly influences its capacity to detect and investigate fraud (and other matters). The trade-off between intrusive law enforcement investigative methods and legitimate privacy interests requires a balance to be set. A narrow interpretation will limit the extent to which the AFP can detect and investigate fraud matters, but to allow unrestricted access to information may raise legitimate concerns over privacy.</PARA>
<PARA>These are matters which the Government must address. Every time the question of privacy and worries of the type that I have just demonstrated in the Estimates committees are raised, we have been given a bland assurance that it really is all right and that we do not have to worry because we have the Privacy Commissioner and legislation. Clearly, as the calendar rolls on, we see more and more examples of things simply not being all right in protecting privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I raise concerning this report deals with finance directions. The simple statement of what financial directions are and how they are required to be obeyed is important. Again and again we have seen-usually deriving from Estimates hearings where we are able to ask questions and elicit answers-many occasions when departmental officers breach finance regulations. The most blatant example recently concerned the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce where we heard the most amazing statement from Dr Bell, a very senior officer in that Department, when breaches of the Audit Act were pointed out to him. In one case an appropriation had been made for one purpose and departmental officers had simply taken the money from that appropriation and used it for a non-appropriated purpose. When queried about those matters, his answer was simply that they are only technical breaches and that his Department has a difference of opinion with the Auditor-General. I am afraid that that will just not do. Officers of the Commonwealth are obliged and required to obey the law. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition or statement that the Auditor-General sets out at page 18 is most useful to have. Various departmental officers ought to learn it off by heart. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Finance (DoF) issues Finance Directions that provide the basis for control in the administration of financial matters. The Directions establish the set of rules that are required to be observed when dealing with Commonwealth revenues or expenditures. The Audit Act requires conformity with these Directions.</PARA>
<PARA>I consider that this report of the Auditor-General is a most useful one. I dare say it will be discussed widely and could well have important ramifications for amending legislation which we may subsequently see. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that this report demonstrates very clearly the value of the work done by the Auditor-General. The picture that is emerging from the report is one of an organisation or agency where the type and volume of work being done has changed quite substantially yet the organisation, as bureaucratic organisations tend to, has continued on its merry way using methods which are now totally inappropriate. In 1986-87 the agency-the Australian Federal Police (AFP)-in this area had a total of 43,700 referrals on fraud matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet as a result of direct bank payments to recipients as well as a recommendation by the review of systems for dealing with fraud on the Commonwealth that agencies investigate and prosecute fraud themselves and generally refer only those cases of a more complex nature and larger in scale to the AFP, that volume fell to 9,500 in 1989-90. However, the report found that the AFP had continued to devote a large proportion of its resources to the investigation of low value fraud. More than 50 per cent of the matters investigated by the AFP had a value of less than $1,000 and more than 80 per cent had a value less than $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also note the request, which is one of the most important ones in this report, that the very objectives of the organisation should be reviewed since the last direction obtained from the then Special Minister of State is now five years old and several matters-in fact a large number of events-have taken place. I shall mention a couple of those. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Crime Authority (NCA) was formed under the relevant Act in 1984 and has indeed been active in matters such as drugs and organised crime, which had been identified as high priorities for the AFP. As we know, under its new chairman, Mr Justice Phillips, the National Crime Authority will also carry out substantial work in the white collar crime area. Yet it would appear that at this stage no clear definition of the potential overlap and how these agencies will work together has been arrived at. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority I am particularly interested in this matter, and I trust that this is one area that will receive urgent attention as both the effectiveness of the NCA and the Australian Federal Police could be called into question unless their respective roles are clarified. The other major area which is listed in the report and which would impinge on the work of the AFP is the formation of the Australian Securities Commission which has been established, giving the Commonwealth much wider responsibilities in respect of corporate law. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to repeat the comments made by Senator Michael Baume about the details of the report but in the recommendations there are three matters which the AFP has not noted with support. An interesting pattern has developed, and can be seen in the list of recommendations, where the AFP supports each recommendation, with the exception of those three, sometimes with an addendum. But there are three which the AFP has left without such a comment and one cannot help wondering whether the AFP is prepared to cooperate in the implementation of such recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> One of them is recommendation No. 3, which suggests that criteria be developed for inclusion in the agreements with other agencies. The AFP, while in general terms supporting the recommendations, puts in a proviso saying that the criteria should not necessarily be determined in terms of the size of the complaint but that several other criteria should be considered. In this respect clearly the AFP is at variance with the Auditor-General and some further work needs to be done. Recommendation No. 19, which indicates that the AFP should act to ensure that performance indicators are consistent and indeed reliable measures of AFP activity, does not receive any comment of support from the AFP either. One can only wonder why such a measure, which would go to the efficiency measurement of the AFP, is apparently left without agreement by the AFP. The Auditor-General recommends that the AFP adopt procedures to ensure full and timely review of case files by managers during and at the completion of investigation. Once again we find that there is no supporting comment made by the AFP. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a statement in the report that inter-agency agreements have not only been difficult to conclude-and two are mentioned in that category: the Australian Customs Service and the Telecom agreements-but that there is at least one exception, the Department of Defence, where, despite consistent efforts, such an agreement has not been concluded. This must be a matter of concern because, clearly, the objective of the AFP to investigate fraud in Commonwealth government agencies cannot proceed with efficiency unless such agreements are concluded speedily. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I table the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Romania, Greece, Anzac Parliamentary Group and the North Atlantic Assembly of November 1990. It was my privilege to be selected for this delegation and it became my pleasure to be a part of it. The first country which we visited was Romania, and I intend to speak at some length about our visit to that country. It was a most important visit. We were the first parliamentary delegation to visit Romania since the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime and since that country moved from communism towards some form of democracy and held its elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are in my view some lessons for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans and the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, who respectively are sending people to China and Bougainville to conduct inquiries. For the week we were in Romania we conducted substantial inquiries. I say to those Ministers that there are major difficulties in making adequate inquiries in any foreign country unless one speaks the language and is aware of the subtleties of language passing backwards and forwards among people. There are major difficulties in any event in making an assessment of a particular country in a relatively short period. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the number of times that Australians complain about some visitor to this country who, having been here for five minutes, proceeds to make profound statements about what is wrong with the country, what we ought to be doing to it and all the rest of it. That is taken with a grain of salt in Australia. That is why I say that what our delegation says in relation to Romania needs to be taken with a degree of caution. With all due respect to Senator Gareth Evans's delegation to China and Senator Robert Ray's delegation to Bougainville, those reports will have to be treated very cautiously. In particular, I urge them to consider sending someone along who speaks the language as a native or an interpreter who is able to understand the language as a native. At least that will provide us with that advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, we made this investigation into Romania. One of our major aims was to assess the changes that had taken place since the fall of Ceausescu, including whether democracy in Romania has a future; the state of its economy; whether it has learned about human rights, especially regarding the Hungarian minority; whether it realised there was a relationship between economic aid and human rights; and Romania's attitude towards the so-called miners' revolts on 13-15 June, which were in fact riots, allegedly involving miners allegedly called in by President Iliescu. </PARA>
<PARA> We were welcomed with great generosity and warmth and spoke with a wide variety of people-from parliamentarians, both Government and Opposition, Ministers, bureaucrats, media and welfare workers to ordinary people. There were no limits, although it must be remembered of course that our itinerary had been set by our hosts. As I mentioned, we did not speak the language. We formed a number of tentative-I emphasise the word tentative-conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Romania have been repressed for longer than anyone alive can remember. They have suffered the tyranny of monopoly or oligopoly rule for centuries. Therefore, it is no surprise that they have little understanding of democracy. Likewise, after nearly 50 years of communist domination, their knowledge of free market economies is at best superficial and theoretical. They talk about the pain of moving into a market economy situation, but they are already suffering great deprivation. What further pain could these people put up with without revolting again? Could a democratic government maintain office while it was inflicting such pain upon its own people? It is interesting to make a comparison of the achievements of Chile under the dictatorship of Pinochet and that of other countries in South America which operate under elected governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The impression of the whole delegation was that the elected parliamentarians, the Ministers and the bureaucrats are determined to make the transition to a Western style democracy and to a free market. We had many opportunities for confidential conversations with members of the opposition parties and individuals, but there were few major complaints. I recall one complaint from a citizen which demonstrated a total lack of understanding of democracy at work. This woman was from the Transylvania area and acted as our interpreter. We discussed her views on what was happening in Romania. </PARA>
<PARA> Her bitter complaint was about the Opposition, not about the Government. She thought that the Opposition should appreciate the Government's difficulties and should support its efforts. She said, `After all, this Government is really doing its best and the Opposition should shut up and support the Government in what it is endeavouring to do'. I could not help but think of the Australian Labor Party; that is what it would have us do. It was a total demonstration of what happens under a one party communist-controlled system. Here was an intelligent woman in her thirties, an interpreter who spoke a number of languages, who had so little idea of democracy that she thought that the Opposition ought to be blamed because it was not helping the Government out. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Opposition members of parliament told us publicly that they believed there had been some fraud in the 1990 elections. The estimate of one of them-he was said to be the extremist Opposition member-was that the maximum amount of fraud was about 15 per cent. However, he and all of the Opposition members agreed that whatever fraud had occurred made no difference to the result. Romania has a parliament which has, in effect, been elected for the purpose of drawing up a constitution. That is its aim. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is very concerned to ensure that the constitution requires full disclosure. We discussed with government members and with one of the legal committees the sort of terminology that might be used. We discussed with them the difficulties that a written constitution containing expressions of freedom will bring about for a government. But they were determined that its constitution would set out the fundamental principles of freedom. At the end, the overwhelming feeling of the delegation was that the parliamentarians-both Government and Opposition members-who had been elected in May last year following the overthrow of Ceausescu are determined to adopt a fair, open and democratic constitution. That is what they are working on. Although we should be cautious in our conclusions about their ability to adopt such a constitution, we feel they were fair dinkum about it and applaud them for it. It is expected that the constitution will be finalised and new elections held no later than the middle of 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> We did discuss the so-called miners' revolt with everyone-parliamentarians, Ministers, bureaucrats and ordinary people. We concluded that the lesson-that they really cannot treat their people in a way where a group of alleged miners comes in to beat up their fellow citizens-had been learned. Of course, our conclusion may be invalid. We think that the message has been learned. As I say, that conclusion may be invalid: if the pain of reform becomes too great, as I indicated before, that could lead to a further revolt. Alternatively, the basis for our premise-that is, what we were told had happened-may prove to be invalid. The worry is that the allegedly dismantled Securitate-the security police-may have been involved in the riots; we do not know. We certainly were not told that they were, but subsequent reports and investigations by other people have indicated that this is a possibility. If that is so, I am sure that the approach of the Securitate next time will be much more subtle than that of June last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Our wide-ranging discussions involved both economic and political reforms. I have been talking about political reforms. Moving to the economic discussions, the country and its people are impoverished. They desperately need the West's capital, expertise and technology. They have some resources and they have no foreign debt. Ceausescu was concerned about paying off the foreign debt. He forced the people to work six and sometimes seven days a week for the state to ensure that the state had no debts and built him a marvellous palace. This marvellous palace, situated in the heart of Bucharest, has not been completed. The people are impoverished. They have little in the way of efficient infrastructure. Membership of the European Community and a free market seems like a golden apple to many of them. </PARA>

<PARA> Before the dinner break I was saying that this country is quite poverty stricken and, to many of the people of Romania, membership of the European Community and a free market seems like some sort of golden apple. The truth of the matter is that, although they say they understand that the transition will be painful, I fear they really do not understand the depth of the pain that they will have to suffer-especially as they are already in a situation of great deprivation. I fear that further pain might lead, ultimately, to another revolution of the people and/or possibly to another dictatorship which might arise to take over in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of the country are enormous. But I say to any people who are thinking of investing there that I think there are enormous opportunities. I understand that a number of British people have already invested in Romania. In particular, I would urge Australians of Romanian origin who speak the language and understand the problems and who have been successful business people in Australia to look at the opportunities for sound investments in their former country. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall be brief in mentioning orphans and health care. I refer the Senate to the report. Members of the delegation did visit two of the orphanages and also met Stephen Toma and Dr Barbara Bascour of World Vision. These people estimate that up to 9 per cent of Romania's orphans are recoverable to normality and they are seeking help to achieve this. It is a massive problem. It was also brought to our attention that the physically and mentally handicapped people of Romania were living in terrible conditions and the plight of the aged was equally dreadful. I refer the Senate to the report for further details about those problems. By contrast, Ceausescu's palace, Romania House, stands as a monument to an egotistical monster. </PARA>
<PARA> Romania is grey and cold, especially in Bucharest in November. Life is grim; survival is a fight. There were no smiling faces and little animation, except at demonstrations, and most people still carry with them a sense of fear. For example, we heard a story of a fellow who wanted to sell his pig. Previously under Ceausescu the sale of animals was forbidden-a person did not really own an animal; it belonged to the state. This fellow apparently went to some authority and asked whether he could sell his pig. He was told that, yes, he could just go and sell it. He said, `Give me a bit of paper that says I can sell it'. That is the sort of fear which still existed in 1990 in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Bucharest is like many other old European cities, with large squares and some beautiful old buildings. Unfortunately, they are decaying and the recent bullet holes do not help. One wonders when this country will ever have sufficient resources to be able to restore those buildings to the condition they were in many years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The only spark of life and animation that we saw was when four members of our delegation were caught on the edge of a demonstration. That was a grim and purposeful affair. Mr Peter Duncan, who apparently has some knowledge of what happens at demonstrations, recognised immediately what was going on and flashed us past this group of people. My wife and I were somewhat casual about it and did not recognise how grim and purposeful it was until we were caught in the middle of it. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, our hosts, guides, and interpreters could not have been warmer or more welcoming. Our whole delegation was moved and encouraged by the Romanians' endeavour to democratise their country. But we must keep in mind their history of tyrannical rule and understand that it is just as difficult to unlearn the lessons of the past as it is to learn lessons for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to Greece. The delegation arrived in Athens in the evening and the contrast with Bucharest was incredible. We had been in Romania for a week and we had forgotten that there were no lights. In the hotel it had been practically dark because only one globe was alight every now and then and the wattage was about 20 or 15 watts or less. There were few lights in the streets. Then we arrived in Athens in the evening. It was just unbelievable. We had come from a grim city of people in desperate straits who were fighting to survive, to a noisy, bustling, thriving city of the West-it was a bit like coming home. There were lights everywhere, traffic, noise, people laughing and talking, and butter-it was the first butter we had tasted for a week. </PARA>
<PARA> What was not like home was the unbelievable pollution from the vehicle exhaust gases. I tried leaving my hotel window open but at one o'clock in the morning I had to get up and shut it because I could not cope with the fumes coming up from the square outside my hotel. A walk around Athens makes one's eyes burn and jogging is out-one runs out of oxygen if one tries to jog. </PARA>

<PARA> Our very worthwhile meetings and discussions in Greece are detailed in the report, but I do not want to go into them. I want to refer specifically to two meetings that we had-one with the President of the Pasok Party, Mr Andreas Papandreou, and the other with Mr Charilaos Florakis, the Chairman of the Coalition Left and Progress Party, which is in fact the Communist Party of Greece. I think its membership comprises nine or 10 members of parliament, so it is a fairly solid sort of Communist Party. There are very few Communists. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;More than the Democrats. I have to be honest and say that I did not want to see Mr Papandreou. We had to go to see him at his home. He is, of course, subject to prosecution and he is living almost a hermit's life. It meant a drive through the streets of Athens for about three hours in heavy traffic and, as far as I was concerned, it was all for what? To go to meet an elderly gentleman who was yesterday's man. Let me assure the Senate that I was wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I asked him the first question-a simple question-would he like to talk to us about the Gulf? For an hour and a half he held us absolutely spellbound about the crisis in the Gulf. One has to appreciate that at that stage the debate was about: would there be a war? How long would it take? How many people would be killed? How many of our service people in the United Nations coalition forces would be killed? Would there be a war or would Hussein finally see the light and give in?</PARA>
<PARA> As I say, this fellow held us spellbound. Of course, he knows Saddam Hussein personally. He was able to predict Hussein's reactions for us. He went further and, for the first time among the people I had been speaking to, he started to talk to us about what would happen after the war. There was no question, of course, but that the United Nations forces would win. He then started to raise with us the Kurdish problem-what would we do about the Kurds in the northern part of Iraq? What would we do with the problems in Turkey? He raised those difficulties with us. </PARA>
<PARA> He also predicted that Hussein would not leave Kuwait without setting fire to the oilfields. He raised the sights of the whole delegation to beyond the war, and this was before the Gulf war started. All of his predictions have come true. He demonstrated that sort of leadership which makes one understand why he was the Prime Minister of Greece for a period of time and why he is still the leader of the Pasok Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The other fellow was Mr Florakis, who is an old communist warhorse with an engaging personality. He was a personal friend of Joe Stalin, and there would be few of them still around in this world. Mr Florakis still believes-because I raised it with him-that the Soviet march on Hungary and Czechoslovakia was an internal matter and not for outsiders to criticise. It will not surprise the Senate to know that he and I clashed, but we ended up with mutual respect for each other and, on my part, a sneaking admiration for an old political warhorse that I recognised the moment I started to talk to him. </PARA>

<PARA> We flew to London to participate, we thought, in two forums: the Anzac Westminster Parliamentary Group and the thirty-sixth annual session of the North Atlantic Assembly. However, unfortunately, the Anzac Group was destined not to meet on this occasion because on the day we arrived the Prime Minister of England, Margaret Thatcher, resigned. There was parliamentary turmoil and the delegation was privileged to be invited to be in the Strangers' Gallery of the House of Commons on the day she resigned. </PARA>
<PARA> Not one of us will ever forget the magnificent parliamentary performance of Mrs Thatcher on that day. Never have I seen such strength and sheer raw courage, notwithstanding how she must have been feeling. She came into the chamber for Prime Minister's Question Time, which goes on for just over 15 minutes. She took it and she was absolutely brilliant. When it finished, she slumped in her chair and I looked at her knowing that within the next two hours she had to come back into the chamber to defend a censure motion. I could not see how she could possibly recover sufficiently to come back in. </PARA>
<PARA> However, she came back into the chamber and she gave us 30 minutes of an absolutely brilliant speech. She demolished the Opposition and she demolished her own side, I might say. She demonstrated beyond any shadow of doubt that she was the most able parliamentarian in the House of Commons on that day. It was a performance that all of us will long remember and I might say that it impressed the Australian Labor Party members of the delegation as much as it impressed me. </PARA>
<PARA> The North Atlantic Assembly is the parliamentary forum of the North Atlantic Alliance. Until this visit, Australia and Japan were the only non-member countries granted observer status and we had been pushing for a greater participating role. This time, after some deliberation, the standing committee of the Assembly afforded non-member parliamentary delegations, including Australia, a more active role. We were permitted to take a seat at the committee tables with a right to speak both in committee debates and plenary sessions but, of course, with no voting rights. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to granting these rights to Australia and Japan, the Assembly granted the same rights to the eastern European former communist countries, with the notable exception of Romania. The so-called miners revolt in Romania has meant that Romania is not trusted. Its elected parliamentarians were not given the acknowledgment and encouragement that we thought they deserved, and we made the point that we thought that they deserved recognition to the President and others of the Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian delegation was well received and participated well. Participation in this Assembly is worthwhile and should be nurtured. Continuity of attendance is of great importance because that will increase our ability to have our views heard, as well as ensuring that the Assembly takes a global perspective and not just a Euro-American one. I do not know how we overcome this because on both sides of the chamber we swap the delegates for each of these Assembly visits. The result is that we are always new delegates who are feeling our way, instead of delegates who know the people there and who can push their views more strongly, perhaps, because of their knowledge of the procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank the North Atlantic Assembly for its hospitality, which was very good. All of us especially enjoyed the reception which we had at Buckingham Palace, the chance to have a look at Buckingham Palace and the chance to meet and speak with the Queen. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to report that the delegation was particularly harmonious. Incredibly, we spent most of our spare time together even after a month of living in close contact with each other. For this I would like to thank the other members of the delegation: the leader, Con Sciacca, and Tina Sciacca; David and Monique Connolly and their son Ellis; Arch and Cathy Bevis; Peter and Julie Duncan; Rod and Aldona Sawford; Bruce and Cynthia Goodluck, who were with us only briefly because Bruce was unwell; and, of course, my wife Willie. The secretary of the delegation deserves a special mention for her unfailing good humour, her enthusiasm and her ability to get the job done. I say a very sincere thank you to Anne Hazelton. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a most informative and worthwhile trip. Romania was an education. Seeing a beautiful country with so many people in such desperate straits touched us all. It also made us more aware of our great good fortune in having freedom and democracy handed to us without bloodshed or years of struggle and deprivation. Greece, the cradle of democracy, has her economic problems as we have, but the contrast with Romania and, indeed, the rest of eastern Europe is like life and death. Greece is also a member of the European Common Market and we received a sympathetic hearing for our trading problems with the Common Market body. Likewise, in London, the delegation made known the interests of Australia in the many levels of discussion that took place there. I thank the Senate for allowing me to attend this delegation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am continuing my remarks from 17 April on this subject of uranium concentrate and the payments that should be made by companies, particularly for the clean-up operations. This applies particularly to the Office of the Supervising Scientist attached to the Ranger uranium mine. The point needs to be re-emphasised that those of us who are concerned about the environmental impact of the uranium industry believe that all uranium mining, including Roxby Downs at the moment, which is the only other operating mine, should come under the auspices of the Office of the Supervising Scientist and that the companies involved should pay for the operation of that Office and that the Office should have more teeth to be able to make prosecutions rather than just recommendations as is the present situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I then went on to talk about the present expansion of the uranium industry debate which is going on in the Australian Labor Party at the moment in the run-up to the centenary conference of the Labor Party in Hobart in June. I had mentioned that Mr Kerin's famous letter, leaked and very widely publicised, was flawed in many different respects. I went through the five different points and I think adequately showed that the arguments Mr Kerin put forward just do not stand up. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time remaining to me in this debate I want to move on to a couple of other issues connected with this possible expansion of the uranium industry in this country. One of those which are outstanding is the question of insurance. This is a very difficult, dicey question for insurance companies globally as they try to grapple with the problems which can be faced by them in terms of compensation claims relating to the nuclear industry. I am indebted for some of these remarks to Greenpeace which has put together a lot of very useful lobbying material which is circulating particularly among members of the Australian Labor Party at the moment in the hope that there will not be a change in the direction of the expansion of the uranium industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously uranium mining in Australia should not be allowed to expand as we are clearly contributing to an industry which the insurance markets believe is so dangerous that it cannot be covered in the normal way. Victims of nuclear accidents will not be properly compensated. Australia's uranium trade implicates the country in an industry which exceeds the risks of other industrial activities. To give a couple of examples-the British life insurance companies have expressed an unwillingness to offer cover to workers at the very famous Sellafield nuclear plant in that country. British Nuclear Fuels which operates the site has paid a total of $1.8m in compensation to workers who have contracted cancer. In court cases on behalf of the children of Sellafield workers, the successful insurance companies might well refuse any cover for reprocessing workers, because it is just too dangerous. The companies do not know how many cases they will be up for. </PARA>
<PARA> A case closer to home of which Australians need to be aware is that Indonesia has announced plans to build 12 reactors by the year 2010. I hope that this never comes to pass because it could create all kinds of problems for Australia, particularly if the plants which may not have the latest technology, or even if they do have it, run into difficulties in future years. As a close neighbour to Indonesia, we could suffer from fall-out effect as the countries in Europe suffered from the Chernobyl disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as that there is a problem for the Labor Party because Indonesia lies in an earthquake zone and we need to know whether insurance companies in this country would be prepared to take on insurance policies with relation to any possible nuclear contamination emanating from plants in Indonesia. That is a matter that certainly needs to be considered. There are no international boundaries, as we know, and following the Soviet example, it is clear that the Soviet Union has yet to pay any compensation to the European countries which were contaminated as a result of the Chernobyl disaster. It has left them in an invidious position, and we do not want to encourage that to happen here. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question I want to touch on briefly is that of safeguards. It has been demonstrated very clearly in the past that safeguards are not worth the paper they are written on. We had a perfect example of that today. Senator Coulter directed a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) about Iraq's capacity to build nuclear weapons, how much uranium it had before the war, how much it has after the war, and so on. The Minister said that there will be an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection coming up next week, so it has taken a war to force that to happen. The IAEA is promoting the nuclear industry as well as monitoring it. That has always been an unacceptable contradiction in my estimation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister went on to say that France and the Soviet Union supply to Iraq, and Australia supplies France, so that there is no guarantee that Australian uranium has not ended up in Iraq and could be used in its reprocessing and preparation for nuclear weapons. France sells to Iraq enriched uranium and it has been very clearly demonstrated by the huge row that erupted here 3 1/2 years ago that Australian uranium entering the French nuclear fuel cycle goes through a tricastin plant in particular which is directly linked into the French nuclear weapons making program; it is not restricted to use for nuclear energy. </PARA>
<PARA> We know-we have had it demonstrated-that the safeguards are not worth the paper that they are written on. We know that there is a direct possible link from Australian uranium through France to Iraq. I think that that is totally unacceptable. It is another very good reason for not expanding the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There is always the question of waste. Mr Kerin seemed to think that the waste problem was no longer relevant. I do not know how he arrives at that conclusion because we have already got a huge problem in Australia relating to the nuclear fuel rods from Lucas Heights. There are 1,600 highly radioactive spent fuel rods in storage at Lucas Heights because the Government does not know what to do with them. I do not envy it the problem of trying to figure it out either; it is a really hard one. The last thing we want to do is to add to that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin talked about Synroc as a possible answer, but not one country that has nuclear power has purchased the Synroc technology. Obviously, it has not been proven to the extent of being acceptable to the users. We have an enormous problem, internationally, with all levels of waste-low level waste, medium level waste and high level waste. Synroc may solve the problem to some degree, but it has not been accepted by the nuclear industry internationally as an answer to the problem. I think we have to remind the people of Australia that the end product of uranium mining is nuclear waste and, even worse than that, it could be nuclear weapons. The waste problem has certainly not been solved-not by any stretch of the imagination. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue which has not been mentioned very much, certainly not by the proponents of the industry-they do not want to mention it; they want to keep it very quiet-and not even by people within the Australian Labor Party who have some misgivings about it, is the decommissioning of existing nuclear plants. There are many plants which are nearing the end of their useful lives. They become so highly contaminated, so highly radioactive, that they are not safe for workers; they are not safe to be in or around. The decommissioning of plants is something that will be increasingly on the international agenda in the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> There has not been a successful device worked out for how to do that. These reactors are huge and they can be mothballed-that is, encased in massive amounts of cement-in which case we are building ghastly, ugly monuments for future generations to have to look at. There is no guarantee that mothballing in a thick layer of cement will do the trick either. We just do not know. The cost is absolutely prohibitive. Whatever way is devised to deal with this decommissioning-it has not been done yet; there is no proven tested way of dealing with it-we can be sure that the cost will be astronomic. This cost is never built into the cost of the provision of nuclear power; it is never once mentioned. It will be a huge environmental problem, adding to the existing waste problem from the smaller items that I have already mentioned, the plants themselves and, of course, the cost factor which is never taken into account. I think that is something of which we need to be very much aware. </PARA>
<PARA> Since speaking in the debate on 17 April, there has been a delegation of Martu people visiting Perth. They were very obviously lobbying the State politicians about their possible plight if the uranium industry were expanded in this country. The Kintyre deposit, which has been explored by CRA Ltd, is ready to go. The industry is very keen to get the go-ahead for that and it would have devastating effects on the Martu people. I want to stress again that 120 or so people travelled all the way from the Rudall River region to Perth for the protest rally about mining in national parks. The decision from the Labor Party in Western Australia to excise areas out of our three major national parks in Western Australia-Rudall River being one of them, and particularly relevant to this topic because uranium is a mineral that is up for mining there-has been really disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision will not only affect a national park and a dry river ecosystem and be a uranium issue; it encroaches right on to the self-determination of the Martu people from the Pangurr, Punmu and Cotton Creek communities, which have tried for the last 10 years to go back to their traditional lifestyle. They have been through all of the problems associated with being fringe dwellers-all of the negativity associated with that. They have taken themselves back to their traditional country and they deserve every bit of support. They have a dry community there, they have set up a school and they are teaching their kids their culture. Apart from the threat that they constantly feel from the insecurity of tenure that they have on their own land because of CRA's push for uranium mining there, with the conflicting signals that they are getting from the Western Australian Government about it and the uranium issue being on the agenda of the national conference they feel extremely threatened indeed. They should not have to go through that; they should be getting our full support. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it really puzzling. I would have thought that the results of the committee of inquiry, which is now nearly three years old and which took submissions from hundreds of people around Australia, 98 per cent of whom were against the expansion of the industry, would have been a clear enough lesson to the Labor Party not to put uranium mining on the agenda again-not to try to change this policy in the direction of expansion. I do not think the Labor Party can afford it. There are enough difficulties to deal with around the country without adding in something like this which is totally unnecessary to argue about at the centenary conference. </PARA>
<PARA> This certainly has a sense of deja vu about it as far as I am concerned. When I was first elected to this place in 1984 uranium mining was one of the main platforms on which I campaigned-and here we are again. It is really quite difficult to understand. I know that the Left faction is firm on this one. I trust that it will stand absolutely resolute on this one. It has caused enough angst in the Party already. I hope that the Centre Left faction does the right thing and makes it clear before conference, and certainly at conference, that this will not get a run from the delegates at this conference. </PARA>
<PARA> This industry is a discredited industry; it is declining internationally. I made that point in the first part of my speech a couple of weeks ago. If we needed any other reminder about the dirt and the problems that come from this industry, we needed only to look into the eyes of the Chernobyl children who were here very recently on a get well visit. It was great that they were able to come here. But those kids, and many more like them, are suffering the effects of the nuclear industry in their country. It is a morally bankrupt industry, full of lies and deceit. It is not telling the truth about the dangers, but trying to cover up all the time where there are problems. I think we should leave it well alone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1991. The legislation essentially proposes to increase the export duty on uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory from $1.15 a kilogram to $1.30 a kilogram from 21 February 1990. It is clear that this is due to increasing costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is significant to note again that the Government has chosen to levy only the Ranger uranium mine and not other companies which are attracting activity by the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS). For instance, the Office of the Supervising Scientist now has responsibility for the conservation zone and Coronation Hill, in particular. Yet, thus far, there is no levy upon Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) for the expenditure in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the second recommendation of a review of the OSS by Professor G. Taylor, set up, I think, by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories in 1989, was:</PARA>
<PARA>The collection of the costs for the Office of the Supervising Scientist from companies in respect of the Conservation Zone be by way of an annual fee upon renewal of exploration authorities, and if mining commences, by means of a levy specified in the lease conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me just say that one of the concerns I have is with the level of efficiency that we find in the Office of the Supervising Scientist. The Office has been subject to very considerable legitimate criticisms. It has been subject to a number of inquiries and perhaps one of the most trenchant critics is Ranger. So far, it seems to me that other than inquiries there has been no constructive change to the administration or the style of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. </PARA>
<PARA> Until 1989-90 something like $56.37m of taxpayers' money had been spent by the Office of the Supervising Scientist. Notwithstanding a number of recommendations from a number of inquiries, the Office continues to be based in Sydney. If my memory serves me correctly, a condition of employment of the Supervising Scientist was that he be based in Sydney. It is interesting that, I think, up until 1986-87 the Office had spent $2,650,000 in air fares alone on flights between Sydney and Darwin. At that time, the total expenditure of the Office of the Supervising Scientist was about $40m. About 8 per cent of its total costs went in air fares so that the Office of the Supervising Scientist could be located comfortably in the capital city of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the average annual cost per employee of the OSS, we will see that it is approximately 50 per cent higher than the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, 20 per cent higher than the national resource division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and 28 per cent higher than the Alligator Rivers region unit of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories in the Northern Territory. Notwithstanding very considerable criticisms thus far, the Government has done nothing about it, either by way of this legislation or by any other process. With Senator Parer's agreement, I seek to withdraw the second reading amendment moved by Senator Parer to the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1991. </PARA>

<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate calls upon the Government to abolish the present three mine uranium policy noting:</PARA>

<PARA>(b) the damaging effect on Australia's international reputation as a fair and responsible trading nation caused by the continuation of the current restrictions on the export of uranium;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) calls for the development of the uranium mining industry in Australia, subject to environmental considerations, appropriate safeguards and the national interest.''</PARA>
<PARA>Let me say from the outset that, notwithstanding the prejudices of this Government and the ideological, myopic attitude it has, nuclear energy is here to stay. Whether we have a three-mine policy, a one-mine policy or a no-mine policy, nuclear energy is simply here to stay. Twenty-nine countries have chosen to have nuclear power as an integrated and integral part of their energy resources. This group is made up of every major industrialised nation in the world. The United States of America, for instance, has 112 nuclear plants in operation. France is building a new nuclear plant every two years. Japan is to increase its electricity generated by nuclear power to 35 per cent by the year 2000. Of course, Canada has committed itself to expanding its capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time, the market is depressed and so are prices. For the time being, demand will be satisfied by current inventories. However, there will be a significant increase in demand in the coming period. Australia has 29 per cent of the world's reasonably assured resources, and it is capable of taking part in that very significant upturn in demand. But, of course, not only do we have a three-mine policy at the present time; we have already locked ourselves out of a number of markets, not the least being the Taiwanese market. We have locked ourselves out of the Taiwanese market because of the absurd attitude that we continue to have towards Taiwan. I understand that the general line of argument is that the Government says that it can enter into government-to-government agreements only in respect of safeguards. It does not acknowledge Taiwan as a government, so we do not export uranium to Taiwan. That does not stop the Americans, who have entered into a very satisfactory agreement in respect of safeguards, an agreement which is monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency; and yet we find ourselves locked out because of the bizarre way that we treat Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious to all, not least to Senator Button, that this Labor three-mine policy is based on ideological obsessions. It is spurious in its arguments, and it is now shadow-misted in red herrings. It has absolutely no foundation of logic whatsoever. Nobody seeks even to defend it on the grounds of its own merit. It is a policy driven by crude policy expediency. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977, as I recall, the Labor Party policy was to oppose all uranium mining. In fact, it went further than that. In 1977 the Labor Party was saying that it would repudiate current contracts. In 1977 what the Labor Party thought did not matter much because nobody took any notice of it. It was in the wilderness; it was going to stay in the wilderness. In fact, in Western Australia it got a worse vote in 1977 than it did in 1975. But, as we got towards 1983, it became apparent that the Labor Party, the scourge of this country--</PARA>

In 1982, when it was obvious that the Government had some prospect of winning the election, of course, the policy changed. It changed to this extent: it was possible that the Government would win in Canberra and in South Australia, so a compromise deal was done. The deal was done in part because in 1982 the present Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>No conservative Prime Minister in the history of this country will have been given a more effective weapon to stop the election of a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said in 1982 at the Federal conference. He said that because Labor's policy at that point was not to allow export and to repudiate current contracts. So, in the crude expedient way which drives this Government, the policy was amended to allow existing contracts to remain. Presumably, it thought that they would be there forever except that, as those contracts ran out, they would not be renewed. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of Roxby Downs, it was said that if Bannon got elected the deal was that the export of uranium which was mined incidentally to the mining of other minerals be allowed. How absolutely absurd. It is just like being a bit pregnant. Uranium mined is uranium mined. Whether it is mined with copper, zinc, lead or gold, it is mined. It was a crude, grubby way of not risking Bannon's defeat by knocking Roxby Downs on the head. The price of government in South Australia was Roxby Downs. </PARA>
<PARA> I give the Government credit for one thing: there is nothing that it will not do to hold office. On the weekend, I heard an ex-Minister of the Labor Government say that this Government was driven by power, not principles. Frankly, I thought that that was a very eloquent statement about this Government. </PARA>

As we all know, the more pragmatic, the more realistic, but perhaps no more principled Ministers of this Government, in their weaker moments, have stood up and been counted. Senator Button said something like, `It does not matter whether you come from the one-mine school or the three-mine school or the no-mine uranium school, the issue is presently an absurdity; there is no logic to it'. Senator Button was dismissive of any who thought that they could stand up and argue in support of the present policy. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has said the same sort of thing. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) said that the Government should face reality. The reality is that there is no logic in the present proposal. We are denying this country export earnings. The present policy of this Government achieves absolutely nothing; it only placates the Left.</PARA></TALK.START>

No doubt the Prime Minister is concerned about the quality of the debate, not the quantity of the debate. Having heard that comment, I can understand why he was driven to make sure that this matter was not on the Government's agenda. The remark by Senator Aulich represents the sort of emotional rhetoric which drives this debate; it is totally divorced and totally removed from fact. It plunges the whole debate into an area of friction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are not having a debate and we are not changing this policy, irrespective of what is good or right for Australia, simply because it is bad politics for the Government. This issue is a bit like other decisions that we are seeing pop up, such as the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. It does not matter whether it is good for Australia or good for the economy; it does not matter whether it is logical. Because there might be one or two seats in it, we do not have a third runway. </PARA>
<PARA> When logic is so overwhelming that even this Government is vaguely embarrassed about it, we have a process that guarantees that two elections will be held before any decision has to be made. As we saw in the period before the last election when we were dealing with Coronation Hill, the Government, for a change, could not bring itself to do the right thing. I have no sympathy for BHP; it welches every single time it is taken to the barrier. Perhaps there is a bit of poetic justice in this issue for BHP. Irrespective of whether it is good for BHP, this Government did not have the courage to follow the obvious and apparent logic.

I do not know whether he was on an overseas excursion. In the end, the Government took this matter off the agenda because, for the time being, that seemed to diffuse the issue. Of course, it did not; the matter came back to haunt the Government. Then we had this absurd situation where the decision was not to do with Coronation Hill; it was about the wider implications of the conservation zone, which just happens to be geographically there, drawn on a map. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) was poring over a map trying to find a piece of land that he could rescue from the determination to lock up what he described as `clapped out buffalo country'. So we are where we are now. The Resource Assessment Commission was meant to be the Solomon of the Labor Party. It was supposed to solve all the Labor Party's problems; of course, it did not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister says that he governs for all Australians, that his decisions are for all Australians. That is absolutely hypocritical hyperbole. This Government governs the sectional interests that confine the pressure points to which this Government has a knee-jerk reaction.

We finally got the recession. We were told we all needed it, it was for our own good, and we should not think that the Prime Minister would ever do this dastardly thing to the Australian people if it was not needed.

We now have a born-again Bula in the area. We now have a new issue which takes this difficult problem of uranium mining off the agenda for the Australian Labor Party.

It does not matter whether the argument is the environment, the nuclear cycle or the Aboriginal problem. The sad thing about this debate is that it is totally debased, totally intellectually barren.

As I am concluding, I am inspired because I have now found Senator Button's comments in an article in Australian Business. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Minister Button is also scathing. ``Whether one supports the `none' or `more' schools of thought (on mining),'' he writes, ``Australia's present practice of `some but not too much' seems quite incongruous.''</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I had better get on with the topic. Senator Crichton-Browne has spoken for a very long time. I want to deal with a few of the points made by other honourable senators. Senators Parer, Tambling, Macdonald and Brownhill all raised the question of whether government export duty is discriminatory. The Government is anxious to ensure that environmental costs are equitably shared and, of course, the present arrangements of levying the tax only on operating mines in the Alligator Rivers area has some shortcomings which are acknowledged by the Government. These will be addressed in the Government's consideration of the Taylor review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. There may be some concern about delays in implementation of that review, but the question of equity will be addressed in that context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senators Tambling and Macdonald raised the relevance of the Office of the Supervising Scientist at the Ranger mine. It is not just a role of the supervising scientist to conduct research relevant to solving mining engineering problems of the companies. It would not be appropriate for taxpayers' money to be used in a way that directly benefits those companies. Rather, research of the Office of the Supervising Scientist is summarised in the 1989-90 annual report, which was tabled in the Senate in December last year. </PARA>
<PARA> One or two matters were raised by Senator Vallentine to which Mr Kerin has asked me to respond. Senator Vallentine made some wide-ranging criticisms of Mr Kerin, personally and of his views expressed in a letter to colleagues. I want to refer briefly to some of those criticisms. I refer to those criticisms with some difficulty since Senator Vallentine's remarks were merely a recitation of several assertions and misrepresentations contained in an ill-informed document of Greenpeace, which purported to respond to Mr Kerin's views. Mr Kerin believes that the Greenpeace paper did no credit to the organisation and that it was a contribution of low standing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine raised five issues which purported to represent points made by Mr Kerin. I want to refer to some of the more gross misrepresentations which Senator Vallentine, possibly in ignorance or unwittingly, has repeated. First of all, her comments on non-proliferation were just a mish mash of bilateral safeguards and wider unrelated arms controls issues. The point which detractors of the Government's safeguards policy consistently misconstrue is that we have bilateral safeguard agreements in place under which Australian uranium is fully accounted for in the fuel cycles of our customer countries. In addition to these arrangements, our uranium is subject to international safeguards applied by the International Atomic Energy Agency. For nuclear weapons states, including France, these arrangements confirm that Australian uranium is used only in their peaceful nuclear programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the question of safety is, of course, a legitimate concern. The difficult aspect of this issue is maintaining a balanced perspective. As unpalatable as it may be for those who would play up every incident in the nuclear industry to bolster their stance, the nuclear power industry has a good safety record. Chernobyl is not representative of the industry. The recent incidents in Japan did not cause any exposure of the public to radioactivity. There have been 5,000 years of reactor experience and in that time only Chernobyl has had major consequences for public health. The level of safe performance will continue to improve with the introduction of new technologies and the retro fitting or closure of older types of reactors and some Soviet design models. </PARA>
<PARA> Worker health and safety, which was raised by Senator Vallentine, is an issue which the Government takes very seriously. There are health and safety risks for workers in every industry. That cannot be avoided. But these are not risks exclusive or in any way peculiar to the uranium industry. Many industrial and medical staff encounter similar risks and measures are in place which ensure that these risks are as low as possible. The exposure level of uranium miners in Australia is significantly below the level set. </PARA>

<PARA> With regard to Aboriginal interests, Senator Vallentine's comments focused on Western Australia. They are based on a number of unfounded assumptions about the Kintyre deposit, the main assumption being that it was virtually up and running, which is not so. Mines on Aboriginal lands have proceeded only after agreement has been reached with the representatives of the traditional owners, and that process will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on the issue of uranium markets, Greenpeace-its views being articulated here by Senator Vallentine-seems quite misinformed about uranium supply and demand and its relevance to the debate. Governments do not hinder the development of their economies because someone's supply and demand projection for a national resource might indicate that other countries could meet supply needs, particularly when the projections have been manipulated to that end. Just to indulge Senator Vallentine's sources, even Greenpeace, with its dire forebodings about the nuclear industry, concedes some growth in nuclear generating capacity, although it manages to extrapolate commercially unreal low levels of uranium demand from its capacity estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of confusion between supply capacity and actual supply, and ignorance of what is really happening in the industry. The sorts of claims being repeated by Senator Vallentine show no appreciation of either Government policy making in the resources area or basic commodity supply demand economics. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine later today had some remarks to make about insurance and radioactive waste disposal, and went a little further on the question of the uranium market. It added nothing to what was said in her earlier remarks. On the question of insurance, Senator Vallentine argues that uranium mining should not be allowed to expand because it contributes to an industry which is too dangerous to be covered by normal insurance. A lot of areas of industry are not covered by normal insurance. Specific insurance cover in these areas can be and is negotiated with insurers. Cover for nuclear accidents is widely negotiated overseas and Australian companies participate in underwriting such policies. So those comments are incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of Mr Kerin, I just wanted to correct some of those misapprehensions which were, not surprisingly, contained in Senator Vallentine's speech to the Senate on these issues. I thank other senators for their observations and wish the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, he is the de facto Cabinet member who probably has more say over industrial relations than the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) himself. The legislation is a blatant example of the Government's determination to ensure that trade union leaders who have the capacity to wreak havoc on the general community remain above the law as it applies to the rest of the community. This is because this legislation is the first step towards the establishment of a separate labour court, which could well have the effect of removing jurisdiction over industrial relations from the Federal Court and the High Court where they should remain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, in handling this legislation in this place on behalf of my colleague the shadow Minister for industrial relations, John Howard, in the other place, let me make it plain at the outset that the Opposition is totally opposed to this Bill and believes that it should be defeated. I urge the Australian Democrats, who I see are at least represented in the chamber by Senator Bell, to support us in throwing out this Bill after the second reading debate. However, if the Australian Democrats lack the wisdom to do that, I foreshadow that our opposition will be reinforced with amendments in the committee stage of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that the Government is introducing legislation which ostensibly seeks to bolster the importance and independence of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and to centralise wage setting structures for the defence forces, which this legislation also seeks to do, at a time when it has rejected the recommendations of the Industrial Relations Commission and is busy trying to impose its own wage guidelines under the guise of decentralisation and enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> The crucial part of this legislation is Part III of the Bill, which is a consequence of the long running dispute between the ACTU and the Industrial Relations Commission about whether Industrial Relations Commission salaries should be linked to those of Federal Court judges, rather than be determined under the wage guidelines which the Industrial Relations Commission determines and administers for ordinary workers. The Federal Court-Industrial Relations Commission nexus was abandoned in May of last year under intense pressure from Bill Kelty and the ACTU, when the ACTU demanded that any remuneration tribunal increases for Commission members must be consistent with the guidelines it laid down for national wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was forced to reject the Remuneration Tribunal's recommendations, including part of its own submission to the Tribunal, at the bidding of the ACTU. To avoid further embarrassment the Government appointed a committee of review to find a way out of the corner into which it had painted itself. This committee, headed by the former head of the New South Wales Premier's Department, Mr Gerry Gleeson, conducted a review of the Commission, including a work value survey. It reported to the Minister recently, on 1 March this year, with a series of recommendations that, when one considers them, are remarkably similar to the Government's own submission to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is opposing these recommendations because they have nothing whatsoever to do with the interests of working Australians and everything to do with placating Mr Kelty. The recommendations propose new classifications within the Commission that are clearly linked to the industrial jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia and the future creation of a labour court. It is intended that the new senior deputy presidents will also sit as judges in such a labour court; yet, the members of the Commission, however well qualified in the law, are not judges. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the boilermakers case in 1956, the High Court of Australia declared that it was unconstitutional for the then Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to exercise judicial power, being a body concerned with conciliation and arbitration. It was after that case that legislation was passed to form two distinct bodies: the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the Commonwealth Industrial Court, which later became part of the Federal Court. This Labor Government resurrected the idea of a separate labour court in its major rewrite on industrial relations legislation drafted in 1987. When the Government rushed to an early election in mid-1987, community outrage caused the Government to drop this proposal from the legislation along with the proposal for a minimum union size. These proposals were also left out of the new legislation introduced and passed in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Government, grateful for the convenient reversal of attitudes by the Australian Democrats, rammed through legislation to force the creation of mega-unions. Now the labour court is back on the agenda. The Minister has made this very clear. But it is quite unacceptable to have a special labour court judging matters of law concerning industrial relations. Undoubtedly, members of a new labour court would be appointed from the Industrial Relations Commission or related networks, weaned on the ethics of the industrial relations club and accepting fully, no doubt, the industrial relations club's ethos. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial relations matters taken to such a court are obviously matters being appealed. Indeed, quite often they are appeals against the legalities of the Industrial Relations Commission decisions. For the Industrial Relations Commission in this circumstance it would be a case of Caesar appealing to Caesar, quite unfair to the party which might be opposed to the Industrial Relations Commission in the court hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of a labour court could also be used to remove the right of resort to common law actions which have been so successful in recent years in resolving disputes and beating intimidation by union leaders. The Dollar Sweets and Mudginberri disputes are significant examples of such successes. The people of Australia are entitled to ask why this Government steadfastly refuses to make the real changes to our industrial relations system which are essential if we are to be internationally competitive in creating wealth to be shared by all Australians instead of changes, such as those we are debating tonight, designed to further entrench the industrial relations club. </PARA>
<PARA> One only has to look yet again at the waterfront situation as an example of the appalling mess in which industrial relations in this country currently exist. It seems that the centralised wage fixing system was acceptable as long as it was producing higher wages but, once it was seen to be in danger of producing across-the-board wage cuts, decentralisation suddenly looked a better prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall describe the events which led to this situation. In April this year the Industrial Relations Commission brought down a wages decision that rejected the accord mark VI that had been agreed between the Government and the ACTU in February 1990, the first part of which had already been implemented in September last year. This accord has been in place in one form or another since 1983, generally rubber stamped until now by the Industrial Relations Commission. However, the Industrial Relations Commission has at last thrown it out. Instead, it proposed a 2.5 per cent national wage rise based on productivity increases and an agreement not to make other claims. </PARA>
<PARA> This was rejected by both the Government and the ACTU, and particularly by the waterside workers. Suddenly, a national wage case, because it included conditions in the form of productivity increases, was not acceptable either to the Government or the ACTU. So much for the oft-repeated claim of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that the umpire's decision should be accepted. The reality is that it is accepted by this Government and its ACTU mates only if the umpire is wearing their guernsey. The Government and the ACTU, hitherto the champions of centralised wage fixing, opted for accord mark VI, an across-the-board increase of $12 a week from 16 May, a three per cent superannuation increase and an accelerated shift to so-called enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to prove it was serious, the Government has made a commitment to pay the accord package to Australia's 400,000 public servants. The waterside workers, however, did not want accord mark VI. They wanted more than that. That is what they have after a nifty bit of blackmail over waterfront reform. The Waterside Workers Federation asked for increases of 10.8 per cent, which would have added about $40m to its wages bill, an increase in costs on the waterfront which this country obviously cannot afford in light of the existing inefficiencies and excessive expenses in that industry. The fact that business has dropped by about 35 per cent is apparently of no concern whatsoever to the waterside workers. </PARA>
<PARA> After lengthy negotiations with unions, employers and the Government, an agreement has been reached that gives the waterfront workers an initial across-the-board increase of $12 with a further aggregate adjustment of 6.12 per cent. This further adjustment will be in three equal instalments. The first instalment will be effective from 1 July this year on an enterprise by enterprise basis, once enterprise-based agreements and reclassifications have been completed. The second and third instalments will be effective from 1 January 1992 and 1 July 1992, provided that the enterprise-based agreements and productivity improvements are in place according to the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> This agreement means that waterside workers will receive an across-the-board average increase of $41 a week over the next 15 months. Of course, this agreement with the Waterside Workers Federation is still subject to ratification by the Industrial Relations Commission. It would certainly be a very brave Industrial Relations Commission that rejects the will of the Government and the ACTU at a time when the Government in this legislation is pushing through a law that gives its members significant increases in their remuneration packages. It is sad and regrettable that these deals are all being worked out in the name of enterprise bargaining and enterprise-based agreements when they are nothing of the sort. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's version of enterprise agreements are Claytons enterprise agreements. Do we need reminding that early in 1987 Prime Minister Hawke told the Business Council of Australia that enterprise bargaining would be introduced over his dead body? Do we need reminding that Bill Kelty pointedly turned his back on Peter McLaughlan and Professor Hilmer when they presented arguments for enterprise bargaining on behalf of the Business Council to an Economic Planning Advisory Council meeting in 1989? Do we need reminding that last June Industrial Relations Minister Cook told the Metal Trades Industry Association that agreements for enterprise bargaining were fairies at the bottom of the garden stuff? Have the three central players in this Government's industrial relations policy suddenly experienced a dramatic conversion? Of course not. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Liberal and National parties have set the agenda on industrial relations policy and debate. It is the Liberal and National parties which have, for at least six years, advocated decentralisation and deregulation of industrial relations and wages determination in order to encourage direct and improved communication between employers and employees and recognition of their shared and mutual interests. This approach has won widespread community support, despite strong opposition from the Government and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> At last this Government, on its last legs, has recognised that support. So it seeks to use the language which has won acceptance-terms such as `enterprise bargaining' and `enterprise agreements'. But while it seeks to clothe itself in the terminology that has won widespread support, in reality the Government has no clothes. It is not introducing genuine enterprise-based agreements, as the attempted waterfront deal shows clearly. The waterfront deal may not have originated with the Industrial Relations Commission but it is nonetheless a centrally determined arrangement. It has nothing to do with genuine industrial relations reform which is directed at real enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing the Government has put forward as enterprise agreements meets the three criteria which are essential for true enterprise agreements. Those criteria are: firstly, that employers and employees must be free to come to an agreement over wages and conditions without duress and especially without the requirement of ratification or arbitration by the Industrial Relations Commission or interference from any third party. Secondly, the principle of voluntary union membership must be in place and must be protected by law. Thirdly-and this goes against all of the recent legislation on union amalgamations which has been brought in by this Government-workers must have the right to form new unions and, in particular, enterprise unions as well as industry or craft-based union structures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's arrangements clearly fail to meet these criteria. In their absence, the Government's claim that it is embracing enterprise agreements is nothing more than empty rhetoric. The Prime Minister is proposing that workers and employers agree, on an enterprise-to-enterprise basis, to apply for a wages deal that has already been decided by the Government and the ACTU. It is essentially an industry-based decision that takes no account of the wishes of individual employers or employees, or the ability of employers to pay. It is strictly a take it or leave it deal. </PARA>
<PARA> In making its decision for a 2.5 per cent wage increase, the Industrial Relations Commission took into account the present state of the Australian economy-the recession in Australia and overseas, the rural crisis, the likelihood of an imminent recovery and the potential effects of the emergence of increased and excessive labour costs on that recovery. While acknowledging that some modest wage increases may be justified in line with continuing inflation, the Commission nevertheless pointed to the benefits of continuing wage restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> In its reasons for its decision on the national wage case, the Commission reiterated that it took the decision to reject the accord mark VI in the national interest-something about which this Labor Government seems to have very little concern. Some passages from the Commissions's report are worth quoting. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Because the ACTU had pressed certain views about the remuneration of members of the Commission, there had been a clear impression amongst many trade union members and officials that the Commission may be biased against the ACTU . . .</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission is concerned with its independence and integrity . . . it is our view that integrity and independence has been jeopardised by the manner of the recent actions of the Commonwealth Government and the ACTU . . .

<PARA>This serves only to reinforce what I said earlier about this Bill: it is here as a consequence of the Government trying to get itself out of a difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are seeing is a bizarre situation: on the one hand, the Hawke Government has always seen the Industrial Relations Commission as the holy of holies with regard to the conduct of industrial relations in Australia; yet, on the other hand, in the past few months-and especially the past few days-the Government has appeared to be supporting Kelty and the ACTU in what amounts to a vendetta against the Industrial Relations Commission. The Opposition will have no part in this and strongly opposes the Bill for this reason. </PARA>
<PARA> Another part of this legislation relates to the Trade Union Training Authority. As honourable senators would be aware, the Opposition does not support the continuation of the Trade Union Training Authority in its present form. In the Opposition's Economic Action Plan we said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Trade Union Training Authority provides industrial relations training for trade unionists at taxpayers' expense. The Authority will be offered for sale to the trade union movement, and/or any other interested buyer. If the Authority is not sold it will be disbanded.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, we do not see why the Trade Union Training Authority should not be either self-funding or funded by the trade unions. After all, the Government has adopted a policy of user pays for everyone else and has even introduced legislation to make companies spend a percentage of their payroll on training. So why not the trade unions as well? We can therefore see no good reason for the amendments proposed in this Bill with regard to the Trade Union Training Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this Hawke Labor Government has caused a lot of pain and suffering to ordinary Australians through wrong-headed decisions. </PARA>

<PARA> This Government refuses to introduce genuine enterprise bargaining, where employers and employees agree voluntarily to do their own deal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 proposes amendments to industrial relations areas within the Industrial Relations Act 1988, Defence Act 1903, Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 and the Trade Union Training Authority Act 1974. Therefore, it is comprehensive in its proposed changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, the amendments to the Industrial Relations Act are a direct result of the Government's acceptance of the report from the Committee of Review into the structure of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the remuneration of its members, which was chaired by Mr Gerry Gleeson. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are pleased that the Government has accepted, in essence, the Committee's recommendations because they will strengthen the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC). We have, at all stages, firmly supported a strong Commission which is able to adequately take responsibility and supervise negotiations between employees and employers for pay and conditions and to oversee the crucial process of amalgamations which the Australian Democrats unashamedly supported in the legislation of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> We note the revised structure of the Industrial Relations Commission with the addition of a vice-president and senior deputy president, which will strengthen the Commission in its increased range of responsibilities. It is the intention of the Australian Democrats in the committee stage of this Bill to introduce an amendment which gives more substance and authority to the position of vice-president. </PARA>
<PARA> We also note that there is scope for increased cooperation between the Commission and its State counterparts, with members of each being commissioned to hold office in both the Federal and State tribunals. However, we have considerable reservations concerning the proposed amendment to subsection 30 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act, which gives effect to a recommendation of the Gleeson Committee that greater flexibility in the constitution of full benches of the Industrial Relations Commission be permitted. Even though flexibility in the affairs of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is to be supported, the proposal has some notable drawbacks. </PARA>
<PARA> This is clear when the range of matters that a full bench is permitted or required to deal with is considered. All are significant and warrant a highly qualified full bench. Some examples include: national wage cases under section 106; appeals under section 45; referrals by the President of a matter of industrial dispute `of such importance that, in the public interest, it should be dealt with by a Full Bench' as appropriate under subsection 107 (2); reviews of awards, orders or certain other decisions of a member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission under section 109; the consideration of proposed certified agreements that are inconsistent with national wage principles in accordance with subsection 115(6); the review of the operation of certified agreements under subsection 117 (1); and the cancellation of awards under section 187. These are only some of the substantial matters which should be considered by a full bench. The Australian Democrats have some reservations about the proposed amendment to subsection 30 (2). We will address those reservations in an amendment which we will move in the committee stage of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as practical concerns, attention has been paid to remuneration and various other entitlements of members. It is the Government's intention that these recommendations will be implemented shortly. In essence, the recommendations of the Gleeson report strengthen the Industrial Relations Commission and at the same time augment its independence-an independence which the Industrial Relations Commission asserted controversially as recently as last week. </PARA>
<PARA> These recent events have challenged the Commission and the position taken by both the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Government on the decision of the IRC to grant a 2.5 per cent national wage increase rather than a flat $12, which was sought, and to defer further moves to extend occupational superannuation has had serious implications for the centralised wages system and for the gradual but substantial workplace reforms brought about to date by the accord. It is to be hoped that the Industrial Relations Commission can withstand this assault. Workplace reform is vital if Australia is to overcome the current recession and emerge from it intact to regain our position and standards of living relative to other nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats welcome the recent suggestion by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) that the wages accord may be broadened later this year to include employer organisations and also the trade union movement beyond the ACTU leadership. This would go a long way towards preventing the types of mindless confrontation which so typified industrial relations in this country over past decades. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Australian Trade Union Training Authority (TUTA) are also important as they will significantly reform its structure. These changes have been undertaken so that TUTA will develop a national focus, which is already being implemented at an administrative and policy level, and also increase the productive use of its resources. The amendments will establish an executive council of TUTA with power to establish regional advisory councils to deal effectively with issues arising in a particular geographical area. As a result of this new national approach, TUTA's Australian Council and regional councils for the States and territories will be abolished. The position of National Director and Director of Studies will be abolished and will be replaced with the one position of executive officer. </PARA>
<PARA> For many years, the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal has been labouring under restrictions which have resulted in slow progress and various inefficiencies. These amendments to the Defence Act will give rise to more efficient and faster procedures. The Chairman can now direct that a matter be dealt with by a single member and provision will be made for a single member to instigate review action. Provisions dealing with intervention by interested parties and the ratification of consent matters by the Tribunal will be clarified. These amendments to the Defence Act 1903 have no financial impact but, hopefully, will have positive, practicable implications. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 are of a minor drafting nature and have no financial implications. The Democrats therefore indicate their support for the general thrust of this amending legislation, but will seek in the committee stage of the debate to resolve by amendment two reservations which we have in relation to the first series of amendments proposed by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that the debate on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 should follow the urgency motion debated today in which the Government was asked to clarify its position on industrial relations in view of the confusion that has been caused since the decision was made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission with regard to the national wage case. It goes without saying that we have seen a situation in this particular case where the Government, despite many statements by Senator Cook and others, has chosen to take a different position because this particular national wage case decision does not happen to suit the Australian Council of Trade Unions or its mates. This is in direct contrast to the position that has been adopted recently in the meat industry. The undermining of the Harrison inquiry goes on and on, to the point now where we may see some of the parties pulling out despite the millions of dollars that has been spent on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real question that has to be asked about this particular legislation is: what is the hidden agenda behind it? I want to address two principal changes: firstly, the implementation of the Gleeson Committee's recommendations for changes to classification in salaries within the Industrial Relations Commission; and, secondly, the prevention of trade unions from avoiding the amalgamation provisions of the Industrial Relations Amendment Act 1990. We strenuously opposed the Industrial Relations Amendment Act because, under its provisions, it is impossible to develop a true enterprise agreement situation when one is dealing with mega unions. Enterprise agreements will occur only if they are allowed to develop between enterprise unions and employers-or however groups in the workplace want to structure their particular operations. </PARA>
<PARA> In addressing this particular Bill, those matters I see on the hidden agenda, which has yet to come out, and the changes which have occurred over recent weeks, I pose these questions: is this the forerunner to a labour court? Is this the beginning of an attempt by the Government, aided by the Democrats, to bring about the demise of subsections 45(d) and (e) and common law actions in the industrial field? Is part of that situation the introduction of right-to-strike legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government needs to come clean on all these issues and state where it stands precisely so that the Australian community can make a judgment about the direction which has been taken at this time as far as the future of industrial relations in this country is concerned. This is particularly the case at present when unemployment is soaring. We will be seeing new figures this week which, I predict, will move significantly upwards again. We see many instances in which businesses are going bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that Senator McLean spelt out clearly the position of the Australian Democrats in an article in the Bulletin last week. I found it extraordinary that in that article he was adopting a position where third parties who had been damaged should not have redress to claim for that particular damage. That would certainly be a step backwards of some 10 years or so in industrial relations. One must have a balance between the people involved in a particular situation and when one party can significantly damage a second or a third party, it should to be held accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal in a little more detail with a couple of these points. I deal first with the implementation of the Gleeson Committee recommendations. We see the present three tiers of classifications within the Commission-that is, the President, the Deputy President and the commissioners-being expanded to five by the creation of the position of vice-presidents and senior deputy presidents, between the existing positions of President and Deputy President. I believe, as I said earlier, that that is the first step in moving towards an attempt to introduce a labour court into this country-a position which was adopted prior to an election and which was soundly rejected by the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I wish to deal with is the prevention of trade unions avoiding the amalgamation provisions of the Act. We had much debate on this matter on the previous industrial relations Bill that we had before us, and we took a very strong stance against that Bill. First, it sought to enshrine power in the hands of a few trade union officials, and particularly the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU); and, secondly, it was defying what was happening in the marketplace in terms of development of enterprise agreements.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make the point that there are some things that are very important in getting successful enterprise agreements off the ground. An enterprise agreement must be on the basis of the enterprise-that is, the employer and the people involved in that enterprise. For that to be successful it is important that the people involved be able to form their own enterprise union. If they have big brother interfering with that process, it cannot and will not work. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the principal reason why we do not see any of the huge number of work practices that we have on the waterfront-some of which I quoted today and some of which I will quote in a moment-being addressed in the latest effort of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It is plain damned ridiculous that a $12 wage increase will be granted from 16 May when we continue to see many excessive work practices staying in place, at least for another 13 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me quote a few of these practices. The gross average weekly earnings for a general class waterside worker is $824 a week for an average working week of 27 hours. The waterside worker enjoys five weeks annual leave, with a 27.5 per cent leave loading. The waterside worker enjoys 10 sick leave days a year. In addition, this can be accumulated over a period of time and cashed in after 10 years of continuous employment. These are excesses far beyond any other situation that exists in the Australian work place. There is a gross degree of overmanning. As a result of this there is a considerable amount of `nicking off', to the extent that it is a well known practice to have an organised system to allocate `nicking off' days in a fair and equitable way. What a glorious situation! It is a disgraceful situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote only a few of these work practices. For example, those involved in the transport of container cargo were paid a weekly consolidated disability allowance of $11.20 to compensate them for the dirty work conditions they might be forced to work in. Those not adversely affected by the conditions still get the allowance. Overtime for more than one hour earns workers a meal allowance of $9.15. A supervisor earns approximately $1,000 a week for a 35- to 40-hour week. Employers estimated that if the first deal put to Conaust Ltd were accepted, the package would cost at least $50m or more a year if the wage package were granted. Idle time, where employees are paid to stay at home because of lack of work, is estimated to cost about $27.5m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask, in the light of what is being put in front of us in this Bill: where does all this fit into the hidden agenda and what is now going on in the industrial relations arena? If we look further in terms of developing enterprise agreements, if we are serious about it, there are some fundamental points which must be emphasised and which are essential if the system is to work. The first is that the legal right to establish enterprise agreements must be between employers and employees without intervention. Closed shops have to be abolished. Voluntary unionism must be introduced and there must be enterprise unions. The Government's current position fails on all these points. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless the whole issue of enterprise bargaining is addressed on these lines, as a result of what occurred on the waterfront we will see that agreements will come out of bullying and coercion. They will not produce the benefits that are required to address Australia's current economic and industrial problems. On the one hand, we now have operating one situation for the meat industry-an industry which provides some $3 billion of export income earnings for this country-and the preferred treatment of Wally Curran and his abuse, in his way, of the Harrison inquiry and what is occurring there, aided and abetted by the Victorian Government. Yet, on the other hand, we have the situation now, having been repeatedly told in this place that the matter has to be dealt with by the Commission with the Commission as umpire, that when the Commission brings down its national wage case the Government takes the view, `That's no good. Bill Kelty doesn't like it'. So the Government adopts another position and suddenly the Commission is no longer the umpire. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to address what is happening in the wool industry in its current crisis, which is a difficult one but one that is worth looking at for a moment. I refer to a survey carried out in my district in Western Australia which shows that the cost of producing wool is $2.96, or near enough to $3 a kilo, which equates to 450c clean. That does not include the 15 per cent tax proposed by Minister Kerin, which we will be dealing with at another time, but, effectively, it will take the cost of producing wool up to about 500c a kilo clean to break even. That does not include anything for any works on the property-for example, fencing, improving the water supplies and conservation. It is just the bare cost of producing the wool. </PARA>
<PARA> How has that industry responded to it? How have the people involved in the workplace responded to it? They have responded-and I have seen this-by going to the people who employ them and saying, `We want this industry to be around for a while. We want sheep to be shorn'. There are examples now of sheep actually being shorn for around 85c. That is a response of people in the workplace who know that the industry is in a difficult situation, despite the fact that the price for shearing is around $1.40 a head. That is what genuine enterprise agreements and bargaining are all about. The employer and the employee work out a price which can keep both in business and avoid or minimise the number of bankruptcies. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at other aspects of the wool industry. Once again, we see that wool classers have been prepared to accept approximately a 35 per cent decrease in what they were getting paid when a reserve price of 870c was in place, because they want to go on classing wool, they want to be part of the industry, they want to be able to provide their families with a living they have earned, and they do not want to be a liability to society. The situation with rouseabouts and other people demonstrates that, when we are in recession and when industries are down, we must have flexibility in place so that there can be an adjustment in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on quoting many examples, but I just want to come back to what I set out to say on this Bill and on the direction we see occurring now in industrial relations in this country. It appears to me that over the next 12 months we are going to see a number of actions taken which, in fact, will be designed to enshrine the power of the ACTU and to make it more difficult for a government that is prepared to address this issue to do it in a rational and sensible manner. These actions will make it more difficult to address the excesses which currently exist in the workplace, as will this so-called agreement, which really achieves very little or nothing on the waterfront. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), among other things, is basically fiddling with a structure in which the Government has no confidence and which has been subject to continued attacks from the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Senator Cook. These amendments are seeking to prop up, to somehow change, the Industrial Relations Act along the lines of the Gleeson Committee review, so that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will remain the subject of scorn and ridicule by the Prime Minister, but the structure will be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One wonders about the relevance of this sort of legislation at a time when the Industrial Relations Commission is at least an anachronism and at best will be performing under the next government a totally different role from the one that at present has meant that it has contributed enormously to the level of unemployment and economic disaster facing this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen quite clearly the irrelevance of the present Industrial Relations Commission in the way that the Government has arrived at its decisions about the waterfront. We have seen the irrelevance of the Industrial Relations Commission by the Government's response to the Commission's failure to follow the Government's lead on the accord. I am not going to suggest that the specific amendments that are listed will either improve or diminish the status of the Commission. What I want to concentrate on is the Commission and whether or not it has played, and will continue to play after these amendments are passed, a disastrous role in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt, for example, that, as a result of the deals done between large employer groups and large union groups, there have been a whole series of ludicrous decisions made, which have had a specific impact on those people who do not get the opportunity to be represented before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I speak specifically about a group of people whose concerns I seek to represent in this place, that is, the young people of Australia. They do not have an opportunity, specifically, to put their case to the Industrial Relations Commission, and yet they are the very people who are most in the firing line and who have suffered most from this Commission's determinations, which effectively have been rubber-stamping the Government's deals with unions. </PARA>
<PARA> All I need do is refer honourable senators to the latest official labour force figures-and there will be some worse ones, I think, coming out on Thursday for April. The March figures indicate the irrelevance of the present structure to labour in terms of proper response to the marketplace. Because of the rigidities in the system, which are in no way addressed by this amendment, we see this sort of situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We see that over the last 12 months the number of full time adult jobs that have disappeared, that have been wiped out as a result of the recession we had to have according to Mr Keating, has been something like 81,500. The number of full time jobs of young people, that is, people aged under 20, that have been wiped out over that same period is 110,700. In other words, something like 58 per cent of the jobs that have been wiped out over the last 12 months are young people's jobs, and yet young people make up only 5.3 per cent of the total number of people at work. More than half the job losses in Australia have come from this 5.3 per cent of full time workers. </PARA>
<PARA> What does that tell us about the systems we employ to establish wage rates in this nation? It tells us that the wage rates we have set for young people, that have been set by the structure which we are dealing with tonight, are such that there is a massive concentration of job loss among young people who have no capacity to represent themselves in front of the Industrial Relations Commission. They have no capacity to come to private arrangements, private deals, with the Commission. They are subject to the control and domination of the unions which clearly, in their deals with big government, with the club and with the Commission, put the best interests of young people last. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that the Commission has continually adopted the approach of applying cash pay rises, which diminishes the proportional gap between adult wages and youth wages. One of the problems that emerge when this happens is that it becomes relatively too expensive to employ young people as against employing more productive older people. If the marketplace were allowed to exist, we would not get this disproportionate job shedding or job destruction at the young end of the employment scale in an economic downturn. If the rates of pay that young people could negotiate bore a real relationship to the market, we would not see a concentration of job loss in the young end of the market. If wages bore a relationship to productivity and to the level of experience of an employee-in other words, a relationship to the marketplace-there would be no economic pressure on employers to dispose of so many young people and to make it impossible for young people to get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Government's continual reviews of industrial relations, in its consideration of amendments like those before us today, it is clear that absolutely no interest has been displayed about the disadvantaged position that the present system puts young people in. The fact that 110,700 jobs have been wiped out throughout Australia in the past 12 months means that something like one in four jobs for young people-those under 20 years of age-have been wiped out. We must have a system that is more responsive to that situation, particularly as among adults the proportion is relatively minute. I recognise that, as I said, there have been 81,500 jobs lost among adults, but there are still something like six million full time adult workers in Australia, whereas there are now only 320,300 young people at work after this 25.7 per cent wiping out of full time jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence of the unemployment that has emerged as a result of this inflexible and inappropriate industrial relations arrangement is that real unemployment rates for young people are far higher than the official rates suggest. The current official unemployment rate in Australia for people seeking full time work is something like 25.2 per cent. That means that about one in four young Australians simply cannot get jobs. It is interesting to note that this unemployment rate overwhelmingly understates the real unemployment rate because the number of job losses far exceeds the increase in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the 110,000 young Australians who have lost their jobs, only 41,000-odd have gone on to the unemployed list. What has happened to the other 70,000-odd? When we ask that question, we come up with some fascinating answers. The 70,000-odd, who have lost their jobs largely as a result of inflexibility of the industrial relations arrangements, have disappeared from the unemployment statistics. There is apparently a combination of reasons for this disappearance. It has resulted in a massive fall in the participation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> A few years ago the Government changed the definition of unemployment so that a person who worked for one hour or more a week-unpaid-was no longer regarded as unemployed for the purposes of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That means, for example, that if an unemployed young person engages in work experience, say with a member of parliament or with one of the media organisations-which I know happens-that person, getting no pay, is not on the unemployed list according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and according to this Government. That is just a farce. Someone who cannot get a job but works on his parents' farm for no pay-and I know very few farmers who at the moment could afford to pay even their children to work with them-is not regarded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as being unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have the situation now where Austudy has been extended to secondary students. Last year $300m-odd was spent to get young people who could not get jobs to go back to school. That will be of benefit to some of them, and I would not criticise the Government's attempts to increase the skill levels of large numbers of young Australians. Even within the inflexible and ludicrous industrial relations system that is enshrined in the accord and manifested by the deals that the Government does with the trade union movement, and for which the Government seeks the rubber stamp of the Industrial Relations Commission, people who have increased their skill levels at least have a greater chance of getting jobs-if and when there is an upturn in the economy under this incompetent Government-than those who have not learnt some skills. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that a large proportion of those people who are being paid to return to school are simply in a teenager-sitting exercise. They are not being provided with skills. They are not back at school by choice; they are reluctant attendees because they know perfectly well that they cannot get a job in the private sector or the public sector. Their only way of getting income basically is through Austudy. They may as well be on Austudy as unemployed. It seems to me that this is a measure of the failure of the present industrial relations system. When we add the rate of hidden unemployment to the unemployment figures, we see that in Australia there are something like 35.6 per cent unemployed. However, when we look at the unemployment figures, these people have magically disappeared from them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I sit down, Senator Faulkner will be able to stand up and answer these questions. He should not get excited; he will have a chance. I am putting some serious questions before him and I will wait here with great interest to see whether he rises to his feet and effectively addresses these issues. He should stop cursing and prepare his speech now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The advice that I received is that an honourable senator who is not a member of standing committee may participate in its public sessions and question witnesses unless the committee orders otherwise. In other words, an honourable senator has a right to attend public hearings of a committee and question any witnesses before the committee unless the committee makes a deliberate decision to exclude the honourable senator. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to hearings of evidence in private sessions or in briefings, a committee may decide to allow an honourable senator who is not a member of the committee to attend and participate in the proceedings. On the request for such an attendance being made, the committee should make a decision on that request. </PARA>
<PARA> In both circumstances, I understand the decision must be a decision of the committee and not of the chairman alone. I would be interested to hear from the Chairman of this Committee whether this was his decision or whether it was made on the votes of the honourable senators on the Committee. Does the fact that this was a so-called informal meeting make any difference? Apparently not. Proper notice was given for the meeting and the usual rules of meeting procedures applied. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked whether there are any precedents to exclude an honourable senator from a committee meeting when a specific request has been made. None of the experienced colleagues I have been able to contact can recall such a precedent. In fact, I would be very interested to hear from Senator Foreman whether he can provide any such examples. Does this mean that I happen to be the first? I am not sure and I would be keen to hear the precedents. The Committee can establish rules governing participation by honourable senators who are not members; for example, it is a general rule that members of the Committee have a priority in putting questions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point that I was being provoked by Senator Evans and Senator Faulkner. If Senator Evans is worried about people reading speeches, he might look at his own performance today where he was being particularly careful to attune his words to exactly what the Prime Minister said in the other place. Of all people in this chamber, it ill behoves Senator Evans to raise that particular issue today. I appreciate the chance that Senator Evans gave me to make that point, which was very obvious to all my colleagues on this side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Returning to the point, there are a number of particular ironies in this case. I understand that, whereas I was being excluded from the Committee, David Hill, the gentleman who was appearing before the Committee, was quite happy to answer my questions. Senator Faulkner will have to find out who told me this: when the Committee made its particular determination, David Hill made a very kind offer to come around and speak to me, to brief me about the matters which he thought were of some concern and give me the chance to raise some questions. If I had been given that opportunity, I would not be up here this evening raising these issues. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a good argument. Because Senator Faulkner keeps on provoking me, this might go on for some little while, so he should brace himself. There were some matters that I would have liked to raise with Mr David Hill today. I would have liked to have had the opportunity to be at the Committee hearings to make these points to him. Some of my colleagues will be aware that today the ABC announced a new independent complaints procedure for viewers and listeners who have particular concerns about ABC programming. I would have liked to ask David Hill how these new procedures, which apparently have been announced today, differ from the sorts of procedures that the Commonwealth Ombudsman would have liked to apply in relation to ABC programming. Over the last 10 years there have been constant disputes between the ABC and the Commonwealth Ombudsman as to whether the Commonwealth Ombudsman has a particular right to investigate allegations and complaints against ABC programming. If Senator Faulkner does not mind, I will read from a statement made in a special report by the Commonwealth Ombudsman in relation to the ABC. This special report was tabled in this chamber in 1985 and in it the Ombudsman referred to `the self serving attitude of the ABC' and pointed to its `determination to resist the Ombudsman'. The Ombudsman then called for an:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . effective mechanism of external-</PARA>
<PARA>and I stress the word `external'-</PARA>
<PARA>accountability to protect individual members of the community against unfair and unjust treatment by the publicly funded agency. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is simply unacceptable that this government instrumentality under the guise of independence, or some other assertion, be allowed to function at a Caesar's Palace when legitimate complaints are made about it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Commonwealth Ombudsman said in 1985. As far as I am aware, this dispute between the ABC and the Commonwealth Ombudsman has not been resolved, although I understand there was a meeting on Monday between the Commonwealth Ombudsman and Mr David Hill of the ABC. I would have liked to ask Mr David Hill some questions about the new guidelines that he proposes. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have stated, the ABC has hardly adopted a constructive attitude towards complaints. It effectively denuded the complaints procedure by its highly restrictive interpretations of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983-in particular section 82. This eliminated public complaints about matters of bias and restricted complaints to alleged errors of fact by the ABC. Complaints from individuals were not accepted where the ABC argued that it had a `lack of sufficient interest'. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that therefore arises under the new guidelines is: what precisely is meant by allegations of serious bias, lack of balance, or unfair treatment arising from an ABC broadcast? Are we to have the same restrictive interpretations of the plain meaning of these words? Who indeed will be deciding the meaning of these words and whether any particular complaints fall within these categories?</PARA>
<PARA> A serious problem with new guidelines is that, if one agrees with an ABC review under these procedures, one must give a guarantee not to pursue any legal claim; in other words, the procedure cannot be appealed against. This seems to be most unsatisfactory. A further problem is the fact that legal representation is not permitted under the new guidelines. Whereas this may be appropriate in a large number of cases, they would undoubtedly be complex cases in which the complainant may need legal advice. Finally, the new procedure comes into effect from 13 May. This excludes all the complaints about the coverage by the ABC of the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the ABC has decided to announce a new complaints procedure is a vindication of the many critics of the ABC who have argued for a long period that the approach of the ABC in dealing with complaints is unsatisfactory. While the new complaints procedure may well be a step in the right direction, it cannot be described as a proper external review process, as would occur, for example, under the Commonwealth Ombudsman Act 1976 or if an independent ABC ombudsman was appointed. The new panel will be reporting to the ABC board.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Government has committed itself to a genuine external review procedure for the ABC. In the interests of the ABC and the Australian public, it should pursue its stated policy. Perhaps David Hill would have been able to answer my questions today. It is a pity that I did not have the opportunity to ask them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to detain the Senate for long this evening. However, I do wish to take this opportunity to address a few remarks about a meeting which I attended last Friday in Mackay in the company of the honourable member for Dawson, Mr Ray Braithwaite. It was a meeting of young people in Mackay and the surrounding districts and was called a youth forum. The purpose of the meeting was to solicit the views of people aged between approximately 16 and 25 as to what they think should be the future direction of Australia and the problems they see this country meeting in the next five to 10 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One point that was stressed at this meeting by many of the participants was a grave concern about this country's future, because they, like myself, are the people who will be paying the debts for a long time into the future. The consensus was that one failing of the last 20 years has been this nation's expectation of future generations to pay for the mistakes of their predecessors. They therefore turned their attention to what Australia needs to do in order to have a sound and stable future. </PARA>
<PARA> What was of prime importance to many of these young people-especially as most of them were in grade 12 and about to complete their studies at high school-was the very grim prospects they have of obtaining gainful employment or, indeed, any employment at all. They said that this was partly an educational problem; in other words, what they were taught at school did not necessarily prepare them for life outside school. </PARA>
<PARA> A frequent criticism I hear in many places is that students are asked to learn about maths 1, maths 2, physics, chemistry and all these other subjects solely to get a good tertiary entrance score but that at the end of the day they leave school without necessarily having a sound understanding of how the world outside works. The issues that are of concern to them are how a bank account is worked, how a credit card is managed and how a bank statement is read when it comes at the end of the month. These are criticisms that are frequently made and criticisms that need to be answered by our educational system if we are to equip this next generation of school leavers with the necessary skills to become good Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> We see and read so frequently in the newspapers stories of people my age or younger becoming bankrupt because they could not properly manage their credit cards, their cheque books or whatever. These are tales of woe and wasted opportunity, of young lives that have been blemished because the educational system failed to prepare them for what they would meet outside the school gate. </PARA>
<PARA> These young people also suggested that it was perhaps necessary to change the way in which we assess people; in other words, we should not ask everybody to study maths 1, maths 2, physics and chemistry because it does not necessarily mean, for example, that they will be good lawyers, carpenters or plumbers. Increasingly, society is demanding school leavers be academically qualified but not that they be qualified for life. Of course, it does not take too long after leaving school before we forget all the things we were taught and all the academic subjects which have been shoved down our throats for so many years. </PARA>
<PARA> Schools could profitably teach people how to be good citizens and how they can get jobs when they leave school. Many of these people said to me that they do not even know where to start to look for a job. They do not know how they should equip themselves to have the maximum chance of getting a job. Senator Michael Baume has been diligent in bringing unemployment rates to the public attention, and so he might as the shadow Minister for youth affairs; it is only appropriate that he does so. Whilst we have these enormously high youth unemployment rates, it is incumbent upon schools and teachers-and parents and citizens associations for that matter-to ensure that the students who leave our schools have the skills to get the jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Even then the problem does not end because jobs need to be available for the taking. Here we find the great dilemma facing young Australians today: there just are not the jobs to put them into the work force. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, of course they did not plan for a recession. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) says that he planned for a recession, but it is a bit rum to expect young people to plan for a recession; Senator Kemp is quite right. Once they leave school full of vim and vigour and an enthusiasm for life, after so many months on the dole queue and so many months of being shunted from one place to another, that enthusiasm evaporates. They are concerned about us creating a climate, an economic condition, in this country where it is increasingly difficult for them and other school leavers to get the jobs they need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The comments that I am hearing amongst young Australians are really quite interesting. They are saying that there ought to be work for the dole schemes because nobody has a right to get a living off the State. They are saying that we should not be paying ourselves more than we deserve, because we are being greedy and the people who have the jobs are depriving those people who lack the jobs of the opportunity to get into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the problems that the young Australians of today demand that we in Canberra address. These are the problems which they believe are critical not just in the future of some abstract group called the public, but in the future of so many important young lives-so many young people who are about to embark, for the first time, upon life in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst my comments must necessarily be brief and whilst I draw to a close, I hasten to add that I am very pleased and proud to have had the opportunity to met those people in Mackay-people who came in their own time because they were seriously interested in meeting with parliamentarians and expressing their view. It is an honour for me as a young Australian to bring their views down here to Canberra. That is one promise I made to them and one promise which I am very proud to have delivered. </PARA>

At no time did either of those honourable senators or any other honourable senator who was present at the meeting move a motion in relation to who could or could not attend the meeting. However, what did occur was that the Managing Director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Mr David Hill, generously offered, if there were a problem-because Senator Kemp had some questions to address to him-to meet him privately. He actually offered to meet him today, if it suited Senator Kemp's program. I think most people in this chamber would consider that a generous offer from a very busy person. Senator Macdonald, because he raised no further objection at the Committee, I thought accepted that as a reasonable compromise, because Senator Kemp could not be contacted as far as I know.

There could not have been a more proper procedure by any Senate committee. It was a properly convened committee meeting that made an original decision about inviting Mr Hill. I thought, and I would hope that most of the honourable senators there would have thought, that the process and the Committee's deliberations were very worth while.

The Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, Senator Foreman, gave a reasoned account of how he saw the meeting and I had no objection to anything he said. Had the matter been left at what Senator Foreman said-which was accurate-there would have been no need for anyone else to speak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did not hear Senator Kemp's speech, but I read the notes of it when I came into the chamber very late in the piece. There is nothing in Senator Kemp's speech which I find offensive. But the contributions of Senator Faulkner and Senator Kernot have of course made it imperative that I do set the record straight in relation to a couple of matters. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understood him, Senator Faulkner suggested that I should not have gone out and told Senator Kemp what had happened in the meeting. Senator Kemp had made a request to me and I brought it, quite properly, to the attention of the Committee when it consisted of the Chairman, Senator Faulkner, Senator Kernot and myself-the same people who were there when the matter was first discussed; not a full committee meeting.

At the meeting I put the request to the Chairman and the Chairman determined, for various reasons-which I accepted when the majority of three, Senator Kernot, Senator Faulkner and the Chairman, all agreed-that Senator Kemp could not come. I asked to be excused while I telephoned Senator Kemp to tell him that he was not permitted to come and to give him the reasons why.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were there later, but not when this matter was discussed. As someone who supposedly gave an accurate record of this meeting, the honourable senator's mind is as inane as his interjections. There was also a suggestion by Senator Faulkner that I did not contact Senator Kemp. I do not know where he got that information from. I do not know whether he was eavesdropping my phone call. He did not need to eavesdrop, because it was quite open. It was done in front of him. I did contact Senator Kemp. To stand up in this chamber and say that Senator Kemp was not contacted is absolutely ridiculous. If that is the sort of effort we see from the Deputy Whip of the Australian Labor Party, we might wonder about the veracity of some of the things that happen here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is, as honourable senators have said, much ado about nothing. I simply want to end with the comment that I can see absolutely no reason why Senator Kemp could not have come along if he had a wish to speak to Mr Hill. Mr Hill certainly did not object. He offered, when the request was made, to speak to Senator Kemp. That was passed on to Senator Kemp. I spoke to Mr Hill's assistant and told him that Senator Kemp would be available tonight. However, Mr Hill said that he had an important meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and he did not know whether he would have time to get back to Senator Kemp tonight. I informed Mr Hill's assistant that I was sure that Senator Kemp would be quite happy to meet him at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the reason for Senator Kemp not being allowed at that meeting, or for Senator Bishop, Senator Baume or any other honourable senator not being allowed there, it completely escapes me. There was no great secrecy. There was no Government policy involved. There were no state secrets involved. There was nothing that would bring down the Government. It was a general chat with the chief executive officer of a very important arm of this Government. Several senators would have liked to have gone along. Why Senator Kemp could not have been invited or allowed to come in completely escapes me. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that the Chairman went along with the rest of the Committee. Senator Kernot and Senator Faulkner, for some reason, seemed to have a particular fix against letting Senator Kemp in. I do not know why. It seems absolutely amazing to me that that should happen. Why it should happen completely nonpluses me. I am about to finish, but, Mr President, as you and every other senator would agree, it would have been so much simpler if the Committee had said, `If Senator Kemp wants to come along, why not let him'. We would have avoided all this. I am simply amazed at the decision. As my name had been mentioned in this debate, I wanted to ensure that the facts that had been wrongly stated were corrected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commonwealth Budget surplus for 1989-90 of $8,036 million reflected a domestic surplus of $10,901 million and an overseas deficit of $2,865 million.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The domestic surplus of $10,901 million in 1989-90 represented 3.0 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Budget estimates for 1990-91 incorporate a domestic surplus of $10,733 million and an overseas deficit of $2,626 million. Since the release of those estimates, the forecast for the overall Budget surplus of $8,107 million in 1990-91 has been revised downwards, reflecting mainly the effect of the slowdown in domestic economic activity on Budget outlays and revenue. The decline in the overall Budget surplus can therefore be expected to be reflected, in large part, in a decline in the forecast domestic surplus. The overseas deficit, however, will also be somewhat larger than estimated at Budget-time because of higher than expected disbursements on defence and interest payments.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The estimated domestic surplus of $10,733 million for 1990-91 in the Budget estimates represented 2.7 per cent of the Budget-time forecast of GDP. While the domestic surplus and the level of GDP are now expected to be lower than forecast at the time of the budget, the overall effect is expected to be a lower ratio of the domestic surplus to GDP relative to the Budget-time estimate.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Less emphasis has been placed on the distinction between the domestic and overseas components of the Budget balance in recent years as greater attention has been given to the extent to which the Budget (and the public sector more generally) contributes to or draws upon aggregate domestic saving. The balance between domestic saving and investment determines the extent to which the nation is required to draw upon foreign savings and thus the size of the current account deficit. There is no reason to distinguish in this regard between the domestic and overseas components of the Budget balance, as a surplus in either would represent an addition to saving, while a deficit would represent a subtraction from saving.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The cost of providing capacity for additional aircraft movements forecast to 2005 using expenditure projections in Table 7.6 in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed third runway at Sydney Airport is:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Proposed third runway at Sydney airport plus staged Badgerys Creek, $14,800/aircraft movement.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Directed Badgerys Creek plus current programme at Sydney Airport, $20,719/aircraft movement.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Active traffic management at Sydney Airport plus staged Badgerys Creek, $14,904/aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA>The relative cost of providing additional capacity in the long term at Sydney Airport, and at Badgerys Creek, is not meaningful in terms of aircraft movements due to the wide variation in passenger numbers carried by aircraft of different types that will be permitted to operate at both airports. The cost effectiveness of expenditure is best related to the cost in dollars per passenger to meet the forecast level of incremental demand.</PARA>
<PARA>Under this measurement, construction cost per passenger in 1990 dollars to provide capacity under the three options is (a) proposed third runway at Sydney Airport with staged Badgerys Creek, $99 per passenger, (b) directed Badgerys Creek plus current programme at Sydney airport, $113 per passenger, (c) active traffic management at Sydney Airport plus staged Badgerys Creek, $112 per passenger.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The guidance to the SIDCDE that I was referring to at the press conference was a government decision in November 1990 that inherently lethal, incapacitating or destructive goods would not be sold to a certain destination; but that applications relating to other military goods could be approved. Examples were given as to the kind of applications (for that destination) which would be referred to the SIDCDE and some of these examples included parts that were goods itemised in Part 1A of Schedule 13 to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. The Government's guidance has assisted the Committee to make recommendations on several sensitive applications for `in-principle' approval to me or my delegate, and for the relevant firms to be advised.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) &amp;(4) Formal meetings have normally been called when there is a need to address policy matters or other major issues. My answer to Question on Notice No. 302, particularly Parts (4), (11) and (12) explain the process and reasons for out of session consideration of applications. The Chairman (Assistant Secretary Exports and International Programs Branch), in consultation with SIDCDE members, has my authority to call a meeting of the Committee. As explained in my answer to Question on Notice No. 302 Part (4) information relating to individual applications is forwarded to members by facsimile transmission. Any points of clarification can be discussed by telephone and further information provided by facsimile or memorandum if necessary. Members provide advice by similar means.</PARA>
<PARA> All members of the Committee are consulted on applications relating to the type of goods and destinations they wish to see (as has been agreed by the relevant Ministers). For further details see my reply to your Question 515 (1). In some instances the Committee Chairman or Secretariat in my Department carries out consultation beyond these agreed categories where a Committee member has a particular interest, expertise or could be expected to have additional pertinent information.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Part 2 Section 8 of the Capital Equipment Procurement Manual provided to you under cover of my letter of 12 March 1991 provides details of the procedures followed in the administration of export applications by my Department. These show when applications are referred to the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Exports (SIDCDE) (including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade). In summary these include:</PARA>
<PARA> - applications to export Part 1A goods (in schedule 13 to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations) relating to an agreed list of sensitive destinations;</PARA>
<PARA> - applications to export Part 1B goods which are of major military significance relating to an agreed list of sensitive destinations (excluding application for which a precedent for approval exists unless there are changed circumstances);</PARA>
<PARA> - applications to export Part 3 goods to countries to which any of the criteria listed in the Public Guidelines paragraph 36 could apply.</PARA>
<PARA> Applications to export Part 1A goods and Parts 1B or Part 2 goods of major military significance to certain agreed countries are automatically denied and are not referred to the SIDCDE.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade requested to see all applications relating to Part 1B goods to an agreed list of sensitive destinations. Any other applications which my Department felt might be of interest to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for foreign policy or human rights reasons would also be referred.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) &amp;(b) The ``information'' is contained in the procedures agreed by Ministers including those outlined in (1) above as well as agreed destinations subject to consultation (see my reply to your Question on Notice No. 509);</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No. Iraq is not on a list of countries the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade wishes to see because it is subject to a complete embargo as indicated in a press release by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 6 August 1990 and a notice in the Commonwealth Gazette on 7 August 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The procedures at (1) are agreed by all relevant departments and their Ministers. The Department of the Attorney General has indicated that it does not need to see applications relating to Part 1 and Part 2 goods.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) This question does not properly reflect the actual procedures followed (see 1 above). However, in terms of actual practice I can give the following answers:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (or any other member of the SIDCDE) could request to see details of other applications or category of applications;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) See (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) 640 applications relating to military goods (see also note below)</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 47.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 11.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Defence also processes applications relating to cryptographic goods destined for civilian users and for nonmilitary lethal goods (such as sporting rifles and associated ammunition) which are also covered by Schedule 13 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. Including such applications the total processed for 1989-90 was 1576.</PARA>
<PARA> The above statistics do not reflect the fact that the kind of applications referred to the SIDCDE frequently involve multiple destinations as part of a marketing exercise.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes; or a document that serves a similar purpose. The requirement may be satisfied by suitable documentation other than an End Use and Non-Transfer Certificate as indicated in Paragraph 18 of the public guidelines `Australian Controls on the Export of Defence and Related Goods'. In some cases the requirement is more satisfied by terms and conditions in a Memorandum of Understanding with a particular country concerning end use and non-transfer of goods provided under Defence Co-operation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) In the period July 1985 to March 1991, 225 employment</PARA>
<PARA>(2) services were funded at a cost of $29.4m pa.</PARA>
<PARA> At present it is not possible to specify how many of these services are provided for people with an intellectual disability, but it is estimated that a large proportion of consumers using these services have an intellectual disability.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) The Department does not collect this information.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) Provision for funding research and development (R&amp;)</PARA>
<PARA>(5) activities falls under Section 12 of the Disability Services Act. R&amp; activities fall into five categories broadly covering both research and development activities. Brief descriptions of these categories follow:</PARA>
<PARA> i. Investigation, Initiation, Planning and Development-to provide resources to support the development of services for people with disabilities;</PARA>
<PARA> ii. Training-to promote management efficiency in services funded under the Disability Services Act;</PARA>
<PARA> iii. Publicity and Resource Material-to develop and produce information sources;</PARA>
<PARA> iv. Research-to provide for applied research that examines outcomes and the need for and provision of new services;</PARA>
<PARA> v. Other-to provide for contingencies and unexpected priorities which may arise, to allow for the development of services which will lead to the better co-ordination between service providers.</PARA>
<PARA>For the period July 1985-June 1987, funding for innovation and development projects was provided under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act through the Program Upgrading Scheme (PUGS). Through PUGS, a number of activities were funded and it is not possible to identify dollar amounts for activities that equate to research and development under the DSA over the period. Consequently, only the number of projects for this period have been shown.</PARA>

<PARA>(2) I accept that there is a possibility that some of this work may move off-shore if the Government proceeded with the proposed bounty change.</PARA>

<PARA>(4) The Government has decided to withdraw from the legislation the proposed increase in minimum bounty claim size for books and instead, in consultation with the industry, to look to the introduction of a minimum annual bounty payment threshold as a more effective way of achieving the Government's objective.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 March 1991 (Hansard, page 1547) Senator Tambling asked me as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs a question without notice about Cambodian boat people in Australia, which, inter alia, made reference to the Government consideration of the claims of these people to remain in Australia and whether this was dependent upon the negotiation of arrangements for return of the Cambodians. I undertook that if there was any further information that I could usefully provide, I would do so. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following additional information to the answer which I provided to Senator Tambling's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>On 11 March, in a question in the Senate, Senator Tambling asked whether the assessment of the Cambodian boat people against refugee criteria was dependent upon the failure to negotiate arrangements for the return of them.</PARA>
<PARA>As at 30 April 1991, the status of the 224 (now 259) Cambodians is not yet resolved. Twenty-six full and final applications have now been received from members of the Melbourne group, and 16 from members of the Sydney group. Further finalised applications are still awaited for the remainder of these two groups. The Darwin group are yet to submit any applications.</PARA>
<PARA>I have deliberately allowed those involved time to seek all available assistance in the preparation of their applications. This has resulted in a situation where most have yet to lodge applications.</PARA>
<PARA>The consideration of their claims is a lengthy and complex process and I do not expect final decisions on any of the group for some time yet.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to become involved in speculation about the outcome of the decision on these claims until the decision process is complete.</PARA>
<PARA>It is far from clear what may emerge from this process. Those whose claims are accepted will be able to remain under the conditions provided for refugee asylum. Others whose claims fall short of refugee status but who have strong humanitarian claims may be allowed to stay. Those who do not meet the refugee criteria and who do not have other admissible claims will be required to leave.</PARA>
<PARA>In this context officials from my department discussed possible arrangements for return with the authorities in Phnom Penh in June 1990. These discussions resulted in a simple arrangement for return being prepared and agreed. This was reflected in an exchange of notes at an operational level by the officials involved.</PARA>
<PARA>The arrangements proposed closely follow normal deportation procedures that apply to all people who are required to depart Australia. The slightly novel aspect of the arrangements as discussed arose from the fact that I believed that the Government needed to ensure that normal and acceptable arrangements for return existed and would be met. This appears to be the case.The situation in Cambodia is very complex. Opportunities for people in Cambodia to emigrate are limited. There are many seeking family reunification with families in other countries including Australia. As a consequence I have instructed my department to explore the possibility of establishing arrangements for the emigration of the family of Cambodian Australians from the territory of the State of Cambodia. To this end a delegation of senior officers from my department visited Phnom Penh recently to discuss possible arrangements. These initial discussions (held over the period 2-5 April) were most useful and I am confident that effective arrangements will be established in the near future.</PARA>
