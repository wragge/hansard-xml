<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled; the petition of the undersigned citizens of Western Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>That we call upon the Honourable Senators to reject legislation denying Australians the right to advertise electoral material on radio and television, believing such bans amount to a refusal of free speech, an unfair advantage to an incumbent government, and a denial of information to print-handicapped Australians.</PARA>

<TITLE>Animal Patenting</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and members of the Australian Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> The undersigned citizens of Australia oppose the patenting of animals, and the processes for altering them. Animal patents would:</PARA>
<PARA>compromise animal welfare, allow genetic engineering companies to appropriate the fruits of centuries of selective breeding, reduce biodiversity, and further concentrate ownership of breeding stock. We note with concern that many applications for animal patents have been lodged with the Australian Patents Office and without your intervention they may soon be approved.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, please take all possible steps immediately to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Patents Office rejects all existing applications for animal patents and declines to accept any more.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Senate amends the Patents Bill 1989 to prohibit the patenting of animals.</PARA>
<PARA> We urge the members of the Australian Senate to act on this petition.</PARA>

<TITLE>Telecom: 0055 Services</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Telecom is selling 0055 telephone networks to private contractors who provide offensive and sexually explicit recorded messages to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The providers of these services are advertising in the pages of Australian newspapers in a manner which is designed to titillate and attract calls from the whole community and thus play on the curiosity of children.</PARA>
<PARA>3. These services degrade and humiliate women and portray them as sex objects, and they destroy the innocence of children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, immediately call on Telecom to so regulate the conditions under which these services are made available, that women are no longer portrayed as sex objects, degraded or humiliated and that the innocence of children is protected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a very brief comment about this motion. General Business time is an important time for members of both the Senate and the other place. It is one of the very few times that we have to bring forward matters which are not necessarily on the agenda of the Government or the official Opposition. It is really an infringement of the rights of individual senators for General Business time to be unduly constrained or abandoned, as this motion suggests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a number of matters on the Notice Paper. For the last eight years, I have not had an opportunity to put these matters forward in the time made available in General Business time.

<PARA> I thought I should just make that point and put it on the record.

<PARA>EXPORT CONTROL AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to introduce amendments to the Export Control Act 1982. The amendments do not reflect major changes in policy by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>The Export Control Act sets up a regime for the export inspection of prescribed goods. These goods include meat, fish, fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy produce and grains. The purpose of the inspection is to ensure that the goods which are to be exported meet the strict requirements set out in the orders made pursuant to the regulations under the Act. These requirements are aimed at ensuring fitness for human consumption, quality and accurate trade description of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government takes a serious view of malpractice in the export food industry. Any malpractice that may endanger the reputation of our export industries and jeopardise overseas markets for Australian goods must be strongly deterred. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly these amendments include the introduction of two new offences into the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 6 of the Bill introduces an offence of falsely representing, at the time of entering goods for export, that conditions or restrictions applicable to those goods have been complied with. The representation is made to an authorised officer who is usually an officer performing inspection services. The phrase `enter for export' is defined in Clause 3 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>This offence is introduced because many goods which are controlled by the Act are prepared without the direct supervision of an authorised officer. The exporter of those goods may only enter the goods for export if the goods have met the conditions or restrictions that were applicable to the preparation of those goods. </PARA>
<PARA>The offence has three elements. First prescribed goods must be presented to an authorised officer for the purpose of the authorised officer performing his function under section 10 of the Act. That function is to ensure that the conditions or restrictions applicable to the goods have been complied with. A presentation to an officer at that officer's request will be a presentation for the purposes of this element. </PARA>
<PARA>The second element is that the presentation must occur at a prescribed stage of the preparation of the goods. Given that there are different inspection processes for different commodities it will be necessary to prescribe stages of preparation that are suitable for each commodity. Hence there are particular stages of preparation at which goods which exporters wish to enter for export must have complied with the conditions or restrictions applicable to those goods. </PARA>
<PARA>The third element is that there is a false representation that the conditions or restrictions applicable to the goods at or before the time the goods were entered for export, have been complied with. This need not be an express representation. It is sufficient that it is by necessary implication because in the normal course of inspecting goods it is not common for the exporter to expressly state that the goods have complied with prior restrictions or conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>The second offence created by this Bill is set out in Clause 15. That clause amends section 24 of the Act by inserting an offence of authorised officers receiving goods or services from the owner of a registered export establishment without written permission of the secretary. Section 24 of the Act currently prohibits an exporter providing goods or services to an authorised officer. This amendment complements that provision by prohibiting the receipt of goods or services by authorised officers. I must particularly stress the importance of the integrity of inspection staff in the food industry. Lack of integrity on their behalf will jeopardise valuable export markets for Australian exporters. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 14 of the Bill introduces a new section 23 into the Act. Section 23 provides for the secretary to issue health or fitness for human consumption certificates. Such certificates are usually required to be provided by the exporter to the importing country before that country will allow goods to be imported. In addition the certificates are also used for commercial purposes by the exporters even where there is no importing country requirement, for example to obtain payment for their goods. Accordingly, to facilitate export trade, this amendment makes it clear that such certificates may also be granted where the certificate relates to requirements of the Act or to other matters concerning goods of the kind that are to be exported. </PARA>
<PARA>An express power to cancel such a certificate is included where the secretary becomes aware that the information attested to in the certificate is incorrect in a significant respect. </PARA>
<PARA>Other amendments in this Bill follow current criminal law policy by omitting references to monetary penalties where terms of imprisonment are provided for. Section 4B of the Crimes Act 1914 will operate and for each 12 months of imprisonment provided for in the Export Control Act, a court may impose a monetary penalty of up to $6,000.00 for individuals or 5 times that amount for corporations. This obviates the need to amend the Act when policy as to the relativity between gaol terms and monetary penalties changes. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>NATIONAL FOOD AUTHORITY BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This country has a long history of food legislation. According to the Times of London in 1914, ``Australia was the first of the dominions of the British Empire and probably the first country in the world to enact pure food legislation and to establish standards to which manufacturers of food must conform''. That newspaper reported that there was ` `a pure food Act of the amplest description in force in Australia before the Bill for the American Act came before Congress.''</PARA>
<PARA>The need to establish food legislation in Australia was recognised as early as 1838, when the colony of New South Wales passed its Adulteration of Bread Act. In 1863, a Melbourne newspaper published lists of common adulterations in food and then went on to expose practices such as colouring sweets with lead chromate. In 1896, New South Wales passed its Public Health Act, which made it an offence to sell unwholesome or adulterated food or food which was falsely described. Adulteration was seen as both a health safety problem and a fair trading issue. </PARA>
<PARA>States retained the right to make food laws after federation and in 1905 Victoria passed its Pure Food Act and was followed over the next five years by the remaining four States. </PARA>
<PARA>Changed conditions after World War II made a new approach essential. In the late nineteen forties, the industry established food technology associations in each State and through their Federal body, the Australian Food Technology Association, these associations approached the Government with an offer to undertake preliminary work towards developing uniform regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1953 the Federal machinery to develop uniform food regulations was set up within the National Health and Medical Research Council. </PARA>
<PARA>The NH&amp;RC had been established much earlier, in 1938, to advise governments on public health matters. Food fell within its interests and when moves were made towards uniform regulation it was considered to be the obvious body with the scope of interests and expertise to guide the regulation process. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite substantial reforms to food industry regulation since then-most notably, an agreement by the Commonwealth and States for the joint development of standards-the need for reform remained evident both because of the impact of the food regulation system, the growth of the processed food industry and the capacity of the regulatory system to respond swiftly to public health and safety issues which are of increasing interest to consumers. And much more needs to be done to ensure that the public have a better opportunity to contribute to the framing of standards. </PARA>
<PARA>The food processing industry is a very important industry to all Australians. Not only is it a major contributor to our health and well-being through the production of safe and nutritious food, it also provides employment for many. </PARA>
<PARA>The food processing and beverages industry represents the largest sector of our manufacturing industries. It accounts for approximately 20%-in excess of $30 billion a year-of manufacturing turnover and employs some 173,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia is a major exporter of food. Our exports amount to over $8.5 billion a year which is over 20% of total Australian exports. Most of these are, however, low value added products. The opportunities are there to expand our exports of the processed foods- Austrade believes that our exports of processed foods to the Asian region could be doubled- but a number of studies have shown that there are continuing difficulties with achieving our full export potential. </PARA>
<PARA>The industry was examined by what was then the Industries Assistance Commission in October 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The IAC's final report agreed that the current system of food regulation was a significant impediment to the development of an efficient and competitive industry in Australia-that is to the development of our export industry. Similar conclusions have been reached in a series of reports by the then Business Regulation Review Unit. </PARA>
<PARA>The IAC concluded that current administrative mechanisms were costly in terms of time and resources and had reduced the efficiency and competitiveness of the Australian food industry through increased costs and impediments to product innovation and adoption of new technologies. </PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, difficulties with the current standards and their administration were impeding gains in public safety and consumer protection sought by the community. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also the case that in recent years consumers have become increasingly conscious of the significance of food for health and are rightly concerned at a range of potential issues affecting its safety. They are also concerned about the levels of residues from pesticides and naturally occurring heavy metals that find their way into our food chain and about the type of additives and processing aids used in preparing the food for the supermarket shelves. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the commitment and dedication of a large number of people, the current arrangements for developing domestic food standards are cumbersome and time consuming. Under these arrangements new and revised food standards are developed through a cooperative arrangement with the States and territories. At the Federal level, responsibility is split between the National Health and Medical Research Council and its various expert committees under the Community Services and Health portfolio and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs under the Attorney-General's portfolio. Standards are then implemented through State and Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The major problems with the current regulation system can be attributed to:-</PARA>
<PARA>* a lack of clearly defined objectives for food regulation, together with the lack of a single body with responsibility for driving the system and developing standards</PARA>
<PARA>* complexities and rigidities which render the present system ineffective at responding swiftly to public health problems and innovations in food production technology, and</PARA>
<PARA>* deficiencies in the mechanisms for setting and reviewing food standards. </PARA>
<PARA>We also believe that there needs to be more openness in the system with real opportunities for interested parties to contribute to the process. </PARA>
<PARA>The current approach to State implementation could also be improved. While some States now adopt food standards by reference to the standards formulated by the National Health and Medical Research Council system, there are delays in States drafting their own regulations and differences in drafting between States increase the difficulty in ensuring uniform interpretation. Also there are differences between State approaches in areas such as food hygiene and food recalls. </PARA>
<PARA>Against the background of the IAC report, the Government agreed that a revised mechanism for setting food standards was necessary and should be developed jointly by the Commonwealth, States and Territories. This position was endorsed by the Australian health Ministers' conference in June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>In close consultation with States and Territories we have developed a reformed process for setting food standards which addresses the problems of the current arrangements. In October 1990 the direction of these reforms was agreed by the heads of all governments at the Special Premiers' Conference on Commonwealth-State relations. </PARA>
<PARA>And now after such an impressive history in food regulation originally led by the States and then bringing on board the industry, scientists and consumers, for the first time, the Federal Parliament is to have the opportunity to debate the issues and to contribute to the reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>The basic principles of the reforms being proposed are:-</PARA>
<PARA>* to consolidate responsibility for domestic food standards development with a minimum number of decision making layers</PARA>
<PARA>* to ensure uniformity between jurisdictions;</PARA>
<PARA>* to establish objectives for food standards;</PARA>
<PARA>* to promote coordination of domestic and international food standards;</PARA>
<PARA>* to ensure an open and publicly accountable arrangement which would allow input by interested parties and provide for public hearings where appropriate;</PARA>
<PARA>* and, importantly, to retain the involvement of the States and Territories in standards development and administration. </PARA>
<PARA>These principles are to be adopted by the Commonwealth, States and Territories through the Bill before the Senate and a formal agreement between all heads of government. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me first describe the Commonwealth State agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the existing agreement each State and Territory adopts the food standards that have been developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council and agreed to unanimously by members of the National Food Standards Council. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Food Standards Council comprises the responsible Ministers from all jurisdictions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The existing agreement also allows for each State to make unilateral variations to those food standards. It is now necessary to revise that agreement to take account of the decision of the Special Premiers Conference that uniform national food standards should apply across the nation and be regulated by a national food authority. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the revised agreement presently being considered by States and the Territories, they would adopt food standards that have been:-</PARA>
<PARA>* recommended by the National Food Authority, and</PARA>
<PARA>* agreed to by the National Food Standards Council by majority decision. </PARA>
<PARA>Now let me turn to the Bill before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will establish the National Food Authority as an independent statutory authority, and make provision for its membership, staffing, functions and objectives. It will also prescribe the process by which food standards are to be developed so as to ensure that all interests-consumers, industry and scientific experts-are involved in the development of standards by providing adequate information about proposals and an opportunity to contribute. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority is to comprise a full time chair supported by four part time members. One of the part time members would be an officer of a State or Territory health authority with a good knowledge of the food regulation system. The Bill requires that the members of the Authority are to have experience or expertise in relevant fields such as public health, food science the food industry or consumer advocacy. The members are however not representatives of the various interest groups. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill requires the proposed National Food Authority to pursue set objectives in making recommendations for the introduction, removal or amendment of food standards. The Authority will be required to have regard in priority order to:-</PARA>
<PARA>* the need to protect public health and safety;</PARA>
<PARA>* the provision of adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices;</PARA>
<PARA>* the promotion of fair trading in food;</PARA>
<PARA>* the promotion of trade and commerce in the food industry; and</PARA>
<PARA>* the promotion of consistency with standards applied to food in international trade. </PARA>
<PARA>The fifth objective referring to the requirements for international trade, is likely to be of increasing relevance. The food standards recommended by the food Authority apply to all food sold in Australia-to imported food as well as to domestically produced food. And of course the producers who produce to meet domestic standards would be advantaged if these standards were consistent with overseas requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>The role of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-or GATT-negotiations is also relevant. Those negotiations have identified the need to avoid food standards being used as barriers to trade. The GATT goal is to ensure that national standards should be based upon the standards developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission or where they differ, they do so on a scientifically justified basis. The National Food Authority will contribute to the decision making on Codex standards and, in turn, harmonise our  domestic food regulations, where appropriate, with Codex. This harmonisation would remove the potential for accusation that Australia was using food standards as a non-tariff trade barrier. </PARA>
<PARA>The principal function of the Authority as set out in the Bill is to develop and review the standards relating to food available in Australia. Food standards prescribe a range of matters that relate to food composition, the use of additives, production, storage, maximum levels of environmental contamination including heavy metals and pesticides residues, labelling and packaging. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also gives the Authority a range of functions which are ancillary to the development of those standards. Generally, these relate to working with the States and Territories to:-</PARA>
<PARA>* conduct surveys of the food available,</PARA>
<PARA>* arrange the recall of unsafe food, and</PARA>
<PARA>* conduct food safety awareness and education programs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority will also develop and publish recommended codes of practice and guidelines to assist industry in maintaining hygienic production and handling procedures to ensure the safety of the food. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill goes into considerable detail to prescribe the process to be followed by the Authority in relation to its principal function-the development of standards. The Bill requires the Authority to notify interested organisations, including all State and Territory health authorities and the National Health and Medical Research Council, and to place notices in the Commonwealth Gazette about all proposals to develop or amend a food standard and to invite submissions on the proposals. The New Zealand Government will also be advised, so as to ensure a continuing exchange of information and consistent approach to food regulation between ourselves and our close trading partner. </PARA>
<PARA>After considering any submissions, the Authority will draft a standard and once again notify interested parties and the public and invite comment on the draft. When considering the more significant of proposed standards, the Authority will be empowered to hold a public hearing to give interested parties the opportunity to debate the issues in open forum. </PARA>
<PARA>This requirement for an open and public process is an essential element of the reform and, I believe, that it will become a model for the approach to making regulations in many other areas. In order to avoid the process itself becoming a barrier to necessary swift action the Authority may simplify the process where issues are of minor significance and has a ``fast track'' available to it there is an exceptional public health risk. </PARA>
<PARA>There are limited review processes included in the legislation. An applicant for development of a standard may seek review of the NFA's decision by the AAT where the Authority rejects an application without having developed a draft standard. The final recommendation of the NFA and the decisions of the NFSC are not subject to review. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the complaints about the present system is that it can take far too long to consider an application and process it through the complex National Health and Medical Research Council committee structure. The reforms proposed in this system will overcome this by imposing a time frame within which the Authority must complete its scientific assessment of a proposed standard and make a recommendation to the National Food Standards Council. This period is first established as a maximum of 12 months and it may be reduced by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority will employ scientists over a range of disciplines whose expertise will be supplemented as needed by experts either called on an ad hoc basis to advise on individual standards or employed as consultants. </PARA>
<PARA>At the end of this process the Authority will present a draft standard and recommendation to the council of State, Territory and Commonwealth Ministers responsible for food regulation-the National Food Standards Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, under our federal system whereby the Commonwealth will provide the facilities and processes to develop the standards which are to be implemented by States and Territories, it is essential that the States and Territories are fully involved. As I have already mentioned they will be represented on the management of the Authority and will be advised of all proposals coming before the Authority, thus having the opportunity to make submissions. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the Bill provides a mechanism for States and Territories to be involved in the broader issues such as the development of the policies within which food standards are set. </PARA>
<PARA>This involvement will be through a high level advisory committee which would be established by the Bill. This committee would comprise the chairperson of the Authority, a representative of each State and Territory, a representative of the departments of Community Services and Health and Primary Industries and Energy and a representative of the New Zealand Government. Provision is also made for the chairman to appoint other members for specific purposes such as to provide advice on industry and consumer issues. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not a committee to routinely examine proposals for food standards. It is intended as a top level policy advisory body to assist the Authority in setting its broad policy guidelines and directions. It would only become involved in consideration of an individual standard when the chair of the Authority believes that top level policy advice is needed-the development of that standard would remain subject to the fixed time scales. </PARA>
<PARA>The procedures set out in the Bill represent the best thinking of people working within the present system and have been developed to ensure that the principles of the reforms that I mentioned earlier are carried through into practice. However, with such a major change to industry regulation, we must keep the system under review to ensure that the reforms actually achieve the efficiencies that they were designed to achieve. The Government will therefore instruct the Authority to review its operating procedures after they have been in place for two years to assess any changes that may be necessary to improve efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government also proposes that within its first eighteen months of operation the food Authority should review the policy for setting food standards and prepare a timetable for the review of each existing food standard. </PARA>
<PARA>Public confidence in the food supply is essential to protect the marketability of agricultural produce and processed foods. Both Commonwealth and State governments have responsibility, complementary to the role of industry, to promote quality and hygiene and this can be effectively provided through a National Food Authority. The establishment of such a body, together with the proposed Heads of Government agreement, will be a major achievement in removing regulatory impediments to the development of the Australian food industry and establishing an effective mechanism for responding to food safety concerns. The proposed approach is strongly supported by the food industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before the Senate ensures that consumer groups have the opportunity to contribute to food standards and recognises the need for all of us to be able to be confident that food we purchase is safe and wholesome and that the information about that food is comprehensive and adequate. The Bill also recognises the significance of the food industry and the need for interstate and international trade means that the process for setting food standards should be efficient and dynamic. </PARA>
<PARA>The bringing together of the administrative responsibility for food standards and imported food risk assessment policies into one body will bring about some efficiencies of operations. However the tight time frames for finalising applications for new standards and the need to review all existing standards for conformity with the objectives set out in the Bill will involve a modest additional resource commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian agency has an absolute authority to test all Australian athletes. It can do so at International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) events but that body also has the right to test athletes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has that process been working satisfactorily or is there some conflict between the two? It seems to me that is the prospect we would be facing, with the IAAF claiming to have the right to test all athletes, but the Australian Sports Drug Agency not having the right to test all athletes unless it is subject to an agreement between Canada, I think, and the United States or the United Kingdom. Other than that agreement, the Australian Sports Drug Agency would only be able to test Australian athletes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation is that, while Australia is quite happy with the arrangement, the IAAF has expressed concern not simply about what it might term Australian interference but the interference by national bodies at large. I understand that we will be having some further talks with the international body to see whether we can unruffle its feathers. The other question the honourable senator asked was whether the arrangement is working well and the answer to that is yes. In so far as the agency is concerned there have been no problems.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask it particularly because the object of setting up this Australian Sports Drug Agency, presumably, was to have an independent agency divorced from both the administration and officials of the sports. If they insist themselves on choosing who are the athletes to be tested, the testing process is eliminating the Australian Sports Drug Agency from participating in a primary role in events which are taking place in Australia. This fundamentally undermines the purpose for which we passed legislation in this place last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I did ask at the Estimates hearing whether or not somebody could discover for me what part Mr Rowe played. I asked that for a particular reason. As I understood it, Mr Rowe is associated with the IAAF drug doping agency and he is also in some way associated with Athletics Australia. What concerned me, without making judgment about it, was that Mr Rowe sprang very vigorously to the defence of Mr Plant, who was also associated with the IAAF. He did not defend his role in the substitution incident long past but was at pains to point out that he had not committed any technical offence. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that, if he were to have a view at all, he should have been saying that it was an unsavoury practice and not one that is looked upon favourably by the Association with which both he and Mr Plant in some way are associated. To the extent that he is an Australian and to the extent that Athletics Australia claims that it had no contact with the IAAF over the appointment of Mr Plant, I rather wonder what the relationship between Mr Plant and Mr Rowe is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the situation with Mr Plant is a matter of concern for us. Mr Rowe is a member of what is called the Technical Officials Panel of the IAAF; that is his position. So far as Mr Plant is concerned, I am advised that Athletics Australia has banned him from any managerial position with Australian teams, so he does not have an official position of that kind. But I understand that he still looks after a number of Australian athletes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Richardson. I will not labour the point, but it is not too subtle a point. We have the IAAF insisting that it be responsible as the primary body for drug testing in Australia for events conducted by Athletics Australia. For instance, in respect of the Australian national championships the IAAF would claim to be the primary testing body and responsible for that testing, and not Mr Haynes's body. To that extent there is not a separation from the officials and from the events. That would not concern me, except that Mr Nebiolo and his group have a pretty unsavoury past. I take honourable senators back to the Rome world championships as a classic example, when Mr Nebiolo at that stage was also the head of the Italian amateur athletics association, and it is a pretty sordid and sorry history that took place at that time. That body now claims to have control of the testing of Australian and overseas competitors in Australia in events conducted in what might be the Australian championships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mixed up with that body is Mr Rowe, who is associated with dope testing, defending Mr Plant, who is one of the commissioners of the grand prix circuit who was involved in an attempted substitution. Frankly, it does not give anybody much encouragement that there will be a hands-off approach. That is why I ask whether Mr Haynes's agency, the Australian Sports Drug Agency, will be able to test all athletes whenever it likes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I answered that part of the question a little earlier, but just to finalise the matter for Senator Crichton-Browne, I would inform him that later today the Australian Sports Commission will be discussing with Athletics Australia its program. As Senator Crichton-Browne knows, the Commission approves these programs before approving the very considerable funding that it gives all sports. Because, as I acknowledged earlier, the points that Senator Crichton-Browne raises are a matter of concern, they will be raised today with Athletics Australia as part of those discussions that the Commission is having with that body. The Commission will be endeavouring to get some sort of satisfactory response from Athletics Australia as to how we will do this in future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as I am aware, there is no term in the agreement to which I could refer to say that that power is given. Nonetheless, the decision was taken given that the money was payable under the agreement anyway and that the purpose of the exercise was to keep the Ravenshoe Mill open, functioning and employing. The company operating the mill produced evidence considered sufficient by those in the Department who were administering the agreement that it required an advance payment because of a number of seasonal factors to which I think I referred in an answer to a question in the Senate a few weeks ago, including a supply of logs because of wet weather and a few other factors. The company had a short term cash flow problem which an advance would assist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that the Commonwealth was liable for the money anyway, the decision was taken after examining the evidence presented by the company that an advance should be payable. What then occurred was an adjustment to the total requested because of interest forgone.

However, the Commonwealth signed an agreement for the purpose of keeping a mill open, functioning and employing. If a short term cash flow problem were to arise which was going to bring the mill undone and have it closed, then the Commonwealth has a choice to stick rigidly to the terms of the agreement and allow the mill to close or make an advance payment in an attempt to keep it open, functioning and employing. That is what the Commonwealth determined to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

As a result of his signature, it was a ministerial agreement. Is the Minister now telling us that the Plywood mill could ring up the Department and say, `We are having cash flow problems because of the weather'-or whatever- `and we need a cheque for $1m quickly' and the Department would not refer that matter to the Minister as the responsible Minister at the time? If that is the case, then I suggest the agreement has not been adhered to. Could the Minister direct his thoughts to that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will repeat the matters for the Minister: the agreement between the Commonwealth and Plywood and Plastic was signed by the Minister for and on behalf of the Commonwealth. That agreement was to make payments on 1 July.

Did the Department have in its possession audited financial statements, or did it have other financial information? If it had financial information which was not audited, what tests were applied to the veracity of that financial information at the time at which the payment was made? The Minister says that the company said it had short term cash flow difficulties, but if the cash flow difficulties are indeed short term, it would be appropriate for the Department to sight the proper financial statements and, I suggest that they should be audited financial statements.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that waiting for audited statements would have been possible. Had the Department decided to wait for audited statements, then I think that time would have run out for the mill to continue to operate. I do not think that would have been very sensible. This was a short term cash flow problem, and so an examination was undertaken by the Department and Price Waterhouse into the circumstances that gave rise to the problem to determine the extent of it, and whether or not the extent of it justified an early payment. In the view of those who made that investigation, both from the Department and from Price Waterhouse, the circumstances did justify the making of an early payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of when I sighted the letters that I will table-and if Senator O'Chee does not mind, I will table them as soon as this is over because the problem is that if I give them up I cannot work from them while we are speaking-I first sighted them about two weeks ago, I am informed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The payments were decided upon departmentally. This means that an officer of the Department approved some $968,000 which, I think everybody here would agree, was not strictly authorised under the terms of the agreement. I note that the Minister is nodding and I thank him very much for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst everybody accepts that the Commonwealth had a future obligation to make the payment, my concern is that within the letter of the law the payment may have been unlawful because it was not made on the due date. In fact, it was made in the preceding financial year. It is not the calendar year which is relevant here, it is the preceding financial year. The financial year in which this payment was to have been made began on 1 July 1990-that is, the 1990-91 financial year. The payment was, in fact, made in the 1989-90 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer Senator Richardson to clause 2(1) (b) of the agreement, which I have already quoted, in which it is said that the subsidy is for the 1990 year and is payable in advance on the first day of July. In other words, not only was it not made within the terms of the agreement in that it was on the wrong date, and not only was it made in the wrong financial year, but also the payment was in effect a subsidy for the 1989-90 financial year when it was meant to be a subsidy for the 1990-91 financial year. Upon that basis, I ask the Minister to advise how the payment was lawful and the basis on which the Department arrived at that conclusion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain that there is much I can add to the answers that I have already given on this question. The Department believed that the payment was made in the context of the agreement and that it was the Government's policy, as determined by the agreement, to try to keep the mill open and to pay quite considerable sums to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Had I been consulted at the time that this payment was made, my view is that, provided the examination by the Department and Price Waterhouse suggested that there was sufficient reason to keep the mill open, I would have agreed. The object of the exercise-the only purpose of this exercise-was to keep the mill and, many people would say, the town of Ravenshoe functioning. </PARA>
<PARA> Had we taken a decision not to make an advance payment a couple of years ago and had that resulted in the closure of the mill, I am quite certain that I would have been attempting, in an Estimates Committee, to justify why we had so cruelly closed the mill, taken employment away from all those people and caused great hardship in the town. It is one of those situations in which Ministers and public servants earn their money. We had to make a decision on the evidence we had before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps on the strictest possible legal interpretation, we could have said, `Well, the agreement says the money will be paid on 1 July. We will not vary that. That's it. If you close down between now and then, too bad'. But I take the view that the Commonwealth has already invested considerable sums of money-and it had already made a couple of very large payments-and the view was that, to keep the show on the road, we had to make an advance payment. Had I been consulted, I would certainly have said yes. I do not seek simply to pass the buck and say, `Blame the Department'. In terms of the decision to make the payment, had I been consulted at the time, I would have said yes and, having been in a position to review that decision, I still say yes. </PARA>

Because I was not consulted, I did not give it a tick. So there is no document which I have ticked. There is a document which shows authorisation of payment, however, and I am quite happy to table that. I do not think that that is a problem. It would show that an assistant secretary authorised the payment. I will give that to Senator Macdonald.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will summarise the two letters which I will seek to table. The first letter is on Timbertech letterhead, which is a fairly important name these days. The letterhead says that Timbertech is a division of National Associated Plywood Pty Ltd. It is written to Dr Turner, who at the time was the Assistant Secretary of the Natural Heritage Branch, but I do not think he is any more. The letter begins by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of my letter is to bring to your notice problems we have encountered over the past 12 months and . . . the effect these problems have had on cashflow . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The letter then goes on to talk about operations, manning levels, good mill practice, timber extraction, retooling and so on. It goes on to the fourth page setting out the problems that the company was encountering. I will allow the honourable senator to analyse that in whichever way he wishes. </PARA>
<PARA> The other two letters which I table are from Price Waterhouse. The first letter-the letter from the company-was dated 13 December 1989. The two letters from Price Waterhouse are dated 21 December 1989 and 28 December 1989. These letters contain an examination of the company's position. They go through each of the company's suggestions and complaints. It is in fact in the Price Waterhouse letters that one sees the suggestion that if a payment is to be made there should be a commensurate reduction for interest foregone. As I understand it, the Price Waterhouse letters do not recommend either way; they simply set out the facts for the Department's consideration. The Department considered those facts, as well as its own investigation of them, and then made the decision. </PARA>

Even in retrospect, we were justified in doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have already said that, even in reviewing this two years on, had the information that was available to me then been presented to me, I would have authorised the payment. Once a payment is authorised, be it by myself, as it sometimes might have been in other circumstances, or by a senior officer and the Assistant Secretary in this circumstance, one would expect that the right name would be put on the cheque. In this case a wrong name was put on the cheque. But, on the basis of the advice I have received, I do not believe that this in any way diminishes the Commonwealth's legal position. As I said, I am seeking an opinion to have that confirmed, but that is what I am advised by the Department. </PARA>

<PARA> My concern is still the legality of the payment. Senator Richardson has accepted already that, within the strict letter of the law, the payment was unlawful because it was within the wrong financial year and outside the terms under which it was authorised by the agreement. We now have the situation where the cheque was not only paid outside the terms of the agreement in terms of the date but the cheque was also paid to a company that could not give an acquittal of the Commonwealth's potential obligations to pay to the correct company at a subsequent date. In effect, the payment did nothing to relieve the Commonwealth's future obligations. Senator Spindler would agree that that is a cause for grave concern about recovery actions. We now have the second basis on which this payment is unlawful. The first basis is that it was made outside the terms of the agreement and was early. </PARA>

The agreement is headed `Wet Tropical Rainforests of North-East Australia Nominated World Heritage Area-Rainforest Conservation Structural Adjustment Package', from which I assume that the payment is a part of the $75m structural adjustment package for the wet tropical rainforest area. The payments are authorised under clause 2(1) and (2) to be for assistance to the mill. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 5(1) the subsidy is to be used to continue the operations of the mill and a number of other things. Senator Boswell draws to my attention that the cover sheet of the agreement is marked `In relation to the provision of financial assistance to re-equip the company's mill at Ravenshoe'. Will the Minister accept that, by the payment going to the wrong company in Kyogle, the money was not applied within the ambit of the agreement and was not applied or paid by the Commonwealth within the terms of the agreement to assist the company to which it was due? Can the Minister give an indication of the seriousness of making a payment of almost $1m which, quite clearly from the date the cheque was written, was never going to serve the purposes for which it was intended. </PARA>

If what Senator O'Chee is saying were correct in respect of what was done with the money, it could well amount to a very serious breach of the agreement-not by the Commonwealth but by the company. That is something we may find out later. Senator O'Chee may be right about there being a breach, but not by the Commonwealth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a long way away. A lot of companies that operate in north Queensland or rural parts of Australia come out of Sydney, so that is not too unusual. Senator O'Chee has missed quite a few points. I did not say, nor do I accept, that in any way the payment was unlawful. I have already said that, had I been consulted about the making of this payment on the basis of what has been presented to me, I would have said yes, because I would have been very concerned to keep the mill going. That was the undertaking that the Government had made to the people of Ravenshoe. To deny the money, if that were to cause the closure, would have been the most serious breach of that undertaking possible, and I would never have countenanced that. I do not believe that the payment was unlawful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have at no stage said that the making of the cheque out to Timbertech in any way prejudices whatever legal position the Commonwealth might have because of what I would refer to as the purposes. It was not the purposes of the agreement that I referred to; it was the purposes set out in the letter for making a payment which was made in the context of the agreement and made early. </PARA>
<PARA> In that letter, as I said, a whole list of circumstances is set out where the cash flow problems are explained. They were examined by Price Waterhouse and they were also examined by the Department. I am not sure how good a lawyer Senator O'Chee is-although I am getting an impression-but I would have thought that any reading of the letter signed by Mr Macdonald would suggest that if a payment is made to Mr Macdonald on the basis of the claims that he has stated in the letter, then he would have to stick to them. Of course, he was a principal of quite a number of the companies in the complex web that I referred to earlier. I think that lawyers with a little more clout than the honourable senator accept that view. Nonetheless, that view cannot and will not be decided in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all-because Senator Richardson mentioned this in a very honest way-I should make it clear that Fergus Macdonald, who the Minister referred to, is absolutely no relation of mine. In fact, I have never met the gentleman, but I have heard quite a bit about him from the people of Ravenshoe. My concern in this matter has always been not only the loss of Commonwealth money but the fact that that money should have gone to Ravenshoe, been spent in Ravenshoe and been used by Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd at Ravenshoe to pay the creditors of Ravenshoe who extended credit to the mill because they believed that the Government was financing the mill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems from information that has been tabled in this Senate that the money did not go to that company and did not go to Ravenshoe; it is being suggested that it went to New South Wales and has been used there. In that way I am very concerned that the Commonwealth has not properly overseen large amounts of taxpayers' money given for a particular purpose which have been used for other purposes. That has caused enormous hardship in the town of Ravenshoe. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been raised for over a year now. On 16 October Senator Richardson indicated that, at last, the Government thought there might have been something a little smelly about it, and the Minister was referring the matter to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). That was on 16 October, which is almost seven months ago. Since that time we have been trying to find out what has been happening. In the Estimates Committee hearing on 19 April I asked what was happening and I got no response. On 10 April Senator O'Chee asked the same question. I remind Senator Richardson of his answer at that time. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that some recommendations on this matter will be going to the Attorney-General within a matter of days. I can assure . . . the Senate that we will endeavour to make the information public at the earliest possible opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>Questions have been asked since, but we just do not get any answers. I put a question on notice on 7 March which was answered on 9 April in which I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>When is it likely that the Senate will be advised of the results of the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer came back in writing:</PARA>
<PARA>I will keep the Senate advised of progress on this matter, as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>At that time I also asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What avenues are available to Senators to monitor the action which is being taken by the Government in relation to the approximately $7m of government funds which appears not to have been used for the purposes for which it was allocated. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that question came back:</PARA>
<PARA>Normal Parliamentary avenues. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what normal parliamentary avenues are. If I keep asking the Minister what is happening, how are the investigations going and when is it likely that something is to be done, and I cannot get an answer, what are the parliamentary procedures that I can take?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, you will be aware, as Senator Richardson will be aware, that I am currently pursuing a motion before the Senate asking that this whole matter be referred to an inquiry by a committee of the Senate. While he was answering a question from one of my colleagues yesterday, in response to my interjection Senator Richardson indicated that he would have no hesitation about an inquiry proceeding. I interjected on Senator Richardson saying that probably we should have a royal commission into this matter, and I think Senator Richardson said, `I would have nothing to hide; it would not worry me', or something like that.</PARA>
<PARA> My questions to Senator Richardson are these: when can we find out what is happening with this money? If the Minister will not give me an answer, what are the normal parliamentary avenues that I can pursue to get an answer? Would he confirm his comment to me in response to my interjection yesterday that he would have no objection to a standing committee of the Senate-probably the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts-looking at all aspects of what has happened in Ravenshoe? Aspects such as what has happened to employment opportunities in the town; what has happened to the social fabric of that society; what has happened to the mill; and what has happened to the money-where has it gone, who got it and what should have happened to it. I wonder whether Senator Richardson would be kind enough to give me an indication of his feelings on those three particular matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of things clear first. When I was answering a question from Senator O'Chee earlier I talked about questions over the past seven months on this matter and I went on to elaborate on various matters; I was not referring to the cheque, I was referring to the circumstances of the mill, its closure and how the money was spent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Turning to the questions of Senator Macdonald, I have to operate within the constraints that the Attorney-General's Department has given me. That has been a complicated and difficult matter. As honourable senators would be aware, a receiver has been appointed. I do not believe it has been very easy for the Department to collate the kind of information necessary for it to make its decision promptly. My understanding is that opinion has been sought from senior counsel on a number of matters, but I am not able to go into that. Whatever action is to take place, I am strongly advised by the Attorney-General's Department that I am not at this point able to comment because it might prejudice our legal position. So I cannot do it, much as it would make my life much easier at this time if I could, and I shall decline to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of what Senator Macdonald wishes to do for the people in Ravenshoe, the Government is still negotiating with three potential purchasers of the mill for a further injection of Commonwealth funds in an attempt to keep the mill going. Obviously, I also would not want to do anything that would prejudice that. Those discussions are continuing. I am hopeful that they will result in a decision which keeps the mill going. That ought to be everyone's aim in the exercise. That is why all the Commonwealth money was spent in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> As to Senator Macdonald's question about an inquiry and what it might do, I did say yesterday that in so far as I was personally concerned I had no problem with such an inquiry, and I had nothing to hide on the matter. Given that I have just revealed everything that I know about the matter, I think that honourable senators now know as much as I do and I believe that I have nothing to fear personally from the tabling of the documents or the discussion this morning. Whether the Senate wishes to pursue such an inquiry would be entirely up to it. Of course, if legal action is taken it will be difficult for the Senate to proceed with an inquiry if it affects those court actions. We have arguments about that in here, so I am not prepared to comment on who prevails in these circumstances. That is something we will sort out later. </PARA>
<PARA> My view would be that absolutely everything that has happened in this saga will be in the public arena over the course of the next 12 months. If any inquiry is to take place, not just into this matter but into Ravenshoe more generally, because the honourable senator just widened the terms of reference somewhat in his question, I would have thought it far better to wait until that information is properly put into the public arena without prejudicing the Commonwealth's legal position and, when the information is out, the Senate can make any choice that it likes. We will all still be here and those opposite can obviously do it then. </PARA>
<PARA> I would advise that, in advance of any action being taken, there will always be the possibility that it could prejudice the Senate inquiry and the Commonwealth's legal position. In any event, I am not sure what documents the Attorney-General's Department would be prepared to make available at this stage. That is something the honourable senator will have to sort out with his colleagues. I would advise that, because there is an inevitability about all of this becoming public, there is probably a better place for it to come out than here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have already explained, the departmental officers who examined this question-and that goes beyond the person who authorised the payment-took the view that the payment was being made in the context of the agreement; that there was a clear Government policy to keep the mill open; and that if the payment was not made the danger was that the mill would close immediately. That is the position they took and they made the payment accordingly. I do not believe that that is unlawful, given that the Commonwealth was obligated under the agreement to make the payments in any event.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It does change the dates because obviously it must do that if it is given in advance. Giving an advance payment on an agreement is not normal but it is also not rare.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as I am able to, I actually did answer the question but I will do it again so that the honourable senator will understand. The view was taken by the Department that the payment to be made was within the ambit of the agreement. Given that the Department had responsibility for administering the agreement, which is the normal course of events, I do not believe that the officers at the time thought that they needed any other specific authorisation to take the action which they did. They believed that because it was within the ambit of the agreement they could continue on with their administration of it. Whether they made the $1m payment in July or January, it was still going to be within the ambit of the agreement. If an officer in the Department starts on that basis, he is of the view that he does not need any further or specific authorisation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are going around in a circle here. I have answered this question, in so far as I am able to, several times. I am not sure there is much point in going over it, but I will say it one more time just so that we understand. The Department received a letter on Timbertech letterhead which referred to a payment due to Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd. That letter contains information as to what was wrong at the company and a request that a payment be made early.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that the letter refers to a payment due to Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd and the circumstances of the mill at Ravenshoe, according to the company as set out in that letter, I am advised that the view of the Department's legal officers is that the Commonwealth's position is not prejudiced by the cheque having been made out to Timbertech. Senator O'Chee is obviously of a different opinion. I cannot help the fact that he has got a different opinion, but that is it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator O'Chee must remember that after that letter, prior to a payment being made, the Department examined the request, as did Price Waterhouse. It seems to me from a reading of these letters that the Department has followed the suggestions of Price Waterhouse, with one exception, that being that the Department reduce the amount from $1,062,000 to $968,000; and Price Waterhouse thought that the Department should obtain a deed of release from the company for that reduction as a full discharge of the obligation. The Department did not consider that to be necessary. Beyond that the Department would appear to have followed the thrust of what Price Waterhouse had to say. </PARA>
<PARA> On that basis the payment was advanced. When one has an agreement, especially an agreement with a company about the Commonwealth giving money-and it must be remembered here that the Commonwealth agreed to give money, and that part of it was loan, part of it was a gift-it will always be possible that money can be used for purposes that one did not have in mind at the time. It is fortunate for the whole debate that we are having on the Commonwealth's legal position, in any event, that a late decision was made to give part of the money as loans and not all as gifts. It is that fact that enabled the Commonwealth still to be able to protect its position and perhaps, depending on advice, take further action. One wonders how much could have been taken at all if there had been simply a gift. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one problem that I have of a procedural nature, Mr Chairman, which relates to whether or not appropriations are made against which issues such as this can be raised properly in Estimates committees. I draw your attention to section 3 of the explanatory notes for this Department, page 34, at the top of the page in division 135, where under the heading `Administrative departmental running costs' there is an allocation of $255,000 not allocated to program. As I sense the burden of your remarks, Mr Chairman, it would suggest to us that, because these are not program-specific, we are denied the opportunity of discussing an expenditure of $250,000 because it happens to be non-program-specific. I submit to you in your consideration of this matter-because obviously you were intending to consider the position and perhaps felt that it was inappropriate for this debate to have proceeded or for the matter even to have been raised at Senate Estimates-that, where one has an amount that is not allocated to a program, it raises an opportunity for a general expenditure to be discussed in the sense that presumably, because it cannot be made program-specific, it ranges across matters which may well include issues of this nature. If, for example, there were a wage rise or something of that order, it seems to me that it would relate to anything in the Department.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Michael Baume asked a question yesterday which I undertook to answer before the end of the proceedings. With your indulgence, Mr Chairman, I seek to do so now. Yesterday Senator Baume asked questions about the purchase of Australia II in 1984. The response is as follows: on 4 November 1984, the Chairman of the Council of the Mus- eum of Australia, Mr Alex Dix, announced that the Commonwealth had agreed to buy Australia II for the Museum of Australia. On 4 February 1985, an agreement was signed between the Mus- eum and The America's Cup Defence 1987 Ltd under which Australia II was sold to the museum for $2m to be paid in four instalments over the period to mid-1987 when the boat was to be delivered to the museum. The Department files show that all Council members agreed to the purchase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also have a reply to a question asked by Senator Crichton-Browne. I will struggle with this one, but I will do my best. The Department sought the Attorney-General's opinion because section 67 of the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act provides for imprisonment for wrongful disclosure of athletes' names. The Department wanted to know whether this had implications for parliamentary committees. The Attorney-General's opinion in summary is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . officials of the Agency could not be required to divulge that information to a Committee. Moreover, if such a Committee is empowered to require the production of documents or the answering of questions it is prohibited from requiring an official to divulge that information to it.</PARA>
<PARA>On the advice of the Privacy Commissioner, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act restricts release of names to the athlete concerned, to the national sporting organisation and to the Australian Sports Commission where Commonwealth funds are involved. At the time the Bill for the Act was debated, Senator Crichton-Browne sought an amendment to allow the release of names to Parliament, and that amendment was defeated. The Government supports the need to protect privacy and therefore believes there is no need to amend the Act at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should say at the outset that my amendment was a declaratory amendment. It did not seek to vary the Bill. It was simply restating a fundamental principle, and that is that under section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act there is an obligation upon witnesses to provide information so requested of them by a committee of the Parliament, and immunity from prosecution is provided to witnesses for giving evidence which may be claimed under any other circumstance to be a criminal offence. The claim that would be put would be this: if the head of the Minister's Department provided evidence that under section 67 it was a criminal offence, it would be a defence and an immunity from prosecution under section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. Therefore, the secrecy provisions do not prevail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Presumably, if Mr Tony Blunn came before the Committee and refused to give evidence to us, he would be refusing on the basis that he would be breaching section 67 and therefore committing a criminal offence. Section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act provides a defence. Under section 16, it is not a criminal offence. Therefore, there is no defence for not giving the evidence. I find it a remarkable proposition put to us by the Solicitor-General, who I notice in his opinion says that it `probably' would not be an offence for Mr Blunn to give evidence. If it is not an offence, the secrecy provisions do not prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> My declaratory amendment was simply to reinforce the fact that section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act prevails with respect to the hundreds of clauses and the hundreds of Bills that contain secrecy provisions. I continue to argue, as do most sensible people, that no offence is being committed by any witness giving evidence before a committee of the Parliament. That is why I find the opinion of the Solicitor-General remarkable, particularly when he uses the word `probably'. </PARA>
<PARA> With your indulgence, Mr Chairman, I wish to table a response that I received from the Clerk with respect to this matter in which he puts a view which sits comfortably with my own, and that is that section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act prevails. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> The opinion concedes that, because of section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, a person `probably' could not be punished for giving evidence to a Parliamentary committee contrary to the secrecy provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the very point I am making. For instance, if Mr Blunn cannot be punished, therefore the secrecy provisions do not prevail because he is covered by immunity under section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. I find it a remarkable situation that we find ourselves in when the Solicitor-General is suggesting that they cannot give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not wishing for any unreasonable disclosure, but I find this remarkable when we have an Australian Sports Drug Agency set up under an Act of Parliament to give it both discretion and autonomy so that it is not subject to any influence from any other body and is able to test athletes in Australia. At the end of the day-to give a very bad example-if it found that eight of the Canberra Raiders had been using banned substances, eight players would be missing from the team the next time it played and their absence would continue to be a great mystery to everybody, because under the secrecy provisions nobody would be allowed to know that the eight players tested positive. We would have to assume that they had all come down with some terrible disease at the same time, which I find an absolutely bizarre situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the secrecy concerns in this matter. However, one of the deterrents, as Ben Johnson will tell anybody, of testing positive to a banned substance is the public humiliation that goes with being found to be a cheat. In my view, at the end of the day that is a greater sanction than any other penalty, not the least being of a pecuniary nature. There is a great deal of persuasion to be had, with respect, in having a disclosure of that nature. I also find it bizarre that, as I understand the current ruling, where an athlete is tested and is found negative that cannot be disclosed. Unless I am wrong, it is not possible for the agency to disclose that Mal Meninga has been tested and found negative. Surely there is some virtue in demonstrating that the athletes are clean and that the Australian Sports Drug Agency is doing its job. I seek leave to table the opinion from the Clerk. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

First, the Government is looking at an amendment to cover the last point raised by Senator Crichton-Browne, that of disclosing the names of those who do not test positive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was seeking to table both opinions. I was listening carefully when Senator Richardson said, `Think about that'.

I suppose there is no reason why they should not go beyond this place, because they are public knowledge and the public is entitled to know about what is going on, and nothing has been corrected. Can I expect an answer from the Minister as to when all honourable senators will be advised that there has been a check on this answer, and when they will be advised of any mistakes, just as the Department has advised how much has been spent by each office to date?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> (12.04 p.m.) I think the most appropriate way of rectifying the record is by this discussion we have just had. It will obviously appear on the record that the corrections have been made with respect to Senator Panizza and Mr Bruce Lloyd, whose overtime expenditure has been reduced from $84,000 to $54,000 for the financial year in question. By placing that on the record in this discussion, honourable senators and members will be advised of the corrections in the way that they received the first supply of information.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that answer but I believe that that is not a satisfactory way to go about it. It is satisfactory to me, because my bill will be sorted out. I want it to be sorted out for the previous two years to find out whether the bill for those previous two years is correct. I did ask the Department about that by telephone and I have not heard back from it. I did get a letter but there was no hint of an apology. I take it that that will settle my case, but it still leaves other senators and members up in the air as to whether theirs is correct or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now move on to telephone costs. I think I asked the Department to check that my electorate telephone costs were correct. I presume-and no doubt the Minister will tell me-that this is the figure only for the electorate office, not for the private home. I would like a comment on that. What led me to believe that the telephone costs may have been wrong was when I ran through everyone's bills to see how my office was averaging and whether mine was above or below those of other members and senators. I looked at the bill for my old friend and colleague Senator P.A. Walsh and found that he had $42 against his electorate telephone for the year 1.7.89 to 30.6.90. Either he has been very inactive or something could be wrong there. Bearing that figure in mind, could I have an indication as to how accurate the telephone bills are?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that the telephone accounts are accurate. In respect of Senator Walsh, it should be remembered that no-one is trying to suggest that he was out of contact with people. For most of that period, he was a Minister. It is probably a fair assumption to make that his telephone bill would have been paid by his then Department, the Department of Finance.

<PARA> I now come to a personal telephone account which gives an example of what I am on about. In some cases accounts from some exchanges, certainly the main ones around Australia-and Senator Patterson raised this privately-show the details of telephone calls on the back. I would like to know whether these detailed accounts go to the Department. I have nothing against detailed phone accounts. I can see the Minister is smiling because he is worried about who I may be ringing. If the details of all our phone calls go to the Department, I believe that that is not right. As I have said, I believe in having detailed accounts so that when a senator is running an office, whether it be an electorate office or a private office, that senator can keep an eye on how things are going and can use the accounts to allocate costs of calls to certain items. That is useful in private business. In the case of electorate business, I find it rather disconcerting that the Department is getting a list of all the numbers that I ring. There are no worries about that when it comes to my private office. I tell the Minister that I will sit down as long as he understands the question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have got the question. I addressed this issue some time ago when the supply of those full accounts was going to be made available by Telecom. We have decided to ask Telecom not to provide the Department with any details of phone accounts of members of Parliament. The issues that Senator Panizza raised were important. Of course, he would not want anyone using the freedom of information provisions to obtain details of the telephone accounts of some of our colleagues. So we have decided that itemised accounts should not be made available. In the past, there was a practice whereby details of trunk calls were provided to the Department, but the request now is that, in the interests of privacy, no details of phone calls of members of parliament should be made available to the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a general comment about the large number of questions on notice that we have before us. I also have a particular question relating to some matters that I put on notice, the answers to which have now been supplied. It was very clear in Estimates Committee D that the Minister adopted a very restrictive approach to the sorts of questions which could be answered on the Additional Estimates. That caused quite a deal of debate in the Committee and, in the end, a large number of questions which, in my view, could have been dealt with in a very expeditious manner were referred to the Department on notice. There are some problems associated with that. One is that we did not get answers that could have been quickly followed up at the time. Perhaps matters of apparent concern to members of the Committee could have been dealt with in a very quick manner. But that was not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to you, Mr Chairman, that in a number of other committees-in particular, Estimates Committee A-a very wide range of questions were permitted during the Additional Estimates hearings. For example, I recall that in Committee A Senator Schacht and Senator Coates were allowed by the President of the Senate to put a very wide range of questions to the Clerk of the Senate. I noticed that the Clerk did not worry about that and neither did the President or the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Childs, and I think that is fine. But I put it to you that if those rules apply to Labor senators in particular committees it is quite intolerable for coalition senators to find when they go to their committees that the responsible Minister has decided that there will be a very restrictive interpretation of which questions may be asked. </PARA>
<PARA> This caused particular problems because in this Committee there was a desire to get through the material as quickly as possible, and there were general agreements to that effect. I cannot speak for my colleagues, but in future when we are faced with the Additional Estimates I shall be very loath to make any general agreements with anyone about cutting down the time in which hearings are to take place, when those views and that cooperative spirit are in no way reciprocated by the Minister at the table. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask you, Mr Chairman, to look very closely at the situation where Senator Bolkus in Estimates Committee D took an exceedingly restrictive approach to the questions which were able to be asked, whereas Senator Childs in his Committee took a very open and, in my view, very appropriate approach to the questions which were able to be asked. I think it is important that some ruling be made or some view be given. As I said, I find it extraordinary that Labor senators were able to range far and wide over a wide range of topics with not a hint of protest, while Liberal and National Party senators on the Committee of which I was a member were constantly prevented from asking questions by the Minister at the table. That is the general comment I wanted to make and I hope the Minister will take it on board. I hope that you, Mr Chairman, in your role will also take those comments on board. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to those comments, I think it is fair to say that we do not suffer from an overdose of consistency in Parliament. In the Estimates Committee I took the view that we were talking about Additional Estimates and that is where the questioning should have been directed. Senator Kemp makes the point that other senators in other committees were allowed to stray far and wide from that. In another part of this Committee I had to raise points of order against questions asked by the Chairperson because I felt that they were not going to the Additional Estimates. I understand the problem Senator Kemp would have had in trying to ask questions from his side when I was trying to keep the Committee on course in terms of the Standing Orders. I was heartened to hear Senator Kemp refer to Estimates Committee A and Senator Schacht and Senator Walsh asking questions. In respect of Senator Schacht asking questions, our colleague Senator Bishop stated:</PARA></TALK.START>

Although I am called Chairman of Committees, I do not have any authority in relation to Estimates committees. The word `Committees' refers to the various committees that are formed in this chamber. As the honourable senator probably realises, I do go round and look at how some of the committees are operating, which makes my job a bit more meaningful when the matter is considered in the Committee of the Whole. I do know a little of what happened in Estimates Committee A, but I am not sure of what happened in Estimates Committee D as I do not know that I got there at the relevant time. I hope that Estimates committee chairmen will make sure that any debate is on the actual estimates before them-in this case the Additional Estimates, or in the Budget Estimates-because it makes my job a little difficult if I find out in the Committee of the Whole that debate has ranged over matters which are not relevant to the Additional Estimates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I thank you for your helpful comments. Senator Bolkus missed the general thrust of what I was saying. I was saying that there was a difference between the approach taken at the particular committees. He quoted an extract from Hansard  and Senator Bishop, but he did not actually read the Chairman's ruling. The Chairman's ruling, if I recall it correctly, was that in some general way there should be an attempt to relate the matters to a particular item. It was a very general ruling, and was not a bad one. I think that, as a follow-up, it was decided that virtually anything was to do with the salary appropriation; hence a very wide range of questioning was allowed to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think it is a bad thing to have rules-I am disposed to a position where matters should be debated widely, nonetheless, I accept the need for rules-but the point is that, in Estimates Committee A, Labor senators were given a very wide range of chances to pose questions. I make it quite clear that I was not opposed to that. It has to be said that the Minister's colleagues who adopted that approach were a very weighty group. Our very distinguished President was the Minister responsible, Senator Childs was the Chairman of the Committee and the Clerk of the Senate was being questioned. It was a very distinguished group of people. I would have thought that, if the precedent is established that a wide range of questions can be asked, it should apply to all committees. Senator Bolkus mentioned that Senator Bishop raised a point of order. In my view, it was quite appropriate for Senator Bishop to do so. I think that a very general ruling was given to that point of order. But if the Minister continues to read the Hansard, I think he will find that the ruling did not inhibit in any way the wide range of questioning which took place. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a matter relating to a question on notice. The Minister provided me with some figures on the number of staff and consultants employed by Ministers. I appreciate the Minister providing such comprehensive figures. I wish to put a couple of questions to him. The figures that he has provided show there has been a very sharp expansion in expenditure on staff employed by Ministers since 1982. The figures show that in 1982 the total amount expended for ministerial staff was $4.5m; whereas in the current year it is forecast to reach $15.4m. Can the Minister tell me what amount is forecast to be expended this year on consultants as well as staff?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp made a point about increasing staff numbers. Since taking office in March 1983, the Government has increased the Opposition staff resources by 53 per cent-from 43 to 66 staff-compared with the staff allocated to the previous Opposition by the then Government. The Government in the same period has increased its own staff resources by 55 per cent-from 204 to 316 staff-which includes ministerial consultants. Given the changes in public administration over that time and the reorganisation of the public sector, that is quite an appropriate increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be noted that in the same period the average salary mix of the Opposition has also improved substantially. In 1983, it was 60 per cent of average Government staff salaries; it now stands at something like 78 per cent. So there has been an enhancement in the range of salaries. In fact, as a result of the changes in the last eight years and the level of salaries paid, the Opposition can now get better staff. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it should be noted that in August last year the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) requested an increase of 30 positions, with an enriched salary mixture to rectify what he claimed was an imbalance between Government and Opposition staffing numbers. We agreed to an additional eight positions, maintaining the relativity with Government staff increases since 1983. It is important to keep that in mind by way of background. One should also keep in mind the fact that there is a major difference between being in government and being in opposition. In government one has to administer departments as well as participate in the parliamentary and other processes that opposition demands. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kemp asked specifically about overall salary payments consultants for this financial year. We only have an estimation of $1.6m for this financial year for consultants. I will get that checked and provide any more definite figure for Senator Kemp, if that is available. </PARA>

<PARA> The Minister quoted some figures and comparisons in relation to the staff employed by Opposition leaders and noted the trends over the last seven or eight years. Just to be clear, I ask whether the Minister could indicate the total increase in the number of additional ministerial staff that the Government has put on since 1982-I think he may have quoted this figure-and whether the people employed in the two media units that the Government has established are included in that figure. </PARA>

The figure I gave to the Senate was an increase from 204 staff to 316 which, as I said, was an increase of 55 per cent over that period compared to 53 per cent in Opposition staffing increases. I also made the point that the salary mix was increased quite substantially from 60 per cent of average Government staff salaries to about 78 per cent. I am advised that within those figures we have included the actual media advisers to Ministers and media advisers to the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not have the precise figures on that, but my understanding is that there has not been an increase in the number of staff in government media units over that time. In fact, there may have been a decrease in the numbers, though it might be marginal. But we will also get that figure checked out for Senator Kemp.</PARA></TALK.START>

If one adds on the 100 or so additional positions which the Minister quoted have been supplied to the Government since 1982 for ministerial staff and compares that with the extra eight or nine positions provided for the Opposition, one can see that he has again been particularly generous to the Government. If one compares the three part time consultants with the 30-odd consultants who are also employed on the ministerial staff by the Government, I again suggest that the Minister has been extremely generous to the Government over this period.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an answer to those points. One would expect in a place such as this that one would make assessments on the basis of evidence and information. For Senator Kemp to ask questions, to go through this process, to get information showing that the numbers of Opposition staff have increased almost at the same level as Government staff but that their salaries have increased with something like a 20 per cent enhancement over what they were in 1983, and then to make those claims about the Government being generous to itself-political cheap shots-does not really help the level of debate in this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I want to mention the thirtieth anniversary of the formation of Amnesty International. In May 1961, when Amnesty was formed, the world was a very different place. The Berlin Wall had not yet been built; the first manned spaceship had circled the earth a month before; Marilyn Monroe was still alive; Castro proclaimed Cuba a socialist nation and abolished elections; racial violence was particularly ugly in the south of the United States of America; Sir Robert Menzies was the Prime Minister of Australia; and the general attitude to human rights and especially to the treatment of prisoners of conscience was that torture and summary execution were really quite appalling but, if they happened in another country, there was really nothing that one could do about it short of war. One had no right and certainly no power to interfere in the internal affairs of another country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then Peter Benenson, a British lawyer, read a newspaper article about two young men who were gaoled for toasting freedom in a public place and he decided to try to do something to help political prisoners. His newspaper appeal, `The Forgotten Prisoners', was published worldwide on 28 May 1961 and brought in more than 1,000 offers of support for the idea of an international campaign to protect human rights. Within 12 months the new organisation had sent delegations to four countries to make representations on behalf of prisoners and had taken up 210 cases. Amnesty International members had organised national bodies in seven countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The principles of strict impartiality and independence were established. The emphasis was on the international protection of human rights. Amnesty International members were to act on cases worldwide and not become involved in cases in their own countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The movement of Amnesty International in Australia began as a result of two broadcasts on Australian radio of the British Wilfred Thomas Show in 1961. The first, on 3 August, told of the formation of an organisation, called Appeal for Amnesty 1961, in Britain by Peter Benenson. Wilfred Thomas explained that its proposed worldwide campaign was to publicise cases of men and women in all countries who were imprisoned for their political and religious beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA> On 24 August, Wilfred Thomas interviewed Peter Benenson. He urged listeners to write to Peter in London. Fifty-five Australians responded immediately, asking what they could do to help. By the end of 1961 some 100 members of Amnesty International Australia had written to about a dozen prisoners of conscience around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1961 Amnesty International has adopted or investigated more than 42,000 cases. Each case may involve one individual or many. Of these cases, over 38,000 are now closed. At the end of November 1990, Amnesty International was working on more than 3,000 cases, involving more than 4,500 individuals from countries worldwide. Indeed, 1,296 cases were closed in the first 11 months of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International has a lot to be proud of. Two-thirds of Australian parliamentarians are members of the Group. We have members of all political parties and Independents, and the Group's patrons are the leaders of all federal political parties. In the company of thousands of people around the world, I am proud to say that I hold a position of significant power and influence: I am a member of Amnesty International. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to talk about the problems being experienced by the Disabled Workers Union in Western Australia. A lot is said about the rights of disabled workers under the Disability Services Act of the Hawke Labor Government, yet a situation has arisen where their most effective voice in Western Australia is now under grave threat. This Government and the Department of Community Services and Health are standing by while the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia serves an ambit log of claims upon the providers of sheltered employment in Western Australia. In effect, this large federal union is seeking to represent the hundreds of handicapped workers, most of them intellectually disabled, for whom the Disabled Workers Union has provided since 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am talking about is a small, specialist union that has fulfilled a need when, for 26 years, major industrial unions could not be induced to take an interest in the disabled workers. This is a union unique to Western Australia, with 2,400 members paying $5 a year in fees. Whenever I have visited sheltered employment facilities in my State it has been quite clear what an effective job the Disabled Workers Union has done. It really is a fine example to the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the wish of the union membership, the award does not contain any wage clause. This reflects the fact that many employees work less than 38 hours. The value of allowances has been reached by mutual agreement. The allegations made against some sheltered workshops during the course of the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs into employment of the disabled as to inadequate remuneration and poor conditions certainly do not apply in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Led by Gloria Cassidy as secretary, this union has displayed a practical approach, appreciating the mix of pay and conditions that its members need and that the institutions can afford to pay them. Members of the union are increasingly tired of having their chosen mode of employment denigrated as repetitious or institutional. It is very sad that there are people who, without knowledge of the way in which sheltered workshops operate, simply say that we must push disabled workers out into open employment, that doing the same job two or three times in a day is demeaning, when it is those workers who choose to do the same job. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have an ambit log of claims running to 12 pages from a big union with a new-found concern for the disabled. Allowing for the nonsense of ambit claims in our industrial system-a tradition that does Australia no good-I have a real concern that the Miscellaneous Workers Union will adopt a confrontationist approach that will ultimately destroy the sheltered employment facilities upon which disabled workers will continue to depend. </PARA>
<PARA> The log of claims starts with a demand for a weekly wage rate of $1,000 with extra allowances of $100 which are scattered around like confetti. The hours are not to exceed 30 per week. There is to be treble overtime; eight weeks annual leave; 100 paid days of sick leave each year; half an hour's washing time before an hour's lunch break; first class air fares for the whole family after three months work; and free board and lodging. </PARA>
<PARA> Among many other things, the number of days off that one can get under this ambit log of claims is just remarkable. Across Australia, there are approximately 250 working days in a year. This log of claims contains an allowance for 40 days annual leave, which is eight weeks annual leave; an additional eight public holidays, somewhere along the line, to those which everyone else gets in this country; and 100 days sick leave. I quote from the log of claims:</PARA>
<PARA>Employees who are unable to attend work for reasons of illness or accident shall be entitled to 100 days paid sick leave per year. Unused sick leave shall accumulate from year to year and shall be paid out on death or termination or at any time beforehand at the employee's request. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty attractive way to pick up an extra 100 days. The log of claims is seeking an entitlement to 10 days bereavement leave per year, 50 days compassionate leave per year and 50 days of special--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the supporters of militant unionism will say that this log of claims is not to be taken seriously, it does, nonetheless, represent an extension of the kinds of demands that hamper and wreck conventional businesses in less sensitive areas. I repeat that at a time when disabled people would have little chance of gaining jobs in open employment, with unemployment in Western Australia soaring over the 11 per cent mark, the last thing they need is aggressive union coverage that threatens the viability of the institutions that employ them. Disabled workers with families and mortgages know this only too well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many disabled workers and their families in the community who are becoming increasingly concerned about being pushed out into open employment with the possibility of the de-funding of sheltered workshops hanging over their head. They know that able-bodied people simply cannot get jobs these days. How on earth can the disabled compete with able-bodied people in an ever decreasing employment market?</PARA>
<PARA> I fear very much that it would suit this Government nicely to see the Disabled Workers Union eliminated as a voice for the disabled. In standing up for the rights and wishes of its members, it has forthrightly defended the continued funding of sheltered workshops and activity therapy centres, which have fallen out of favour with the predominant ethos of the Disability Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA> At no stage am I trying to indicate that everything is wrong with the Disability Services Act; that is not so. But I am trying to show that there is a grave danger of disabled people being put on the scrap-heap, and that is surely not a desirable objective. The Act is too often administered in a spirit of knowing what is best for the disabled and stigmatising those who bring forward inconvenient facts as to the continued need for sheltered employment as the best means of ensuring meaning and dignity in the lives of disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA> I think people have probably forgotten the old saying, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. If we have a situation where disabled people are gainfully employed and where they and their families are happy and the service providers are happy, why do we have to change it? Why do we have to say, `Take all of those people out of there and try to find a job for them', when, as I say, other people cannot find jobs at the moment?</PARA>
<PARA> The Department also wants special advocacy groups to enter sheltered workshops and in effect take over this role from the Disabled Workers Union. Threats are even made that the $43,000 in Federal funding for salaries in the union will be withdrawn because it has committed the mortal sin of supposed lack of cooperation with the objectives of the Disability Services Act. All that the union is trying to do is serve its members in the best possible way. I thought that was the objective of the union movement-and this very small union is doing that very well. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, on 28 November, Mrs Cassidy received an angry letter from the Department because she had publicly opposed generic union membership for the disabled. I think it is very sad that such is the authoritarianism of the Disability Services Act. Such accusations by the Department have gained an Orwellian significance whenever the disabled and their parents are faced with de-funding of essential sheltered employment. This is of great concern to the parents, many of whom are very old. They are very concerned that they will not be around to look after their sons or daughters. They are also looking down the gun-barrel at their children losing their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also an ideological preference for normalising-if one can call it that-the employment of the disabled through conventional union coverage without thought as to whether those unions will act in the real interests of intellectually disabled people. There is no thought by these social engineers or by this Government of encouraging specialist unions similar to the Disabled Workers Union in other States where there may be real problems with sheltered workshops. Instead, Gloria Cassidy and her team are regarded as an inconvenient anomaly that should be quietly eliminated so that the Miscellaneous Workers Union can add to its empire and the disabled can be told what their rights should be, irrespective of the practicalities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very sad state of affairs when a big powerful union can send a log of claims to the providers of sheltered employment and tell them to respond within seven days or else. Now this matter has to go to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to be sorted out. Really, it is a case of unscrambling the egg. Why do we now have to go through this lengthy process when the Disabled Workers Union is already doing the job in the best interests of the disabled?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise an issue of importance that will have a major economic bearing on the future of this nation, not only in the near foreseeable future but also well into the future. I refer to the issue to be addressed today by the Cabinet relating to the mining of Coronation Hill in the Northern Territory. It is an issue that has attracted wide attention throughout Australia in recent months, if not years, from politicians, from judges, from Aboriginal leaders and even from Anglican bishops. I will comment on that a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In raising this issue of major concern, I want to highlight a letter, dated 29 May 1991, written by the Deputy Chief Minister and the Minister for Mines and Energy in the Northern Territory, the Hon. Barry Coulter, to the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). It is so important that I would like to read it into the record:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA> I have considered the report to the Minister under section 10 (4) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act (the Heritage Act) on the Kakadu Conservation Zone. In my opinion the whole report is seriously flawed. With respect to His Honour the report is plainly wrong in many respects especially those concerning Northern Territory and Commonwealth law. In view of recent media reports that Cabinet is to consider the issue of Coronation Hill tomorrow I consider it appropriate that I place on the record the Northern Territory Government's concerns about the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The first fundamental issue that the report fails to address is the role of the Commonwealth legislation. The second reading speech of the Heritage Act made it clear that the Act was one of last resort. No action can happen in the Conservation Zone unless the Commonwealth initiates it. Even if some action was proposed the person carrying out the activity in the zone would then be faced with the processes under Northern Territory law for the protection of sites. There is no role for the Commonwealth under this Act until these procedures under the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act have been exhausted. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue is the finding in the report that the Northern Territory law is in some way inadequate because sites are not protected by strict liability. Unless you wish to drastically reverse some of the basic principles of criminal law this finding cannot bear scrutiny. The Northern Territory law is also criticised because it allows an elected Minister some decision making power and because registration of a site is only prima facie evidence that it is a site for the purposes of prosecution. You will note that the Northern Territory law is practically identical to the Commonwealth law in respect of the discretion of the Minister in section 10 (1) and the effect of a declaration in section 24 (1). </PARA>
<PARA> The third fundamental flaw is the finding that the Minister may still make a declaration no matter how remote a threat of injury. Despite acceptance of the Minister's initial determination that there was currently no immediate threat of injury or desecration, His Honour appears to report that because there is a real chance or possibility of activity in the area there is currently a threat of injury or desecration. The definition used by His Honour bears no relationship to the circumstances of this matter and cannot be logically sustained. My earlier comments about the role of the Commonwealth Act also apply in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> A further flaw is the finding that Northern Territory legislation can allow desecration of a site. The Constitutional position of the Northern Territory, its power to make laws in this area, section 73 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Act, and section 35 of the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act clearly demonstrate that this conclusion cannot be correct. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of these flaws any reliance upon the conclusions of the report would be dangerous unless, when read with the evidence and submissions, those conclusions are clearly correct on the face of the material. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>Barry Coulter</PARA>
<PARA>The issues that have been raised by Mr Coulter are crucial to the decisions that must be addressed by Federal Cabinet tonight. A misinterpretation of the role of the Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, an incorrect finding by Mr Justice Stewart that the Commonwealth Minister could make a protection order over Coronation Hill, an incorrect finding that the Northern Territory Act could allow the desecration of a site, and the incorrect criticisms by Mr Justice Stewart of the Northern Territory Act, are important issues. They are fundamental and they are crucial. If Federal Cabinet does not take them seriously and if the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy does not pass them on as part of the decision-making process this evening, all Australians will be seriously disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the beginning of my speech that a number of comments have been made by politicians. I accept that that letter from Mr Coulter to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is an exchange between politicians. It is also interesting to note the criticisms that have been levelled at judges, particularly Mr Justice Stewart, with regard to the report of the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC). There has been widespread criticism of that report in recent weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> This must also be read alongside the fact that it is well known that within the Resource Assessment Commission there is wide disenchantment with the Chairman, Mr Justice Stewart. This comes about because of his very inflexible and very legal way of running the RAC. He has obviously had trouble recruiting and attracting people to work in that organisation. It is well known that he hates Canberra and has a particular dislike of bureaucrats. Because of these fundamental flaws, perhaps in his own leadership of the Resource Assessment Commission, we need to be very cautious when looking at the final outcome of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The third group of people who I said were important in this decision-making process are the Aboriginal people. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you have often pointed out in this chamber with regard to the Coronation Hill debate, it is well known that there is controversy in respect of the Aboriginal custodians of the site. This controversy has been alluded to by Mr Justice Stewart in his report. It has been alluded to by many spokesmen for Jawoyn Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and the wider Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another politician for a moment and refer to some of my own statements. I have always maintained that it is wrong to assume that Aboriginal culture is incapable of evolving and of accommodating the social consequences of change. We have seen many successful mines in the Northern Territory in the context of Aboriginal people. The ones that stand out and which are well-known are the bauxite mines at Gove, the manganese mines on Groote Eylandt and the uranium mine at Ranger within the Kakadu National Park. In all of these instances, the Aboriginal owners and people vitally connected with these projects have successfully reconciled mining with the various aspects of their spirituality. Moreover, mining has brought them a sense of financial independence which is so vital to maintaining the dignity of an individual and a community. </PARA>
<PARA> We must look to the future. We must not cocoon Aboriginal people in the nineteenth century. They must not be subject to the patterns of behaviour and expectations put forward by some wild and woolly-minded people, particularly anthropologists. I was very interested to note that in one of the submissions made to the Resource Assessment Commission and Mr Justice Stewart some very good sense was put forward by one anthropologist, Dr Ron Brunton. In his submission, Dr Brunton said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . cultures are not . . . houses of cards . . . People and their cultures adapt to changing circumstances; they select, they reinterpret, they innovate. They cope with challenges, and they are usually stronger for having done so. There are many potential growing points in an Aboriginal culture . . . Whatever decision is taken regarding Coronation Hill, there will be impacts on Aboriginal religious beliefs, and not just among the Jawoyn . . . A decision to prohibit mining in order to protect Bula would probably strengthen the hands of traditionalists and provide an added impetus for greens to forge strategic alliances with their `totemic people': traditional Aborigines. A decision to allow mining is likely to encourage those of a more open and modernising bent, those who seek to accommodate the cultural and social development of their communities to contemporary circumstances. This accommodation may take many forms: it does not imply the `loss of culture', or Jawoyn-ness, or Aboriginality. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a most important point to bear in mind in terms of all the discussions that are currently being pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> The final group that I identified includes an Anglican bishop, the Rt Rev. Clyde Wood, the Bishop of the Diocese of the Northern Territory. Earlier this week, Bishop Wood was quoted in the Australian newspaper as warning that mining royalties can lead to alcoholism and acute social dysfunction in Aboriginal communities. I will quite readily accept the authority and the position of Bishop Wood as a Christian when it comes to matters of biblical exegesis or matters of my Christian faith. But when it comes to matters of politics-seeking to add fuel to a controversial political issue, such as the mining of Coronation Hill, and to influence the Government's decision-I will take issue with the bishop. I will thoroughly disagree with him and I will say that he is wrong. The tragedy of alcoholism, kava abuse, petrol sniffing and the use of analgesics-and the violent consequences and medical complications that this produces-is endemic in far too many communities. But to link these issues to mining royalties, which, after all, are an independent source of income to many Aborigines, defies normal logic. </PARA>
<PARA> From my experience in northern Australia, I could give the bishop many more examples of the same social and domestic problems existing in communities where the income sources are not mining related. In fact, I hold a very strong view that welfare dependency and the lack of work opportunities are the major factors contributing to many of these social issues in Aboriginal society today. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that in the past the Anglican Church played a very important missionary role at communities such as Oenpelli and Groote Eylandt in the Northern Territory. But I would turn the bishop's attention to what happened even under missionary control, when grog was then available in those communities, and to the consequences of that before mining royalties flowed to many of his flock and Aboriginal constituencies. I would have hoped that the bishop, because of his very extensive pastoral knowledge and activities throughout the Northern Territory, would have looked more widely and compassionately at this issue and not sought to get involved in a grubby political debate. </PARA>
<PARA> However grubby that debate might be in this place, the matter is for us as politicians to resolve because we are charged with the political responsibility of making the important economic decisions for this country. The mining of Coronation Hill is an important factor in the future of this country. The fact that the Labor Government wants to hide behind Aboriginal spirituality and Aboriginal issues and deny thousands of Territorians and many more thousands of Australian citizens wide and proper economic benefits from an appropriate mine is something that must bear heavily on the Federal Cabinet when it considers these issues this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I direct my question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Is it not true that without the large 3.5 per cent increase in government spending, the March quarter national accounts would have shown negative growth? I also ask, given that the private sector has been subjected to this disastrous scorched earth policy, why did today's figures show that foreign debt grew by a further $3.3 billion in the March quarter to a record $133 billion?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short has asked a couple of questions which are somewhat unrelated, but I think they both flow from the figures released today and I understand what he is asking. The first question related to government spending. All I can say is that the question relates to total government spending and the figures indicate that Commonwealth spending has been very restrained. In terms of State government expenditure, the figures show that the State governments are continuing to spend significantly. As I understand it, there is no break-up of the figures for respective State governments, but in terms of a pattern of expenditure the spending comes from State governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Looking at the national accounts figures generally, I appreciate that Senator Short would ask me a question about government expenditure because in terms of net exports, inflation outlook and a range of other factors the national accounts figures, without being exciting, certainly show a trend which Government spokesmen have said is likely to be there at this time and show up later in the year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the question of profits, let me say first of all that profits are down to a figure which is, I think, 2 per cent below what was a record figure for corporate profits two years ago. I will give those precise figures. The profit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio was 14 per cent, down from a record high of 16.5 per cent in June 1989-something that those opposite never achieved in their whole period in government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Minister obviously had great trouble in dealing with that question the first time around. Let me ask again the first of my two questions which he failed completely to address. Is it not true that without the increase in government spending the March quarter national accounts would have shown negative growth? In the light of the Minister's attempted response to my questions I also ask: is it not a fact that when the national accounts figures are adjusted for the terms of trade-which is the correct way of looking at national accounts-they show a fall this quarter of a further one-half per cent, making five falls in the last six quarters?</PARA></TALK.START>

In so far as the contribution of government expenditure to GDP is concerned, let me say that GDP reflects the economy as a whole and it always has.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health. The Minister will be aware of an unfortunate dispute between an officer of the Department of Community Services and Health and the Human Rights Commission about the validity of the women's health program within the terms of the Sex Discrimination Act. As this legal action is, I am aware, essentially a private matter, can the Minister reassure Australian women of the Government's ongoing commitment to the Federal-State women's health policy and outline progress of its current implementation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3943" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not very familiar with the legal proceedings to which Senator Reynolds refers and, of course, I make no comment on those in particular. It is a fact that Australian women are responsible for a large proportion of the informal and formal health care provided in the Australian community. I know that Senator Reynolds has a particular interest in the progress of the Federal and State governments in dealing with the question of health services for women, particularly arising out of the National Agenda for Women which led to a commitment to develop a health strategy to deal with women's health policy matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am able to indicate several elements in that program which have been extremely helpful to women in the Australian community. For example, the women's community health services aim to improve women's health services through a strengthened primary health care network, as well as the access of disadvantaged women to health services. To be eligible for funding under the national women's health program, all such services must provide primary health care services at no cost to women and that network is being developed. In addition, a consumer information and education program which aims to develop a women's health information and education strategy, dealing in particular with the needs of disadvantaged women, is being put together. Of course, there is continuing education and training on women's health for health professionals.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate would also be interested to note that, in addition to the national women's health program, the Government has established a number of other services to meet the specific health needs of women. First, the rural women's health package, which is targeting women in rural areas who are particularly disadvantaged by their isolation, was announced by the Prime Minister in his rural statement on 1 December 1989. The rural package provides $438,000 over three years to frontier services in conjunction with the Royal Flying Doctor Service to develop a program to improve women's access to health services in western New South Wales, south-west Queensland and north-west Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Second, the alternative birthing service program assists the States to establish appropriate and safe midwife managed alternative birthing services for women who choose not to give birth in specialised hospital settings. Thirdly, there is the national program for the early detection of breast cancer. We know from many debates in this chamber about the premature deaths from the failure to detect breast cancer early enough. With $64m of Commonwealth funds set aside for a three-year budget for that program, it is anticipated that some 375 deaths a year will be averted which might have otherwise resulted from breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA> These are only three of many programs that I could mention which are specifically dealing with the health problems of women and with the responsibility of governments to ensure that the questions which are specific to women in regard to health policy are dealt with in a practical fashion, such as I have outlined, or as part of the women's health policy which has evolved from a consideration of matters raised by women themselves in consultations held under the National Agenda for Women.</PARA>

Given that a number of East Timorese soccer players have remained in Australia following the recent Arafura Games in Darwin, can the Minister please explain how many have sought asylum with Portuguese authorities or applied for Australian refugee status? Are the defections of concern to the Government in light of Australia's diplomatic relationship with Indonesia and Portugal's international court challenges over the Timor Gap?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously this is primarily an immigration matter. All I can say about those aspects, the subject of the brief in front of me, is as follows. An Indonesian soccer team from East Timor was participating in the Arafura festival in Darwin. Two members of this team travelled from Darwin to Canberra on 27 May where they made contact with the Portuguese Embassy. I understand that they were provided with Portuguese travel documents to allow them to travel to Portugal and they left Australia on 29 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two other members of the team are reported to have contacted the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in Darwin to lodge applications to remain in Australia as refugees. That is, of course, a matter for my colleague the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. I understand that any such applications would be dealt with on their merits through the established determination of refugee status procedures. The remaining members of the soccer team returned to Indonesia on 29 May.</PARA>
<PARA> I see no reason for these events to have any impact on Australia's bilateral relations with Indonesia. I note that the Indonesian charge d'affaires in his remarks to the media and during his call on my Department yesterday, 29 May, also made clear that the Indonesian Government does not want these events to harm the bilateral relationship.</PARA>
<PARA> Conditions in East Timor are obviously not perfect. We have made that clear often enough. Although the Embassy's assessment is that the human rights situation is now significantly better than during September-November 1990 when the Indonesian authorities were responding to what they perceived to be an increase in security problems, we continue to monitor very closely the human rights situation in East Timor. We continue to make representations to the Indonesian Government where there are credible grounds for concern. Our views on human rights are well known to the Indonesian Government and current events will be perceived in that light. As to the role played by Mr Snowdon in these matters, I have absolutely no idea but I am sure he behaved with his usual absolutely impeccable sense of responsibility.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is yes, they will. I announced to the Senate earlier this year that the Civil Aviation Authority board had moved to a two-centre air traffic control system which is proposed to be in place by the end of 1995. This system, which will include state of the art communications technology already proven overseas, is at this stage proposed to be located at both Brisbane and Melbourne. When it is established, for the first time in Australia the CAA will have in place a totally integrated air traffic services system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The CAA has announced that six international companies have been invited to submit registrations of interest for the project as prime contractors. Registration of interest in the two-centre project will seek bids from the companies on the costs and benefits of retaining geographically distributed terminal control units. I am aware, because representations have been made to me directly, of Australian industry's concerns over being given the opportunity to be involved in the two-centre proposal. I would point out that the CAA's original list of prime contractors was drawn up on the ability of these companies to provide a proven totally integrated system.</PARA>
<PARA> I might add-and I absolutely support the CAA's view on this-that the need to get this new system in place is urgent and necessary. We simply cannot afford to waste time because of the substantial period that will be necessary in research and development to get a new system up off the ground and this would include the difficulties with having an unproven technology at the end of that extended time.</PARA>
<PARA> The CAA's decision to provide for contractors who will provide proven air traffic control technology is a decision that I support entirely. Although clearly it is too early to speculate over the exact amount of potential Australian involvement in a project in its formative stage, the Civil Aviation Authority, in conjunction with the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, will be holding a workshop with Australian industry representatives next Wednesday to outline details of the two-centre project. This workshop will give Australian and New Zealand companies the opportunity to assess where they may be able to develop proposals to link in with the international companies which have been asked to provide expressions of interest. Australian industry has made a major contribution to the Australian aviation system in the past, and I have no doubt will continue to do so in the future.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that Mr Aliprandi has approached the New South Wales Supreme Court on a large number of occasions. Whether it is of the number that Senator McLean indicates in his question I do not know, but I certainly accept that, given his interest in these matters, that is an accurate indication of the difficulty that Mr Aliprandi has had in getting this matter resolved before a properly constituted court. Of course, I am aware of the Westpac letters and their contents, as I think all honourable senators are. But the broad thrust of Senator McLean's question deals with the problem of the cost of justice, the access to obtaining justice in our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Senate committee chaired by my friend and colleague Senator Barney Cooney which is looking into that matter is carrying out a large number of hearings on that very matter. It has received many submissions, including I have no doubt from Senator McLean, particularising the problem that customers and clients of banks and other financial institutions have when taking on the might of those institutions, bearing in mind the considerable resources available to those bodies, in engaging legal counsel and obtaining the best possible legal advice.</PARA>
<PARA> I must say though that the Government has not just stood aside awaiting the report from Senator Barney Cooney's committee in relation to persons getting access to justice in our community. We have been encouraging in many spheres the development of alternative dispute resolution processes-mediation and other processes. Particularly in the banking industry what has been a most notable achievement has been the way in which the Federal Government, through the then Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, and the banking industry and consumer groups came together to evolve what has become a most successful operation, namely that of the banking ombudsman, Mr Graham McDonald.</PARA>
<PARA> There, one has a method whereby those bank customers who are dissatisfied with a decision by the bank can get very speedy attention to their grievance. They can get a remedy from the Ombudsman, if he decides that a remedy is justified, of up to $100,000. If he makes a recommendation, the banks have agreed to be bound by his recommendation in that regard, and there are no costs in the service that the banking ombudsman provides. There we have a very clear instance of the evolution within our society of an alternative to the very costly legal system as a means of resolving disputes.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that already the ombudsman's office in its first year of operation has received over 2,000 written complaints, a further 8,000 telephone inquiries, and that over $1m has been paid out by the banks following recommendations by the banking ombudsman. There is also my announcement that a group proceedings process would be evolved over the next several months to enable persons, where they had a matter in common, to approach the Federal Court so that they could group together to lower the costs which otherwise would have to be paid by individuals approaching the court in relation to similar or related disputes. I do not see why that initiative should not be available to those who are alleging against those who provide banking or other financial services that that bank has, for example, engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct. Clearly, the group proceedings procedure would be available in that case in appropriate circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> As to legal aid itself, there will never be sufficient legal aid available to satisfy all those who wish, with the assistance of the community, to pursue their cases before the courts. Nevertheless, the Federal Government has provided well over $100m for that purpose this year throughout Australia, to be distributed by the legal aid commissions in all the States and Ter- ritories. I believe that this is a very substantial contribution by the taxpayers to assist their fellow Australians to have access to justice where the funds available to them are not sufficient. I believe that those scarce dollars are being put to very good use by the various legal aid commissions around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I understand the problem raised by Senator McLean using a particular case as an instance, but I believe that as a society we are attempting to provide alternatives to that very expensive resolution of conflicts before the courts in the traditional judicially supervised processes.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3947" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;President Bush announced last night, our time, an arms control initiative for the Middle East which in a very important way addresses conventional arms transfers and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and missile proliferation. Action on and commitment to arms control is an essential follow-up to the Gulf war. This initiative, which we regard as bold and imaginative, is a very important step in the extraordinarily difficult process of achieving peace for the Middle East and certainly has our strong support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The initiative envisages six broad elements coming together. The first is Iraq-specific measures, involving continuation of the current United Nations supervised destruction of Iraqi missiles and weapons of mass destruction, and the continuation of the UN embargo on arms transfers to Iraq. Secondly, as far as missiles are concerned, it involves the elimination of surface to surface missiles by the countries of the region with a first step of a freeze on acquisition, production and testing of missiles by regional states.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, in relation to chemical weapons, it involves the resolution of all major outstanding issues relating to the chemical weapons convention by the end of this year, early adoption of relevant chemical weapons convention provisions by regional states as confidence-building measures and a commitment to become original parties to the convention when it is concluded. In relation to biological weapons, it goes to the enhancement of the global biological weapons convention. In relation to nuclear matters, it involves a ban on production of all weapons using nuc- lear material in the region and reiteration of the call for International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards on all regional nuclear facilities. Finally, as far as supplier constraints are concerned, it goes to the coverage of conventional arms transfers, weapons of mass destruction and missiles as agreed to by the five major suppliers of arms to the region, who are in fact the permanent five members of the UN.</PARA>
<PARA> The initiative in its practical implementation will focus on the five permanent members of the UN Security Council-the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, France and China, as being the major suppliers of arms to the Middle East. It will also focus on the regional countries themselves. It should be said that Australia is already pursuing, through multilateral forums, many if not most of the particular elements of this initiative in our own arms control activity, a role that has been acknowledged widely, not least by the invitation to me to be a keynote speaker earlier this week at the Japanese-UN sponsored disarmament con- ference. We do have a role, and we are seen as having a particular role to play, in the development and negotiation of global multilateral measures, including the chemical weapons negotiations and also the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, the operation of the IAEA, and the biological weapons convention.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, while the US Middle East initiative that I have described is important in so far as it tackles the major area of concern about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons in that region, we should not lose sight of the same problems in other areas of the globe, including those of particular concern to Australia. The most obvious problem in that respect on the agenda at the moment is the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons in North Korea. Many of the elements in the Middle East initiative have an obvious application either world wide or in other specific regions. Australia, in cooperation with countries of the same view around the world, will continue to pursue our objective, which is a crucial one, of restraining the proliferation of missiles and weapons of mass destruction, and the excessive build-up of conventional arms.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to the recent statement by President Bush of his intention to recommend extension of most favoured nation (MFN) status to China. Does the Australian Government support such an extension?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3949" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;President Bush, in another very recent announcement in the past day or so, has indicated his clear intention to seek from Congress a renewal for one year of China's most favoured nation status. Under United States law, countries such as China which restrict emigration are ineligible for MFN status. However, under that same law, the US President has the authority-following the Jackson-Vanik amendment of 1974-subject to congressional agreement, to waive the application of this law on an annual basis if such a waiver is deemed to be in the national interest. In view of the difficulties in the US-China bilateral relationship going to the trade balance but, more importantly, the nonproliferation issues as well as concern about human rights, congressional debate on the renewal of MFN is expected to be very intense. Congress has until 1 September to respond to the President's recommendation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's position is one of support for the continuation of MFN status for China. We take that position in support of the UN Administration for a number of reasons. Non-renewal of that status could be expected to have a very serious adverse effect not only upon US-China bilateral relations but also very specifically upon Hong Kong, and through Hong Kong for the region generally. There could be a number of serious flow-on effects for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be appreciated that some 30 per cent of Hong Kong's trade is with China and a very substantial proportion of that goes on to the US. It is estimated that something like 30 to 40 per cent of Hong Kong's re-exported goods to the United States would disappear if this particular status were not renewed. That would be a body blow, unquestionably, to the Hong Kong economy, resulting in the unemployment of tens of thousands of people and a significant impact on the growth of that territory.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, while we are very keen to see China more responsive to international concern on missile proliferation and human rights issues, there is a concern about the method chosen to pursue these goals if it does involve major economic repercussions for the country. It needs to be appreciated that the biggest impact of the MFN status issue would be on the economy of southern China-the Shenzhen economic zone and areas of that kind-where economic reform has been greatest and where the political environment tends to be the most relaxed. The consequences that would follow from removal of MFN status would have major repercussions in this sense internally for China. Inclination towards policies of self- reliance would tend to turn it even more inwardly than is the case at the moment and would be, from the perspective of encouraging reform, a rather unhappy result.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, and finally, there is the consideration that MFN generally is, as President Bush said, not so much a special status or privilege as the ordinary basis for trade worldwide. At a time when we are trying to liberalise international trade and get restraints, conditions and barriers removed, that is another reason why the basic approach, we believe, should be to support the widespread application of MFN, not its selective removal. We hope that all those considerations will be taken into account by the US Congress in responding to the President's request.</PARA>

<PARA> In respect of the third question-whether the Treasurer is prepared to place banks under the Prices Surveillance Authority-the Government's view is that the Reserve Bank of Australia has all the powers that are necessary to adequately and prudentially supervise the banks. There has been some discussion in economic journals by former senior officers of the Reserve Bank on whether those powers were in the past, at certain points, adequately exercised in the sense that discussions took place between the Reserve Bank and the various banks. Whether those discussions were sufficiently in-depth is debated in the economic journals. In terms of the powers that are available to the Reserve Bank, we believe those powers are adequate in order to fulfil this function.</PARA>

In view of the Minister's answer, it would appear that the Reserve Bank is obviously not exercising its powers, since the Minister agrees with the propositions in questions one and two, yet the increasing margins exist to the detriment of the economy and borrowers.

That is not an appropriate question for powers of the Reserve Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In so far as I answered the first part of the question by saying there was some academic discussion on whether the Reserve Bank's prudential powers had always been exercised in a totally appropriate way in the past, there is discussion about that.

There is a slight lack of clarity in the note I had from Treasury in this respect yesterday which led me to be less clear than I should have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic situation is that Egypt's total debt to Australia is $760m, of which some $390m is subject to this debt forgiveness exercise. That $390m is, in turn, comprised of some $280m owed to the Commonwealth itself as a result of national interest insurance payments to the Australian Wheat Board (AWB).

<PARA> The second component of the $390m is $60m owed to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) as part of Austrade on its commercial account. Again, that is just a commercial liability to be borne by EFIC. The final component is $48m to the Australian Wheat Board, which represents the uninsured portion of sales to Egypt.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly endorse Senator Jones's call for plainer English to be used in insurance contracts. It is very important that policyholders have a form that they can easily comprehend and understand. I am sure that some sections of the insurance industry are using plain English forms. That is to be encouraged, and I hope that it is regarded as a model for other insurance companies to follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner is also promulgating new guidelines which will require greater disclosure by insurance companies of the actual terms into which a prospective policyholder would be entering. All relevant information has to be given in a comprehensible way, and I think that is to be encouraged too. But there is no doubt that the question of small print and the difficulty of understanding insurance contracts are only one part of the various complaints that are made about the life insurance and general insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, the setting up by the life and general insurance industries of processes whereby complaints can be readily dealt with in a fair way under the supervision of panels comprised of representatives of consumers and industry, and chaired by persons appointed by an industry council, will lead to many of the complaints that are presently left either unresolved, or resolved in the insurance company's favour in a way which is not satisfactory to the policyholder, being dealt with in a much better way.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the process will depend on conciliation, as much as anything else, but the panels will be empowered to make binding decisions in relation to the industry up to certain amounts. Their activities in resolving these complaints will be under the supervision of a council chaired by Mr Lionel Bowen, the former Deputy Prime Minister and Attorney-General of the Commonwealth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to you, Mr President. It refers to a letter from you and Mr Speaker, Mr McLeay, dated 24 May relating to the ruling in the case of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations and the Tobacco Institute of Australia. I note that that decision does not change the legal status of tobacco, and I note that you have said that on advice `we could be seen as negligent if we do not totally ban smoking in Parliament House' which, in effect, is treating tobacco smoking as illegal. By whom was the advice sought? By whom was the advice given? Would you please table that advice? Would you explain under what authority the Usher of the Black Rod is acting to enrol honourable senators in behavioural courses to quit smoking? Indeed, what part of the building is included in the term `totally ban'? Does it include members' private offices and the Executive wing? What are the proposed penalties for breaching your orders?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in Question Time, Senator Short asked me a question relating to government expenditure contributions to the aggregates of the March quarter national accounts. I indicated that, while government expenditure as a total is up, the largest contribution came from the State governments. I just want to give Senator Short the figures. As he knows, the total increase in government consumption expenditure was 3.5 per cent through the quarter. State and local government expenditure was up 5.6 per cent and Commonwealth expenditure was down 1.3 per cent on the last quarter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In so far as his interjection about real interest rates, let me say that, while we do not have the most favoured position in terms of real interest rates, the latest fall in real short term interest rates to 5.6 per cent is much more in line with the figures in other industrialised economies. For example, Germany has a real interest rate of 6.1 per cent; France, 5.8 per cent; United Kingdom, 5.2 per cent; Italy, 4.9 per cent; Japan, 3.5 per cent; Canada, 2.7 per cent; and the United States, 1.1 per cent. Those are figures from the Economist of 31 May. They compare with the figures which Senator Hill, I think, quoted from a previous edition of the Economist. Our real interest rates are about the middle of the range when compared to those countries.</PARA>
<PARA> With the trend lines revealed in inflation taken from the March quarter national accounts and declining interest rates, that position will improve. I will be happy to try to answer Senator Short's question next time the national accounts figures are published.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>With respect, I ask you, Mr President, to look again at the remarks of Senator Cook. Unfortunately, I do not have the Hansard with me but, if you examine the Hansard, you will see that Senator Cook was answering a question on industrial relations in the State of New South Wales. In the course of giving that answer, he made an aside about the views of Senator Knowles in relation to a goods and services tax. I do now see how, in answering Senator Childs's question about an industrial relations matter in New South Wales, an aside in relation to a goods and services tax, which is a totally different matter, and which attacks another honourable senator in relation to her alleged views on a goods and services tax, does not fall within standing order 193(3), which says that all personal reflections on senators, in effect, shall be considered highly disorderly. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that there is some cut and thrust-and again, unfortunately I do not have the Hansard with me-but you will see that Senator Knowles's only response was immediately to call Senator Cook a liar-in fact, she said he was a born liar. That led to your requiring her to withdraw. She was placed in a position where she either responded immediately across the chamber to him because of his words or she had to leap up to seek that you make a ruling that it be withdrawn. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Defence)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Today I announce Government decisions on a series of significant defence reforms. These mark a further major step in the continuing process of refining Australian defence policy since this Government set the broad strategic direction for Defence with the 1987 White Paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>2. Defence planning, by its nature, must be dynamic and evolve with changing strategic and economic circumstances. We face considerable strategic uncertainties as we enter the 1990s. We are not in Europe, where we might benefit directly from the decline in superpower confrontation. We have regionally-based defence needs, and they have not diminished. There are tensions and pressures which could impact on our security, and which require us to maintain our military capacity to protect Australian interests, or to contribute to regional efforts to resolve problems. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Effective defence depends on a high level of commitment by service personnel and the broad support of the nation. It also depends on national economic strength over the long term. Our long term security interests will be better served if planning for defence and our national economic development are in harmony. This includes having appropriate sectors of the nation's economy more attuned to the support of our defence effort. As we enter the 1990s, the central challenge before us is to organise our defence better, so that we can obtain the maximum combat capability in the most efficient and affordable way. </PARA>
<PARA>4. It is easy to draw up lists of what can be done to improve our defence capacity, if there are no resource limits. More demanding is the task of deciding what we can do less of, or to find better ways of doing things so that we can release resources for new projects and activities. In Defence, as in all areas of government, there is always a need to strive to make more effective use of resources. It is only through being more innovative and creative in its approach to resource management that Defence will be able to acquire more surface combatants, improve Australian Army mobility, and acquire airborne early warning and control aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>5. In the debate that follows about the force structure review, I am sure that we will hear reference to the recent Gulf war. There will be claims that the Gulf war proves that this or that equipment is obsolete, or that Australia must hurry to buy some specific piece of high technology-irrespective of our strategic circumstances or operating conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>6. I will not indulge in such speculation. It will take months of careful analysis by military specialists to reach considered conclusions about the practical military lessons of the Gulf war. Australian experts will participate in those studies, and we will examine the results carefully. We will not be distracted by the sensational claims of the instant experts, whose stridency is usually matched only by the shallowness of their knowledge of defence matters. Such so-called experts rarely acknowledge that Australia has no land borders with any country, and that distances in Australia's northern environment are mostly measured in hundreds or thousands of kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA>7. The only useful conclusions we might draw now about the Gulf war are broad strategic observations; that is, success in military undertakings is critically related to military professionalism backed by national will and economic strength. Saddam Hussein gambled on what he saw as the weakness of Western democracies-their pluralism, their commitment to human values and their distaste of conflict. He also grossly overestimated the military capacity and commitment of his own, largely conscript, armies. </PARA>
<PARA>8. There is an important lesson flowing from this. Militaristic and aggressive regimes run the risk of being met with concerted action, which will extend, if necessary, to military force. In particular, potential aggressors will need to be wary of the response of the United Nations and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>9. The Gulf war also highlights the central obligation to provide for national defence. Australia will continue to receive support from alliances, including access to advanced technology and intelligence, and emergency re-supply, but we must plan on carrying out our primary combat tasks ourselves. The Gulf war has not changed these fundamental assessments, nor should it drive our force structure decisions. Australia must continue to structure its Defence Force around the tasks likely to arise in its area of direct military interest, and must not revert to the old and discredited forward defence policies of the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA>10. This is not to neglect alliance and regional associations and cooperation with regional neighbours. They remain essential elements of Australia's overall defence approach. As the Gulf war showed, from a self-reliant Defence Force structured for the defence of this nation, Australia can make a contribution to operations further afield in support of friends and allies, and activities sanctioned by the United Nations. Today's decisions will ensure that Australia continues to have the capacity to contribute to wider global and regional security. </PARA>
<PARA>The Force Structure Review</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>11. The force structure review examined the current Defence Force structure and recommended adjustments up to the year 2000, taking account of strategic priorities and likely resources. It builds on 20 years of development towards defence self-reliance in Australia, applying the priorities set out in the Government's policy paper entitled The Defence of Australia 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>12. The force structure review adopted the following key principles:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Firstly, to maximise the combat capabilities of the Defence Force, by reducing the number of service personnel involved in headquarters and base support functions; and, by commercial and civilian support and maintenance where this is operationally feasible, practicable and cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Secondly, to meet the strategic focus on northern and western operations by extending western basing for the Royal Australian Navy and northern basing for further Army units, and by enhancing the forward deployment capacity of the Royal Australian Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Thirdly, to make greater use of reserves, including a new form of reserve service to supplement the existing reserve forces of each service, while maintaining the required overall force readiness levels. </PARA>
<PARA>13. It is important to ensure that there is enough flexibility in funding to undertake new initiatives in the latter part of this decade, when expenditure on current major projects such as the Anzac ships and Collins class submarines reduces. This is because in the first decade next century there will be heavy demands to replace obsolete equipment such as the guided missile destroyers, Fremantle class patrol boats, M113 tracked armoured fighting vehicles and F-111C aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>14. Within this framework, the review examined the capabilities which the Defence Force should possess as Australia moves into the twenty-first century. It found that current capabilities provide a generally adequate national defence capacity for the key roles identified in Government endorsed strategic guidance, although some should be given higher priority for enhancement. </PARA>
<PARA>15. There will be greater emphasis on the use of reserves. To give a new focus to the present reserves, an Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Reserves) will be appointed to advise the Chief of the Defence Force on ways to improve their effectiveness. This appointment will be held by a two-star Reserve officer. </PARA>
<PARA>16. Command, control and communications developments will emphasise joint operations, and we will be moving to collocate the joint force commanders as soon as practicable. Future communications projects will be directed away from costly, military specification programs to make more extensive use of the civil infrastructure and of commercially available equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>17. There will continue to be substantial investment in intelligence and surveillance, reflecting their high priority. An operational network of two over-the-horizon radars will be developed by the late 1990s. The need for a third radar will be reviewed then. By the mid-1990s, Defence Force operations will benefit from better integration of data from both military and civilian sources. </PARA>
<PARA>18. The P3C aircraft will be substantially upgraded to enhance their surface surveillance performance, and it is planned to introduce airborne early warning and control aircraft later in the decade, when more effective and affordable systems may be available. </PARA>
<PARA>19. The six Collins class submarines will be based in the west, but with one or two deployed continuously off the east coast. Defence will continue to monitor developments in air independent propulsion, but without commitment to fitting such systems. </PARA>
<PARA>20. A balance between aircraft, surface ships and submarines is needed to provide flexibility in maritime patrol and response. These are demanding tasks in the extensive ocean areas to our north and north-west. The present concept of three tiers of surface combatants will be replaced by a two-tier concept of destroyers or frigates and offshore patrol vessels. </PARA>
<PARA>21. By 2009, the number of major surface combatants will increase to 16, compared with the current 10. The new ships will be based on a modification of the Anzac frigate design, for delivery from 2006. The Fremantle class patrol boats will be replaced by 12 more-capable offshore patrol vessels, for delivery from 2004. Pending their introduction there will be a life extension for the Fremantles to maintain our patrol and intercept capabilities in the maritime approaches and fishing zone. </PARA>
<PARA>22. The increase in numbers of surface combatants will also improve the Defence Force's ability to protect shipping and offshore territories. There will be a change of direction for the mine counter-measures program: we will acquire larger coastal minehunters of proven design in place of the inshore minehunter program, which has not proved cost effective, and has performed poorly. The Government makes no apology for making the hard decision to end this program. Such decisions should be made as soon as it is clear that a new concept will not meet expectations, to limit further investment and to pursue more cost effective approaches. </PARA>
<PARA>23. The FA18 and F111C aircraft are central to the Defence Force's air defence and strategic strike capabilities. The fleets will be managed to extend their service life for a further 20 years. Completion of the chain of northern air bases this decade with the construction of RAAF Base Scherger, near Weipa, will enable the Defence Force to respond more effectively in the north. </PARA>
<PARA>24. We are developing an innovative scheme to provide a significant surge capability for the tactical fighter force and strike reconnaissance force. For the first time, former FA18 and F111C aircrew who have left permanent RAAF service may continue to fly them while on the reserve, thereby ensuring that their capability to bolster the permanent force is retained. </PARA>
<PARA>25. A number of changes will be made to the Army to enhance our ability to protect assets and to respond to incursions. Most importantly, Army will be restructured on the basis of independent brigades, better oriented to northern operations, with selected battalions having a higher level of tactical mobility through the permanent allocation of transport. A new infantry mobility vehicle will be acquired. We are negotiating with the United States for the reintroduction of four to six upgraded Chinook helicopters. </PARA>
<PARA>26. More Regular Army units will be based in the north. The Second Cavalry Regiment will move to Darwin in 1993. An armoured regiment with one regular tank squadron, and a composite aviation squadron will be deployed in Darwin by the mid-1990s, and an infantry battalion by the end of the decade. The regular tank squadron in Darwin will be able to be reinforced by the reserve tank squadron, which will remain at Puckapunyal. </PARA>
<PARA>27. The regular First Division headquarters in Brisbane will be restructured as a smaller, deployable joint force headquarters, while the reserve Second Division headquarters in Sydney will develop the skills and doctrine for conventional divisional operations. </PARA>
<PARA>28. The Regular Army of some 26,000 will continue to have a significant combat capability. There will be some 11,000 regular soldiers in that combat force, making up four regular infantry battalions, the Special Air Service Regiment, an armoured regiment with one regular tank squadron, a reconnaissance regiment, two aviation regiments and a balanced mix of combat and logistic support units. </PARA>
<PARA>29. The Army Reserve will maintain its present size of some 26,000 personnel, and the existing seven Army Reserve brigades will be retained. In addition, by 1996 a new form of more completely trained and equipped reserve will have replaced most regular combat and combat support units in south Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>30. Twenty per cent of the strength of the new reserve brigade will be regulars. The reserve commando regiment and three northern surveillance units will continue to have significant numbers of regulars. Other regular service personnel will be involved in training and support, including for the 14 remaining conventional reserve battalions and the many other units which make up the reserve contribution to the support of land operations. </PARA>
<PARA>31. The Defence Force will retain the capability to respond to requests for support from regional nations, and this capability will be improved when the training ship Jervis Bay is replaced later in the decade by a new ship with the dual role of helicopter support ship. </PARA>
<PARA>Training and Support</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>32. Training will be rationalised on a joint service basis. Consistent with the Government's policy of micro-economic reform, there will be significantly greater use of commercial support and civilian staff in technical training areas. Navy's technical trade training will be consolidated at HMAS Cerberus. Motor vehicle trade training will be consolidated at the Army centre at Bonegilla-Bandiana, and the RAAF base at Wagga will handle all Defence Force aviation-related trade training, and possibly combined clerical training. </PARA>
<PARA>33. Facilities will also be rationalised. HMAS Nirimba will be closed as part of the rationalisation of training. It is also planned to close HMAS Platypus with the phasing out of the Oberon class submarines later in the decade. The RAAF airfields at Laverton and Point Cook will be closed and sold. No. 6 RAAF Hospital may be retained at Laverton, and the possibility of moving RAAF Logistics Command there from central Melbourne will also be investigated. The airfield at Point Cook could be zoned for public recreation purposes, but Headquarters Training Command, the RAAF College and RAAF Museum will remain there. </PARA>
<PARA>34. Changes to Army structure and rationalisation of training, together with extensive commercial support of Air Force and Army maintenance and support functions, provide additional opportunities for substantial rationalisation of facilities and concentration at a smaller number of bases and depots. </PARA>
<PARA>35. Opportunities will continue to be taken to expand combined training with the New Zealand Defence Force where it is mutually beneficial to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>Implementation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>36. Since implementation of these proposals will incur some costs, particularly in early years when the defence program is under heavy pressure from commitments to major projects, it will be phased. In order to avoid overcommitment to unrealistic targets and expectations of savings which may not be met, only those estimated savings arising from functions which we are confident can be commercialised cost-effectively in the short term have been programmed. Similarly, no targets have been set for asset sales because of the difficulty in determining net proceeds. Funds from these activities will provide additional flexibility in the second half of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA>37. The personnel changes flowing from these Government decisions and internal defence efficiency measures will amount to almost 10,500 regular personnel-over 1,000 from Navy, 5,200 from Army, and 4,200 from Air Force-together with more than 3,800 defence civilians. More than 1,600 of these civilians will come from central elements of the Department, and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. DSTO will be given a more commercial orientation, so that it can make a larger contribution towards Australia's technology base. </PARA>
<PARA>38. In putting forward these proposals I am conscious that they will impact directly on the professional interests and career aspirations of staff at all levels. The changes will be managed to ensure that the needs of defence personnel, as the most important single resource, are recognised and given careful consideration, including appropriate consultation. Their high levels of skill and commitment are central to Australia's defence. </PARA>
<PARA>39. The changes will be introduced over a decade, and there will be no immediate or large-scale redundancies. However, to avoid distortions in rank and skill levels, some management initiated voluntary redundancies may be unavoidable. These will be kept to an absolute minimum. Many of the service personnel leaving the Defence Force in the future will find that their transition to civilian life will be eased by the greater availability of civilian jobs in areas where they have expertise. They will be able to continue their military careers on a part time basis through the new reserve scheme. The same scheme will provide opportunities for young people to have a year's full time training followed by a part time military career. </PARA>
<PARA>A New Form of Reserve Service</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>40. The Government has endorsed in principle this concept for a new form of reserve service, with implementation to begin next year. It will make greater use of former regular personnel and, in the case of Army, significant numbers of new recruits receiving about 12 months initial full time training. These personnel will allow appropriate parts of the Defence Force to operate at levels of operational readiness and cost below those for permanent elements, but higher than for the current reserves. They will significantly increase our capacity to deploy well trained personnel in shorter time scales than is practicable with the current reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>41. The new form of reserve service will form a part of, and build on, the existing reserve components in each service. While these personnel will primarily be recruited for the Army, they will also supplement permanent Navy and Air Force elements. The force structure review has planned initially for 3,200 in the Army and 450 each in the Navy and the Air Force, with possible future increases. As I said earlier, for the first time, we will be maintaining a reserve of significant numbers of former F111C and FA18 aircrew to provide a surge capability for those aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>42. The Government decided not to adopt Mr Wrigley's specific proposal for a `militia' in his report The Defence Force and the Community largely because Mr Wrigley's proposal did not meet the Government's readiness requirements. Mr Wrigley's proposal is a high risk strategy which depends on retaining large numbers of reserve personnel. Nevertheless, the defence concept for the new form of reserve service is consistent with his emphasis on greater use of former regulars and improved training and resources for reserves to broaden the overall defence base. </PARA>
<PARA>Expansion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>43. The new force structure, with its links to the wider community and the national infrastructure, will provide a better basis for expansion. I have directed that studies be undertaken to develop further defence planning for the remote contingency of substantial conflict. These studies will identify areas likely to cause difficulties during expansion, and identify action required to ensure that the Defence Force can meet any threats to the nation's interests. </PARA>
<PARA>The Wrigley Interdepartmental Committee</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>44. Mr Wrigley's proposals to open up defence support activities to competition, consistent with operational requirements, have been accepted by the Government. A substantial range of activities currently performed by service personnel can be carried out commercially or by Defence civilians, with no detriment to our defence posture and at lower cost. </PARA>
<PARA>45. There are many gains to be made. Reliance on the community will allow a more effective increase in the defence effort if needed. In some areas, such as communications, the civil infrastructure offers greater capabilities than Defence could provide on its own. Commercialisation and civilianisation will provide access to a wider range of skills. Importantly, commercialisation offers the prospect of substantial savings which can be redirected so as to improve the combat effectiveness of the Defence Force. A better level of understanding between Defence and the community should result. </PARA>
<PARA>46. Defence will start this program immediately, with progressive implementation across the decade. The central objective will be to transfer support activities to the civil sector where this is practicable and cost effective. Combat and combat-related activities within operational areas will not be commercialised nor, in general, will operational support functions. Rather, commercialisation will focus on areas such as catering, stores and transport, clerical support, non-military training, repair and maintenance, communications, health care and firefighting functions. </PARA>
<PARA>Defence Industry and Exports</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>47. The measures I have announced for a greater role for the private sector in Defence support functions represent a logical extension of previous Government initiatives for the Defence industry. </PARA>
<PARA>48. The Government has given practical effect to the White Paper objective of greater self-reliance. We have ensured that the major submarine and Anzac ship projects have Australian prime contractors and substantial industry programs which will last into the next century. Since the early 1980s, the Australian industry component of major equipment projects has risen substantially, with some $800m more being spent in Australia this year. </PARA>
<PARA>49. The challenge for Australian industry is to upgrade its ability to produce, support and maintain Defence equipment at competitive prices. Allowing much greater involvement by private industry in Defence support activities will ensure that the investments in industry capability we are making through our major new equipment strategies are properly utilised by Defence. </PARA>
<PARA>50. There has been considerable micro-economic reform in Defence already. The former government dockyards and Defence factories have been sold or corporatised, reducing their cost to the taxpayer by hundreds of millions of dollars. The process of reform is continuing. Aerospace Technologies of Australia has successfully restructured its business. The Government recently endorsed the company's five-year corporate plan as the basis for its future development. The board of Australian Defence Industries Ltd has recently announced a proposal to restructure and rationalise its activities, aimed at realising further efficiency gains, while meeting the requirements of the Defence Force into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA>51. I now turn to the matter of controls on the export of defence and defence-related goods. Australia's policy of defence self-reliance requires the involvement of Australian industry in the support and maintenance of the Defence Force. The Government remains strongly of the view that defence exports should be encouraged. The export efforts of defence-related industries will continue to receive active Government support. Australia is a substantial net importer of defence goods and services, and we should continue to support an increase in the level of exports from this sector of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA>52. As I undertook earlier this year, the guidelines on defence exports have been reviewed. This review was prompted in part by concerns about the practical utility of some aspects of the policy guidelines for defence exports. Ministers have now agreed to a number of changes to policy which have produced both a simplification and a tightening of the procedures for the consideration of defence exports. </PARA>
<PARA>53. Firstly, applications to export defence and defence-related equipment to sensitive destinations will be referred to the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Exports. Under previous arrangements, only lethal or destructive goods, or those determined to be of major military significance, were subject to the interdepartmental process. Internal procedures relating to the identification of sensitive destinations have also been streamlined. </PARA>
<PARA>54. Secondly, existing foreign policy criteria for considering applications have been strengthened in order to ensure that important strategic, external policy and human rights considerations are not prejudiced. The Committee, in making its recommendations to me, will take into account not only the political and military situation and policies of the country for which a particular export is intended but also the situation in the general region for which the goods are destined. </PARA>
<PARA>55. Thirdly, the guideline relating to goods of `major military significance' has been amended. Previously, such goods were so defined by reference only to their significance for Australia's defence. Now there will also be taken into account the significance of such goods for a country in the region of proposed export. </PARA>
<PARA>56. I must also emphasise that the significant majority of Australia's defence exports are non-lethal, and our major export markets do not give rise to any concerns on strategic or foreign policy grounds. In recognition of these facts, the process for consideration of applications of this nature will be streamlined. Certain parts and accessories will be able to be exported without individual permits. Licences for such parts and accessories will be issued for export to approved non-sensitive destinations. Being able to export such goods under licence will be of considerable advantage to industry in that companies will be able to respond more promptly to client's requests. </PARA>
<PARA>57. The recent events in the Gulf have further emphasised the need to strengthen international arms control measures. Australia is an active participant in international arms control forums such as the Coordinating Committee on Exports of Technology to Communist Countries; the Coordination Committee for Multilateral Strategic Export Controls; the Missile Technology Control Regime; the Australia Group concerned with chemical and biological weapons; and the Nuclear Suppliers Group concerned with nuclear proliferation in efforts to finalise the negotiations on a chemical weapons convention. Australia is recognised as a responsible member of the international community. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>58. The plan that I have outlined today represents another major step in this Government's commitment to ensuring that Australian defence planning goes forward into the next century in a way that meets our national priorities and is consistent with our international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>59. In the mid-1980s, with a rapidly growing economy, we were able to sustain significant real increases in defence spending. This allowed us to increase investment in new capabilities and update equipment significantly, and to improve living and working conditions for service personnel and their families. </PARA>
<PARA>60. For the 1990s, much of the defence agenda is about greater efficiency and effectiveness. This statement shows that, without expectations of major growth in the Defence budget, the Government can adjust the force structure in a considered and timely fashion, to deliver an even more effective Defence Force, with appropriate capabilities to take us into the twenty-first century. Nothing in this statement precludes future Government changes of emphasis, should this become necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>61. These decisions shape the Defence Force to maximise its capacity to draw on national resources as a whole to meet credible military threats. They will provide a force capable of overcoming the long distances and isolation of Australia's environment. Our strategy is designed to capitalise on Australia's geographic advantages and ensure that any aggressor would face major obstacles in an attack on this nation. It also ensures that we can make a contribution to operations further afield and, when required, support friends, allies and activities sanctioned by the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>62. Most importantly, while we do not now face a military threat, these decisions ensure that the Defence Force will be able to respond quickly to any threat that does emerge, and will be able to do so with the full support of the Australian community and the backing of all our national resources. They constitute a long term program to restructure and improve the effectiveness of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to table some accompanying documents. They are the Force Structure Review and the report of the Interdepartmental Committee on the Wrigley Report entitled The Defence Force and the Community. I would also like to table the Defence Communications Corporate Plan, which was not referred to, but I thought we would put it on the table and, finally, a document on the ready reserve program 1991. I also indicate that an executive summary of the two other reports, that is, the Defence Regional Support Review and the Defence Logistics Redevelopment Project, has been circulated to honourable senators. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On such an important subject as defence, I am sorry to say that the statement we have just heard from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is disappointing and a cop-out in a number of important areas. The statement is based on a great number of reviews, committees, reports, and reports on reports accompanied by a great deal of hype which has emanated from ministerial officers preceding the delivery of the statement today. I did really expect that we would have had something of greater note and significance than the statement we have just heard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite all the work and attention that seems to have gone into this statement extending over many months, it is a seriously flawed statement in a number of respects. In the first place, perhaps the most serious criticism of all about this statement is the fact that it has not been based on any new up-to-date strategic assessment of Australia's situation in 1991, and that which we will face during this decade for which this statement and the Force Structure Review have been prepared. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been perfectly clear since the end of the Cold War that there has been a fundamental, major change in the strategic situation in which Australia is placed-indeed, in which the world is placed. This has had major implications for our own region. Then there was the Gulf war. There is instability in parts of our region which should be reassessed, and there have been new developments in arms acquisitions, transfer of technologies and so on. All of this has demanded a reassessment of the situation since the White Paper was prepared and delivered in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has been calling for this reassessment for many months now. The Minister has steadfastly refused to make such a reassessment and has fallen back time and time again on the White Paper, finetuned, he says, by some secret strategic assessments of the Government. But he has refused to table even a sanitised version of that finetuning-and that is all it amounts to. The Minister has refused to have any prior public debate on this question of the fundamental basis of the Force Structure Review, and of the exercise which he and the Department of Defence have undertaken and which is now announced in the statement. </PARA>
<PARA> In itself, this approach has meant that the statement today has not been based upon any up-to-date consideration of these fundamental matters. The Minister's attitude is even more surprising in view of the recently expressed attitudes of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). As recently as last Friday, the Prime Minister told an Asia-Australia Institute function:</PARA>
<PARA>The last five years have seen the most profound changes in global strategic circumstances in nearly half a century. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that this requires Australia to reassess our strategic relationship with Asia. On 24 February this year, Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, said:</PARA>
<PARA>There can be absolutely no doubt that the easing of superpower competition has had great effect in our own Asia-Pacific region; nor can there be doubt that new approaches to security now opening up have direct application in the region. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, this whole exercise has been going on, as I said, with committees, reviews and so forth, by the Defence Department and the Ministers-the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) has been much engaged in this-without the creation of any fundamental base which should be governing the direction of all of this work. On that ground alone, it is no wonder that there are serious flaws in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason why this statement is so flawed is the simple fact that it has been driven simply by budgetary considerations. Again, this is a matter which the Opposition has emphasised time and time again over many years, particularly in defence debates in this chamber. This is not some new-found concern by the Opposition; it is something that has been reiterated over and over again. I have heard my colleagues Senator Newman and Senator MacGibbon in many defence debates, long before I became the shadow Minister for defence, emphasising this fact. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear, from the record of the defence budget since the 1987 White Paper, that it has fallen well behind the financial requirements of the policy contained in the White Paper. We have this absurd situation where the Government has adopted the White Paper of 1987 and its force structure proposals, but has never been prepared to match its own acceptance with the financial requirements. As I said, it has been pointed out by the Opposition time and time again that this could not go on, and that there is a growing tension between the defence commitments that the Government has undertaken and the reality of the financial shortfall in the budgets year by year. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Force Structure Review is a complete acknowledgment of that major failing on the part of the Government in relation to Defence. Paragraph 3.5 on page 39 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The funding of major White Paper initiatives has reduced the amount of discretionary expenditure available to Defence in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA>I might say that this short term is a matter of some years. The paragraph continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This commitment to major capital programs has also reduced much of the flexibility in Defence planning which enabled competing resource demands to be balanced. The short term problem is thus to develop a strategy to overcome these resource pressures over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what this is all about. This is not a strategy for Australian defence over the next decade; it is a strategy, as this Force Structure Review report admits, to overcome the resource pressures over the next few years. That is a sorry indictment of this Government and, I regret to say, of the Ministers who have this responsibility, although it is much wider than the Ministers themselves because in the end it is the Government's responsibility to determine how much money it will give to Defence. I do not want to imply that responsibility is simply limited to the Ministers concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a Government failure and, from this Force Structure Review, it will clearly be a Government failure in the years to come because the projections of this Force Structure Review would have to have been based on whether there will be no growth in expenditure, whether there will be a minus one per cent growth or maybe-maybe-a growth of one per cent. Over the last few years since the White Paper, the Government has not met a one per cent growth on average. </PARA>
<PARA> With the economic failures of this Government and the economic circumstances of the present day and age which will continue, unfortunately, for the next few years until the Opposition gets into government and turns it around, one can see no prospect for more resources being made available to Defence than have been available before. In fact, the probabilities are that under this Government there will be less. That is the second reason why this statement is fatally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason for the flawed nature of this statement is the way in which the Government has gone about the savings which it clearly has to make in order to meet its capital equipment program and to also retain some semblance of Defence effort. We in the Opposition have been supporting the idea of saving money in the ways that Mr Wrigley pointed out in his report, which has also provided an opportunity for the Government because a major analysis was made by Mr Wrigley of ways in which savings could be made in Defence. The Government has, to its credit and to this extent, looked at that and sought to make some savings in that direction. But I am bound to say that the efforts of the Government to achieve savings by contracting out Defence support functions, by replacing more expensive service personnel by employment of civilians in this area and by cutting down and using better management practices so that there could be a reduction overall in manning in the Defence Department, have been somewhat half-hearted and somewhat ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA> The fatal flaw in this cost savings measure is that it has been directed towards and has fallen most harshly upon the regular combat areas of our defence forces. This combat area has taken the brunt of the cuts. I notice that we had a new euphemism by the Minister in his speech-cuts are personnel changes. That is what cuts are. The largest single cutting has been into the regular combat forces, particularly in the Army but also very significantly in the Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has supported the Government in the opportunities for savings and in the way it saw that this could be done. The Government has taken these opportunities up to some extent, and we support what the Government has done to the extent it has, although I think it has been insufficient and a half-hearted effort. Nevertheless, the Government has seen its way to making its largest cuts in the totally wrong way, namely, cuts to the combat forces, and particularly vicious cuts in the Army, because its regular combat strength has been reduced from six battalions to two battalions. </PARA>
<PARA> A further weakness of this statement is its attempt to replace that clear weakening of our defence forces by the creation of a new Ready Reserve force, which is a new idea. No-one knows whether it will work. My colleague Senator Newman will have much more to say about that matter, so I will not deal with it further. But this is another clear weakness in that the Government has been prepared to exchange the certainty of our highly trained regular combat forces with something that could prove to be a pie in the sky. I hope it will not, but it is a risk. Nobody can doubt that it is a risk. </PARA>
<PARA> A final reason for this statement being so flawed is that the Government shows very little indication of the need to introduce a new management culture in the Defence Department generally. It indicates that there is no understanding of the need for management reforms, all of which were pointed out by the Opposition in our policy for the last election and which, of course, still stands. There are clearly a great many opportunities for management and particularly in the central areas of the Department. I note that the Minister is claiming that he is making cuts in numbers in what he calls the central elements of the Department. I do not know whether that is just at Russell Hill in Canberra or whether it is wider than that, but there is really no indication that there is to be any new management philosophy or structures adopted where further savings could be made. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a large number of matters dealt with in this very comprehensive statement. Although it is disappointing, nevertheless it certainly covers a great deal of ground. My colleagues in this debate, including Senator Newman, will no doubt deal with certain other aspects of it. There are some matters about the statement which the Opposition supports such as our support throughout this process for the approach of savings through civilianisation and contracting out. The Government has had our support all through on this. It must have been expected that the Government would make better use of that bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will move further units to the north and there will be development of facilities there. It has reaffirmed its commitment to the two-ocean Navy with the building up of facilities at HMAS Stirling at Cockburn Sound, near Fremantle, and the decision to base all the new submarines there. These are matters that the Opposition supports. The collocation of the force structure command clearly is a sensible step, as is tri-service training. I am pleased to see that the Government has taken up the Opposition's strong recommendation that the ill-fated mine countermeasures be abandoned, and it now proposes to purchase some suitable coastal mine hunters, which it should have done a long time ago. I am also pleased to note that that can be done within a budget of no real growth. I do not know whether it can be done if there are cuts, and probably it will not be, but at least the Government is announcing this as a measure of some certainty. </PARA>
<PARA> This is unlike a number of the other equipment proposals, which in this statement only amount to a wish list. We have had a major force structure review and all the hype associated with it, but when we come to look for hard commitments as to what the Government proposes to do on the purchase of equipment-some of which will become necessary, as the Force Structure Review admits, in this decade but which certainly will become necessary in the early years of the next century-this document is very short on any commitments at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the major requirement of an airborne early warning and control capacity is left very much in limbo as to whether that can be managed at all within the life of this structure, which goes through for this whole decade. The review and ministerial statement are very ambivalent as to what the Government intends to do about that vital matter, as indeed is the statement on capital. It talks about what can be achieved with no real growth, with very limited measures indeed, and it says that it will require higher funding, if it can get it. Examples of high priority projects are helicopters for the Anzac frigates, reconnaissance and trooplift helicopters for the army and airborne early warning and control. Those very important matters are left entirely up to some later decisions, and this can only amount to a wish list in terms of this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to defence industry, I am pleased to see that the Government has repeated its review of its policy on export defence equipment and has reiterated its support for that policy. I think that this has been very much driven by the Opposition's initiatives in this area. From what I have seen of the statement, I am not by any means satisfied that the changes overall will be beneficial to assist more exports of defence equipment. I will have to reserve my judgment and comments about them until I study the new guidelines, but as they have been described in the statement it seems that further additional new problems may arise for exporters if they are having to negotiate some of the new provisions in the guidelines which have just been announced by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, therefore, the Opposition finds little to commend in this statement. As I have said, the Opposition is disappointed on the whole by the statement. We certainly hope that the Government will be able to find greater savings and thereby direct the defence dollar to those areas where it is most required, namely, in the combat strength of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement that we have heard today from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) could fairly be called the Robert Ray memorial lecture. I use this description because Senator Ray was handed a poisoned chalice from his predecessor, Mr Beazley. The problems that Senator Ray now faces as Defence Minister would not have needed a solution if `Bomber Beazley' had not handed him the bomb and dived for cover. Mr Beazley was also sometimes known as `the general', and Professor Stuart Woodman only recently told an audience in Brisbane at the defence and media conference that `a politician wants to be the general and the general wants to be a politician'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Well, politician Beazley may well have been called the general, but he did not act like one. The duty of a general, apart from providing leadership, includes providing balanced judgment and direction for those under his command-the Australian Defence Force. Minister Beazley did just the opposite. He provided no balanced judgment, nor any lasting direction in his administration of his Department or in his administration of the Government's own White Paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Beazley has wrongly been described, in my view, as a good Defence Minister. I have never believed that to be true, and in fact the evidence is here before us today. He was obsessed with capital procurement to the exclusion of the realities of long term financial management and the impact of his shopping trips on the remainder of his budget, and the budgets of his successors. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the fact that the Minister has recognised and acknowledged the lack of flexibility in the defence budget over the next few years, because Defence's forward commitment to capital expenditure is currently at its highest level ever at approximately 80 per cent of the capital expenditure component of the budget. This, when taken together with the salaries component of the budget, means that 80 per cent of the entire defence budget is already allocated well into the future-and thereby the problems with flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Beazley's White Paper, as Senator Durack has already said, was prepared in different times, and there can hardly be any informed commentators left today who would believe that the strategic assessments on which the White Paper was based are still appropriate. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) only recently have acknowledged this. Yet, for some unaccountable reason, the Government apparently continues to rely on that same White Paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Not since the White Paper was produced in 1987 has the Labor Government provided the funds on which it was predicated and which were necessary to meet the tasks set out in the White Paper. Yet the capital procurement which was set in motion proceeded without apparent concern for the dislocation of the other priorities in that White Paper. Today we are debating a defence statement which, in essence, is an admission of the failure of the Labor Government to achieve its White Paper's objectives and, even worse, signals the inability to do so in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major priorities to be achieved for Australia, according to the White Paper, was a mine countermeasure capability. Yet after 15 years of the Mine Hunter Inshore having been accorded a high priority, we still today have little or no mine countermeasures capability. This is only one of the capabilities set out in the White Paper which we still lack. Others include, of course, the ability to maintain surveillance of our maritime and air approaches; the ability to rapidly deploy our forces by land, sea and air; and an amphibious capability for the Army. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet two years ago the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade made a number of recommendations about our mine countermeasures inadequacies, and today the Government has finally acknowledged the failure of the program. Not only is this serious for the defence of Australia but it is also a matter of great concern that nearly $109m has been wasted. I mention this because, to me, it is one of the more sizeable examples of poor management in the Department of Defence. The other examples are many and varied, and they have gone on for a very long time, ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> Only this week, when debating the Appropriation Bill, we heard several more examples of poor management by the Department. These included spending $350,000 recruiting engineers overseas before the necessary clearance had been given in Australia to allow the entry of those engineers into the country, and a trust fund of $100,000 which was given to the Department of Defence in 1983 and remained for four years without being invested, losing value each year: hardly good management of a trust fund bequeathed by a Polish Australian to be used in the interests of the defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On Tuesday Senator Ray and I debated the need for Defence to have good information systems so as to know how it is spending its money. Late last year, in a very important report, the Auditor-General revealed that it was almost impossible to get information on the cost of a soldier. He was not alone in having difficulty in getting financial information from the Department. Ever since I arrived at this place, I have had that difficulty, as have my predecessors. I recognise that the devolution of financial authority to commanders will go some way to improving the management of resources, and I welcome those moves, but there is still a need for senior management to know how that authority is being exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently that seems to be too hard for Defence to manage, even though there are 24,000 civilians in the Department of Defence. The Defence Act provides that the Secretary to the Department of Defence is responsible to the Minister for financial planning and programs of all elements of Defence outlay and for financial administration and control of expenses, including the correct and proper use of public funds. One wonders what those 24,000 people are doing if this information is not available and cannot be made available cost effectively to the Parliament. Also, what are they doing in the mismanagement of the projects that we have seen over the years?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is proposing to reduce the size of the Public Service elements of his Department by 3,800 people. This immediately raises questions. If financial control is actually being handed to Defence Force personnel down the line, why are we still retaining 20,200 civilians who will no longer have their previous financial responsibilities? In addition, what confidence can we have that these 3,800 reductions are real? We have seen number shuffling with this Department in years gone by. I understand that 200 people in the Defence, Science and Technology Organisation in Adelaide are part of the 3,800, yet the phased restructuring of DSTO was announced by Minister Kelly on 18 November 1987. I believe that these people have been counted once already. How many of the remaining 3,600 are in the same boat?</PARA>
<PARA> We might also ask whether the DSTO reductions are of scientists and engineers in this clever country. I will be seeking details of the 3,800 positions, and I note that there has been no similar civilian structure review tabled here today as there has been with the force structure review. Even if the 3,800 positions are not being recycled, it would appear that the civilian reduction is 16 per cent when the people we actually recruit to defend us are being cut back by 15.4 per cent, almost the same amount. One would have expected the civilian cuts to be proportionately greater. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has already stated on the public record its support for efficiency and improved management, both of which at the last election we claimed were possible and necessary in the Defence portfolio. We also support a changeover from military to civilian personnel in fulfilling base tasks provided it will not have a deleterious effect on our combat capability. We do not accept civilianisation measures which will reduce our combat capability. It goes without saying, therefore, that appropriate contracting out is supported by the Opposition. Indeed, I visited the Ministry of Defence in the United Kingdom two years ago to learn of the moves it had made in that direction, and I received warnings of the need to exercise great care not to impact on combat capability. </PARA>
<PARA> The two elements which give me most concern in this whole exercise are the impact on our readiness and, therefore, our ability to defend Australia, and the financial footing on which the whole exercise is based. The Opposition has made it very clear that it opposes any force structure cuts which impact on combat capability but, despite the Government's rhetoric to the tune of `our cuts will not affect combat capability', this is precisely what it is doing, as Senator Durack has already said. It is clear, despite the Minister's claims, that combat capability will suffer and the sharp end will be considerably blunted. </PARA>
<PARA> General Sir Ivan Mackay, the general responsible for this nation's territorial defence in 1942, said that he reckoned a garrison of not less than one division would be required to hold Townsville against a Japanese attack. He reported to the then Labor Government that it might be necessary to submit to the enemy occupation of certain areas of Australia should local resistance be overcome because, in effect, there were only enough troops in the country to defend an area bounded by Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. This was the origin of the notorious Brisbane line. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A Labor initiative. I thank Senator MacGibbon. It was at a time when we had over 50 active battalions. In Vietnam we had nine battalions; currently we have only six undermanned battalions, and the Government proposes to remove two of those battalions and replace them with reserves, meaning that we will reduce our capability even further. To do this is surrendering Australia. How can the Government possibly be serious? Only yesterday Senator Maguire, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, released that Committee's report on United Nations Peacekeeping and Australia and issued a press statement which said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Committee recommended that `Australia should seek the command of any United Nations peacekeeping force in Cambodia to demonstrate our commitment to the region and our willingness to contribute to the peaceful resolution of the conflict there.'</PARA>
<PARA>That will not be as easy as it seems now, with the reductions that the Government is making. If two of our combat battalions are made ready reserves, not able to serve overseas, how can the other four sustain and maintain a rotation for a considerable duration in Cambodia, especially if it continues for some time, and do its job of protecting Australia at the same time if any threat or low level contingency should arise?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has been talking to journalists about our teeth to tail ratios being out of kilter, but what he has said has been misleading, because in prior wars Australia had the support of our friends and allies to provide logistical support. A change in ratio to meet our demand for self-reliance inevitably means that we have more logistics people, and rightly so. Wherever sensible reductions can be made which will not affect our combat capability, they should be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem which compounds this loss of capability is our ability to actually recruit and retain the personnel to make up the two ready reserve battalions. The role of the Ready Reserve, as the Minister has indicated, is to boost Australia's overall expansion force with the capability to increase personnel in a short time to meet any credible contingencies. Those are admirable words, but how many ready reservists will be quickly released by their employers if they are needed? Even more basic, how many employers will be prepared to allow employees a year away with the reserves plus periods of six weeks a year thereafter? How many employees, especially in a time of recession, will be prepared to put their career on hold for 12 months while they go away for training, and then leave again for over one month's training in each subsequent year?</PARA>
<PARA> The financial inducements to employers will be costly to the taxpayer, and the absence of the employee for 10 weeks, about, of 52-including their four weeks annual leave-will have a significant effect on businesses, which should not be underrated. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly, what legislation does the Government propose to enforce these requirements? The Minister has made no mention of it and it is my understanding that there is none. How can we possibly be reducing our regular personnel component without any guarantees that those we are replacing them with will do the job if required?</PARA>
<PARA> The readiness of the Ready Reserve battalions inevitably will be less than that of the two regular battalions they are to replace. We are once again moving back to the situation we faced in 1939 where there were insufficient regulars ready to commit to combat and a long training period before the reserves were made combat ready. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ready Reserve program provides for a review with a prospect of expanding the Ready Reserve, especially for the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). These two services, in my view, have not made sufficient use of reservists in the past and thus the proposals in this area are welcomed. But the thought that the ready reserves in the Army will be expanded to replace even more regular units in the future is, however, one which fills me with alarm. </PARA>
<PARA> The two battalions of ready reserves will be provided with financial incentives, such as payment of tertiary education fees and commitment bonuses. What will be the costs of these incentives? The Minister has not spelt them out. If we look at the American experience we know that this can be very costly. In summary, the ready reserves will not be ready and any savings made by their introduction are uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA> The force structure review proposals substantially reduce flying hours for the RAAF F111 aircraft and for the Navy Sea King helicopters, the RAAF Caribou fleet is being reduced from 21 to 14 and operating costs for the RAAF 25 Squadron at Pearce are being reduced. These will significantly reduce the training and experience levels of yet more defence personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem we will face is a reduction in communications capability. The communications project cutbacks identified will make it difficult for our combat force signallers in the field to operate effectively. This has substantial significance for any peacekeeping forces we may send away in the future. The loss will mean that our combat forces will have only elementary manoeuvrability in the field. What is left of our communications may be suitable for vital asset protection, but this is hardly sufficient for our multi-roled soldiers. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the title of `ready reserves', I am concerned at the impact of the new proposals on the existing reserves. Already many reserve units cannot afford to pay the reserves that turn up for training or any new reserves recruited. One letter I received this week indicates that one reserve unit cannot afford any more training weekends until the end of this calendar year, weekly training nights have been restricted to 2 hours, and that it is carrying out some training on an unpaid basis. This is only the latest of several such reports from other units. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe one of the principal impacts will be to reinforce the existing reserves' perceptions of themselves as being neglected and at the bottom of the system. The result will be that many members of the reserves will be further discouraged and will drop out. This is likely to be especially so when the ready reservists undergo their part time training and inevitably have the advantage in promotional and career path opportunities over the existing reservists. One can only speculate on the impact on the existing reserves if some of these funds that the Minister has been announcing today had been invested in the existing reserves rather than in the new flashy model of ready reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also likely that the Ready Reserve will have an impact on regular recruitment. There is every likelihood that the new one year option will be taken by potential regular recruits instead of the existing four-year commitment. I am concerned that this will have a serious effect on training costs and impact heavily on training facilities as well as reducing the total experience level of the regular force. </PARA>
<PARA> A high proportion of people going through the very short training cycle and then leaving not only is costly but also leaves little chance of the required experience levels being maintained. This is the same situation we faced in the 1950s when a small, demoralised regular force was tied up with an overwhelming national service and training commitment. It also means that the training costs blow out and the experience levels in the force go down. Both of these are very serious problems which may face us in the future as a result of today's announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> My further concern with the Ready Reserve is that many of the existing reserves come from essential services areas. That is, many reservists are farmers, farmhands, transport workers and Telecom Australia employees. The Minister obviously is aiming for farmers, amongst others, for the ready reserves. With a greater reliance on them, what will be the situation in an emergency? In the Second World War essential service workers were prevented from going to war in order to keep the country running. </PARA>
<PARA> How can the Government possibly deny that the ready reserves will mean a reduction in our total force combat capability? The experience levels and complex training achieved by regular personnel are vitally important to maintain these combat roles. As the American experience in the Gulf war demonstrated, crucial combat roles were only undertaken by regulars. </PARA>
<PARA> The sharp end will not be significantly `sharpened' as the Minister has constantly claimed; in fact, it will be blunted. A ceiling of 11,055 for the Army's combat force has been identified in the force structure review. At present, there are approximately 12,799 in the combined front-line combat and immediate support combat troops. The force structure review reduces the Australian Regular Army by 2,460. The other reviews have targeted other areas leading to a total reduction of 5,200 from the Army; this making a total of 10,500 from the whole Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads me to the question of redundancy. The Minister has announced that cuts will take place over time, based on a percentage of voluntary redundancies together with some management initiated early retirement and natural attrition for the remainder. He says that redundancies will occur by negotiation where rank-trade imbalances exist, but it is my understanding that the extent of the redundancies is not known and neither are the terms and conditions of any packages. </PARA>
<PARA> The lowered morale that will be generated by this instability and uncertainty are very worrying, especially as defence personnel, unlike public servants, currently have no right to be considered for redeployment into the Public Service. I would hope the Minister will announce the extent and the terms and conditions of redundancies very soon. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister stated in his speech that many of the service personnel leaving the Defence Force in the future will find that their transition to civilian life will be eased by the greater availability of civilian jobs in areas where they have expertise. That raised a hollow laugh on our side of the chamber, because the Minister appears not to recognise the difficulties of his Government's induced recession. Clearly, the Government is totally out of touch. No matter how well qualified many people are, they are still out of work. </PARA>
<PARA> He also said in his speech that those leaving the regular force will be able to continue their career on a part time basis. Perhaps the Minister is thinking of copying the British Government after the Napoleonic wars when the Army was put on to half pay. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee for Employer Support of the Reserves Forces is properly to receive additional support. It is interesting that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has been invited previously to provide a representative on both this Committee and on the Army Reserve Advisory Council. But it has not, however, chosen to provide a representative on either. This lack of support for the defence forces does not augur well for the future when Australia's defence will rely even more heavily on civilians. As is known only too well, the union movement has had a sorry record both in World War II, Korea and Vietnam and in peacetime, in its dealings with Australia's defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the financial integrity of the statement. I have very serious reservations about the costing of the Ready Reserve. I referred earlier to the Auditor-General's report on the reserves. There were difficulties in getting reliable figures, but that report claimed that the cost per day of today's reserve soldier is more than 50 per cent higher than that of a regular soldier. Imagine my astonishment when I find that the Government has costed a ready reservist at only 42 per cent of a regular soldier and that the Army itself costs a ready reservist at 60 per cent of the cost of a regular soldier. They obviously cannot all be right. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that a ready reservist will inevitably cost considerably more than a reservist in the present Reserve. If 20 per cent of our reserve units are to be made up of regular members, and if regular reservists are to spend more time in uniform than the current reservist, then the training, pay and equipment for each of the ready reservists will be greater than for the current reserves. In addition, the incentives for recruitment and retention of the ready reservists and for their employers will be expenses which are not currently incurred for the existing reserves, and they will not come cheap. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Auditor-General stands by his costs of last year for the existing Reserve and I understand that the Army figures were not wildly different from the Auditor-General's figures. It can only mean that the figures of 42 per cent and 60 per cent of a regular soldier do not include all the costs which should be included to arrive at the true cost of a ready reservist. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been waiting for the last couple of years to see the results of the previously announced assets sales. The continuing depression in the real estate market has meant that Defence has not received the benefit that these sales were predicted to bring to the Defence budget. I would not place too much reliance on any prediction of buckets of money from the sales of bases announced for closure today. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the long term closure of HMAS Platypus may well result in a pretty small return for the Defence budget if, as appears likely, it ends up as a waterfront park rather than a valuable subdivision. Similarly, there is a question mark over the use to which land at RAAF Williams could be put and, therefore, to its value. Incidentally, one wonders in this context how effective the RAAF museum will be in the future if it is no longer to be attached to an airfield. This, I understand, was considered to be essential to the long term planning for the museum. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out, there are several internal uncertainties in the statement in the financial area. What is not spelt out by the Minister is the context in which these decisions have been taken. The announcements today are predicated upon no real growth in the Defence budget. However, the Defence Force structure review also looked at options based on an increase of one per cent and a decrease of one per cent in the Defence budget. It recognised that, even with one per cent real growth, the Government's White Paper was not affordable. It also recognised that only 70 per cent of the White Paper initiatives could be funded without any growth, and that if there was a reduction of even one per cent in the budget, less than half of the White Paper program could be funded. </PARA>
<PARA> I am most fearful that, taking together the suspect figures for the Army Reserve, the uncertain returns from the facilities sales and the bulge which will shortly hit us in the capital procurement inheritance from Mr Beazley in a year or so, the budget will once again be up for radical cuts. How much more can Australia's Defence Force be cut before we decide to lay down our arms and have no force at all? We are doing nothing short of surrendering Australia. How long must we wait before we see substantial and meaningful cuts to the dinosaur of the Defence bureaucracy? When will our combat capability truly take priority over the brown-suited bureaucracy? The mandarins appear to have won round one, and Australia is the loser. </PARA>
<PARA> The documentation released today will require more detailed study and time than has been available for this debate. A huge range of issues needs to be addressed, from the cuts to existing programs, to the sales of defence facilities to a close scrutiny of the areas detailed for contracting out and for civilianisation. This afternoon, however, I have concentrated on the personnel and financial aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> However, before concluding I would like to acknowledge my support for the decisions on the Chinooks and mobilisation planning. The cutbacks of the Chinooks was a decision which was roundly opposed by the Opposition at the time, and I welcome the maintenance of even some capability in this area. I also welcome the indication by the Minister for Defence that mobilisation planning will now be given some attention. Mr Wrigley was correct in pointing out our deficiencies in this area. However, I believe he was incorrect in suggesting that this could properly be laid at the door of Defence. Mobilisation planning covers much more than defence-it goes to other governmental responsibilities and the wider economy. The need for such planning must be a governmental decision. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, although there are aspects of the Minister's announcement today with which the Opposition has no quarrel, there are serious and glaring faults. Firstly, the strategic basis for the White Paper has not been reviewed and cries out for reviewing. Secondly, the Government's past funding has gone nowhere near meeting the tasks established in the White Paper, and the financial measures taken today will only leave us further away from the targets set in that paper. Thirdly, the statement is purely budgetary driven, although it has been dressed up in public relations clothes to give it more clout. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the guts of it is that we are trading off readiness for dollars. Fifthly, our fears are that many of these dollar savings are illusory. Sixthly, the Ready Reserve program contains a `nudge nudge, wink wink' warning that this will be only the first step on the way to an even greater level of reserve forces. Seventhly, the Minister's shopping list for capital procurement into the next century is as illusory as the dollar savings he is claiming. They are simply a continuation of Mr Beazley's wish list of four years ago, the only difference being that they have been pushed further down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> The deployment during the Fiji crisis in 1987, the deployment to the Gulf in 1990 and the continuing instability amongst our neighbours, especially Papua New Guinea, makes it abundantly clear that we must retain highly specialised forces who are dedicated, have a high level of training and have the ability to react quickly in any of the contingencies established in the White Paper. The reductions in combat capability announced today by the Minister puts the defence of Australia in jeopardy. It is as serious as that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 May the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, told the Senate the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I know Senator McLean wants to think laterally and to think in an exciting way about defence but I caution him on this point: one of the things in defence is never to adopt a high risk strategy. That is always the constraint on any Minister for Defence-he or she cannot always take the high risk strategies. </PARA>
<PARA>The theme of my response today to the Minister's statement on the Defence Force structure review is that Senator Ray has fundamentally misunderstood the point that I was making. The fact is that Australia already has a high risk defence strategy. For years the strategy has been designed to meet imaginary threats while real ones are largely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> Our gigantic defence capital equipment budget is being lavished on inappropriate weapons systems while our real defence needs are starved of funds. Service families are being shunted around the country every two years and personnel are asked to perform tasks of declining relevance to the Australian community, yet our defence planners wring their hands and wonder why people are leaving the services. </PARA>
<PARA> We are at a watershed in our strategic and military history. If ever there was a time for a lateral and radical rethink of defence policy, that time has come. Vision and courage are needed to develop an affordable defence system which meets Australia's unique requirements, but this is not a high risk strategy. On the contrary, it is far less risky than the current approach. It is no exaggeration to say that the Australian Defence Force (ADF), notwithstanding the great dedication and skill of our service personnel, is in crisis. But crisis is opportunity, and the crisis in the Australian Defence Force is an opportunity for reform that presents itself only rarely. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the publicity hype which preceded today's statement gave the impression that such a fundamental restructuring was under way. Nothing could be further from the truth. Beneath the hype is the reality that, as Peter Robinson wrote in the Australian Financial Review on 24 May, `The Ray approach is simply a camouflaged cost-cutting exercise by a veteran Labor numbers man'.</PARA>
<PARA> It must be said that Senator Ray did not create the mess from which today's statement is supposed to extricate him and the ADF. The Minister is between a financial rock and a hard place inherited from his predecessor in the Defence portfolio, Mr Beazley. The hard place, as David Lague wrote in the Financial Review on Wednesday last week, is the massive capital equipment program launched by Mr Beazley, which is now consuming 30 per cent of the Defence budget and putting enormous pressure on funds for personnel, training and operations. The rock is the pressure to stabilise the Defence budget, despite the 1986 recommendation of the Dibb report on the Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities that annual real increases of 3 per cent were needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the Government's unwillingness to prune capital spending-indeed, this statement foreshadows the continuation of today's crippling level of investment for the next 20 years-the reductions must come from somewhere. It is for this reason and this reason alone that 10,450 regular service posts and 3,840 civilian posts will be axed over the next 10 years; that a Ready Reserve of some 4,100 personnel will be established; and that many of the non-combat service functions will be contracted out to civilian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In his analysis of the Wrigley report, which was a major catalyst for today's statement, Dr Graeme Cheeseman of the Australian National University described it as an attempt to shift the deckchairs on the Titanic. The same could be said of Senator Ray's blueprint. The force cuts look radical, but the band on the deck is playing the same depressing old tune. The fact is that the changes do not alter the fundamental contradictions and absurdities on which Australia's defence planning is based. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an almost nonsensical quality to a defence strategy which assumes that a relatively small incursion into our northern zone will require the deployment of our entire Army to protect northern air bases. In the unlikely event of such an incursion, its very purpose will be to put pressure on Australia by exacting significant costs. The deployment of the full Army is certain to cost a great deal and the purpose of the incursion would have been achieved. We are investing billions of dollars on state of the art submarines, frigates and fighter bombers, and this statement foreshadows the possible purchase of six more frigates starting next decade. Yet any self-respecting military analyst would admit that they will play no useful role in the event of low level incursions and raids, which are the only feasible, albeit highly unlikely, threat that Australia faces. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his address last week to the Melbourne Press Club acknowledged that we face no military threats. He said that Indonesia lacks the right military posture to threaten Australia and does not intend to acquire one in the future and has no aggressive intentions towards us. Any country beyond Indonesia which wanted to attack Australia would have to attack Indonesia first. </PARA>
<PARA> Only three years after Mr Beazley invented potential military threats from China, India and Japan in his attempt to sell ANZAC frigates to a sceptical New Zealand public, Senator Ray has disinvented these threats in order to sell his force cuts to the Australian public. The Minister is, of course, right. We face no existing or foreseeable military threat. Little wonder then that the past few years have seen defence policy drift back to the discredited doctrine of `forward defence' which has nothing to do with defence and everything to do with Australia's self-appointed role as the South Pacific policeman. The plan to buy a training vessel doubling as a helicopter and troop carrier, while having some merit, has the potential to be used for heavy-handed and unwelcome intervention. This proposal must be subjected to a full public and regional debate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, we face no military threats, but we face substantial and potentially catastrophic threats from other sources. The greenhouse effect, for example, is predicated to claim large slabs of Australian territory as sea levels rise. Land degradation is putting significant amounts of farm land out of commission. By contrast, there is negligible risk that we will lose comparable areas of land, or indeed any land at all, to an invading force. Yet we pour $9 billion per year into meeting non-existent military threats while throwing a few million at the real security challenges of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one in this chamber would doubt that an important peacetime function to which defence can contribute, and does to some extent, is coastal zone surveillance. Yet the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar network, when operational, will only function from 9 to 5 during daylight hours, apparently to keep costs down. Australia's most powerful surveillance system of the future will be blind for 16 hours each day while drug smugglers and illegal fishing vessels operate undetected around our northern coastline. </PARA>
<PARA> It is crass madness that the coordinator of the State Emergency Service response to the Newcastle earthquake is forced to conduct chook raffles to fund the SES civil defence work. Just a few kilometres from Newcastle, 40 F/A-18 fighter-bombers worth $45m each sat idle in hangars with no pilots to fly them while the SES was forced to cope with the earthquake on a shoestring budget. This is not to suggest that ADF personnel live in glorious luxury. They come a poor second to weapons systems in the Government's defence investment priorities. One illustration of this is the Army hut at Ingleburn which I occupied in 1956 during my national service. That hut is still in use today and it is in somewhat similar condition to what it was in then. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am making is that too much of our defence effort is irrelevant to our defence needs. This fact is never addressed by the other parties in their accusations and counter-accusations about wastage of service personnel. Why? Because the remedies lie in radical and lateral thinking which both sides refuse to admit is urgently needed. </PARA>
<PARA> This lack of relevance goes a long way towards explaining the public tradition of not being interested in defence. The Minister is now proposing to bridge this gap by following the Wrigley report recommendation that non-combat defence jobs be farmed out to civilians. Defence policy development will stay firmly in the hands of the small group of service chiefs and planners, bureaucrats and academics who have always set the agenda. The Minister should rest assured that this ivory tower practice will keep public interest in defence as low as ever. </PARA>
<PARA> This apathy may in turn hamper the Minister's ready reserve program. While the Democrats would generally support an improved reserves scheme, we have serious reservations about this one. Senator Newman has enumerated quite a number of quite legitimate reservations about the practicability of the program advanced today. We do not believe that it is sensible to artificially stimulate recruitment by using the reserves as an employment sponge to mop up struggling farmers and students, yet that appears to be the basis of this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> We have particular reservations about the tax-exempt ready reserve education assistance scheme and the proposal to allow for more assured deferral of tertiary places for recruits undergoing their initial 12-month training. It is insidious and unjust to discriminate against the average students, many of whom have inadequate financial support, simply because they are unwilling to do military service. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a great disappointment to the Australian Democrats that, far from giving the public a role in defence planning, this Government continues to exclude even the Parliament. I remind the Minister that he has failed to honour an undertaking to me to table the Wrigley report for debate in this chamber. I also point out that the work of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, which has been conducting an inquiry into ADF reserves for some time now, was not asked to contribute to the development of today's statement. I endorse the conclusion of Peter Robinson in last Friday's Financial Review that today's statement:</PARA>
<PARA>will give Australia the worst of all possible worlds-a demoralised, inadequate, directionless defence establishment and a nervous, unconvinced public . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats do not pretend that there are easy, overnight solutions to the crisis in our defence establishment. The longer the need for a truly fresh look at defence is put into the too hard basket, the deeper the crisis will become. Nor do the Democrats claim to offer a detailed, watertight alternative to the present system. We offer a model which clearly defines the directions in which defence planning must head if it is to become relevant to today's realities. </PARA>
<PARA> We propose that the Australian Defence Force become a multi-role civil-military organisation. Traditional defence tasks must take their place alongside peacetime coastal surveillance, search and rescue, bushfire fighting, environmental protection and rehabilitation, and other defence functions which require common skills and equipment to perform, and which therefore contribute to a capability for dealing with low level incursions in a cost-effective way. There is simply no justification for today's disproportionate emphasis on high level military threats when these are patently the least of our worries. </PARA>
<PARA> This multi-role organisation would encompass the existing civilian agencies which presently perform some of the civilian tasks I have mentioned. A Democrat Defence Force would have a core of professional, full time, regular military personnel; a larger pool of reserves providing routine part time service; and civilian personnel, some of whom would perform front-line non-military tasks, such as coastal surveillance and environmental protection.</PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats would encourage a respect for a new brand of national service-not national service by way of conscription to fight other people's wars, but voluntary national service in defence of Australia. We would begin to establish a conservation corps to undertake selected conservation tasks which build skills relevant to our wider defence needs, such as the rehabilitation of degraded lands and polluted waterways through major reafforestation programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Under our model, defence units should increasingly become regionally based, with the exception of capital city units which could supply reinforcements in the event of large scale emergencies in remote areas, and could contribute to United Nations peacekeeping activities. The units would operate in peacetime with light arms where necessary, using relatively small, medium-tech vehicles such as Canadair CL-215 multi-role amphibious aircraft, transport planes and helicopters, small trucks, four wheel drives, motor bikes, river craft, minehunters and fast ocean patrol boats. In this context the Democrats are in general agreement with the Minister's plan to acquire four coastal minehunters and 12 patrol boats. </PARA>
<PARA> Larger naval vessels and long-range maritime patrol aircraft would police the outer reaches of the fishing zone. Fast combat aircraft would provide air cover in the event of high level contingencies. Priority would be given to effective surveillance, combining technological means such as Jindalee with the eyes and ears of civil Australia-Aboriginal communities, farmers and pastoralists, truck drivers, fishermen, port officials and so on-linked to regional and national surveillance centres. In the event of an incursion, our strategy aims to evacuate threatened communities where possible and necessary and surround and await the raiding parties, whose supply lines will be extremely vulnerable or, more likely, non-existent. We would end the present nonsense of planning to deploy tens of thousands of personnel to deal with an incursion of perhaps 100 people. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADF's top-line military hardware is already of marginal relevance to Australia's defence and would have almost no role in the Democrat model. We propose to mothball tanks, artillery and armoured personnel carriers which are too cumbersome and destructive for remote defence tasks. Democrat policy also strongly supports a non-provocative defence posture and has no place for F111 land attack bombers, long range submarines or gold-plated long-range heavily armed frigates and destroyers. Expensive and irrelevant forward defence operations would be buried once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA> It is within this framework that the Democrats believe that Australia can construct an affordable, relevant and effective defence system which offers far greater vocational rewards and social stability and is in tune with the changes in community attitudes and our strategic environment. It is time, therefore, for real change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The defence statement that we have before us this afternoon has some of the hallmarks of a confidence trick. When we listen to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) we could be forgiven for believing that we had no problems in defence-that everything was fine-and that, even more importantly, it would get better still. Indeed, in the second sentence of the statement the Minister says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Today I announce Government decisions on a series of significant Defence reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>The word `reforms' means that there will be improvements. That is simply not true and I think it is less than honest to pretend that it is true. What we have before us today is a series of incorrect decisions which are quite dangerous, as Senator Durack and Senator Newman, who have preceded me on this side of the chamber, have said. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing announced in this statement improves in any way the capabilities or readiness of the Australian Defence Force (ADF)-in fact, we have something that reduces significantly the readiness and capabilities of the Australian Defence Force which are, as the Gulf war showed, at a very low level already. What we have before us is a proposition to save money-the old Australian Labor Party trick of running down the defence forces. There is nothing more to it than that; it is a money-saving exercise by the Government. Put in its simplest terms, when we have a very small force structure of about 70,000 men and women-as Australia has in its Defence Force-to propose that 10,000-odd personnel can be taken out of it without affecting the capability, suitability and readiness of that force is absolute nonsense. When one adds to that the fact that this is coming after years and years of cuts to the defence budget, the situation then becomes very clear even to the slowest of minds. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the Americans, we are not coming from a well-funded background stretching over the last decade. We are coming from a persistent level of cuts-down, down, down every year. The consequence of taking 10,000 personnel out of the Australian Defence Force will be a serious degradation of our present capability and readiness. It will affect the Australian defence forces for at least 10 years because it will take five years before anyone in the Defence Force has the courage to tell the Minister of the day that there is a real problem here, and it will take another five years to come up with some system to fix it. In those 10 years we will have a great loss of institutional knowledge from the Australian Defence Force. Some of that knowledge, some of the skills and some of the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force will never be replaced; they will be gone forever-and they will be gone for no purpose whatsoever. This is particularly important at the present time because Australia has a need for increased readiness and increased capability in its defence forces. Australia's ability to look after itself is now at a higher premium than it has been for many years, purely because of the ending of the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA> Paradoxically, while the American force structure has been reduced and is being reduced significantly and its degrees of readiness are coming down as a consequence of the relaxation of the tensions of the Cold War, that imposes upon Australia an obligation to increase its own capability. While the world was polarised into two blocs-the Western democratic nations and the Soviet Union-their military presence on the world stage meant that many countries of the world had to conform to one or other bloc. To be seen to be involving themselves in military adventurism or pursuing national interests in a dangerous way was really forbidden to them by the great power blocs that were astride the world stage at the time. With that gone, we will see lesser nations pursuing their national interests, and sometimes they will pursue their national interests in a military way. The consequence of that is that there will be increased unpredictability and instability in the world. Australia simply has to have a higher level of readiness and capability in its defence forces than it has at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic problem that we have at present is that the Defence Force is poorly structured. It has an incorrect balance and it does not have a high enough degree of readiness. The Government is proposing to reduce further-not enhance-that capability and readiness by getting rid of about 10,000 personnel to reduce our number of regular infantry battalions from six to four. I am ashamed that Australia has only six infantry battalions. I think for a country of 17 million people that is a very shameful admission; it shows that we are not really serious about defence at all. But to reduce our strength of regular infantry units-our principal land combat units-from six to four, by one-third, is absolutely indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time in the Minister's statement we see that the essential equipment needed by the Australian defence forces will not be bought. A huge loss of morale has followed the Labor Government with its progressive cuts year after year. The way that the Sanderson report was handled, the way it was leaked and the way the uniformed services have known what was in it for the last three or four months, has had a crippling effect on morale. We will see resignations from key people in the Services because they feel that they do not have a future in the defence forces any more. There is now a general air in the Australian Defence Force that these people no longer have a career; they have a job for the time being but they do not have a career. An enormous difference in morale comes from that. </PARA>
<PARA> Like other speakers on this side, I express my disappointment at the way the Government has bungled this opportunity. There is a need to reform the Australian Defence Force but the opportunity has been missed. Not only has the opportunity been missed; we have had some regressive changes which I believe are quite dangerous. It is all unnecessary. Australia is the easiest country in the world to defend. There is not an easier country to defend and every day it gets easier with the introduction of new high technology weapons systems. I am not saying that the defence of Australia is easy-of course it is not. It is difficult and it is expensive. But it is the easiest country in the world to defend and we can defend it if we have high quality personnel with high quality training and high quality, appropriate weapons systems. None of those is addressed in the report we have before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had four reports and a ministerial statement placed before us. I have not had time to read them all. In fact, I have only skimmed the ministerial statement, the Force Structure Review and the Ready Reserve Program paper. It is no accident that the Government has done this, as Senator McLean said. Though the Minister for Defence is a member of this chamber, we have had no formal debate on defence. The last large report that we had from the Department-the Wrigley report-has never been debated in the Senate. We have never had the opportunity for that. And now, in the closing stages of the session, we are overwhelmed by four significant reports dumped on us with inadequate debating time. We will rise for the winter recess, we will come back to the torrent of the Budget Bills and no-one will get around to analysing what the Government is proposing to do. As I said before, that is no accident when it comes from the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray). I will talk about those reports on the adjournment debate, even if it means keeping the President out of bed some nights and, hopefully, Senator Tate as the Minister on duty. </PARA>
<PARA> How did we ever get into our present position? It is all about money. We got into it because funds have been progressively cut. The Department of Defence, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, recognised quite clearly that as a consequence of the equipment purchases from the Vietnam era, with a life cycle of about 20 years, by the middle of the 1980s and through the decade after that there would be a high replacement bill. There are a whole range of papers published by the Department of Defence as to how the financial problem would be overcome. I have a number of them still in my files. I have been talking about this since the early 1980s. In precis form, what the Department said was that there had to be a real growth of 3 per cent per annum in the defence vote just to maintain the position we had-just to stay still-because we had to accommodate new capital expenses. It is very interesting to look at the graph at page 38 of the Force Structure Review presented today. I seek leave to incorporate the graph in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The graph shows how defence funding has run down. In the Labor years we have never achieved 3 per cent average growth. In fact, in the first couple of years of Labor Administration in this country, we achieved a little over 2.5 per cent growth purely because, under the FMS contracts, the Americans delivered equipment ahead of time. The graph shows that for three years the degree of funding has been actually less than what was required in the year before and in no case has it provided enough to accommodate the new purchases that had to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Additionally, there was some very irresponsible spending by the Government. The Government used the Department of Defence as a means of distributing political largess. The speed with which the submarine program was run through and awarded to South Australia was purely a consequence of Mr Bannon's election at the time. The speed with which the Anzac ship proposal was picked up and run through for Victoria was to help the poor old failed government of Mr John Cain. I do not mind make-work programs from a Labor government but, for goodness sake, it should pay for them from the welfare program-out of Senator Richardson's department-not from the Department of Defence because that is a gross perversion and abuse of its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal briefly with the salient points in the Force Structure Review paper. I will have to deal with the failings of the report more than anything else. I make three general comments before doing so. They relate to the scholarship of the report, the funding considerations in it and the discussion on the White Paper. The first thing to be said in relation to scholarship is that it is a very intellectually banal and pedestrian document. There is not one original idea or creative thought in it. It came from a narrow-based Army staff committee and, even worse, it was never discussed with the senior officers of the three Services. I find it astonishing in a profession of arms that matters of great importance which affect everyone are not put for discussion before brother officers of a suitable rank. It is quite astonishing to me that a profession can be run in such an authoritarian way as the Army and the ADF Headquarters ran this report. What we have is a collection of assertions, allegations and assumptions without any analysis and research and anything in the way of scholarship behind it to back it up. In one sense it takes defence planning back 20 or even 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> There are sophisticated management tools available today for systems analysts. There are econometric models that can be developed. One can analyse in great detail and predict with great accuracy what the consequences of certain management schemes will be and what certain management actions will result in. In the early 1960s with Robert McNamara in the Kennedy Administration the use of systems analysts in the defence forces was highly developed. They got a bit of a bad name because it went a bit far- there was a degree of excess in what happened in Vietnam. But that does not deny the basic validity of systems analysts in the management scheme of things. </PARA>
<PARA> We had two bodies in Australia: the Central Studies Establishment (CSE) and, later, the Services Analysis Study Group-SASG. They reported on various programs with a very high degree of precision and fidelity. They are no longer with us because they were too good at their job. When service chiefs put pet projects to them, they would be analysed and would be found not to give the benefits that the father of the scheme thought, and that upset the general. When the secretaries in the Department put pet schemes up and they were analysed and did not work out, that upset the secretaries. When Ministers put up proposals and the same thing occurred, the CSE and SASG disappeared from the scene. </PARA>
<PARA> One simply cannot do a seat of the pants analysis of major projects such as the management of the Department of Defence. It is too large; it is too intellectually demanding; and, above all, the consequences of misdirection coming from mistaken ideas coming out are too intolerable to bear. The Minister, for the sake of his own protection, should demand the use of modern management tools such as this. While I am referring to the scholarship and the management of this report, I find it astonishing that a Cabinet could accept only one submission rather than having a range of serious options put to it before making a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, we are in this trouble because defence has not had adequate funding. It is no secret that the Australian Labor Party cannot handle the economy, whether it is the general economy or the particular economy of the Department of Defence. Looking at the proposals in the report, I was reminded of the Scullin Government-another disastrous Labor government-that gave us the Great Depression. Like the Hawke Government, which gave us the second largest depression this century, Scullin gave us the greatest. I went back and looked at Mr Scullin's two defence budgets. While it was running at around #86m to #7m in the years preceding Mr Scullin coming in-in fact, in the year directly preceding it was #6.3m-when he went out of office after his second Budget it was down to #3.6m. I am more than a little concerned that we are going to see Scullin revisited by the Hawke-Keating crew. If that happens we want to stop spending any money on defence now because the money will be wasted. </PARA>
<PARA> I started out by saying that the Minister pretended that everything was fine and dandy. We on this side of the chamber know that that is not so. What we object to is the pretence that things are fine. We would be more than happy to work with the Minister if he came clean, laid it on the table and said, `We are in an enormous fix'. We would work to get our way out of the situation. We are not interested in pursuing any past vendettas; we are interested in the future of the Australian Defence Force and in providing an adequate defence system for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The third general comment I want to make relates to the White Paper. White papers have an importance out of all bounds to the bureaucracy. It is quite reasonable to make an assessment of the strategic environment, the regional environment and what threats and influences might bear on Australia in the years ahead. The White Paper breaks down, though, when people believe it-and believe it they do. They believe that whatever is in the White Paper will happen, particularly in the Army. The Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy do not take any notice of it, except in a ritualistic way when they are in meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> White Papers have very great dangers because, as I say, people believe not only that what they say will actually happen but also that they dictate the force structure and capability and, even worse, that they get to the stage where they dictate force placements. That is what we are seeing in this paper.</PARA>
<PARA> There are three central points on the first page of the report: maximising combat capabilities by reducing numbers; meeting the strategic focus of the northern and western operations; and making greater use of the Reserve. I would just like to briefly touch on those points. Maximising combat capabilities is fine, but that cannot be done by reducing infantry battalions by one-third; that is an absolute nonsense. Cutting out people in base areas sounds simple-it is easy to say-but after 10 years of contraction there is not too much fat left. It is a fact of military life that more people are needed behind the lines than in the front line. An effective fighting force cannot be run without a logistic and training base to support it. There is no way that can be run down just willy-nilly with the grandiose gestures that the Minister makes in his paper. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point about combat capabilities refers to maintenance. We again have a structure that has to go into the field. Civilians cannot be taken into the field in a combat situation, because matters of discipline, training and many other issues are involved. Operational flexibility, which a defence force needs to operate on active service, cannot be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is quite a bit of discussion around that civil contractors in many cases can be more efficient than trained service personnel. That argument really has to be taken with a grain of salt. Civilian contractors work 37 or 38 hours a week. Most maintenance people in the Services are working between 40 to 50 hours per week. If there is a need to do more, they do it quite cheerfully without a cent of overtime. Not one civil contractor will perform five minutes of overtime without heavy penalty rates. If maintenance is intense-in other words, if a resource is used to 100 per cent of its capacity-one is better off owning it than hiring it through contract, just as people are better off owning their own homes over a lifetime than renting them for a short period. </PARA>
<PARA> It comes back to having a decent systems analyst in the scheme of things-of knowing with a degree of accuracy whether it will be cheaper before the maintenance units in the Navy, Army and Air Force are disbanded and turned over to civilian operations. If they are to be turned over to civilian operations, some no-strike clauses or voluntary employment agreements will have to be put in the contracts; otherwise the Services will be held to ransom. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is meeting the strategic focus of northern and western operations. I do not think that anything in the whole report demonstrates the sheer amateurish approach taken by the authors than that strategy. That is armchair strategy at its very worst. Defence forces need flexibility; one does not put everything in the shop window. A consequence of the White Paper is that the Government thinks the threat is coming from the north-west. I do not know where the threat is coming from; the Government is smarter than me if it knows. But a government should not deploy forces in the front line until it has a real threat on its hands. The Government's approach is one of the most blatant displays of professional ignorance I have seen. In the north, we need a surveillance capability so that we know what is going on. We need the mobility, the flexibility and the firepower to cope with what happens after that. We need to hold those active elements in reserve until the threats develop. </PARA>
<PARA> We then come to the business of making greater use of the reserves. This really is the folie de grandeur of the whole report. The Government's proposal will not work and it never will. The Minister has been sold a real tar baby on this issue. I just do not know how he ever bought the scheme. We have a good reserve at present. The reason it is not better is that the Government does not give it enough resources. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wants a higher state of readiness and capability in the Australian reserves, it should give them the tools to do the job. They do not get them at the present time. Until that matter is fixed, coming in with a new system is a total waste of time because it will fail, and it will fail more dramatically than the present reserve system.</PARA>
<PARA> When it fails, it will fail at great cost to both the regulars and the reservists, because we will see the infantry battalions of the regulars reduced by one-third and the A Reserve even more starved of funds. They will go right to the bottom of the priority list. This major change was put in without any research, apart from Mr Bilney's glib assurance that Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd had done some surveys and found that the world was full of students and farmers who were ready to serve for 12 months and then for a period of 50 days for four years thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what is involved in the recruitment side of the issue. The Government makes the point that some ex-Australian Regular Army personnel might want to join the Reserve. It would be good if they did, but the facts of life are that it would be a very small number. Most people who leave the Army before reaching retiring age have had enough; they do not want to be tied up giving six or seven weeks of their lives in the Reserve from thereon. There will be a percentage who do, but it will really be quite small. The other point about those who come from the regular forces is that they have rank-they are corporals, sergeants, warrant officers, captains, majors and lieutenant-colonels-and they cannot be accommodated in the new structure. The benefits of putting ex-regulars in is really quite limited. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the students. I know a fair bit about students. I have taught in universities for quite a while and I have four children who have all graduated recently from university. Students are very competitive; they do not want to be a year behind their cohorts when they are graduating. They do not want to lose $50,000 in their professional lives through missing out on a year's professional practice. The proposition that they can be bought with pin money by the Government paying their higher education contribution fees or giving them a $1,500 bonus when they finish 12 months training just is not on. Students do not want that. The students who are going but not straight away to university are those who put on a haversack and go around the world travelling for a year before they settle down; they are not the sort of people who go into the discipline of a military unit. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we come to the business of training. Once the students have done their 12 months continuous training, what happens? They will not be available for overseas service and there is no way that the Government can compel them under the legislation we have at present. If anyone knows anything about university regiments, one knows that parades cannot be run in mid-term time at weekends. Yet this proposal rests very heavily on weekend training to make it work, and that will not succeed. Although the Government says it will compel members of the Ready Reserve to attend for training, at the end of the day there is no way that it can. Legislation will not do it. The Government will be faced with the problems of high resignation rates, a failure by students to attend for camps and the rest of the problems that the ordinary reserves have. So the problem is not evaded. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the problem of employers. I do not know any employers who would want to give up a good employee for 12 months training and see one go for 50 days a year afterwards. Things are too tough out there for that. The rather glib statement about reserves in the report entitled Force Structure Review about employers being instructed-or words to that effect-to make time available for members of the Ready Reserve to go to camps for training just shows how out of touch the people who wrote this report were. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to go through the equipment changes that are mentioned in this document. I am more concerned with the principles of what is involved than with the equipment. I will come back to that later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government really avoided the question of improving efficiency. I will give a few examples where efficiencies can be picked up, and literally hundreds of millions of dollars saved. First of all, as the defence committee recommended in its management study report several years ago, we ought to get rid of the diarchy between the civilian secretarial side and the uniformed service side. We are still running two management streams. Although it has improved a little in recent years, there are huge delays and there is competition, and that is costing us probably hundreds of millions of dollars a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Defence Force is over-ranked. Job for job, we are at least one rank higher than the Americans. We are overmanned. We have about two or three times the number of officers who hold a rank of one star and above in the Australia defence forces pro rata as have the Canadians and the Americans. We had the mine hunter program. Two years ago we recommended that that be cancelled. That probably represents $200m down the drain and only now has it been chopped. We have the two-ocean Navy and a cost, I estimate, of at least $50m a year for basing a fleet in Western Australia. We need a bare base there. We need to deploy ships as the need comes, not construct buildings. We have three air forces in this country. We have the nonsense of maintaining 34 Squadron, yet we are talking about cutting combat troops. We have to get rid of those inefficiencies and probably hundreds of millions of dollars will be picked up. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite possible to have an adequate Defence Force for Australia, but it takes a lot more hard thinking than this Government has been prepared to do. It also takes money, and at the end of the day we do not put enough in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ministerial statement entitled Defence into the Twenty First Century bears all the hallmarks of a step backwards into the past instead of a look into the future. While some parts of it are to be commended as a move in the right direction, in many ways it is full of contradictions. I can agree with some of the Opposition speakers in that it is inadequate, and that defence options and plans for change, such as the Wrigley Report, should be debated by the Parliament, as Senator McLean said. One of Mr Wrigley's proposals for a militia was today dismissed as a high risk strategy in the statement of the Minister of Defence (Senator Robert Ray)-there was no discussion and no consideration of the options by the Parliament or the relevant defence committees of the Parliament. That is not good enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can agree with some of the things that Senator MacGibbon and Senator McLean said in that respect. However, I must disagree with the amazing assertion from Senator MacGibbon that job creation schemes, as he called them, such as the submarine contract and the frigate project, should be funded by the Department of Social Security. He said, `Take the money out of Senator Richardson's Department'. This is almost unbelievable, but not quite. I did hear it with my own ears. I have to ask: does Senator MacGibbon not know or understand how people are hurting out there in the community? Does he not feel for them, or does he not care for them? He is a man, as I have observed over my few years here, who is bent on machines, especially high tech equipment. He relishes the hardware of the military and, judging by his report on his trip with Mr Ted Lindsay from the other place to visit the Gulf war in action, he has a great appreciation of, and even a reverence for, warfare. I find that really quite sad. </PARA>
<PARA> Going back to the Minister's statement, there is an observation in paragraph 57 reflecting the Minister's speech at the National Press Club on 6 February that the Gulf war has further emphasised the need to strengthen international arms control measures, but then it is recommended in paragraph 51 that Australia should continue to push military exports. There are many contradictions like that in this statement today. In paragraph 9, there is the important observation that we should not go back to the old and discredited forward defence policies of the 1960s, but then in paragraph 10 we have a version of forward defence revisited in the guise of overseas excursions to support the defence of Western interests, as was so tragically played out in the Gulf war recently. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously this whole exercise is about cutting back on personnel and operability to pay for more hardware, an exercise hardly designed to soothe those who have been screaming about the run down of expenditure on military personnel and on day to day operating conditions for the Australian Defence Force (ADF). I do have considerable sympathy for people in the ADF who I think have had a raw deal over the past few years, especially during Mr Beazley's time as Minister for Defence when the whole emphasis was on hardware. Some of us had hoped for, and expected, a change with the new Minister. Obviously we were disappointed. I am sure that many people in the ADF will be extremely disappointed by this continuation of a hardware push at the expense of personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> The report fails abysmally on two counts. Firstly, because Australia does not need the kind of expensive hardware that we are told we can now afford through the savings mentioned in this report. Of course, this is despite the recession that the rest of the community is feeling only too closely that does not seem to affect defence whatsoever. Secondly, it fails because it still assumes that the world of the future will continue to rely on the use of military force to resolve conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA> In paragraph 26 the report acknowledges that there are no military threats to Australia, although Senator MacGibbon seemed to think that we should be armed and ready and practicing while the threats develop. That was the line that he took and that is the usual Opposition line, which is not really based on any logic whatsoever. In respect of there not being any military threats to Australia, we are very lucky. Given the involvement of a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region in historical local conflicts such as those in Kashmir, East Timor, Indo-China, Korea and Sri Lanka, if every country were to act as Australia is and, even in the absence of threats, chose to arm itself with the sort of equipment that we intend to buy, then references to arms control would be laughable. How else can we visualise a world where every country wants FA18s, helicopter support ships, latest state of the art submarines and surface combatants such as the Anzac class frigates?</PARA>
<PARA> An article in the New Zealand Herald yesterday pointed out that critics of this review believe that Australia has become more dependent than ever on the United States of America (USA) through high technology weapons systems, such as the FA18s. The Gulf war certainly indicated our dependence on the United States for equipment. That is inevitable as long as we tie ourselves to the United States in a military alliance and depend on highly sophisticated, but irrelevant, military equipment for our national defence. Most of it is just not appropriate for our conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the cut in the size of the ADF as this country never needed such a large military force, let alone such a bloated bureaucracy on Russell Hill-the largest in Canberra. Here again, I can agree with spokespeople from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a country of 17 million people in the south-west Pacific, generally removed from areas of conflict. A realistically appropriate strategy for the time being would be one that is non-offensive, based on diplomatic non-alignment and restricted to a small military force which would be available for disaster relief or service with the United Nations peace-keeping forces, but which would not otherwise serve beyond our shores. The money saved by the cutbacks referred to in the Minister's statement should be devoted to restoring health, education, social services and overseas aid programs, not to pay for the ADF wish list referred to in paragraph 4, or hinted at in paragraph 5 of the Minister's statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The peace dividend, elusive as it has proved to be, always required advance planning, just as it took some years to switch over from military production to civilian production after the Second World War. It is not something that can be done overnight as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has discovered, despite its efforts to convert factories designed for the manufacture of tanks and missiles to ones which can produce consumer goods such as refrigerators and washing machines. Obviously, a number of members of parliament will be unhappy with the proposals to cut down the number of military bases and other facilities in their electorates. I can understand that, especially in these days of recession when many people are unemployed already. </PARA>
<PARA> What worries me is that, if we spend the money saved by these cutbacks and closures on this wish list, it will hurt our balance of payments even further, because most of it will have to be purchased from the United States. As an example, when France acquired three AWACS from the United States in 1987 they cost $US550m, or $US942m if the ground support systems were included in the price. If we knew more about the helicopter support ship, or whatever roll on, roll off vessel the Navy has in mind, we could work out what that would cost, depending on whether it could be built in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The new helicopters referred to by the Minister will have to be purchased from the United States, like the FA18's, although I doubt whether the Government will admit that they are contributing further towards our balance of payments deficits. This is never acknowledged by the Government and it is rarely picked up on by the community, but defence purchases contribute significantly to the gross imbalance. Surface combatants will be expensive and, despite offset agreements, will require cooperation with a European or North American company, meaning a further balance of payments deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> We also learn from the statement that the Government is going to replace all kinds of expensive military equipment with even more expensive military equipment in the next couple of decades with an even more disastrous impact yet again on our balance of payments deficit. This indicates that either we are going to end up paying more for the military than the current 9.3 per cent Budget allocation, or 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product, or that equipment purchases will take up a greater proportion of the overall military budget than at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally disastrous is the admission in paragraph 51 that all these purchases mean that we are a net importer of military equipment so we have to offset these costs by exporting more military equipment. It is a real catch 22 situation. At this point it is worth recalling the words of Bill Hayden, in his previous incarnation as Minister for Foreign Affairs, when he addressed the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that arms exports should not be turned to as a way of solving domestic economic problems . . . Arms transfers must not become a new cash crop . . . It should also be recognised, especially by those whose development needs are great, that the purchase of arms is at the cost of the purchase of the investment goods essential to the creation of employment and economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>They are strong words which we should heed, but obviously not taken into account by the Minister in his speech today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling several news items that appeared within a few days of the end of the Gulf war to the effect that the arms race was well under way again in the Middle East with orders of up to $US30 billion already received by the Pentagon from Arab states, along with Israel and Turkey. As a defence lobbyist at a conference in Virginia told a Newsweek reporter in February:</PARA>
<PARA>The next big push in the defence industry will be to exploit the Middle East. This is not arms control. This is an arms opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>His words might have been echoed here in Australia as we hear all the weak excuses trotted out by the Minister for why Australia is going to host the biggest arms bazaar in the southern hemisphere in Canberra this November; why we are going to push our military exports in a notoriously unstable and conflict-ridden part of the world; and why our exports are all right while other countries' exports are not. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no mention of the fact that half the other nations in the Asia-Pacific region are following a similar path, including South and North Korea, China, Taiwan, Singapore, India and Pakistan. At least Ken Harris, the Managing Director of Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd (ADI), was aware of this when he warned in his company's first annual report:</PARA>
<PARA>South East Asia is likely to become a much sought after market for European and American defence contracting companies. </PARA>
<PARA>Also reflecting on the Beazley military export strategy since 1988 was Greg Sheridan, a conservative reporter for Rupert Murdoch's flagship, the Australian, when he wrote on 3 March:</PARA>
<PARA>What is absolutely clear is that the attempt to develop a defence export industry has been a failure. </PARA>
<PARA>Thank goodness for small mercies, but it is not for want of trying on the Government's part. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister can protest all he likes about our exports being different from other irresponsible nations selling offensive high tech military equipment to the volatile Middle East, but ADI has already booked its display into one of the world's biggest arms fairs, the International Aerospace and Defence Exhibition at Dubai in the Persian Gulf. We are going to be right in there with the best or the worst of them. This exhibition was originally scheduled to be held in January but it was postponed until after the Gulf war was over and then, of course, it was back to business as usual. How cynical can one get! All the testing was done, all the weapons were proven to be extremely effective and now more orders are called for. A huge arms bazaar in Dubai is coming up and Australia is participating in it. I think it is absolutely disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA> Most military equipment is not offensive-this is the line, of course-but it is vital for the armed forces of any country to prosecute a war. If one country sells high tech defensive equipment, it is an incentive to other countries in the region to acquire equipment to evade it, such as quieter submarines, cruise missiles that fly under enemy radar, stealth technology and so on. It is all part of the arms race. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want to export in this climate, the temptation will be to cut standards of control, not to tighten them up. I notice that in the Minister's statement he talks about streamlining the export guidelines-simplification-but he also mentions a tightening up. Simplification and some items being able to be exported without individual permits will make it easier for industry. Companies will be able to respond more promptly to clients' requests. I can see that that will be the temptation. Even if it is not the intention of the Minister himself, the temptation will be there to cut standards of control to get around regulations which are in place, particularly in the unfortunately very competitive business that arms sales are in the world today. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what the changes to export controls were really about a couple of years ago. I welcome the Senate committee inquiry initiated by the Australian Democrats, to which many community groups will be presenting submissions through the months ahead. International arms control measures referred to by the Minister are a waste of time while Australia justifies its own military exports and blames other countries for weapons proliferation. It is highly hypocritical. </PARA>
<PARA> The ministerial statement reflects confused and muddled thinking. The coalition also offers no improvement when it wants, on the one hand, overall cuts in government expenditure-but not in Defence of course-and, on the other hand, lots more money for personnel in the ADF and the new hardware. As Senator Newman pointed out, this is a continuation of Mr Beazley's wish list. I would add that it is also the Department's wish list and, to a certain extent, the Opposition's wish list as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack reflected on instability in the Asia-Pacific region in his contribution to this debate but, like the Minister, he still opts for a military response instead of exploring the options for non-military models for conflict resolution. Unfortunately, in that there is bipartisanship in the Parliament and I think that is the tragedy. We are still fixed onto a military model rather than looking creatively at non-military options. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that we need radical new thinking about the nature of war and conflict resolution in the twenty-first century; not a reiteration of gunboat diplomacy at a time when the proliferation of ballistic missiles, nuclear, chemical and biological weapons will make national defence obsolete as we understand it today. The glaring hypocrisy of world leaders is stunning as they talk about international arms control measures now directed at the Middle East region-the stable door being closed a fraction, maybe, well after the horse has bolted. These limitations on others are based on the premise that it is all right for `us' in the West, that is, to have all manner of weapons systems including those of mass destruction, while it is not all right for `them' to have such systems because they might not be used responsibly. I believe that all nations, including those who believe themselves responsible, should be scaling down and deploying their massive military budgets towards more socially and environmentally useful ends. That is certainly the position of the Greens Western Australia whom I represent here. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before, any military risks to Australia are imaginary rather than real. Successive defence Ministers have admitted that. Yet, present problems remain unacknowledged or at least inadequately funded. I refer to illegal fishing and drug smuggling on our north coast. Even the new high tech Jindalee system will not be able to monitor those niggling problems, as Senator McLean pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA> These long range high tech, offensive, offshore, directed weapon systems suit the United States military desire for burden sharing and interoperability-burden sharing because the US says it cannot afford to keep up with its huge military expenditure right around the globe and neither should it. It should not be its role to see itself as the international police power, but the Australian burden sharing and interoperability suit the United States military very well indeed. What we need, instead of all of those systems to suit the United States military, are lots of patrol boats and aircraft watching our northern coastlines to deter illegal fishing vessels and drug smugglers. I have said that often before but it needs to be repeated. </PARA>
<PARA> That is where we need the readiness, which the Opposition is so fond of promoting. If ever we needed readiness, it was to deal with the real and niggling threats to Australia's security right now. Assessment of real security risks, not only to Australia but also to the world, must be broadened to include environmental threats to our very existence. A redefinition of security is required and, if we had the courage to remove ourselves from the myth of dependence on militarisation as a guarantee of our safety, then we might be able to address some of the present risks to our security from which no military forces will be able to save us. No military forces can deal with the greenhouse effect; no military forces can deal with other environmental problems which are facing us on a global scale. There are others, of course, like ozone depletion, overpopulation, increasing soil degradation and desertification, and pollution of the earth's waterways. No military forces can deal with those real risks to our security. They are the real problems which the international community should be addressing together and cooperatively. They could do that if we were transfer-funding from militarisation towards ensuring that humanity has a future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement under discussion today is the ministerial statement by the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, entitled Defence into the Twenty First Century. I am concerned that we are not proceeding very far into the twenty-first century with the detail that has been presented to us this afternoon. In fact, I believe that the assessment that has been given by the Minister is really only very short term and will require substantial revision and review, if not within the term of this Parliament, then certainly after the change of government at the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also concerned to have to follow a speaker such as Senator Vallentine on this issue. With her motivations and reasons for commenting on defence, one would think that the only priorities and preferences in northern Australia would be that it should be developed for greenies, green ants and green slime rather than looking after the major issues that must address the proper protection of northern Australia, and at the same time look at the strategic and proper interests of Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The ministerial statement and accompanying documents that have been distributed this afternoon are very bare bones. They do not go into sufficient detail in so many areas that are necessary. The fact that the Government has not had the courage to develop a proper White Paper which would have addressed most of the issues must be one of concern. I am also concerned from discussions with friends I have in various military bases throughout Australia that the Government has not yet concluded the review process that it put in place several months ago. In fact, the major statement by the Minister today is a very ad hoc statement that has picked up some of the Russell Hill work and obviously some of the political budgetary priorities that the Government has had to address. </PARA>
<PARA> There is concern with regard to the cutting of regular Defence Force personnel numbers in combat areas and a range of other issues that my colleagues Senator Durack, Senator Newman and Senator MacGibbon have already outlined in this afternoon's debate. I would, however, comment on the move of more regular army units to northern Australia. It is pleasing to note that there will be changes in advancing this area. The Second Cavalry Regiment will move to Darwin in 1993, and along with this the Government has committed the movement north of an armoured regiment with one regular tank squadron and a composite aviation-infantry battalion by the end of the decade. The regular tank squadron in Darwin will be able to be reinforced by the reserve tank squadron which will remain at Puckapunyal. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with the move of 330 personnel plus dependants in the Second Cavalry Regiment, there will possibly be the movement of the 5/7 Battalion whose strength at the end of April 1991 was in the order of 468 personnel, plus their dependants. This population increase to the Northern Territory will be welcomed, and in particular to the community of Darwin, because of the economic impacts, and the very welcome and special social relationships that have built up between the civilian and defence personnel throughout northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As many in the Senate will know, I have been an advocate for the northern move of the Australian Defence Force both in my terms in the House of Representatives when the initial decisions on the Tindal Royal Australian Air Force base were taken by the then Minister for Defence, Mr Sinclair, and more recently here in the Senate since 1987. The isolation, unique society and relations with our northern neighbours play an important role for people living in northern Australia and their perceptions and concerns as to the threat from the north and so many other associated issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of my constituents when moving to the Northern Territory become increasingly aware just how close our proximity is to Asia and the volatile trouble spots of Cambodia, Burma, Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea. This was brought home to me this week when attending, along with Senator Collins, the North Australian Development Conference in Cairns, where the focus of the conference was on the proximity and special arrangements that we must have in place with Asia. The isolation of northern Australia and the threat from the north are brought home to anyone who takes the time to read Douglas Lockwood's account in the book Australia's Pearl Harbour. Let me quote:</PARA>
<PARA> Destruction came to Darwin mid-morning on February 19, 1942, when war in the Pacific was but ten weeks old. </PARA>
<PARA> Destruction came while the sun shone, with a gentle breeze smudging a few white caps on blue waves rolling in from Beagle Gulf and the Clarence Strait. </PARA>
<PARA> Destruction by an enemy was brought that day for the first time to Australian soil. It came violently though not unexpectedly, with bombs and bullets and cannon shells scything through life as they splintered a fleet and a town and almost a human spirit. </PARA>
<PARA> Destruction and terror were such as to lead to a panic of people. Hundreds fled. They left half-smoked cigarettes, half-finished drinks, unopened mail, unmade beds, incomplete jobs, open doors and caged pets. </PARA>
<PARA> They walked and they ran. They rode on bicycles and they rode in cars, in garbage trucks, ice cream carts, sanitary carts and road graders. Women and children, the aged, infirm and those able-bodied men who could escape detection rode in an evacuee train of cattle trucks and flattops that left them exposed to the tropical heat. </PARA>
<PARA> The men who fled were not all civilians. Among them were many subject to a military discipline that was in tatters. Those who did not flee included nearly 250 men and women, Australian, British and American, black and white, near-black and near-white, whose bodies were at the bottom of the harbour, or soaking in oil-drenched mud on the beaches, or lying shattered in inadequate shelters. </PARA>
<PARA> Darwin that day became Australia's Pearl Harbour, centre of debacle in the tragedy of war without equal on Australian soil. Appropriately to the analogy, the Japanese task force which wrought this havoc was part of the same force, with identical leaders, which started the Pacific war. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing of Darwin will be on 19 February next year. That important event will be recognised by many civilian families and many service-related people throughout Australia. The account that I have just read describes just one of the 60 bombing raids on Darwin that occurred during World War II. I have used this quotation on a few occasions as it vividly describes the need for Australia to protect our northern coast. </PARA>
<PARA> I was therefore very disappointed to read the speech given by the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, to the Melbourne Press Club on 22 May 1991-just a week ago-when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The north of Australia is the only place we can be attacked with air cover and no-one will attack without air cover, and it's an extremely inhospitable and difficult place in which to attack. Your first problem if you landed five divisions in the north of Australia and went a thousand miles is half your equipment would be down, you've extended your logistic and supply lines by a thousand miles and with all due respect to people of the north of Australia, I'm not advocating a Brisbane line incidentally, you really achieve nothing in strategic aims. </PARA>
<PARA>There seems to be some dichotomy of opinion between what Senator Ray was saying a week ago and the initiatives and moves announced this afternoon. I might add that over 2,000 miles separates Darwin from the major cities in the south, and that Jakarta in Indonesia is closer than most of these. Half of this continent is 1,000 miles south of the north coastline. I am sure that many will agree with me when I say that is not just the way in which we should be defending our northern shores which is important. </PARA>
<PARA> The north of Australia has for some time provided a major proportion of Australia's overall economic wealth. In return, the north traditionally has not had the same amount of revenue spent in the region, especially when the population centres remain on the southern and eastern seaboards of Australia. The numbers moving north are an encouragement in that the Government is at last looking to the north as an important area and an important initiative. We need always to be aware that moving large numbers of people by any forced change in their social environment and natural habitat will produce sociological and many other costs, not only to individual families but to governments, and I believe that there needs to be a much greater emphasis in the cooperation between the Australian defence forces and, therefore, the Commonwealth Government and the governments of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is important that these changes are totally integrated within the social system, but I do not get the impression from the statements made today that sufficient priority has been given in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to some of the answers I received during the recent 1990-91 Senate Estimates Committee hearing from the Department of Defence. I refer to the completion dates for housing works of the Second Cavalry Regiment. I note that the original scheduled project completion date was September 1992 and that that has now been extended until December 1992. I certainly hope that there will be no further slippage to the construction program as this infrastructure will be necessary to accommodate the personnel and their families in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of concern to me that the figures in this statement by the Minister, and some of the associated documents, do not stack up. As the Australian economy dips further into the Labor Government's induced recession, we need to be sure that we are not just being given pious promises and convenient words that seek to change a defence statement without the backup and commitment particularly in those areas of finances. As I said earlier, I am pleased with the Government's proposal for troop movements and the emphasis to the north, and I am sure that my constituency in the Northern Territory will welcome this particular move, fraught with many problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Minister will address those issues that are much more national in their perspective and that the other areas highlighted by Senator Durack and other senators will be addressed. I look forward to what I am sure will be many continuing debates on this topic in the near future, not in the twenty-first century for which Senator Ray seems to think he has cast the die.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Senator Cook, I present the Government's response to the report of the Select Committee on Animal Welfare on Intensive Livestock Production. I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard and to move a motion in relation to the document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE</PARA>
<PARA>SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ANIMAL WELFARE</PARA>
<PARA>ON INTENSIVE LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA>PREAMBLE</PARA>
<PARA>1. The Report by the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare on Intensive Livestock Production, tabled on 21 August 1990, has been considered by the Government. This report is the sixth by the Committee and addresses questions of husbandry practices and housing standards which have caused concern and debate within the community in recent years. The Government is now in a position to respond to the report. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The Report contains forty one (41) recommendations. The Committee's recommendations form the basis for improvement in welfare aspects of the relevant industries and generally take account of the interests of animal welfarists and producers. </PARA>
<PARA>3. The Commonwealth Government will move quickly to implement those recommendations which it supports and which fall within its responsibilities. However, the matters considered by the Committee in this Report relate primarily to areas which are outside the control of the Commonwealth Government, which has brought these recommendations to the attention of State and Territory Ministers through the Australian Agriculture Council. While recognising that responsibility for deciding whether or not to implement these recommendations rests primarily with the industries and the State and Territory Governments concerned, the Commonwealth Government urges that a nationally consistent approach be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>4. The Australian Agricultural Council provides a mechanism for monitoring the implementation of the Report at a national level and achieving as consistent an approach as possible. The Standing Committee on Agriculture reports to the Council. There is a Sub-Committee on Animal Welfare which reports to the Animal Health Committee of the Standing Committee on Agriculture. This Sub-Committee on Animal Welfare (SCAW) develops and reviews Model Codes of Practice for animal welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>5. The Senate Committee has generally supported the need to examine alternative or modified housing systems for intensive industries and the Government believes that these should be adopted as soon as evidence of their welfare advantages can be confirmed under Australian conditions. The report itself makes recommendations for further research and review on improving the welfare of pigs and poultry. I will be requesting the Chairpersons of the Pig Research and Development Corporation, the Egg Industry Research and Development Council and the Chicken Meat Research and Development Council to ensure that the required research is carried out. This research will be a vital underpinning of the development and review of Codes of Practice by SCAW.</PARA>
<PARA>6. Funding of the Commonwealth rural industry research and development bodies is from industry levies matched dollar for dollar by the Commonwealth Government up to 0.5% of the gross value of production of the relevant industry. Therefore, the greater the industry funding, the greater is the Commonwealth matching of research and development expenditure. It is to be hoped that the relevant industries will see the benefits of welfare research under Australian conditions and raise their contributions accordingly, unless the additional research can be accommodated from reserves or a reordering of research priorities. While the Government does not determine which individual projects are funded I would expect the annual operational plans and five year research and development plans, to be submitted by these research and development bodies for my approval, to include an appropriate level of research devoted to the welfare of the animals on which the industry is based.</PARA>
<PARA>7. It must also be recognised that these Commonwealth research and development bodies are not the sole research funding organisations and that the States and private sector also have a role and responsibility. Clearly there is a place for a co-ordinated research effort and in this respect the Commonwealth research and development bodies are well positioned to ensure there is an effective network of welfare-related research into intensive animal production. </PARA>
<PARA>8. Public attitudes have been instrumental in driving the welfare debate in relation to such matters as intensive livestock production methods. The public also bears some of the cost of change in welfare practices. Part of this cost comes from the involvement of Governments in funding welfare research. Other costs will appear in the market. Some of the Committee's recommendations such as those on poultry housing could be expected to increase the cost of production, and therefore the retail price of eggs. There is little evidence yet of a substantial willingness in the community to pay the extra cost. </PARA>
<PARA>9. The Government considers that poultry and pig producer organisations, research and development bodies, State and Territory government extension officers, and educational institutions all have an important role to play in spreading awareness of developments in available housing techniques and in public attitudes. In particular they can prepare producers for changes in production systems made necessary by changing welfare standards. State governments and producer organisations have a particular role in ensuring adherence to Codes of Practice. </PARA>
<PARA>10. An aspect of the Report which has caused some confusion is a lack of distinction between types of laying cages. The Government's response is based on the understanding that the term ``laying cage'' refers to the conventional laying cages, rather than to modified cages incorporating design features such as perches, nesting or dusting boxes or get-away areas. </PARA>
<PARA>11. Chapters eight (8) and thirteen (13) of the Report address the welfare problems encountered during the transport of poultry and pigs. The Government notes that the Senate Select Committee is conducting inquiries into the transport of livestock and expects that these issues will be given further consideration in that forum. </PARA>
<PARA>12. Chapter fourteen (14) of the Report focuses on the need for improved stockmanship as a means of improving the welfare of intensively produced animals. The Government notes that research has shown that poor stockmanship can lead to animals experiencing chronic stress and the possibility of negative effects on production. It is recognised that the way in which stock are handled, not just their physical environment, is crucial to their well-being. The importance of a comfortable working environment for stockpeople is also recognised as important in achieving effective stockmanship. </PARA>
<PARA>13. The Government notes the Senate Select Committee's commendation for establishing the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare (NCCAW) and the hope that it will continue to be enabled to perform its functions effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>14. I am now in a position to provide the Government's response to each of the Senate Select Committee's individual recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Committee recommends that research funding bodies ensure that all intensive livestock production studies and specific animal welfare related research methodologies take an integrated approach to problems addressed so that findings contain elements of matters relating to housing environment, animal reaction to it, specific management issues, and animal/human interaction. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will approach the Pig Research and Development Corporation (PRDC), the Egg Industry Research and Development Council (EIRDC) and the Chicken Meat Research and Development Council (CMRDC) regarding implementation of this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>THE DOMESTIC FOWL</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Committee recommends that as an initial step the maximum stocking density for cages with three or more birds be reduced from 52 kilograms per square metre to 46 kilograms per square metre. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the principle of decreasing the stocking density for poultry housed in laying cages and notes that the stocking density recommended has been incorporated in the revised Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Poultry which has been reviewed by SCAW, under the auspices of the Australian Agricultural Council. At the same time the Government recognises that further research and review of existing information is required. The Government will request the EIRDC to assess the available research, identify any further work required and arrange for the required research to be carried out under Australian conditions. The Government will also request SCAW to review stocking densities in the context of its commitment to review the model code of practice regularly to take account of advances in knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Committee favours a shift away from the current practice of calculating floor space per hen by kilogram of live-weight per unit of floor area and recommends that in future, the space allowance for hens be expressed in terms of square centimetres of floor area per bird. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Not supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that recommended stocking densities could not be completely adequately expressed in terms of floor area per bird alone nor in terms of live-weight per unit floor area alone. </PARA>
<PARA>The former (floor area per bird) does not allow for the differing space requirements of birds of different breeds and ages and therefore size. The latter (live-weight per unit floor area) must be adjusted to make allowance for the number of birds involved (more birds per cage will require comparatively less space because they ``pack'' more efficiently, a fact being taken into account in the revision of the Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Poultry). Ideally it should also be adjusted for the fact that a bird which is a good deal lighter than another will not be proportionally smaller in its linear dimensions, and is likely to require almost as much space for some of its behaviours as the larger bird (its wings may be nearly as long, for example). </PARA>
<PARA>The ideal is probably a table of acceptable live-weights per floor area taking into account both the numbers of birds in the cage and the weight of the birds. </PARA>
<PARA>The revised Model Code of Practice gives recommended live-weights per area taking into account the number of birds in the cage but not the weight of the birds. The Government will be continuing to liaise with SCAW on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA> 4. To give effect to the Committee's objective of addressing the need for further reductions in stocking densities for hens the Committee recommends the following reforms:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that each cage have a minimum area for each bird of:</PARA>
<PARA>1000 square centimetres where one hen is kept in a cage;</PARA>
<PARA>750 square centimetres where two hens are kept in a cage;</PARA>
<PARA>600 square centimetres where three hens are kept in a cage; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that an early date of effect be introduced for new cages with a phasing-in period to apply for existing systems. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>As noted in relation to Recommendation 2, the Government believes that research will be necessary to refine recommendations for appropriate stocking densities under Australian conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The Committee recommends that the stocking densities for laying hens be regularly reviewed by the Sub-Committee on Animal Welfare of the Animal Health Committee within the Australian Agricultural Council. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals-Poultry is currently under revision and SCAW has delayed finalisation of the Code in order to include considerations raised in the Senate Committee report. </PARA>
<PARA>Regular review of stocking density is recommended in the Code of Practice, and the Government will encourage SCAW to take into account such factors as the type and weight of birds, new cage designs, results of new research, levels of investment in cages and the economic life of cages. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The Committee recommends that more regular inspections of commercial establishments be undertaken by the appropriate authorities to monitor husbandry practices generally and to ensure that stocking densities do not exceed those specified in the Code of Practice for the domestic fowl. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation will be referred to the States and Territories for implementation as considered appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The Committee, recognising the significant welfare benefits that may derive from the introduction of innovative cage design, recommends that the Commonwealth Government provide tax incentives to encourage farmers to invest in cages incorporating improved design features. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Not supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is of the opinion that tax incentives would be unlikely to achieve significant desired results, ie welfare improvements, and is concerned that any such move would result in distorted investment decisions by producers to the detriment of overall farm management. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Committee recommends that the banning of laying cages be considered when it can be demonstrated that viable alternative systems can be developed suitable to Australian conditions and that these alternative systems have positive welfare advantages. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government would expect that an economically realistic phasing-in period would be allowed should an alternative system be developed which is viable from a technical, economic and welfare viewpoint. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA> 9. The Committee recommends that a combination of cage and non-cage production systems be continued with market forces dictating the relative market share of the different systems. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government feels that it is desirable that the relative market share be determined in the context of public and producer sectors well informed about the available alternatives. The public should also be able to feel confident that product is described accurately. For example consumers need to have confidence in the legitimacy of eggs marketed as ``free range''. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>10. The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government fund a research project in Australia to examine and evaluate alternative housing systems that may be suitable to Australian conditions and that this review:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) examine overseas research findings into alternative housing systems;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) assess the welfare benefits and any welfare disadvantages of such systems;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) evaluate the economic viability of alternative systems; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) consult with poultry producers, State Governments, the veterinary profession and specialist ethnologists, both in the initial and subsequent stages of the project. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the concept of further research on these matters but expects that such projects will be funded from existing sources. This would include the Commonwealth research and development program jointly funded by an egg industry levy on laying chickens and matching Commonwealth contributions. The Government will approach the EIRDC, State and Territory Governments and the Australian Vice Chancellors' Committee (AVCC) regarding funding and implementation of this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>11. The Committee believes that beak trimming should only be performed by competent operators and recommends that more formal training and supervision be introduced by the poultry industry for beak trimmers so that improved standards of practice may be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Code of Practice states that beak trimming should be carried out by a competent operator. </PARA>
<PARA>It is possible that training schemes could be run through the Technical and Further Education system, or in-house schemes could be run by producers themselves. State and Territory Governments, education institutions and producers would be responsible for implementation of this recommendation, as they consider appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is concerned at the evidence which suggests that the beak trimming practice causes nerve anomalies in the beak stump and possible chronic pain. Accordingly, the Government wishes to see efforts continue to reduce the need for the operation, through the breeding of less aggressive strains for example. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>12. The Committee recommends that only humane methods of induced moulting be utilised and notes, with approval, the preferred method of feeding barley ad libitum. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government encourages further research into humane methods of inducing moulting. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>13. The Committee believes that moulting practices that deprive birds of food or water for excessive periods cannot be justified on welfare grounds and recommends that the starvation method of induced moulting be prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the prohibition of deprivation of food and water and notes that this recommendation has been included in the current revision of the Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Poultry by SCAW. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>14. The Committee recommends that the information contained in the Codes of Practice for road transport of livestock be more widely disseminated by government extension services, poultry companies, transport operators and the veterinarian profession. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes that the Code of Practice for road and rail transport is currently being revised. Once the new version is prepared copies should be made available and applied as soon as possible. The Government recognises that declining resources in the extension area have made dissemination of codes generally a more difficult process and has been investigating ways of promulgating their contents via the media in particular. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>15. The Committee believes that sufficient resources should be provided to ensure that the provisions of the Code are enforced and recommends that additional manpower resources be provided to each State and Territory Department of Agriculture to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Codes of Practice for road transport of livestock. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>Implementation of this recommendation would be a matter for the individual State and Territory Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>BROILER CHICKENS</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>16. The Committee recommends that the maximum stocking densities for broilers in sheds be set at a rate consistent with the live-weight of the birds immediately prior to processing to ensure that overcrowding does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Not supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes that stocking rates will be higher during the growth period and that numbers of birds are regularly thinned at different stages of development to maintain optimum stocking rates. Consequently it would be inappropriate to base stocking rates throughout the growth period on the live-weight immediately before processing. However the Government appreciates the Senate Committee's concern and will ask the CMRDC to evaluate the existing research into optimal pre-processing stocking densities and if necessary arrange for further research. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>17. The Committee recommends that the stocking densities for broiler chickens be regularly reviewed by the Sub-Committee on Animal Welfare of the Animal Health Committee within the Australian Agricultural Council. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals-Poultry is currently under revision. Mechanisms for regular revision are being incorporated in the Code. SCAW has recognised the need for regular revisions of all the Codes of Practice based on developing research. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>18. The Committee believes that all slaughtering practices should ensure a humane death and that as to the methods of slaughter, other than by decapitation, the Committee recommends that in all instances broiler chickens be stunned prior to slaughter in accordance with the guidelines laid down in the Code of Practice for poultry at slaughtering establishments. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes, however, that excluding decapitation from the general requirement to stun birds before slaughter may not be warranted as decapitation does not necessarily mean instantaneous loss of consciousness nor absence of trauma. The Government will ask SCAW to consider this question in its current review of the Code of Practice in relation to slaughter. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>19. The Committee recommends that research be conducted into effective means of stunning in an effort to overcome the problems associated with the current methods. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will refer this recommendation to the CMRDC for action. </PARA>
<PARA>PIGS</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>20. The Committee recommends that the Pig Research Council actively encourage research to address the cost equation associated with capital costs of pig housing and loss of production with a view to clarifying some welfare stress issues. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation will be passed on to the PRDC. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>21. The Committee recommends that the maximum recommended stocking densities for growing and adult pigs in groups be reviewed to take account of the advances in understanding of physiology and behaviour and the welfare consequences of pen space, stocking rates and group sizes. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Code of Practice for the Welfare of the Pig is currently being revised to take into account such advances since the Code was initially produced. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>22. The Committee recommends that future trends in housing the dry sow should be away from individually-confined stall systems and that this be reflected in the Codes of Practice for the welfare of the pig. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the principle of reviewing housing for pigs as further information on the welfare implications of different systems becomes available. The Pig Research and Development Corporation is currently funding research to determine the feasibility of such change. The Government is concerned that research must confirm any net welfare advantages of abandoning individual stall systems. Research suggests that individual systems, properly implemented without overcrowding, can have welfare advantages in reducing aggression and ensuring that each pig receives the appropriate amount of feed for its individual circumstances. There are greater demands in terms of stockmanship in group systems than in individual systems, especially in attending to the health and feeding of individual pigs. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>23. The Committee recommends that the tethering of sows be banned. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>Acceptance and implementation will be a matter for the States and Territories. The Government supports the principle of allowing pigs the maximum opportunity for free movement and behaviour. Problems have been reported with neck tether systems when animals are forced to lie with their heads close together and less dominant animals cannot withdraw as they usually do. However stalls can be designed so that they can withdraw if they wish. Also it is possible to have a system of tether housing in which physical and social contact and range of movement is quite adequate. The advantages of individual attention, already noted above, can also be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>24. The Committee, noting that sow size has increased over the years, recommends that immediate attention be given to ensure that stall and farrowing crates currently in use do not cause suffering due to cramping. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>Acceptance and implementation will be a matter for the States and Territories. The Government notes in this respect that manufacturers have been producing stalls and crates that reflect the increased size of sows. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>25. The Committee recommends that the Codes of Practice for the pig be revised to ensure stalls and crates reflect the body dimensions of large sows. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals-the Pig is currently being revised by SCAW, and issues such as this will be considered. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>26. On the issue of farrowing crates, noting that piglet mortality due to sow overlay is a major welfare consideration, the Committee recommends the encouragement of some producer pilot systems to test the ability of designs which allow sows more freedom of movement and access to a separate exercise area at least some time each day. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government understands that some such designs are currently being tested in research institutions and some commercial enterprises. Interaction between producers and producer organisations and researchers will help address the substance of this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>27. The Committee recommends that governments and the industry encourage the adoption of alternative approaches to accommodating sows through their various stages and the improvement in husbandry skills needed to avoid welfare problems. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>Implementation of this recommendation is largely a matter for State and Territory governments, and possibly producer organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>28. The Committee questions the management practice of birth induction and recommends that the welfare implications of prostaglandin use be investigated.</PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will encourage research into the welfare implications of the use of prostaglandin through the PRDC. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government recognises that there may be welfare advantages for both the sow and piglets in using prostaglandin for birth induction, in that this may facilitate the involvement of stockpeople in the farrowing process. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>29. The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government fund a research project in Australia to examine and evaluate housing systems that may be suitable to Australian conditions and that this review:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) examine overseas research findings into alternative housing systems;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) assess the welfare benefits and any welfare disadvantages of such systems;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) evaluate the economic viability of alternative systems; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) take account of the views of producers, industry service providers, design engineers and specialist ethnologists. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the concept of further research on these matters but expects that such projects will be funded from existing sources. The Government will approach the PRDC as well as the State and Territory Governments and the AVCC regarding funding and implementation of this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>30. The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government provide tax incentives to encourage producers to upgrade their systems to incorporate improved design features to improve pig welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Not supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is of the opinion that tax incentives would be unlikely to achieve significant desired results, ie welfare improvements, and is concerned that any such move would result in distorted investment decisions by producers to the detriment of overall farm management. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>31. The Committee recommends that the appropriate authorities ensure that regular inspections of intensive pig production units be undertaken to monitor husbandry practices generally and to ensure that stocking densities do not exceed those specified in the Code of Practice for the welfare of the pig. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation will be referred to the States and Territories for implementation as considered appropriate by the relevant authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>32. The Committee, noting that taildocking involves some pain and stress, recommends that stockpersons are properly trained in the procedure, so that the task is undertaken with dexterity and with as little trauma to the pig as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>State and Territory Governments, education institutions and producers would be responsible for implementation of this recommendation, as they consider appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>33. The Committee recommends that further research into the causal factors of tailbiting be undertaken as the issue is so closely linked to overall aspects of pig welfare in close confinement production. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation will be passed on to the PRDC and to the States and Territories for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>34. The Committee is surprised at the high susceptibility to infection which apparently occurs in intensive systems and noting the emphasis placed on health benefits of intensive production recommends that further research be conducted into the underlying reasons for infection that necessitates teeth clipping. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation will be passed on to the PRDC and to the States and Territories for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>35. The Committee, noting the importance of a multi-sector approach to strategies to minimise stress, deaths, and decrease yield and quality losses during post-farm handling of pigs, recommends a State and Territory-wide multi-sectoral review of off-farm handling of pigs with a view to upgrading existing codes of practice and disseminating information to service providers, producers, transporters, abattoirs and other interested parties. The review process should take account of the views of animal welfare organisations and specialist ethnologists. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is aware that the Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals-the Pig is currently being reviewed by SCAW and will draw this recommendation to the attention of the working group responsible for that review. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>36. The Committee recommends that in addition to ensuring that information is widely disseminated on the proper handling of pigs from farm loading to slaughter, adequate monitoring should also be undertaken to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Codes of Practice associated with the transport and slaughter of livestock. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes, however, that ensuring the effective dissemination of and compliance with animal welfare requirements is largely a matter for State and Territory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>THE WAY FORWARD</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>37. The Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that the subject of animal behaviour be recognised as an integral component of the curriculum in agricultural and veterinary colleges in Australia, especially as a component of welfare;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the development of certificate training courses for stockpersons in the pig and poultry industries by Technical and Further Education and agricultural college courses;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) funding initiatives be developed to support skills training of stockpersons unable to gain access to formal training courses; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the Pig Industry Research Council, the Chicken Meat Research Council and the Egg Industry Research Council give greater priority to welfare-related stockmanship research. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will encourage the research councils and corporations to address the issue of welfare-related research on stockmanship. </PARA>
<PARA>The States and Territories, and the producers themselves, are primarily responsible for the implementation of educational aspects of this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>38. The Committee also recommends that the Codes of Practice be revised to take account of advances in the understanding of the importance of stockmanship in the welfare of animals in intensive systems. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is aware that the relationship between stockperson and livestock is vital to welfare and productivity. It will draw the importance of this point to the attention of SCAW, which is currently reviewing the relevant Codes of Practice. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>39. The Committee recommends that to ensure that the Codes of Practice remain relevant there should be continuing revisions as appropriate and major reviews every five years to take account of technological changes in husbandry practices, including advances in the understanding of domestic fowl and pig physiology and behaviour, and to reflect prevailing community attitudes. Codes should include statements on the importance of suitable education and training in maximum welfare in intensive systems. The review process should take account of the views of the industries, industry service providers, consumer and animal welfare organisations, and specialist ethnologists. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government understands that SCAW has undertaken to review all the Codes of Practice for the Welfare of Animals on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>40. Noting that each State and Territory Government has the responsibility to implement policies and enact and upgrade existing legislation which it thinks will best enhance animal welfare within its jurisdiction the Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) legislation for the prevention of cruelty to animals and other relevant Acts specify that Codes of Practice for the welfare of animals must be followed; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that State and Territory Governments around Australia develop a complementary legislative and regulatory approach to animal welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government recognises that there are both positive and negative aspects of including Codes of Practice in legislation and the question is under consideration by the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare. Areas of concern include the possibility of pressure to lower the standards in the Codes to the lowest common denominator; the risk of making standards inflexible; the problem of encouraging compliance with the letter rather than the spirit of the law and the added cost of administration. As noted in the recommendation the issue of legislation and regulation to embody and ensure compliance with Codes of Practice is a matter for State and Territory governments. However the Government would welcome a consistent, standardised approach to animal welfare regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA>41. Noting that standards are set for a range of commodities which are released onto the market the Committee recommends that governments with responsibility in this area develop standards for new and modified animal husbandry systems. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Supported in principle. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will consult further with the States and Territories with regard to implementation of this recommendation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion that the Senate take note of this document because it is a response to a report that took a lot of time and effort on behalf of the Select Committee on Animal Welfare. The Committee issued this report to the Government in June last year, so it has taken almost one year for the Government to respond to it. However, in reading the Government's response, I believe that it has been worth the wait. If success is rated by how many recommendations are accepted by the Government, it would seem that the Committee has done very well, because 37 out of the 41 recommendations have been accepted, either totally or in principle, by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This report evolved over a number of years. During that time the Committee's membership changed several times, necessitating the retaking of evidence and the re-examination of some of the issues. The basic question the Committee was faced with in this inquiry was whether we should continue to allow intensive production of poultry-the so-called battery production-and internal concentrated housing for pigs. Both issues have aroused considerable hostility and public demonstrations over the years. Additionally, legislation has been passed in some other countries, notably Switzerland and the Netherlands, to phase out or totally ban intensive poultry production and revert to the free range situation. However, despite some obvious visible problems associated with intensive housing for poultry, the Committee found that, in many instances, free range situations were far worse than the intensive system with animals in cages. Scientific evidence actually supported this view. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the Committee came out in favour of a continuation of the present situation, with modifications, until, at such time as is viable, less intensive systems can be developed. I note that researchers in Britain now support our view. A recent article headed `Battery cages are ``better for hens'' ' in the British magazine This Week states:</PARA>
<PARA>Britain was warned against banning battery cages for chickens at a conference in London last week. Veterinarians and experts from the poultry industry said that alternatives for housing laying hens caused more suffering than the cages.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on the article stated that chickens kept in new-style barns or percheries suffer greater hardship than in the battery-type situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than outlining what the Government agrees with in the report, I will concentrate on those areas with which it disagrees. For both the pig and poultry industries, it has rejected recommendations to provide tax incentives to encourage producers to upgrade their systems. I am not surprised that it has refused to provide any form of assistance to the rural industry. It would be totally outside the character of this Government to do that, and I accept that it has refused to consider it. However, its rationale that it might provide distorted investment decisions could be applied to any industry where tax incentives are provided. I believe that its argument is weak, but I have to accept that that is the view of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> On stocking densities, we recommended a shift away from the current practice of calculating floor space per hen by kilogram of live weight per unit of floor area. We recommended that in future the space allowance for hens be expressed in square centimetres of floor area per bird. The Government did not accept this recommendation. The Committee adopted that recommendation after much discussion with the industry on a feasible and affordable alternative to the present system. It is not for me to say whether the industry has now changed its mind because of cost considerations or whether the Department came to that view. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, while economic considerations cannot be ignored by the Committee, it is important that welfare considerations take precedence, as with this particular recommendation. In any event, it will cost producers to upgrade their facilities. That is no reason, however, to suggest that producers should not do it. That is why the Committee thought a tax incentive might encourage producers to upgrade facilities faster than they might otherwise have done. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that Mr Acting Deputy President is leaving the chair. I take this opportunity to commend Senator Burns on the job he is doing as Chairman of the Select Committee on Animal Welfare. He has at heart the interests of what he is doing on that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The opinion of the Committee was that much greater use should be made of tax incentives to upgrade facilities faster than might otherwise have occurred. On the question of stocking densities for broiler production, I am not personally convinced that stocking rates at the late stages of production are appropriate. To my inexpert eye, some sheds we inspected looked crowded. I would have thought a stocking density based on weight would be an appropriate method of reducing numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased at least that the Government has asked the Chicken Meat Research and Development Council to look at the situation and that it has also supported our recommendation that the relevant committees within the Australian Agricultural Council examine the question. I note that the annual report of the Agricultural Council that was tabled yesterday also referred to that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As an overview of the report, I believe the relevant industries have accepted the general thrust of the report, although with some criticisms, while some of the more extreme animal activist groups have rejected it outright. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of battery hen versus free-range egg production has raged for some time. It always intrigues me that those who support free-range production never acknowledge that free-range is hardly ideal either. In fact, on an inspection of free-range facilities in Sydney, the hens looked nowhere near as happy as the ones in good housing conditions in their properly constructed cages. </PARA>
<PARA> Man's use of animals must and does, of necessity, involve compromise. Animal welfare is the parameter by which we try to determine how best these animals can be utilised. In the pig industry, for example, some recommendations received some acknowledgment from the Government. One recommendation was on the issue of farrowing crates. We said that piglet mortality due to sow overlay is a major welfare consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended the encouragement of some producer pilot systems to test the ability of designs which allow sows more freedom of movement and access to a separate exercise area at least some time each day. It is pleasing to note that the Government actually supported that in principle. The Committee understands that some designs are currently being tested in research institutions and some commercial enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> An interaction between producers and producer organisations and researchers will help address the substance of these recommendations. That is something the Committee has been pushing in all its inquiries for a long time. Interaction is basically about people, research and education coming together for the betterment of animal welfare. We have attempted to do that in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> On balance, I believe we have produced an appropriate plan for improved conditions for both the pig and poultry industries. As I have said in this place and elsewhere before, we can make all the rules, we can write all the recommendations and the codes of practice, we can do all that we like, State governments can legislate all that they like, but at the end of the day it comes down to the individual and stockmanship, which is still the most important and paramount issue in any animal industry. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot legislate for good husbandry; one can only educate for good husbandry. One cannot ensure that animals are treated properly by everyone at all times. The reason that we have institutions like the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is to ensure that people do the right thing in different places. All I can hope for is to educate people on what animal welfare encompasses and why it is important. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to thank my staff for the help they have given me in compiling some of the work that we have done on this report. Our staffs do a lot of work at different times in helping us behind the scenes. I pay particular tribute to Sue Carney in my office for the work she has done in helping me in all my work on the animal welfare issues in my role as Deputy Chairman of the Animal Welfare Committee. I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend to the Senate as warranting attention the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory relating to the proposed transport system between the new town of Gungahlin and Canberra. I shall not speak in detail. Every report that I have been associated with emanating from this Committee in the 10 years that I have been here has come at a time of year when we have been pressed for time. But I want to refer briefly to some of the matters within it and say why this report is important. </PARA>
<PARA> In the next 10 years, a lot of people will be living in Gungahlin. There will be considerable traffic movement between Gungahlin and Canberra. The proposals and expectations are set out in the report. Out of an expected population of 85,000 living in the area, approximately 40,000 will be in paid employment. It is clearly important that they have easy access to Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals for roads put before us by the National Capital Planning Authority were looked at bearing in mind that Canberra had to be retained as the bush capital, which most people enjoy and want retained, with a transport system that moved people reasonably to and from Gungahlin. The Committee made nine recommendations, some of which with substantial subdivisions. We hope the Government of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) will examine those recommendations when it makes its decisions on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The report sets out the principals used in coming to these recommendations. In addition, chapter five contains summaries and priorities, in which we refer to the need for a public transport system of a high standard. The report also recommends looking into the possibility of a rapid transit system. We also referred to the report that was issued in Canberra recently dealing with the benefit of a rapid transit system, which we hope will be built early enough to attract people to it. </PARA>
<PARA> We refer to the use of private cars, the routes which people are likely to want, the impact on north Canberra of there not being an adequate peripheral system and, in particular, to the John Dedman corridor and Monash Drive. We recognise the need for residents in Gungahlin to have access to Canberra via the John Dedman corridor. We rejected, though, the route which would take John Dedman Drive to the east of Black Mountain because of the impact that we believe it would have on the woodland areas on the edge of the city, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and, in particular, the Botanic Gardens. We recommend that it proceed on the other side of Black Mountain, and we have dealt with the two options on that side of the mountain. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I shall not go through the report in detail. It is a report which is easy to read and which sets out clearly the principles we used in coming to our decision. The report reflects the unanimous view of the Committee. I commend it to those involved with planning in the ACT and those who will be making the decisions as to the future transport needs of Canberra when this part of the city is developed. </PARA>
<PARA> We were greatly helped by the work of the secretary of the Committee, Mr Grant Harrison, and the administrative officer, Mrs Marlene Lyons. As they do not work full time with our Committee, they have to balance their other commitments as well. I am pleased that we have been able to produce this report and present it within this time frame. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Thursday 30 May 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Committee's fifty-fourth general report covers the activities of two Public Works Committees during 1990-the 29th Committee and the 30th Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Twelve reports were tabled during the year dealing with a diversity of projects ranging from the over the horizon radar to the refurbishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia in Sydney. The estimated cost of proposals reported on by the Committee was 559 million dollars, down from 1.1 billion dollars in 1989, but that was a record year. </PARA>
<PARA>In all, the Committees met on 44 occasions during the year to conduct public hearings, carry out inspections, consider reports and other matters. </PARA>
<PARA>The report raises a number of matters of concern to the Committee. The first matter concerns overseas works. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee conducted a public hearing in Canberra into the proposed construction of Australian High Commission and Defence Housing in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. The Committee is concerned that it is precluded by the Public Works Committee Act from travelling overseas to inspect locations and sites of proposed facilities and to have informal discussions with local staff and authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Instead, very often local embassy staff and design and construction personnel are required to travel to Canberra from overseas to appear at the Committee's public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee suggests that it may be more cost-effective for it to be permitted to travel to countries where new Australian embassy and high commission projects are proposed. Adequate local knowledge is important to the Committee, and very often this cannot be simply gleaned from video productions and written submissions. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the Committee has written to the Minister for Administrative Services requesting that the Act be amended. The second matter concerns what are called urgent works. In May the House of Representatives agreed to exempt the proposed construction of the Australian Pavilion at Expo 92 in Seville, Spain from Committee scrutiny on the grounds of urgency. The motion was made under the provisions of section 18(8) (b) of the Public Works Committee Act. There was apparently uncertainty amongst agencies responsible for planning the proposed work about the applicability of the Public Works Committee Act to this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the exemption of the work the Committee received an assurance from the Minister for Administrative Services that in future situations where doubt exists regarding the applicability of the Act, the Committee would be consulted at the earliest opportunity to ensure that possible parliamentary action is not precluded. </PARA>
<PARA>The third matter concerns energy targets and energy audits. The Committee has requested that sponsoring departments and design and construction authorities set achievable energy targets and thereby not design buildings requiring unusually large and unjustifiable amounts of energy for lighting and climate control. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I would like to make a few remarks about a number of changes in the Committee's membership and secretariat staffing. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was saddened to learn of the death in January 1990 of a former Secretary, Dick Fenton. Dick Fenton was secretary to the Committee from October 1972 until his retirement in July 1986. During this period he was involved in more than 150 inquiries and attended the Committee at public hearings and private meetings on more than 500 occasions. He served five Chairmen and eight Committees. This, his record of achievement and service to the Parliament, speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA>During 1990 a number of Members left the Committee. Clarrie Millar, the former Member for Wide Bay retired from Parliament after a long and distinguished career, first as Deputy Speaker and then as Vice-Chairman of the Committee. The Committee notes with pleasure that Clarrie was created a Member in the General Division of the Order of Australia on Australia Day 1991. The award was made for services to Parliament. I would like to think that this to some extent included his service to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>John Mountford and Senator Glen Sheil retired from Parliament in 1990 and George Gear and Bob Halverson left the Committee upon their elevation to the positions of Government and Opposition whips. Ali made substantial contributions to the work of the Committee and I thank them for it. </PARA>
<PARA>Work on the Committee for both Members and staff is demanding. The Public Works Committee has been exceptionally well served by the dedication and professional approach of the secretariat under the leadership of Peter Roberts. Other members of the staff are Patrick Regan and Michael Fetter, Assistant Secretaries, Sally Dunn and Jackie McConnell and Di Singleton, Secretarial Support. I thank them all. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I take this opportunity to speak on this unproclaimed legislation dated 29 May 1991. One of the reasons why I would like to speak on this is that it is a symbol and a constant reminder to us-the last time we had something like this was, I think, in the middle of November last year-of the role that the Senate can play and has played in bringing the Executive to heel and to task about its responsibilities. On 27 September 1988, the Senate agreed to the following motion without debate:</PARA>
<PARA> That there be laid on the Table of the Senate, on or before 25 November 1988, details of all provisions of Acts which come into effect on proclamation and which have not been proclaimed, together with a statement of reasons for their non-proclamation and a timetable for their operation. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators had become concerned at what seemed to be an increasing tendency for the Parliament to pass legislation with a provision delegating the right to bring such legislation into operation to the Executive without any limitation being imposed on the Executive's powers to delay the implementation of the legislation indefinitely. The order of the Senate, therefore, sought details of all legislation enacted by the Parliament since 1901, the reasons why the legislation had not come into operation and a timetable for its coming into force. The Government complied with that on 24 November 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators at the time were quite surprised at what they found. In fact, some 60 Acts, or sections thereof, were unproclaimed at the time the paper was tabled. We have seen quite a significant change since that time. Tonight we have before us 14 A4 pages with not 60, but still a considerable number of, unproclaimed Acts. There have been some changes. Some Acts have been added and some have gone off the list since last November. One innovation in this document that I have noted is that most of the Acts that are listed give a date of royal assent, which is quite useful and I would like to see that continued. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that concerns me is the rather strange comments from various departments about why their Acts have not been proclaimed. There are a number that I would like to raise, but I do not want to hold up the Senate and I will just give one example which seemed to me to be quite gobbledegookish. Regarding the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Act 1986, the document states:</PARA>
<PARA>The unproclaimed provisions are intended to enable Government nursing homes to be listed in a Gazette notice subject to Parliamentary disallowance rather than in regulations. However, section 139b of the National Health Act, which was to be amended by proclamation of section 22, was subsequently amended by another, separate provision, which rendered section 22 inoperable. A new amendment to section 139b to achieve the original purpose, along with a proposal to repeal the inoperable section 22, is expected to be introduced in the Parliament shortly. If this amendment is passed it will be possible to proclaim the above outstanding provisions of the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Act. </PARA>
<PARA>People trying to follow that legislation could understandably be a little confused as to why that particular section had not been proclaimed. Even that description leaves me a little confused. It seems to me that there is no clear thinking and planning ahead on the part of the Department, and we end up with that sort of confused statement. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other things that I thought was interesting and is of concern to me is that a couple of departments explained that they were not going to proclaim these Acts because they were out of date or because something else had happened and they would at some time in the future repeal or amend them. It seems to me that it would be very simple for a Minister to organise a short omnibus Bill to tidy up such things. In relation to the Health Legislation Amendment Act 1982 again, page 4 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Section 10 and 11 had not been proclaimed at that time and are redundant. It is intended to repeal these provisions as soon as space is made available in the Government's legislation program. </PARA>
<PARA>At the beginning of this session, when we did not have any business, we had hours to spare and the Ministers could at least have tidied up the legislation. On the same Act, page 5 states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is intended to repeal this provision as soon as space is made available in the Government's legislation program. </PARA>
<PARA>There are a couple of other examples where it is said that the legislation will be amended or repealed when the Government has time. I suggest that Ministers co-operate with each other and go through this document and, in an omnibus Bill, tie up the legislation so that we can deal with it very quickly at the beginning of the Budget session. It would be a very easy thing to do. I am sure-because I heard Senator Powell speak on this issue the last time the report came out-that we would be quite cooperative in assisting the Government in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing that concerned me in the report was that under the heading `Health Legislation Amendment Act 1986-section 5' on page 5, we see:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government expects to introduce legislation to amend this and related provisions in such a way that either the amended definition can be proclaimed or the existing provision can be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the Government should get on and do that. I hope it knew whether it was going to amend it or repeal it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I was saying, this document is testimony to the work that was done by former senators, particularly Senator Macklin and Senator Puplick who took a particular interest in unproclaimed legislation. Whereas we had 60 Acts that were not proclaimed, we now have a much smaller number and I think it is even a slightly smaller number than we had in November. Honourable senators should diligently look at them, and I recommend that, particularly in areas in which they have an interest, they address those particular ones and, if there is any chance of their bringing in amendments to tidy up that legislation, they could do so quite easily. That would be quite an interesting exercise for a backbencher or a midbencher, like myself. I will probably be doing that and looking at the areas that I could influence. I think this document is a credit and is another example of the role the Senate plays in reviewing and scrutinising legislation. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes amendments to a range of Acts dealing with Commonwealth criminal law. The most significant amendments are:</PARA>
<PARA>those which amend the Passports Act 1938 and the Crimes Act 1914 to introduce an effective procedure to ensure that the existing scheme under which the passports of persons charged with, or convicted of, certain serious offences, particularly drug offences, may be surrendered; and</PARA>
<PARA>those which amend the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 to enable information obtained under that Act to be provided to a foreign law enforcement agency to which the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 applies. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall briefly discuss each group of amendments proposed in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 2 contains several amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (AFP Act). The first of these will considerably widen the scope of the witness protection scheme. It is in line with the Government's concern to provide the maximum protection possible to people who are under threat as a consequence of witnessing or being present at an event, or because of their relationship with such witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment will remove any suggestion that witness protection arrangements apply only to people who have actually witnessed an event and are called to give evidence and not to their families who may be used as tools by the criminal element to orchestrate the witness's silence. </PARA>
<PARA>The second amendment will adapt the management initiated retirement scheme to overcome some practical difficulties. It allows compensation to be calculated after appointment where a determination was not validly made at the time of appointment to the AFP. Currently, a determination may only be made on appointment. It will also allow the Commissioner to end a person's appointment before the expiry of his or her term. Previously, the appointment could only be ended by the person who made the original appointment. This could create practical problems as the AFP employs over 3,000 people on terms of appointment from 5 to 10 years. It might therefore happen that the person making the original appointment was unavailable. </PARA>
<PARA>Parts 3 and 7 of the Bill amend the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 (The CTR Act) and make related amendments to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. Part 3 of the Bill contains a number of amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988. Many of these are of a minor nature and are intended to assist the Director of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency (the CTRA) in the performance of his functions under the Act and clarify the position of cash dealers in relation to certain matters. For example, subsection 16(1) of the CTR Act requires cash dealers to report to the CTRA those transactions which the cash dealer has reasonable grounds to suspect may be relevant to tax evasion, a Commonwealth offence or the enforcement of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. Subsection 16(5) provides protection against legal proceedings for cash dealers and their employees in relation to any action taken pursuant to section 16. </PARA>
<PARA>Concern has been expressed that, unless all the requisite preconditions set out in subsection 16(1) are strictly met, the cash dealer will not be able to claim the benefit of the protection against legal action contained in subsection 16(5). For example if a teller reports a particular transaction in the mistaken belief that it is relevant to tax evasion or to a Commonwealth offence, and after investigation, it is found to be relevant only to a State offence or to have an innocent explanation no action should lie against the teller. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsection 16 (5) is expressed as a bar to any proceedings against a cash dealer. This bar would preclude any action, even where the action is based on a report filed before commencement of the amendment and even if a court were to take the view that the existing provision did not bar such action. </PARA>
<PARA>Other amendments implement the recommendations of the Group of 7 industrialised nations (G7) Financial Action Task Force on Money-Laundering. Although not a member of the G7, Australia was invited to participate in the task force when it was established in July 1989, because of the comprehensive nature of our anti-money laundering measures. The task force made 40 recommendations on anti-money laundering initiatives which relate to greater vigilance by financial institutions and increased cooperation with law enforcement agencies through initiatives such as suspect transaction reporting and consideration of import/export reporting and significant cash transaction reporting together with law enforcement initiatives such as confiscation of proceeds of crime and mutual assistance at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia meets most of the requirements of the G7 recommendations because of the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 and associated changes in the practices and procedures of our financial institutions. There are, however, a number of recommendations which Australia must implement before achieving full compliance with the G7 recommendations. These include prohibiting cash dealers from disclosing the making of suspect transaction reports and permitting the international exchange of information concerning suspicious financial activity subject to appropriate confidentiality undertakings. These matters are addressed in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Financial Action Task Force now includes participants from the OECD, and most have endorsed the recommendations, there is a growing body of information available internationally which will significantly assist in providing evidence of the true nature and extent of criminal activity in Australia and render both prosecution and confiscation more effective. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill, therefore amends the CTR Act to provide that the Attorney-General is entitled to have access to CTR information for the purpose of transmission to a foreign country to which the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (``the MA Act'') applies. Where the AttorneyGeneral is given access to CTR information for this purpose, and he is satisfied that the foreign country has given appropriate undertakings as to confidentiality and control of the information, the Attorney-General may communicate that information to the foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposed amendments to the MA Act in Part 7 of the Bill permit regulations to be made, specifying a foreign country as a country to which the MA Act applies for the purpose of obtaining access to CTR information. Where such a country asks for such information the Attorney-General can direct the CTRA to give him access to that information for the purpose of complying with the request. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also amends the CTR Act to enable the Director of the CTRA to give access to CTR information to a wider range of domestic law enforcement agencies. These are the Independent Commission Against Corruption of NSW and the Criminal Justice Commission of Queensland. The ability to conduct financial investigations is central to the investigation of corruption, and the investigative functions of these bodies will be greatly assisted by access to CTR information. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains a provision requiring the Director to provide the Attorney-General with an annual report on the operation of the CTRA. The availability of annual reports will be of particular assistance to parliament when the operations of the CTR Act are reviewed in 1993 in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also contains several amendments to clarify the intention underlying the new federal sentencing legislation, which was enacted in the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act (No 2) 1989 and came into force on 17 July 1990. The amendments are required to clarify the circumstances in which non-parole periods and recognizance releases should be fixed. It is the intention of the legislation that, where the total federal sentence is less than 3 years and the court wishes the person to be released under supervision, the court can only make an order for the release of the person on recognizance. Where the aggregate sentence is greater than 3 years the intention of the legislation is that the courts be able to make either a recognizance release order or fix a non-parole period. Because there have been doubts expressed about the operation of the relevant sections, namely, sections l9AB, l9AC, l9AD and l9AE, these sections have been repealed and replaced. In addition, the opportunity has been taken to make a small number of minor technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Several Parts of the Bill amend provisions of the various Commonwealth Acts dealing with confiscation of assets. The Proceeds of Crime Act was enacted in 1987 and was a major new weapon for law enforcement in Australia. It is encouraging to note the increasing success of the new procedures introduced by the Act. Until 30 June 1990, recoveries and forfeiture under the Proceeds of Crime Act (and the related provisions of the Customs Act) have totalled nearly $7 million. In addition, the net value of property restrained to meet future orders was nearly $47 million as at 30 June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Since 1987 a number of decisions by courts exercising jurisdiction under the Act have shown that there is a need for minor modification of the Act. This Bill proposes those changes, and also proposes amendment of the corresponding provisions of the Customs Act and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act. The amendments are all of a minor policy nature and are discussed fully in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Honourable Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will make amendments to the National Crime Authority Act 1984 to give the A.C.T. Government the same status as the State and Northern Territory Governments and to allow it to participate in the activities of the Inter-Governmental Committee. This is appropriate now that the A.C.T. has responsibility for its own criminal matters. </PARA>
<PARA>The participation and co-operation of the A.C.T. in the activities of the NCA is essential to the national focus and scope of the authority's investigations. It is only the issuing of references by State and Territory Governments that provides the NCA with the powers necessary to investigate offences across State/Territory boundaries. The NCA operates as a co-operative national law enforcement agency. The inclusion of the A.C.T. in this process reflects the Territory's status within the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The A.C.T. is currently drafting its own underpinning legislation and the amendments to the Commonwealth legislation will not commence until the A.C.T. legislation is passed. If, however, the amendments are not proclaimed after 6 months they will be automatically repealed. This is to ensure that important NCA operations in the A.C.T. are not prejudiced by delays in the passage of the A.C.T. law. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of an initiative of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the Bill contains amendments to the Crimes Act and Passports Act which are designed to render more effective the existing power of the Minister under the Passports Act 1938 to cancel or refuse to issue a passport to persons charged with, or convicted of, a serious narcotics offence or other prescribed offence against a Commonwealth or Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 7b of the Passports Act already prevents an authorised passport officer from issuing a passport to a person if the officer has reason to believe that the person is, by order of a court or under a condition of parole, recognizance, surety or bail bond, to remain in Australia or to refrain from obtaining an Australian passport. The Act also provides that a passport, whether in the possession of the person to whom it was issued or not, can be cancelled by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments empower a court, when imposing bail or recognizance conditions or sentencing a person for such an offence, to order the person to remain in Australia, refrain from applying for an Australian passport, or to surrender any Australian passport. The order may be varied or revoked as the court sees fit. A copy of any order made by the court must be given to the department administering the Passports Act and the registrar must retain any passport surrendered until the order ceases to have effect or the passport is cancelled or expires. </PARA>
<PARA>As the proposed scheme was the subject of a reference to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the Bill inserts a new section in the Crimes Act designed to complement any state law empowering courts to make orders in relation to passport surrender. </PARA>
<PARA>The only change to the Passports Act contained in this Bill is to amend section 7b to provide additional grounds for the refusal of a passport where the requirement to remain in Australia is a condition of release by licence or any similar instrument of early release granted under State or Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA>The totality of these relatively minor amendments is in my view a significant strengthening of our legislation to ensure that persons charged with serious offences cannot evade detection and prosecution nor reap the benefits of their illegal activities. I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some brief remarks on this report which was presented in the last session by Senator Aulich. As Senator Tate is in the chamber, my comments will be particularly relevant. I refer to a section in the report which deals with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Education Office (PEO) and the work that this body does. The report goes into some detail about the many programs that the PEO undertakes. From my experience with the PEO and its programs, I am pleased that this report gives very strong endorsement to its work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report draws our attention to the fact that there are many things that can be done to make students and adults more aware of their role as citizens. I believe it is very important that more people understand and know about the Commonwealth Constitution. A number of surveys have been done and it is very worrying to see that only a small proportion of Australians have any knowledge at all of the written Constitution of this country, which has carried us through for over 90 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very pleased that recently Senator Tate made a speech-it was reported in the newspapers-in which he said that the Commonwealth Constitution had served this country well. I thought that that was a very important statement from Senator Tate. It is certainly a statement which I fully endorse. </PARA>
<PARA> In the follow through to this report and any considerations the Government might give to it, I would like to see what we can do to make sure that not only the 100,000 or so students who visit this Parliament House every year but the wider community are made more aware of the Constitution and its importance, and the massive achievement of our constitutional history. </PARA>
<PARA> David Smith, the former Secretary to the Governor-General, drew our attention to the fact that there are only five other countries in this world that have a longer continuous constitutional history of democracy than Australia. As there are probably more than 150 countries in the world, that is quite an astonishing achievement. I think that it would be very worth while if the PEO, through its work, was able to bring to community attention the basic facts regarding our Constitution-how it was developed, the work that went into it, and the constitutional achievement of the past 91 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly commend this part of the report to the Parliament and to the Government. I hope that, in the months and years to come, more emphasis will be given to informing students about the great constitutional achievement of Australia. </PARA>

No firm decision has been made about the replacement of Mr Justice Wood, but I can assure Senator Walters that the most vigorous and sustained entreaties and pleas have been made to the Attorney-General to recognise the need for a judge of the Family Court to be based in Hobart.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee has listed as the first matter that it believes should get some further discussion the security of the Family Court buildings in Adelaide which, as the Minister knows, has been something of a long running saga. As the Minister will no doubt remember, I asked some questions in the Senate Estimates Committee because I was told at the last Estimates Committee, and it was reaffirmed at the recent one, that the Government's current plan is to build a dedicated Federal courts building in Melbourne prior to building one in Adelaide-albeit, as I understand it, that was not originally the case. The questions I asked followed on from what I will now refer to as the first Estimates but which were the real Estimates of 1990, where it was indicated that workload was primarily the basis of the decision. It was not surprising to be told that the decision was made on the basis of workload when one realises that Victoria has more people and therefore there will be greater use of the courts. I wanted more information than that and sought it at the recent Additional Estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The information I received included some select statistics for a number of matters in Melbourne as opposed to Adelaide, particularly for divorces, files opened, ancillary applications, orders sought, first directions hearings, contested issues that were determined and counselling cases. Those statistics did not provide an indication of the number of courts in which those matters were dealt with. If Melbourne has 10,000 matters and Adelaide has 5,000, who cares? If Melbourne has double the number of courts, the workload per court-and per judge for that matter-cannot be assessed to be greater than that of Adelaide. I say this on the preliminary understanding that we all share, including the Minister, that the court buildings in Adelaide are manifestly inadequate. On that basis I ask whether the Department can provide the chamber with some indication that the workload in Melbourne, on a per court and a per judge basis, is greater. My dog could wink `yes' to the notion that there would be more cases heard in Melbourne. That is just a little too simplistic. I wonder whether we can deal with that matter first. </PARA>

In order to make a valid judgment as to the different workloads that might be required to be discharged by a number of judges or in a number of courts, we will undertake to provide that information to the honourable senator, but it cannot be provided tonight. It will be provided later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that Senator Vanstone is particularly concerned about the security arrangements in the present Adelaide court. I have had a bit more work done on that by officials who tell me, as Senator Vanstone perhaps knows from her personal observation, that the aspect of security-of course, the court was acquired in 1976 before security loomed as something of great concern to judges and indeed to the staff in registries and so on-which is of most concern is that circulation paths cannot be segregated, chiefly because all the lifts are grouped together and the public toilets are accessible from the stairwell. I do not know whether Senator Vanstone has noticed that, but it is the case. In most courts the judges cannot get from chambers to the courtroom without passing through public space and the size of the floors does not allow alternative circulation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that if additional floors were provided to the court, some security problems would be eased but there would remain fundamental difficulties. The additional floors have been sought in the new works technical policy submission for the coming Budget. That is as much as I can say as, obviously, decisions have not been made. However, it is the intention of the Department, out of the amount of money that is set aside for certain works to be undertaken, to apply to acquire and fit out extra floors in the currently occupied building. That should ease some of the security concerns. But of course that requires that in the Budget process the particular proposal receives assent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not checked, and will not bother to do so, the Hansard of the recent Additional Estimates. I expect that what the Minister has been told is correct, that I did ask for workload figures. But let me put that in context. The reason offered for Melbourne proceeding above Adelaide was workload. Therefore, when one asks for workload statistics, one assumes one is going to be given relevant ones. If what that means is that every time one asks a question one has to spell it out in the context it needs to be put in, next time I ask for workload statistics-because workload was given to me as the reason Melbourne is proceeding ahead of Adelaide-I will spell out every inch and detail. However, that will take a lot longer in Estimates than the good understanding I believe we have had thus far in the Estimates Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One could have expected that I was after some useful statistics. Therefore, having some indication of the number of courts and the number of judges, I would not assume for a minute that what the Minister is saying-he can correct me if I am wrong-is that Melbourne is going ahead of Adelaide because there are simply more Family Court cases there. He cannot be saying that. I am sure the decision has not been made in ignorance of the relative workload per court and per judge. Perhaps the Minister will respond to that. I would be interested to hear what the Minister can say as to the reason offered. I understand that the reason offered was workload and that one of the officers mentioned there were additional matters that one might take into account. As I understand it, many factors are taken into account, and last but not least listed is the Commonwealth making some sort of judicial statement. I quote from the reply I was given:</PARA>
<PARA>These are major buildings which make a major symbolic statement about the Commonwealth's judicial presence.</PARA>
<PARA>So all those elements go into it. The Minister understands, as I do and as anyone who uses the court does, that the buildings are inadequate not only in terms of the security aspect but particularly in terms of the security aspect. What kind of Commonwealth judicial statement does it make for the buildings to be left in that condition and for the lives of judges, litigants, staff and counsel to be put at risk because of that? Presumably, we do not need to go through a recitation here of the problems that Adelaide has had in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the last time I raised this matter with the Minister in this chamber there had been a gentleman who had stabbed his wife or former wife-I am not sure what status she bore at that stage-in one of the public areas, not long after one of the judges had moved out of the public area, I think into the stairwell; but it does not matter where he went. It is a disaster waiting to happen, which is what I told the Minister last time. Nothing has changed. The addition of more space does not necessarily solve the security problem. The essence of my point is that it is not enough to say, `We're going ahead with Melbourne' when Melbourne does not have such security problems. I would have thought that of all the factors the Minister would want to take into account, including whatever symbolic statement he wants to make about the Commonwealth's judicial presence, and the fundamental statement he would want to make about the Commonwealth's judicial presence is that Commonwealth judges will be safe. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, there is no allegation that the premises in Melbourne are anywhere near as unsafe for the judges as they are in Adelaide. That would seem to me to be the priority. I do not say that a judge's life is worth more than anyone else's-not at all; everyone's life is worth the same-but if we are going to talk about judicial statements being made on the location of buildings, I would appreciate the Minister's comments on what sort of judicial statement leaves judges in Adelaide at risk so that a dedicated court building can be built in Melbourne ahead of a building in Adelaide for reasons that are really not explained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have made it clear that I, along with Senator Vanstone, do not regard one life as being more valuable than another. She is quite right to point to the question of risk. There is no doubt that the threat factor and then, given all the circumstances, the real risk factor are issues which anybody concerned with the security of Family Court judges and personnel-and indeed those appearing in the jurisdiction-would know needs to be taken into proper account. I have indicated that the Commonwealth is very conscious of the matters. No little raising of that consciousness has been undertaken by Senator Vanstone to good effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have indicated, the fact is that, even without a decision as to the priority of one building over another, the question of the addition of floors to the present building in order to overcome some of the more severe security problems is being looked at in the Budget context. One would hope that that could, if assented to, alleviate a major part of the security concern. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the choice between Adelaide and Melbourne for a new court building-which is where I think the expression `symbolic statement' really came from; it really relates to the building of a purpose-built court rather than the renting of premises dating back some years-I do not say, and I do not think the Attorney-General would say, that a statement in Melbourne is more important than a statement in Adelaide. I believe that the decision has not yet been made as to either their relative priority or whether they both go ahead at once, which I know would be an extreme but is a possibility because a decision has not been made, as I am advised by the officers tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say that, as decisions are made as to the status of the new buildings to be erected for the purpose of housing courts exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth, the matters that Senator Vanstone draws attention to will be taken into account. Security is one issue. The question of the workload, in the way in which Senator Vanstone has asked it to be analysed, as I have indicated, will be taken into account. The answer which is provided will be put together in a way which will be of interest not only to the Attorney but also, I am sure, to Senator Vanstone. I have given Senator Vanstone an undertaking that it will be provided. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

I did not appreciate that a decision as to the priority between the two had not yet been made; that pleases me. I also wonder whether both buildings will be built together. I wonder whether the Minister could tell me, in a relatively simple form, how far advanced planning for the Adelaide building was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of the legal profession have been very concerned about this not just because of the security matters and the total inadequacy of the court but because, as I understand it, in the past they have been consulted about the adequacy of some of the plans, even to the point of saying, `Look, what about if the public toilets are here, the stairwells are here, the photocopy room is here and the counsel room is here?'. I am not talking about quite narrow and specific detail but, generally, the layout and outline of floors. </PARA>
<PARA> When members of the profession are told about the acquisition of a block of land and are asked about the layout of the building and the floors, they naturally think the plans are pretty far down the line.

In relation to this matter, I wonder whether the Minister has seen the Law Society Bulletin for April this year and the message by the President of the Law Society, Mr Brian Withers. Johnston Withers McCusker-I do not think it is called that any more-or whatever it is now called is not known to be a rabidly conservative firm designed to advance the most conservative or even `Liberal' causes. In his report on the Family Court, the President says that in February he attended the Family Court in the company of two vice-presidents of the society to be entertained by the judges of the court. He says that that was a pleasant occasion; I am pleased for him in that respect. He goes on and says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, what the visit did highlight for us was the very inadequate facilities that are provided to that Court. As we all remember there were plans for a significant Federal Court Building to be built at the corner of King William and Wright Streets. The plans were at an advanced stage prior to the project being cancelled some 18 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that Mr Withers would be pleased to know that we would not refer to the project as being cancelled. The Minister might help me in that respect. Mr Withers goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Court is a most important jurisdiction. It is a jurisdiction which is subject to constant public scrutiny and which has a high volume of contact with the public. It is a Court of high emotion. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister and I have canvassed these matters before. The article continues as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>It is simply intolerable for so grossly inadequate facilities to be provided to such a body and the Law Society will continue to urge the Federal Government to take steps to more appropriately house this important Court. </PARA>
<PARA>That cannot be called a partisan remark from the President of the Law Society. I just wonder whether the Minister is aware of this and how seriously he treats the complaints coming not from an Opposition senator whom the Minister might perceive as having, apart from the Court's interest, some other interest in pursuing this matter. I picked Mr Withers as the President of the Law Society, from a firm that has a high reputation and a totally bipartisan approach, shall I say. I wonder what weight the Minister is prepared to put on Mr Withers's remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would only give it a little more weight than I have already given to Senator Vanstone's remarks. I never thought that they were offered in a partisan spirit, but because Senator Vanstone had the best interests of the Family Court of Australia and those who come within its jurisdiction at heart, as it is experienced in Adelaide. Nevertheless, I do note the segment in that particular Law Society Bulletin.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Time is getting on and the Minister has probably told me as much as he can in this respect, but I draw to his attention a paper put out by the Australian Bar Association entitled The Independence of The Judiciary in March 1991. Page 8 quotes an article by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia entitled `Minimum Standards of Judicial Independence', published in 1984 in the Australian Law Journal in which he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is essential that control of court buildings and facilities be vested exclusively in the judiciary. The court must have the right to exclusive possession of the building-</PARA>
<PARA>which the Adelaide Court does not have-</PARA>
<PARA>or part of the building in which it operates-</PARA>
<PARA>and it does not even have that-</PARA>
<PARA>and must have power to exercise control over ingress and egress, to and from the building or part thereof. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to indicate what the judge thinks about the control which should be exercised within that space, and that is not a matter that I want to raise with the Minister tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I do want to raise with him the point that the Chief Justice has said that a court should have control of its buildings or the portions thereof, and remind the Minister that the Family Court of Australia does not have that control. Even if the Minister and I would not be prepared to go as far as the Chief Justice does and say to the judiciary in each court, `Yes, you can have whatever money you like', which I am reasonably sure that neither the Minister nor I would be prepared to do, the point is that the Bar Association raises this in the context of the independence of the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bar Association's article raises the question of judicial salaries and the premises in which the judiciary is kept. It makes the point that if the judiciary is beholden to a government-has to go kowtowing and scraping to a government-then the question of its independence is very seriously called into risk. That is the whole focus of this paper which the Minister has probably seen. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to stress, in case it is misinterpreted by anyone, that I am not saying for a minute that the Government is deliberately keeping the judges in the Family Court in Adelaide in these intolerable conditions as a means of gaining some sort of dependence from them. That would be a ludicrous notion. I am saying that if the conditions are left in an intolerable situation for much longer, the question can be raised about the independence of the judiciary and what it has to do to get itself housed, not in Hotel Inter-Continental or Hyatt Hotel standards, but in adequate buildings. I would be grateful if the Minister could comment on that. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I ask whether the Minister's attention been drawn to some remarks made by, I think, Mr Justice Brennan in the recent Family Court matter. The title of it escapes me, but it was the one that was decided during the Additional Estimates hearings, on the use of judicial registrars and the notoriously inadequate supply of funds to the Family Court. I will not go so far as to say that it referred to premises-I am not sure it did-but it referred to the general funding to the Court. I make those two references and invite the Minister to consider how they apply to the Adelaide situation and to respond to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that Mr Justice Brennan's comment was made in the course of a particular case. I expect it has been given due weight, given the judicial lips from which it fell. I imagine that it would be part of a more widespread sense of the need to ensure the independence of the judiciary that Mr Justice Brennan has expressed more eloquently and at greater length in certain addresses and speeches which he has delivered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to Senator Vanstone's general point, it is quite true that the independence of the judiciary could be affected by the Executive in various ways. In particular, I think that the security of tenure of judges is recognised in our constitutional arrangements as being the best protection, and the one required by history as being the almost absolutely essential guarantor, of the independence of the judiciary. Other matters, including their salaries and the premises in which they are housed, assume an importance but, to my mind, would not loom as significantly as the question of security of tenure. Nevertheless, I take the point that Senator Vanstone is making. </PARA>
<PARA> I think she also acknowledged the need for the Parliament in appropriating moneys, and the Executive in recommending the appropriation of moneys for the Family Court, amongst all other expenditure, to take into account the fact that the moneys are provided by the Australian community at large and cannot be made available simply on request. I am not suggesting that the Chief Justice thinks that they ought to be, any more than Senator Vanstone does, but we are very conscious of the need to make priorities in the allocation of resources, including to buildings to house those who exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I can give Senator Vanstone the assurance, simply because it has been asked for and not that there is any real need to, that no decision about the allocation of moneys to provide for those premises will be made with any thought in mind of either punishing or, if they are provided, trying to provide some sort of inducement or expression of favour towards a particular area where new premises might be provided. It will be done simply on the basis of the availability of funds in the Budget process. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it needs to be said that if judges, who exercise such an important function in our community and exercise a power vested in them by the Constitution very deliberately, are housed in premises which are not able to come up to that symbolic expression which is considered to be important, then every effort has to be made to ensure that that symbolic statement of the importance and the status of the judiciary in our society is made adequately. </PARA>

Since I am complaining about the inadequacy of the housing, can I attach a question in that respect? Is there any suggestion from the Government that there will be another Family Court judge in Adelaide? Given that the Minister is aware, no doubt, that four of the Family Court judges had to trot down to another court to give evidence of a threat being made against them by someone with experience in bomb disposal-I know nothing about bombs, but I would have a pretty good idea that, if one knows how to take it apart, one probably knows how to put it together-is the reason that we have not got another judge that there is no-one to take the job with the lousy conditions?</PARA></TALK.START>

This chamber, as the Minister well knows, is conducting an inquiry into the cost of justice. With due respect, we have certain members on the Minister's side of the chamber who think that the cost of justice can be sheeted home very firmly to the fees charged by lawyers.

<PARA> I do not mean to pick on the Federal jurisdiction, it is just as bad in the State jurisdictions, but to take the example of 100 pages or 200 pages of transcript a day and a two-day hearing, someone will be paying about $3,000 to the Australian transcript service, or whatever it is called-that crowd. The litigant would be paying $3,000, and in a two-day hearing the court would be paying $4,000, making a total of $7,000. If the other litigant wanted to get a set, they would be paying the same $3,000, so that is a figure of $10,000. Are we honestly at the stage where three parties, all entitled to these things, who have had a two-day hearing with 200 pages of transcript a day-that is a total of 400 pages of transcript-will have to pay $10,000? Is that really where we are at?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The cost of the provision of transcript at the request of a court or a party is, as has been outlined, charged at a per page rate which, given the volume of work transacted in any one day, could lead to the sorts of accumulated costs which Senator Vanstone mentions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far as the court itself is concerned, when the decision was made to commercialise the Commonwealth Reporting Service in the provision of this service to various courts, authorities and commissions and so on, certain money was transferred into the budget of those courts, tribunals, authorities and commissions, representing a best guess as to what up until then had been provided as `a free service' by the Commonwealth Reporting Service, so that people would become more aware of the costs in the succeeding years. That has been the case, and Senator Vanstone has highlighted how that has become the case. But the total cost to the Family Court of Australia for the provision of transcripts is about 0.59 per cent, just over half of one per cent, of the total running costs of that court. In terms of the court itself I do not think that it can be regarded as a major factor. Obviously it is a factor, but it is related to the cost of the provision of the service. I agree with Senator Vanstone that that does not help the parties concerned for whom the costs are quite burdensome. </PARA>
<PARA> In making the decision to commercialise the Commonwealth Reporting Service, the Cabinet set the target date of 1= July 1993 as being the date on which clients such as the Family Court of Australia would be `untied' so that the Family Court could shop around for a cheaper provision of that particular service. Of course, the Commonwealth Reporting Service is very aware of that and would be entering into contractual arrangements with major clients on a commercial basis in order to undercut any competition that might emerge. But I would agree with Senator Vanstone that the cost per page to clients must be regarded as a burden to them in the conduct of the case. I simply say that it is part of the process of requiring that people pay for the costs of the services provided to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister mentioned the cost of transcript services to the Family Court. I presume he picked the Family Court because that was the information he had. There are other Federal jurisdictions for which I assume the charges are not much different, and if they are I suppose I would want to know why. But I will not worry about that now; I will save that until April of next year. The Minister referred to a total of 0.59 per cent. If I were running BHP, I would be very pleased to increase profit by 0.59 per cent of costs. It sounds small as a figure, but it is still a lot of money that could be applied in some other way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the Minister says that the costs to Family Court judges are not necessarily that high. Perhaps the reason that the 0.59 per cent is down is because Family Court judges are doing what I understand judges in another Federal jurisdiction do. They ring up the litigants and say, `Hey, what about a bootleg copy of the transcript?'. The Minister's own judges cannot afford the Government's fees. I am not saying that judges are doing the wrong thing. I give full credit to them if they are sensible enough to get a copy from someone without paying the Government's exorbitant charges. I hope that the Family Court judges are as smart as these other judges I have heard about and are doing this. I hope that there is a bit of sharing going around because the Government's charges are so outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA> My final question to the Minister is: what is the charge per page in the High Court? Is not the charge in the High Court significantly lower because it does not run through the Minister's system? The High Court spotted how hopeless the system was a long time ago and set up its own system. I understand that the charges for transcripts in the High Court are significantly lower. To save my asking another question, perhaps the Minister will give me a nod if his officers agree with what I have said and can give me some assistance in that respect. </PARA>

On 14 May, in response no doubt to the honourable senator's questions, my office received a list of documents about which it was understood in the office-and there is no notification on the papers to indicate otherwise-that this was a copy of the information that had been supplied to the Committee secretariat for transmission to the honourable senator. That is what I thought. I am told by my officers that it was their unstated intention that I should approve the transmission of this material to the honourable senator via the Committee secretariat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was certainly no intention on the part of the Department nor of my office to deny the honourable senator a considerable amount of information. For example, attachment A is the information explaining why the decision was made to proceed with a single select tender to complete the fit-out of the City Centre for the AAT. Attachment B is advice as to why the Department made the decision to re-engage Desaro Design Interiors Pty Ltd. Attachment C is the deed of surrender, dated 5 December 1989, between the Commonwealth and Ozton Pty Ltd. Attachment D is the deed of amendment, dated 20 June 1990, between the Commonwealth and Ozton Pty Ltd. Attachment E is the deed of guarantee and indemnity between the Commonwealth and Essington Developments Ltd, dated 20 June 1990. Attachment F is the certificate of exemption, approved on 8 April 1991 by the State Manager, Projects Services, Australian Construction Services. Attachment G is advice on Ozton being in receivership or liquidation. Attachment H is details of shareholders and directors in Ozton Pty Ltd and Desaro Design Interiors Pty Ltd, Desaro Properties Pty Ltd and Desaro Developments Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great bundle of information there which no doubt is precisely what the honourable senator was seeking. I apologise very sincerely for its not being provided to him in time for this evening's debate. I am not blaming him, but I am only sorry that he did not give my office a call to see what was possibly happening, as some other senators do when confronted with this apparent lack of response. However, I can make it available to him now and I indicate that I am happy to enter into further discussion with him. I think the estimates have to be approved if possible tonight, but I am very happy to enter into discussions with him on the basis of his reading of the documents and to answer any questions that he wants to put tonight in a way which could help provide him with as much information as is possible. So, perhaps at another stage in the Senate proceedings, we could find some means of his expressing his conclusions having read all the documentation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister saying that the Government can spend $100m on a contract and not be required to go to open public tender? As I said in my speech, I do not hold the Burdekin Shire Council up as an example of what the Commonwealth should do, although our tendering process seems to be much better than the Commonwealth when one thinks of the Nashua Australia Pty Ltd deal and others. In Queensland, local authorities are required to go to open public tender over a certain amount, the reason being that it takes away at any time any suspicion or suggestion of corruption, collusion or favouritism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason for going to open public tender where everyone gets a crack at the same set of rules is so that public officials and Ministers cannot be accused of getting some gold bars because they gave contracts to the right place or obtained some better stamps than others as a result of awarding contracts to particular places. That is why I thought in most government instrumentalities there was this absolute necessity that over a certain amount one had to go to open public tender. That is the fair way to choose contractors, is it not? The same set of plans and rules is given to everyone and they are asked, `How much can you do that for?'. In our free enterprise society where competition gives the best result, people cut their margins to the bone to get the job so that we as taxpayers get the best result. Surely, there must be something like that which binds even this Government to follow those sorts of norms. </PARA>

<PARA> Certainly the departmental Secretary thinks that he is getting the best deal. Really, the contract was let by a company whose ability to make the correct deal or to run its finances, to do its financial calculations, has been shown to be sadly lacking because the company is in liquidation, receivership or whatever it is.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in a better position now to answer Senator Macdonald both as to the guidelines that are used and as to their application in this particular case. Guidelines issued by the Department of Administrative Services on government purchasing require compliance with the following criteria, irrespective of the monetary amount involved: best value for money and fair and open competition. In addition, finance regulation 44b requires that persons entering into financial commitments should be satisfied after reasonable inquiry that in all the circumstances the Commonwealth could not obtain better value for the expenditure. The need for tenders to be called is assessed against this regulatory background.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the particular instance of the proposed fit-out of the City Centre, the authority to go to a select tender situation was exercised by the State Manager of Project Services, Australian Construction Services (ACS). This authority provides for delegated officers to issue a certificate of exemption certifying that it would be impractical or inexpedient to invite public tenders by reason of the urgency with which the works and services are required, the source of the particular works or other circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Desaro Design Interiors Pty Ltd, the fit-out contractor for Ozton Pty Ltd, was given the opportunity to quote for the completion of the project. Australian Construction Services ensured that Desaro was aware that Australian Construction Services would go to open tender if its price was not competitive. The quote of $2.348m subsequently received was well within range, and there were obvious benefits in contracting with the company familiar with the job. The Department and Australian Construction Services agreed that the seeking of further quotes would be futile, as prices in excess of $2.5m would be expected due to the higher risk incurred by others. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision was made on the basis of a judgment that savings in cost and time would result if Desaro was contracted for the work. Given the fact that Desaro was obviously familiar with the work and had been a good performer, it was decided to seek that single select tender from Desaro and the quote, as I say, was well within the range-in fact, $402,000 less than the estimate made by ACS, which was the amount included in the Additional Estimates. </PARA>

I do not have a date for it, but the written response gave details of the lease saying that the premises that were occupied by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal were sold to Essington. Essington then became the landlord, I would have thought, and yet the deed of surrender of the lease seems to be with Ozton. Just skimming through this information, the lease suggests that Ozton is the lessor and not Essington. Can the Minister elaborate on that?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to my information, in August 1988 the premises currently occupied by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)-Kindersley House-were sold to Essington Pty Ltd. That is clear. In October of the same year a request was received to surrender the lease on Kindersley House to allow Essington to redevelop the site. Agreement to this request would see Essington funding and providing an equivalent fit-out at an alternative building of AAT's choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The request from Essington was approved, and in November 1989 a lease was signed for new premises at the City Centre building in Market Street. In December 1989 a deed of surrender of the Kindersley House lease was signed between Ozton, the registered proprietor of Kindersley House and a subsidiary of Essington, and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> That deed of surrender made provisions for Ozton to meet the fit-out costs at the City Centre building together with any extra rental expenses incurred by the Commonwealth. It also allowed the Commonwealth to cease payment of rental at Kindersley House and commence payment of rental at the new premises. Under the deed, Essington was nominated as guarantor in the event that Ozton could not comply with its part of the agreement. I think that that is the connection between the parties. </PARA>

Now that I find out that there is a guarantee, what proceedings have been taken against Essington to recover the almost $4m of taxpayers' money which has gone west because either the Minister's Department or the Department of the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus-and that would not surprise me-has bungled this deal? We had a lease, it was not costing us anything-we were paying cheap rent-and suddenly this deal was put to us whereby we could move over to this more expensive place. We would get $4m worth of fit-out for free, but we ended up paying the $4m, so we did not get anything for free. We are paying the higher rent and we are now also paying for the fit-out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Administrative Appeals Tribunal wishes to move from the cramped quarters that it presently occupies to a larger space, which is the simple reason the rent is more expensive. As to the taking of legal action, I am advised that, until expenditure has been incurred and a loss has been suffered, legal proceedings cannot be instituted. In other words, legal proceedings have to be instituted in relation to damage or loss that can actually be pointed to. Once the expenditure is incurred, the legal proceedings can be undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contract has been signed, I assume. The Minister is a much better qualified barrister than I am but, if the agreement has been signed, I would have thought that that was an indication of the amount that we fix the losses by. The Minister might make a comment about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also put to the Minister the proposition I made in my speech-and hopefully his advisers have considered this-that, when he negotiated the lease for the new premises, he obviously did so on the basis that he was getting a $4m capital fit-out thrown in for free. In normal commercial practice, that would have been added on to the rent and he would have been paying for that, but he would have been paying for it over the term of the lease. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying that the rental that was negotiated would have taken into account that the landlord was providing him with $4m worth of free fit-out. That would seem to be a commercial proposition. Now that we are not getting the $4m free fit-out, now that we are actually paying for that, of course we are overpaying the rent. I would like to know whether we have gone back to renegotiate the higher rental that we are obviously paying because we are supposedly getting $4m worth of free fit-out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope I get this right. I think that they are two separate matters. The lease and the rent are determined by way of a relationship between the Commonwealth and the owner of the City Centre Building, which is quite different from and has nothing to do with the fit-out costs, which are part of the deal to vacate the Kindersley House premises. So in fact those are two different matters which have no relationship if, as I am advised, the owner of the City Centre Building is not Essington or Ozton.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the corporate plan that was submitted in draft form for the approval of the council, which was pretty well ready to go to the printers, as we can see, it was excluded. In addition, I have just passed to the Minister another document designed for working use by Memorial staff which also excluded the purpose. I suggest to the Minister that a tendency has now developed within the War Memorial to exclude the purpose of the War Memorial and substitute for it a lesser mission. That is the cause of my concern and, if you like, my overemphasis, as the Minister might see it, on the words in question. I am not satisfied as to the explanation given about why the corporate plan went to the Council without the purpose included in it and why we have confirmation that yet another document from the War Memorial has been given to the printer without the main purpose, the whole and sole reason for its existence, being included in the statement.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was never ever intended that there should be a refusal or an explicit decision to put up to Council, as an expression of the corporate plan, a statement which would merely emphasise the mission and exclude the purpose. I am advised that it has always been the case that the purpose looms very significantly in the understanding of the officers as to the whole function and reason for being of the War Memorial. Senator Newman cannot take any comfort in constructing her argument from the document she has sent over because that does not represent a final formal document.

<PARA> That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to give precedence to a motion relating to the struggle for power within the Government at a time of economic crisis.</PARA>
<PARA>I am seeking the suspension of Standing Orders tonight because of what is occurring in this building at a time of economic crisis. It is important that this chamber tonight has the opportunity to move a motion that will condemn the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for engaging in an acrimonious and destabilising feud over the spoils of office in the midst of a desperate economic crisis induced by the Labor Government's incompetent economic management and calls on the Prime Minister either to immediately sack the Treasurer or to resign himself. </PARA>
<PARA> The background to this situation tonight is the appalling economic situation in which this country finds itself. Unemployment is now at 10 per cent; youth unemployment is at 25 per cent, and in some cities it is 33 per cent. Foreign debt is $170 billion, the top of the scale among Western developed nations. Our balance of payments is about $1.4 billion in the red every month. Bankruptcies are at a record level. It is the worst situation since the Great Depression. What is the Government doing in this hour of need? It is squabbling over the question of leadership. One leader is clinging to power and another is desperately lunging for power. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we learnt tonight? What has happened tonight? We have found out that in November 1988 Bob Hawke pledged to stand aside after the 1990 election. What did he tell the Australian people after the 1990 election? He said that he would serve the full term. He has misled the Australian people again. Why was the Prime Minister going to stand aside? Why did he give this pledge? He gave the pledge in order that Mr Keating might have his turn as Prime Minister. What is his right to have his turn as Prime Minister? The Prime Minister had to get out early enough to give Paul Keating a chance to settle into the job. </PARA>
<PARA> Did they trust each other? No, they needed to call witnesses. Who were the witnesses? They were Bob Hawke's friend, Sir Peter Abeles, and Mr Keating's friend, Mr Kelty. Not one witness was sufficient; each had to call an independent witness to verify the truth of the other. The mates of the Australian Labor Party, in the environment of what has occurred in Western Australia, will stand by each other, no matter what the consequences or the national interest might be. </PARA>
<PARA> What went wrong with the plan? After Mr Keating's press gallery dinner late last year when he decided to put the pressure on, Prime Minister Hawke apparently changed his mind. Mr Hawke described it as an act of treachery. He has called it an act of treachery again tonight. All bets were off. No longer would he stand aside for Mr Keating. Despite the fact that the deal had been verified by the mates, Mr Hawke decided that he had grounds to breach it. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the pressure has been put on in recent times. The faction meetings have been taking place. What would have given us a better guide to what was about to happen than the headline in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald, `Hawke: nothing to fear but his mate, Rock'. It became relevant today because today Mr Keating has gone to the Prime Minister, reminded him of his deal and said, `It's now my turn, I've got the numbers, you've got to get out'. What happened after that no doubt pleasant discussion? Senator Richardson went to see Bob Hawke. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition, Senator Hill has engaged in a rather hysterical display of interest in the internal operations of the Australian Labor Party parliamentary Caucus. He has tried to justify this by saying that the nation is in such a state of economic crisis, and that this ought to be a matter of such concern to this chamber that we suspend the consideration of the Supplementary Estimates in order to indulge in a bit of cheap politicking of the sort that Senator Hill wishes to put forward to the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, if his proposition is to be given any weight, the question really is whether this chamber should be distracted from its duty to the economic well-being of Australia in a way which would enable it to put to one side the consideration of the Additional Estimates.

<PARA> That is the task on which we are engaged as a parliament which has the duty to scrutinise the expenditure proposed by the Executive Government.

I would have thought that if we had a true obligation to the economic well-being of Australia-which seems to be the primary criterion for the assessment of correct and proper political behaviour in this country-we ought to be getting on with the task which is the Senate's primary role at this moment, and that is to consider the Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we are only half way through Estimates Committee E deliberations. We should continue with that particular project as the true and proper business of the Senate.

<PARA> At this stage it is quite clear that the vote at the end of this motion will not allow a suspension of standing orders. Therefore, the motion that Senator Hill wishes to move will not go ahead. If the Opposition decides to take the rest of the 30 minutes which is available to this chamber, it will be quite clear that it has decided that 30 minutes of head kicking is better than none at all. All that means is that we will all be here for 30 minutes longer than we would otherwise have been, at which point we will all go home and members of the Opposition can please themselves what they do. </PARA>

I would have thought that they would be interested in the crisis which is in front of this country at the moment. Does anyone doubt for a moment that this country is paralysed by inaction? The Cabinet meeting has just had to be adjourned because no-one can keep an eye on the ball. No-one is interested in the fact that unemployment is at record levels and that several days ago, when the destabilisers talked about Keating's resignation, the dollar fell. No-one gives a damn in this country, apparently, about anything to do with the state of the economy and the state of the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I thought that I had attempted to do that several times. This country is paralysed by what is going on at the present time. There is obviously no ability, no comprehension and no willingness to confront the real issues. Instead, what we are seeing is a very sordid and grubby display between aspirants who have forfeited any claim to the throne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After eight years of government we have seen the record of disaster and the litany of broken promises. The Senate should remember one classical broken promise when Senator Button had the temerity to suggest that perhaps a deal might have been done on the leadership. Do honourable senators remember that and all the vigorous denials that no such thing had ever happened? Now, of course, we have quite the contrary coming out. The truth emerges when desperate men play desperate games. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps fitting that Australian Associated Press should have Mr Hawke's political obituary given high priority tonight in proclaiming that undoubtedly Mr Hawke, who tonight becomes the longest serving leader of the longest serving Federal Labor Government in Australian history, will go down in history as the Australian Labor Party's most successful leader. What a disaster to preside over and what a claim to fame!</PARA>
<PARA> The most successful leader to take a country to record levels of unemployment. Who says that they are record levels of unemployment? We have been-we had been-told that they have not quite got over 10 per cent, but of course the Treasurer (Mr Keating) tonight is reported as saying that he predicts that the dole queues will reach a record post-war high of 10.75 per cent this year and that the country is facing a $4 billion deficit. Mr Willis, the Minister for Finance, said, `Maybe just under' whereas Mr Keating has been pretending that we will stay in surplus. All this comes from people who aspire to lead the country to even greater disaster and who are not concerned for a moment about the true welfare of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The nation is driven by people that Senator Hill rightly described from Peter Hartcher's article as `those entirely without honour, those who are not concerned about anything other than deal making and those who would not know what the economic and national interest was all about'. The great tragedy of tonight is that no-one on the other side of this chamber is concerned or interested in anything other than simply the spoils of office. They know the sands are running out but are determined to go for broke. They want to get as much as they can out of the system and whether it costs $130,000 to go overseas or whether it involves having $630 worth of dinner on the taxpayer, they will go for broke. </PARA>

Does anyone have any doubt about the desperation of those who are ignoring the desperation of the country and who are desperate to make the most for themselves? Senator Loosley is over there no doubt priding himself on his great ability to get to the front bench quicker than he had hoped. There are all sorts of deals, all for the wrong reasons and all because of the lack of interest in the true welfare of the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very sad day for this country. The very least that ought to happen is that this Senate should try to bring the Government to its senses and get this issue resolved once and for all so that we can simply preside over the dying days of a desperate government. It does not really matter who wins tonight. Labor is the loser. The country is losing and there is only one side of politics that is interested in resurrecting it. I do not think it matters ultimately which one of tonight's prophets without honour prevails. </PARA>

What is clear, what has been clear over the last couple of months and has become crystal clear today, is that the people on that side cannot run their Party. Therefore, according to their own rules, they cannot run the country. That means that, while they are spending all this time trying to run their Party, they are not running the country. That is why this matter has to be brought to a head.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister probably knows the Launceston Students Workshop, a group of workers who educate Launceston students into competitive employment training and placement. I do not think they come under the Disability Services Act. As at March 1991 there were 26 students aged 14 to 15 and 35 students aged 16 to 22-there is a large number of very young disabled students who are trained very successfully for full and competitive employment. Can the Minister indicate from where that group should be funded? It fits entirely within the Government's aim of getting the disabled out into full time employment. Because of the age group, I believe that they do not come particularly under the Disability Services Act. Under which legislation does the Department believe that age group should come?</PARA></TALK.START>

In February, 19 clients were placed in competitive employment on full award conditions; so there could be no doubt about the job Mrs Knox does. Unfortunately, the Department does not see her coming within its guidelines. The State department does not give her any assistance. At the moment she is getting temporary assistance, but it needs to be better than that because, as one can well imagine, she needs to plan. I should like some assurance that she will be funded from now on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. In the questions on Estimates I asked about the linkage programs that are currently undertaken in Victoria in the home and community care program and asked whether those current linkage programs that were being funded would be extended for a further 12 months. The answer I received from Ms Murnane was yes, they would be extended. I asked about indexation and the answer was a little equivocal. Ms Murnane said, `Yes, except in Victoria'. The reason for that is that in Victoria the linkage projects, as they are called there, with the exception of two, have not spent up to their approved limits on purchase of service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although they were not given a precise amount for indexation, they were able in effect to take account of increased expenses because they had that extra money. The Victorian department is now suggesting to us that money should be made available to index all linkages projects and we are discussing this with it. But with the exception of two projects that have now reached their approved limits, the situation is that there is money to enable them to take account of increased costs this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two questions that concern me. One is that the projects had not been advised as at the beginning of this week on whether they would be funded for a further 12 months. I actually sent them copies of Hansard to try to allay their fears. I received a copy of one of the letters the Minister sent. I think it was sent to me by the Minister's office. I really could not tell from that letter whether those programs would be funded for a further 12 months or whether they would be indexed. That is why I am expressing a concern. I was told that in the Estimates Committee; it has been confirmed that that is the case. I want to know whether those linkages programs will get their funding and whether it will be indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> Those programs mainly involve older people-people with disabilities-being cared for at home, who are in projects and who are feeling very vulnerable. Councils are making decisions about next financial year and their budgets. If they are not assured that they will get their money, then those programs are in jeopardy because the councils will not be able to support them. I would appreciate it if the Department could confirm that and tell me when those councils and linkages programs will be told in writing, in a clear way, that they will receive their funding and indexation. </PARA>

I cannot say whether that includes an indexation undertaking. I will get an answer to that question and ensure that, when the Hon.

The Minister also said `large numbers of women'. I am not quite sure whether he knows that the number of women who have planned homebirths is 0.5 per cent, according to the report that the Department was referring to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not offer any. I simply note the fact that this service obviously is not simply a matter of the choice of the women concerned. It has to be undertaken as a matter of proper medical judgment that the birth could be conducted safely. Therefore, it is quite impossible to indicate precisely those numbers of women who, having thought of the alternative birthing service, then find that their pregnancies develop in a way that makes that an unsafe or less safe alternative. I cannot put a number on it, but it stands to reason that there must be some.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly what I mean. It stands to reason that there must be some. I agree with the Minister entirely that those women who choose to have midwives deliver their babies have every right to seek that type of delivery, but the number is very small. The Minister cannot tell me tonight the number of birthing centres we already have around Australia, and his Department cannot tell me how many women avail themselves of the birthing centres using midwives-some of the birthing centres, of course, are used by women who would prefer the medical practitioner to deliver their babies. I am sure that the numbers to date are very small.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to know whether the Department can tell me here and now how many women in Australia availed themselves last year of midwives to do their delivery. I am sure the Department must know. It has put forward this plan that taxpayers should pay midwives more than the individual person pays a doctor for a delivery. The patient does not pay the midwife. The taxpayers of Australia pay the total amount to the midwife. The patient does not pay anything at all and does not get anything from Medicare. The taxpayers foot the bill. I am quite sure that the Department must know that there is a large cry from women in Australia for this service if that is what it recommends. The Department would know the figures. I ask the Minister to give me the number of women who last year chose to have their deliveries done by midwives?</PARA>

The fact is that the Government has determined that this particular alternative birthing service ought to be available to women in Australia. It is prepared to pay an amount to the States to facilitate the provision of such a service. The package of care which the midwife offers over a period of many hours is, we think, such that we ought to help the States by a contribution of $500 per birthing service. The States would then make a decision as to whether they would apply the money directly to a midwife or to a centre which employs midwives or whatever.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As is noted, the Commonwealth is at present developing an evaluation framework and methodology for an evaluation of the program. It needs to be worked out in detail in consultation with the States, as they will be collecting the information in the first instance. As the States establish their alternative birthing programs, they will also be considering how best to monitor the outcomes in relation to maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. States already maintain extensive maternal and peri-natal statistical collections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The NHMRC has recently funded the national peri-natal statistics unit to analyse the statistics from homebirths in Australia for the years 1988 to 1990. This will start in a few weeks time and will carry on from the report on home births in Australia from 1985 to 1987. That is obviously not the full range of statistics to which Senator Walters referred, but I am sure that the States would be undertaking the collection of those statistics from midwives or at least from the alternative birthing service, however it is provided. </PARA>
<PARA> As one of the conditions of receiving the payments from the Commonwealth there will be an obligation on the States to keep an adequate record of the morbidity rates, the mortality rates, the peri-natal care and so on that is offered.

These savings would include the benefits paid for the services provided by the supervising medical practitioner and for a range of diagnostic tests. It is not appropriate, therefore, to characterise this funding as a fee for midwives and any comparison of it with the Medicare schedule of fees for obstetric services provided by medical practitioners must take into account all of the factors which contribute to the different cost structures.</PARA></TALK.START>

That answer was given to us during the Estimates hearings as well. How is the midwife's fee, which has been determined by the Commonwealth Department, assessed? Why on earth would the Department assess it to be a greater fee than that which is given to general practitioners? We know that it is $70 more than general practitioners are entitled to under the schedule fee. Why would a midwife be assessed to receive a greater amount? Her skills are not as great and, as I have pointed out to the Minister on so many occasions, when she gets into trouble she calls the general practitioner to get her out of the trouble that she is in. But we will leave that matter because obviously there is no assessment able to be justified on this occasion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the Government is doing is enabling the provision of the alternative birthing service to be provided with the assistance of a midwife. That involves encouraging, if you like, the States to enable the provision of this service either through a birthing centre or through some other arrangement. It is assessed that the Commonwealth could make a maximum contribution of $500 for each birth managed by that independent midwife. I have indicated how that $500 was arrived at. It is not put together as a fee for a midwife's service so much as a way of expressing the encouragement of the Commonwealth Government to enable the provision of this alternative birthing service. It is based on the notional amount which represents the approximate average saving to the Commonwealth in Medicare benefits compared with the cost in benefits if the birth had been managed by a private medical practitioner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many ways in which this can be assessed. For example, one has to be aware that medically managed births generally involve a hospital stay of about five or six days at a cost of about $450 per day, while women having midwife assisted births either deliver at home or spend 24 hours or less in a birthing centre. The hidden costs of hospital births are substantial and must be acknowledged in any comparison with the Commonwealth's contribution towards services provided by midwives. That is one of the factors, no doubt, that were taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> The type of care which is provided by the midwife involves the provision of routine antenatal care, the preparation for childbirth, advice on nutrition and so on. The midwife attends the woman for the duration of labour and for a minimum of three hours after the birth, an average time of 12 hours. Postnatally, the midwife performs routine screening tests and visits the home daily for seven to 10 days, providing advice and support on infant feeding, postnatal exercises and parent craft skills and substantial emotional help within the family setting. That is one of the factors that has also been taken into account in the provision of that funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence given to the Medical Benefits Review Committee by the two professions-generally speaking, midwives and doctors-indicates that, on average, midwives spend about 45 hours with their clients throughout the pregnancy, birth and after-care, and medical practitioners spend about five hours on average. These were matters which were taken into account in the setting of that particular amount of money to be paid to the States to enable the provision of the service. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me explain the process. On many occasions when a midwife gets into trouble, she calls a general practitioner or her specialist. That call is often pretty late-and on occasions too late. On those occasions, the Medical Defence Association has said already that it is looking at whether that medical practitioner would be covered because he or she has not been in to `direct and complete responsibility for the patient's care during the whole term'. If that is the case, who will cover the doctor that has been called in by the midwife?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot give a definitive response. Quite clearly, there is some analogy with a doctor taking up the care of a patient after a paramedic perhaps-a Red Cross officer or somebody like that-has dealt with a patient who suffered some injury. If the State accepts Commonwealth funding for the establishment of these alternative homebirthing services, there would need to be consideration by the State of the sorts of issues Senator Walters has raised, such as the transfer of the midwife's care, supervision and responsibility to the practitioner or specialist. I will seek information as to whether the States are developing as part of their assurance that service of the best care can be provided to the woman concerned and her child in a way which protects the doctor or the midwife concerned from the consequences of a suit relating to the alleged bad delivery of that care. Quite frankly, I would need to follow it up.</PARA></TALK.START>

I thank the Minister for his answer, although his analogy with the paramedics is not one that is sustainable because they are only used in crisis under emergency situations when no medical practitioner is available.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot accept that the American study is entirely irrelevant to the situation that would obtain in Australia. No doubt those who are interested can find quite interesting information in that particular New England Journal of Medicine. It is worth noting in the Australian context that an extensive review undertaken by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) failed to support claims that homebirths are less safe than hospital births or that there are substantially greater risks to mother or child. I guess that is some indication of the view of the National Health and Medical Research Council in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

As I say, I believe that the NHMRC has recently funded the National Peri-natal Statistics Unit to analyse the statistics for homebirths in Australia for the years 1988 to 1990.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the review; I have the lot. I am just wondering whether the Minister has the subsequent statement on homebirths which puts it slightly differently. Following the fuss-for that is all I can call it-that that working party's report engendered, the National Health and Medical Research Council downgraded that a little. The statement on homebirths says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As stated in the report of the working party, it has not been possible to determine the safety or otherwise of homebirths in the Australian context. </PARA>
<PARA>That could not be done because there were no statistics.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister may think it is being slightly painful in here, but I am sure that the labour pains being suffered outside are worse than those of any homebirth. I have been waiting for an hour to make that joke. I want to ask some questions about the vocational register. In the Estimates committee hearings, I asked a series of questions about the new vocational registration arrangements which were introduced on 1 December 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a significant number of problems with the register from the beginning, including the criteria of registration being loose and ill-defined and the list itself being poorly constructed and extremely inaccurate. However, overall, the most important issue is that there has been very little evidence provided to indicate that vocational registration is working in terms of either better patient care or improvements in the standard of general practice. The legislation provides that for general practitioners (GPs) to be eligible for vocational registration they have to be predominantly in general practice and have appropriate training in general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The criteria used for vocational registration is determined by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP). I actually asked for a copy of the criteria during the Estimates committee meetings but it has not been forthcoming from the Department as yet. I would appreciate it if the Minister could supply me with this information. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter I raised in the Estimates committee meeting was the requirement of GPs on the vocational register to provide home visits. The Committee was told that there is no legal requirement to provide home visits. The criterion is that, with full vocational registration, GPs have to give an undertaking that they will be available for home visits. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the indicators of compliance as to whether or not the GP is in general practice is whether or not he provides home visits. However, in practice, there is nothing to compel the general practitioner to do this. The point I am trying to make is that a higher rebate is being paid and the GP is being advertised as being a better doctor, which implies that one is getting a better service from these doctors. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Estimates hearing I asked to be provided with an update of figures of what percentage of vocationally registered GPs provide at least one home visit. My office has not yet been provided with that. The last figures that I have available to me are from the March 1990 quarter when 91.3 per cent of vocationally registered GPs undertook at least one home visit. Therefore, 8.7 per cent of vocationally registered GPs failed to undertake at least one home visit. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a significant number of GPs on the register who are failing to meet the criteria. I do not believe that the system, which has been held out to the public as one that provides a better quality GP, is working. The vocational register has been in operation for over 12 months. What is of concern is that there appears to have been no evaluation or check to ensure that people who are vocationally registered are adhering to the conditions of vocational registration. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of revised arrangements were outlined in the Estimates hearing, including a new application form and a letter being sent to all vocationally registered GPs reminding them of their obligations. However, the Department, the Health Insurance Commission and the RACGP have yet to decide on the matter of whether the HIC should make information available to the RACGP in order to assist it in monitoring the compliance with vocational registration criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hoped that in the future an agreement is reached whereby evidence given to the HIC that a GP is not acting in compliance with vocational registration criteria is provided to the RACGP for investigation. I hope that the protocols for passing on this information are completed soon and that the vocational register is tightened up. I go back to the two questions that I have asked about the criteria for registration as a vocationally registered general practitioner, and also about the figures regarding the number of home visits undertaken by vocationally registered GPs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will certainly undertake to provide the criteria for registration. I do not know why that has not been provided but I imagine that it can be fairly readily provided. They are called guidelines, apparently, and they can be provided. As to the question of up to date figures on the percentage of vocationally registered doctors providing at least one home visit compared with other general practitioners, at the Estimates hearing Senator Patterson asked for an update of those figures. The Health Insurance Commission is currently extracting information to answer the honourable senator's question and detailed data will be provided when available. It is expected that the analysis would be able to be provided very shortly, but the extracting of the information is taking a little longer than had been thought. It is being undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that I will be able to receive that before the end of this sitting. One of the other issues I wanted to address was the accuracy of the vocational register. In the Estimates hearing I raised the matter of the accuracy of this register. There were 7,561 GPs on the register as at 15 April. The Government's target, I believe, is 10,000 to 12,000. At the rate of 40 additions to the register a week, which were the figures supplied in Estimates, it will take over 12 months to reach even the lower limit of the Government's target.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have received many complaints about the accuracy of the vocational register. Copies of parts of the register that I have obtained have been riddled with mistakes. Many of the problems with the register have been with practice locations listed. Many of the practice locations provided by the Health Insurance Commission are open but not active. </PARA>
<PARA> In the five to six weeks prior to Estimates, the Committee was told that there had been a process of analysis of activity location so that information given out now relates only to the most active of GP practices. I just wanted to check because the answer given in Estimates was that only the most active of the doctors' practices are listed. Does that mean that two or three practices can be listed on the vocational practice or the one at which the doctor is most active?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Tate" NAMEID="NJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just confirm that it is the one practice at which the doctor is most active. When I was told during the hearing that if I were to obtain a list in two weeks I would find it more up to date I was quite sceptical and my scepticism proved justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a list here obtained from an HIC office about two weeks after the Estimates hearing which clearly shows that the Health Insurance Commission is still publishing multiple addresses when I have just been told that it gives people the one most active practice. It is still giving multiple addresses, many of which are not active premises. I could not see any improvement on the last list. </PARA>
<PARA> Another related matter I wish to raise is the method by which the public is informed of the GPs who are on the register. The Estimates Committee was clearly told that if a person requests a list of vocationally registered GPs, that list is forwarded in the mail if the list is too long to provide over the counter, that is, if there are more than five doctors in that post code. </PARA>
<PARA> From reading the Hansard, I think that both the Minister and I thought that, if there were more than five doctors in the list, one would receive the list by post. I gathered also from that Estimates hearing that one would not get a list of five doctors written by hand. But I have here a list received when somebody asked for a list of vocationally registered doctors which is written in the most appalling handwriting. It has something like the doctor's name, 253 and the address but with no name of the suburb. There is another one I can hardly read-I think it is Minchinbury-and then two other suburbs that are almost illegible. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Tate" NAMEID="NJ4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it was not received in the mail, but over the counter-five handwritten scribbled addresses. It is also of great interest, but not much use to a person who is supposedly getting one of these vocationally registered doctors, most of whom got in under the grandfather clause anyway. Apparently one does get a handwritten list, but that is not what I believe I was told in Estimates. How a sick person or someone who is elderly is supposed to utilise this list, I will never know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question that begs to be asked is: why was this list provided when there appear to be over five doctors-in fact, 20 or more doctors-in this particular postcode? In Estimates the Committee was told that a list is not supplied over the counter if it is too long. The truth is that the public is only offered an illegible handwritten list of five GPs. How can the Minister reconcile this statement by the Health Insurance Commission officials as to the method of providing vocational register information with what actually happens in practice?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would advise the Minister that is not what is happening. I think that the Department needs to do something about its training program to advise its officers at the counter that that is the system, rather than that somebody should get a handwritten scribbled list that cannot be read. That does not conform with what I have been told here. I ask the Minister to ask the Department to ensure that the officers in the Medicare offices know what the requirements are for vocational registration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been provided with a costing of a vocational register. The total cost to the Health Insurance Commission of getting the vocational register in its present form was estimated to be $2.12m. A sum of $1.62m has been spent on advertising and promotional costs-$1.62m spent on promoting and advertising a register that has multiple listings, incorrect addresses, and the names of GPs who are not meeting the criteria set down by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP). I suggest to the Minister that the money would have been better spent if it had been directed at getting the register in a more accurate form than is the current one. I think I should put out for a contract. I would quite like to have $2.12m, and no doubt the Minister and I probably could go into business and set up an accurate vocational register very easily. </PARA>
<PARA> There seemed to be some problem in the Estimates in obtaining a full list of vocationally registered GPs. Health Insurance Commission officers have consistently argued during Estimates that secrecy provisions prevent the full disclosure of the list. As a member of the public, I can have access to a page or two, or even more. If I ask for five postcodes, the list will have in it a lot of general practitioners. It is given to assist the public. Well, I do not know whether it does assist the public. Presumably it is felt that it does assist the public to have access to vocationally registered GPs. This list contains, or is supposed to contain, the names, addresses and phone numbers of GPs, or anyway their names and addresses, supplied by the GPs to the RACGP and they are then passed on to the Health Insurance Commission. There is no-I repeat, `no'-secret information on the register, nor any information on the register that is not already obtainable by the public. I have been told in the Estimates Committee that it cannot have a list because of so-called secrecy provisions. Let me tell the Department-and I think Minister Tate questioned that advice at one stage-that I have received advice that this is not so. It would have been appropriate for the Committee to have been provided with that information since the Act does not prevent the Parliament receiving that information, and only when the Act specifies that the Parliament is not to have that information is that the case. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning Senator Crichton-Browne tabled documents on parliamentary privilege and secrecy provisions. The advice I had was as follows, and I shall read it into Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA>At first sight it might be thought that this matter raises the question of whether statutory general secrecy provisions, provisions which in general terms prevent officers disclosing information acquired under statutes or in the course of their work, have any application to the provision of information to parliamentary committees. The question was raised in relation to the National Crime Authority Act and the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, and is disputed in the advices to that committee which are attached to the explanatory memorandum accompanying the National Crime Authority (Powers of Parliament Joint Committee) Amendment Bill 1990, introduced by Senator Crichton-Browne on 8 November 1990. The Solicitor-General appears to think that the secrecy provision contained in that Act in some circumstances operates to prevent the provision of information to that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The advice goes on to say that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the person giving the advice maintains that the terms of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 make it utterly clear that the general statutory secrecy provisions cannot operate to prevent the provision of information to a parliamentary committee, such provision of information being explicitly declared to be a proceeding in Parliament by that Act. </PARA>
<PARA>And so the advice goes on. It leads me to believe that there is absolutely no reason why the Parliament is not able to be provided with that information. If any of the advisers shake their heads in the advisers box, let me say-and I think I will be backed up by Senator Herron-that in regard to the Medical Registration Board in Queensland one can go and buy a copy of the list of registered doctors for a dollar or two, containing their names, addresses, and all the information that is here on the vocational register. The Minister did achieve what seemed to me to be the impossible in that I could look at the vocational register. I received a letter that says that I was not to use it or to publish it:</PARA>
<PARA>At the recent Estimates Committee you made a request for the Committee to be supplied with a copy of the vocational register. The Commission has declined to do this on the basis that in supplying the list to the Committee it will become a public document.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to the Minister that there is nothing in here that is secret. If the Department argues that it has got commercial value, I can find out from some of the commercial operators more about the doctors who are on this list than is available there, and they are more accurate lists. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The General Manager has agreed that this be released to you personally and I would request that it not be published in any way. </PARA>
<PARA>I will abide by that, but I will challenge in this place the right of a department to say that to me-to say that to parliament. There is nowhere in the Act that precludes this Parliament from demanding and asking for that to be tabled and from receiving that document. I will not do that in good faith with the Minister, but I will continue to insist that this Parliament has access to that document in order to evaluate it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appalling. I have the document here. I refer to the Canberra section of the document, and the Minister has just told me that the list would be brought fairly much up to date, with improvements that would take about two weeks from 18 April. This document is dated 10 May 1991, and it lists doctors with multiple entries, doctors who have retired, doctors who have moved to Sydney, doctors who are not at the address, doctors who have moved and doctors who have not been known in the area-all on this up to date vocational register which will be given to sick, elderly people when they go into the Medicare office to get information about these wonderful vocationally registered doctors from whom they will get a very special service, many of whom, as I said, qualified under the grandfather clause. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in that debate over and over again, the Opposition had no objection at all to improving the level of knowledge of general practitioners, but this is a farce-an absolute farce. How many million dollars have been spent on this absolutely appalling list? I will be going through this list and asking continually for updated lists because I want to see the situation improve. I expect this list to be presented to the Parliament. I do not believe that there can be an argument that this document should not be tabled in Parliament. I will be seeking further advice, but I am telling the Health Insurance Commission that I will be hounding it until it gets this list right.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are changes and that doctors move, but it is not good enough. It is messy. There are duplications and it does not help people who are seeking assistance from doctors who, according to the Government, will provide a better service. What is the Minister's advice on whether he believes that it is appropriate for this document not to be tabled in the Parliament?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the advice from the Attorney-General's Department reveals that the General Manager of the Health Insurance Commission may exercise his discretion to release the register in full, and that such a release would not contravene the secrecy provisions of the Act. It had been thought that the details of the register could be revealed only under the public interest clause of the secrecy provisions of the Act. Apparently that is not the case, as I am advised tonight. Indeed, the General Manager does have a discretion to permit the release of the register in full without contravening the secrecy provisions of the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, privacy principle No. 10 which, as honourable senators know, is contained in the Privacy Act passed by this Parliament, talks about the use of data for purposes unrelated to the purpose for which the information was collected, and the General Manager of the Commission has decided to maintain the policy of limiting the release of data from the vocational register. So, while I cannot say that the secrecy provisions of the Act in themselves preclude the provision of the information to the honourable senator, the General Manager has exercised his discretion in a way that is somewhat limited. The information has been provided to the honourable senator for her analysis and commentary, for the purposes which she has in mind in order to improve the standard of the register, to enable her to question officials as vigorously as she has and, as I say, to goad them into the proper construction of that important register document, which apparently is not in complete harmony with the precise information which ought to be on it and available to those who seek to have the benefit of a list of doctors who are on the register. As I say, the General Manager has adopted that policy and has made the information available to the honourable senator. I hope that its having been made available to her enables her to undertake the sort of questioning that is appropriate in order to ensure that this vocational register is properly assembled. </PARA>

It was on the basis of that distinction that an argument was constructed that it was not possible to provide to Senate Estimates committees the information that was sought. Since that opinion was given, it has been thought that section 3f of the Health Insurance Act, which refers to the vocational register, does vest in the General Manager of the Commission the unfettered discretion to release names and addresses from the register. It is on that specific provision in the Act that I was relying in making the suggestion that I did to Senator Patterson and Senator Herron.</PARA></TALK.START>

The distinction the Minister appears to be presuming to draw is that there are no coercive powers for Estimates committees but there are for other committees. If the information is provided as a result of a demand by the committee, privilege attaches; but if the information is simply asked for and is provided by the witness, an offence occurs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have thought, with the greatest respect, that is nonsense.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe. The power to compel the attendance of witnesses and to require them to answer questions is one of the express powers conferred on the Senate and the House of Representatives by section 49 of the Constitution-as Senator Crichton-Browne would be aware-it being one of the privileges of the House of Commons as at 1 January 1901.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under section 49 of the Constitution, such powers may only be abrogated or modified by an expressed declaration of the Parliament. It follows that section 135a (1) of the Act does not affect the Senate's power to require disclosure of information specified in that provision and no breach of section 135a (1) would result from such disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, there is no express declaration in section 135a (1) to abrogate the powers of the Parliament to compel the attendance of witnesses to answer questions or whatever. Senate Estimates committees, however, do not enjoy the Senate's powers in relation to the disclosure of information. The functions, powers and procedures of a Senate Estimates committee are prescribed in Senate standing order 26. Standing order 26 (13) provides:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committees may ask for explanations from Ministers of State in the Senate, or officers, relating to the items of proposed expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the standing order does not confer on the committee the power to compel witnesses to answer questions or produce documents. Given this, the question arises whether section 135a (1) prohibits the disclosure of the prescribed information to Estimates committees. The conclusion was that information could not be divulged. I will make this particular opinion available to Senator Crichton-Browne, having the concurrence of the department to which it was provided. It may be that he will find it very useful in his deliberations on these matters. </PARA>

To put it bluntly, I understood the Minister to be saying that, unless the words of an Act particularly exclude privilege, the Parliamentary Privileges Act prevails, notwithstanding the secrecy provisions, unless the secrecy provisions say to the contrary. In this case they do not, and they are the words I thought the Minister read out. Therefore, the secrecy provisions the Minister read out are the standard secrecy provisions. It does not matter whether coercive powers are available to an Estimates committee. That seems to be totally irrelevant. The committee can simply invite a witness who was quarantined by the Parliamentary Privileges Act from any offence under the secrecy provisions, save where the Act says particularly to the contrary.

<PARA> The other issue I would like to raise is the reissuing of the Medicare card. I draw to the Minister's attention an advertisement in the Age entitled `How to get your new Medicare card'. At least the people shown in the advertisement have hats on, unlike the photographs that the Health Insurance Commission decked its annual report with last year. I hope that those people have factor 15-plus suntan lotion on. In the advertisement we have two people sunning themselves. They are told in the advertisement:</PARA>
<PARA>How to get your new Medicare card . . . A new Medicare card is being introduced, so we can more efficiently validate and process claims, and because many of the old cards are wearing out or contain particulars which have changed. So how do you get one? By doing absolutely nothing. Most cards will be automatically sent within the next six months. If you don't receive one this time, it probably means your card particulars need to be confirmed. But you still need do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>That is wonderful! That is actually what is written here. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>We'll contact you if we need more information. Naturally, your old card remains valid while you're waiting for the new one. So sit back, relax and let Medicare do all the work. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope the Minister feels confident that he is going to get his new Medicare card. If this advertisement is accurate, can the Minister tell me why the Assistant General Manager of the Health Insurance Commission told the Estimates Committee that, firstly, the Health Insurance Commission would not reissue cards without making contact with people-I presume that its officers are going to stroll along the beach giving them to people-and, secondly, that for the first six months Medicare cards will be reissued when claims are made at Medicare offices? It seems to me that the information I was given in Estimates and the information in this advertisement, which appeared just a few weeks later, do not correlate. Could the Minister, or the Department through the Minister, explain?</PARA>

It is envisaged that, in making contact with a branch office in order to secure a Medicare payment, then at that time the opportunity will be taken by the Medicare office to do whatever is necessary to enable that person to receive a new card.

The thrust of the advertisement was to allay fears or worries about the process, to indicate that the introduction will take a gradual and discreet course and to indicate that people did not have to rush in to their Medicare office especially in order to get a new Medicare card to secure their future entitlements.</PARA></TALK.START>

So I will put those four questions on notice next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to raise one other issue about the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority. Senator Walters and I asked a number of questions regarding one pharmacy approval in Port Macquarie but questioning was difficult, given the lack of certain relevant information. I have been provided with an opinion which states that there is no reason why the information I asked for could not have been supplied. The issue of new pharmacy approvals is a matter for concern because the whole idea behind the pharmacy restructuring process was to reduce pharmacy numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has stated that there are too many pharmacies servicing our population. Answers to questions about the desired pharmacy population ratio have been unsatisfactory. But, given the premise that there are too many pharmacies, it is a concern that here we have an example of an area identified by the Department as being overserviced and a new pharmacy having been approved and subsequently opened. I will not go into all of the details. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing that concerned me when I read the new monthly journal Retail Pharmacy-there is not only that publication, which we mentioned in Estimates, but also I have been told about another one in Victoria and another in another State-was the article which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Rorts are already being reported-and don't forget, you are paying for them. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose it was reminding pharmacists and the taxpayers that they were paying for them. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>At least one pharmacist is known to have closed a pharmacy within 500 metres of his long established business and handed in the oldest approval number. Meanwhile, he actually closed the newer business and simultaneously ``relocated'' into the older premises. Given that the authority had to approve the ``relocation'' one can only ask whose money do they think they are handing out?</PARA>
<PARA> In one very large town two nearly adjacent pharmacists were considering amalgamating with the younger pharmacist buying out the older partner. They then found that after getting $80,000 from the authority and several hundred thousand dollars goodwill changing hands between the two, that a third pharmacist just under 500 metres away could move into the vacated building. No sterilisation of the site as it was in the 500 metres allowed even if that site was the subject of money paid out for amalgamation. </PARA>

<PARA>The chairman of the authority was questioned on this and his reply was: ``We are only interested in the handing in of approval numbers.''</PARA>
<PARA>That is a direct quote. One should not always assume that this journal would be any more accurate than some of our newspapers, but at least it is an issue that has been raised by someone in the field. Another issue which is pointed out in another article by another author in that same journal makes me very concerned about the Restructuring Authority. The article points out an example and states:</PARA>
<PARA>This situation has highlighted how easy it is to take advantage of the amalgamation and closure system.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Consider those pharmacies in major hotel complexes and inner city shopping centres. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to refer to pharmacies which do not give out many subsidised scripts. The article asks what is to stop these operators from applying for the closure package, getting a golden handshake and the next day reopening the pharmacy's doors, albeit minus an approval number. The overall effect on its business might be minimal, given the fact that it has not dispensed many subsidised scripts. As the article says:</PARA>
<PARA>After all, the odd Amoxil or KH3 can be dispensed without the customer noticing the lack of approval number. And as long as they conform with all the requirements of the pharmacy board, the board would have no power to stop these pharmacies operating. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem which has surfaced involves partnerships which own several pharmacies in close proximity. </PARA>
<PARA> They can elect to close one that attracts the highest overhead, directing all business to their remaining outlets. </PARA>
<PARA> The pharmacy they decide to close may well be the most convenient for the customers. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought this was what we were on about. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>And what happens when that landlord wishes to find another pharmacy tenant and is prepared to challenge the guild/government agreement in his efforts to do so?</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Unlikely to happen-or already occurring in at least one suburb in Sydney?</PARA>
<PARA>A number of other issues which have been raised concern that. In fact, sufficient concern has been expressed to me that I have discussed it with my colleagues. Senator Walters is also very concerned and because of that concern I have circulated an amendment to the motion that the report of the Estimates Committee be adopted. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, and that the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for inquiry and report by 9 September 1991:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has tried to assist Senator Patterson in relation to her queries concerning the operations of the pharmacy restructuring scheme, but particularly in relation to a certain case, and certain documentation has been made available. However, in relation to the more general matters that Senator Patterson is concerned about, the Government is not disposed to support the reference of matters to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. It believes that, as the Authority was established only in February 1991 and works totally within guidelines determined by the Minister which determine the criteria for approval of a new pharmacy for closure payments and for amalgamation payments, and as the Authority makes recommendations to the Secretary of the Department and the Secretary's decisions are reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), we have a system of review which ought to enable the occasions when the Authority-or the Secretary acting on the advice of the Authority-might be acting in a way which was not in accordance with the guidelines to be reviewed quite adequately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, the Authority intends to recommend to the Minister shortly that a committee be established to review the outcomes of its operations from the standpoint of the achievement of the objectives of the pharmacy restructuring program. As far as individual applicants are concerned, there is an AAT review of outcomes. As I say, there are very clear ministerial guidelines or criteria for Authority recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the program as a whole and a review of its operation, the Authority-and we have to remember that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia has two members on the Authority-is able to carry out an evaluation of itself. In addition, it will be seeking from the Minister a review committee to examine its operations with regard to the objectives set for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the sorts of matters which the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs might inquire into under Senator Patterson's particular reference are matters that are perhaps a little premature and unnecessary, given the only very recent establishment and operation of the Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 15 April 1991:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With reference to a proposal for a protocol to import raw salmonid flesh from New Zealand:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Have all possible tests been undertaken to ensure that imported raw salmonid flesh does not, and cannot, contain viruses or diseases which could affect Australia's aquaculture fish population.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Will the Minister give an unqualified assurance that the signing of this protocol will be delayed until such time as irrefutable proof can be given by the New Zealand Government and the salmonid flesh producer that it is impossible to contaminate the Australian fish population.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Would existing salmonid flesh export arrangements with other nations, such as the United States or Japan, be affected if the proposed protocol with New Zealand is signed.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Does New Zealand permit the import of raw salmonid or trout flesh from Australia; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Has this protocol already been signed; if not, when is it likely to be signed.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Will the protocol be a disallowable document under the terms of s.46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1 &amp;2) The finalised protocol will contain stringent conditions to ensure that the risk of disease entry into Australia is negligible. The risk of an exotic organism establishing in Australian fish populations from imports of New Zealand salmonid meat must be considered very remote. This is especially so as the material is being imported for human consumption and the likelihood that any product containing infective material will come into contact with fish must be very small. The principal practical issue in regard to trade relates to the cost of measures which will give the desired level of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am advised that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is unaware of any such effects.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. The New Zealand position on access for salmonid products is very closely aligned to that of Australia. Like Australia, New Zealand allows access to heat treated product, but does not allow the importation of uncooked product. New Zealand is presently assessing the importation of uncooked salmonid meat from Australia, just as Australia is assessing the importation of uncooked salmonid meat from New Zealand. New Zealand claims to have a higher health status for salmonids than Australia as epizootic haemorrhagic necrosis virus, Aeromonas salmonicida, and some Streptococcus and amoeba species which cause or have the potential to cause salmonid diseases are present in Australia but not in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The protocol has not been signed at this time. The exact timing of finalisation will depend on satisfactory resolution of the outstanding technical issues-this is not expected to occur before July 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Taking direct marketing to mean an interactive system of marketing which uses one or more advertising media to effect a measurable response and/or transaction at any location, the response is as follows.</PARA>
<PARA>Direct marketing is utilised by the Office of Multicultural Affairs (OMA), the Aboriginal Reconciliation Unit (ARU) and the Office of the Status of Women (OSW).</PARA>
<PARA>OFFICE OF MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in instances where the Office wishes to provide detailed information on programs or activities to the general public and defined target groups.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to achieve a greater awareness of multicultural issues and relevant Commonwealth Government programs and services.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) distribution of printed material through direct mail.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Because direct marketing is only a small part of OMA's community information activities and overlaps several functional areas these costs are incorporated into individual program/project costs.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. OMA has a mailing list of around 23,000 names and addresses in various categories, including organisations and individuals who have asked to be included on the list. Telephone numbers are not listed.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. OMA publishes a quarterly newsletter, Focus, which provides information and articles on a range of topics and is distributed to all those organisations and individuals on the mailing list. In 1990-91, issues of the newsletter included special fliers advertising the availability of Office publications and survey forms seeking comments on OMA's posters and the newsletter itself.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, guidelines for the Community Initiatives Grants Program, part of the Commonwealth Government's Community Relations Strategy, were sent to approximately 3,500 community groups in April 1991. Letters were also sent to over 2,000 people in February 1991 inviting them to have their names included on a register of individuals with expertise in multicultural affairs for use by Commonwealth agencies in recommending names for appointment to statutory and other bodies.</PARA>
<PARA>OFFICE OF THE STATUS OF WOMEN</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in particular instances where the Office wishes to provide information on Government policies and programs to improve the status of women.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a greater awareness of women's issues and Government policies and programs to improve the status of women.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) OSW uses a mailing list to distribute a quarterly newsletter, OSWomen. A coupon has been placed in the OSWomen newsletter to allow new readers to add their names to the mailing list.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No, direct marketing is a minor element in the OSW publications program and is not a significant expenditure item.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes, OSW maintains a data base for the publications mailing list. The information on the mailing list is limited to name, address and area of interest and is not used for telemarketing. In addition, the Office maintains a mailing list of major women's organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes, OSW includes in the OSWomen newsletter notices advising of the availability of particular publications. A coupon for self-nomination to the mailing list was placed in a women's supplement of the Sydney newsletter St George Leader in March 1991. A mailout of guidelines and application forms for the National Agenda for Women Grants Program took place in July 1990 to organisations and individuals who had previously expressed interest in applying for a grant.</PARA>
<PARA>ABORIGINAL RECONCILIATION UNIT</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The ARU believes that direct marketing will be of assistance in providing information and reports on progress with the Aboriginal reconciliation process to various groups in the community, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The use of direct marketing would help ensure that the reconciliation process has a successful outcome.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Distribution of printed material.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. As these activities overlap several functional areas the costs are incorporated into program costs.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The ARU is in the process of developing a database from which it can operate its own direct mailing. The final format of the database will not be determined until the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation has been established.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The ARU has not undertaken any direct mailing this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL POLICY DIVISION</PARA>
<PARA> (1) &amp;(2) These questions are not applicable to the Division.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Social Justice Secretariat, a Branch of Social Policy Division, has a mailing list of welfare organisations, academics, librarians, etc. It also has a list of SES officers and a list of relevant organisations from the Office of Multicultural Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Social Justice Secretariat mailed out its Social Justice Strategy Statement 1990-91 immediately after the last Budget to everyone on its general list and its SES list.</PARA>

<PARA>* academics and tertiary institutions.</PARA>

<PARA>The OLG to contribute to and implement Federal Government strategies on matters concerning Local Government and local communities, and promote local achievement of national objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The BIR considers that direct mail is the most relevant and effective means.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) The BIR has a database of approximately 2500 names for distributing its quarterly BIR Bulletin magazine, publications catalogue and conference promotion inserts.</PARA>
<PARA>The OLG has developed a mailing database comprising Local Government, State Authorities, industry, relevant professional associations, unions, media and consumer groups.</PARA>
