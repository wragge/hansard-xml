<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Telecom is selling 0055 telephone networks to private contractors who provide offensive and sexually explicit recorded messages to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The providers of these services are advertising in the pages of Australian newspapers in a manner which is designed to titillate and attract calls from the whole community and thus play on the curiosity of children.</PARA>
<PARA>3. These services degrade and humiliate women and portray them as sex objects, and they destroy the innocence of children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, immediately call on Telecom to so regulate the conditions under which these services are made available, that women are no longer portrayed as sex objects, degraded or humiliated and that the innocence of children is protected.</PARA>

<TITLE>Chubb Report on Higher Education for the Australian Capital Territory</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. We, the undersigned, wish to signify our strong opposition to the Chubb Report on Higher Education for the A.C.T. which proposes that the Institute of Advanced Studies be separated from the Faculties of the Australian National University and the Faculties be amalgamated with the University of Canberra. We believe that the implementation of these proposals would mean the destruction of the Australian National University's national and international high standing and firmly established reputation as a centre of excellence in research and scholarship. The dismemberment of the ANU would severely affect the ability of both the Institute and the Faculties to attract, or even retain, high quality academic staff, funding and support. It would also adversely affect the recruitment of top students. The maintenance of the Australian National University, as it is now constituted-a national university with an international, national and local role-is of vital importance to the A.C.T. and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>2. We call on the Senate to reject the recommendations of the Chubb report and to support the integrity of the ANU and the existing relationship between the Institute and the Faculties.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 amends six Acts, and repeals one Act, of the DASETT Portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The repeal of various borrowing provisions in the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 are the result of last year's decision by the Loans Council that the States and Territories will gradually assume full responsibility for raising and servicing their own Government debt. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context it is no longer appropriate for borrowings by the ACT and Northern Territory Governments and their statutory authorities to require the Commonwealth Treasurer's approval, nor for there to be standing provisions in the Self-Government Acts for the Commonwealth to guarantee such borrowings. These provisions will therefore not apply to borrowings made after 30 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The repeal will not affect the Commonwealth's power under other legislation, current or future, to guarantee Territory borrowings for special reasons, nor limit the borrowing powers of the ACT or the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment of section 14 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 will enable the Legislative Assembly of the ACT to legislate to establish a superannuation scheme for members of the Assembly and their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 14 must be read together with section 73 of the ACT Self-Government Act. Section 73 provides for the remuneration of members to be determined either by the Remuneration Tribunal or by enactment of the Legislative Assembly. There is currently a Remuneration Tribunal determination in force and there is conflicting legal advice as to whether an enactment could be made. Paragraph 14 (1) (c) provides that a member vacates his or her office if the member ``takes, or agrees to take, directly or indirectly, any remuneration, allowance, honorarium or reward for services rendered in the Assembly, otherwise than under section 73''. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will understand that, given the conflicting legal advice in relation to the position of sections 14 and 73, as well as the risk to members of the ACT Legislative Assembly who may receive what could be unauthorised benefits, it was thought advisable to include new subsections 14 (3) and 14 (4). These subsections specifically exclude a superannuation scheme for members of the ACT Legislative Assembly and their dependants from the provisions of section 14, and hence also from the provisions of section 73. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Australian Sports Commission Act 1989 will bring reports on the financial transactions and state of affairs of the Australian Sports Foundation under the reporting requirements of section 63M of Division 3 of Part XI of the Audit Act 1901 (the Audit Act). </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has previously included this information voluntarily in its annual reports, but it has been decided to formalise the arrangement following a request from the National Audit Office. It is also consistent with the Government's policy of applying to all Commonwealth statutory authorities the provisions of either Division 2 or Division 3 of Part XI of the Audit Act, which apply to public statutory authorities, including related bodies corporate, such as the Australian Sports Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 correct two minor drafting errors. They do not affect the meaning or application of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes a number of amendments to the National Library Act 1960. Most are minor technical corrections and improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to section 7A of the Act increases the power of the Library to purchase and dispose of assets, and to enter into contracts, without the need to obtain the approval of the Minister, from $50,000 by amount of money or value of property involved, as is currently provided, to $250,000. This new threshold will reflect the present scale of the Library's financial operations and correct the effect of inflation on the previous limit, which has remained unchanged for 18 years. The 1988 Review of the NLA supported a substantial increase in the threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the amendments to sections 15 and 17E, and in new section 15A, is the removal of the requirement that the Governor-General notify in the Gazette the vacation of office and resignation of members of the Council, and of the Director-General, of the Library. The removal of this requirement from the Act was deemed appropriate given that Gazettal is not practice for other statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 21 of the Act will make the provisions of Division 3 of Part XI of the Audit Act 1901 apply to the National Library. This is in line with current Government practice to apply the provisions of either Division 2 or Division 3 of Part XI of the Audit Act to Commonwealth statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 21A provides the Library with a power to invest money held by the Library, other than on trust, that is not immediately required for the purposes of the Library, on deposit with an approved bank, in Commonwealth securities or in any other manner approved in writing by the Treasurer. This power is similar to that given the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority under section 54A of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 27A will allow regulations to be made for the supply of liquor on Library premises, similar to that provided in the National Gallery Act 1975, the National Museum Act 1980 and the Australian National Maritime Museum Act 1990. This will provide the Library with its own independent power over the sale, supply, disposal, possession or control of liquor on its premises, and allow it to operate its catering facilities on a more commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 27B will extend the regulatory powers to control the movement and conduct of persons on Library land and buildings, similar to those in the Australian War Memorial Act 1980, the Australian National Maritime Museum Act 1990 and the National Gallery Act 1975. The new section will allow regulations to be made to increase security to ensure the future safety of the national collection of Library materials and to prevent trespass to restricted areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The final amendment to the Library Act, to section 28, will increase the maximum monetary penalty limit for offences against the regulations from $100 to $500, as well as removing any reference to terms of imprisonment. This will provide a more appropriate penalty and make the limit consistent with that of other cultural institutions, such as the National Museum, the War Memorial and the National Maritime Museum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes a number of amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 to achieve two objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these objectives is to allow all money collected by the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service from leases, licences, permits and other authorities to be used by the Service in the pursuance of its nature conservation role. This is achieved by removing the current requirement in subsection 46 (2) of the Act that all such money be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and specifying instead, through an amendment to subsection 46 (1), that the money must be paid into the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The second objective is to allow the Director of the Service to invest money that is held by the Service but is not needed immediately. This is achieved by removing the prohibition on investment currently contained in Section 49 of the Act and adding a new section 49A. Section 49A specifies that money standing to the credit of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Fund that is not required immediately for the purpose of the Fund may be invested by the Director with an approved bank, in Commonwealth securities, or in any other manner approved by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> This power is also similar to that given the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority under Section 54A the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. As well as allowing interest to be gained on money held in the Fund, this provision will allow the Director of the Service to accept bequests in the form of shares, securities and other forms of investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the opportunity is taken in the Bill to repeal the Darwin Lands Acquisition Act 1945, which is entirely spent. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In concluding my contribution on this debate, I hope the Senate will reject the amendment to this legislation moved by Senator Bishop. If honourable senators refer to the first clause, they will see it should be rejected because it states that the only reason the Government is providing schemes such as this for the promotion of research and development, that is, schemes similar to those supported by all governments for the past quarter of a century, is that it has allegedly failed to provide the necessary settings of the economy whereby the private sector would provide all the necessary impetus and assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This deserves to be rejected because it would be a very regressive move indeed for any government of whatever political persuasion in the foreseeable future to remove what I consider to be essential government support as well as private sector support for the encouragement of research and development in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, you might be operating under a misbelief or a misinterpretation of what I want to do. I will follow the very profound speech that Senator Parer has made on the Social Security Bill 1990. This Bill is the first of its kind in this Parliament; it is a very large Bill. It has been put forward in an attempt to make legislation understand- able. It simplifies the legislation, particularly the area of social security where the legislation has been quite complex and there have been significant changes in previous years. It has been difficult for clients of social security to understand their rights in this area. Concerns have been expressed by some groups about minor changes that have been made in the legislation. I am sure that Senator Alston will address that matter when he speaks on the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem is that simplicity does not always mean that the Bill is necessarily short, just like this speech will not be as short as I would have liked it to have been. The fact is that the Bill is now before the Senate. I think that Senator Alston will address many of the issues of concern, and I will concede to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Bill 1990 represents a major and largely commendable undertaking by the Government. It is, in fact, a total rewrite of the Social Security Act into plain English form. The Department of Social Security does appear to have consulted very widely on this rewrite, something that perhaps it should have done on issues such as deeming. However, the result of this is a reasonably accessible piece of legislation. I do have doubts as to whether it actually is in plain English, but I share the general community view that it is certainly a lot clearer than it was and as clear as could be expected when dealing with such a complex and difficult area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am particularly impressed by the overall restructuring of the Bill which makes it much easier to locate relevant clauses and considerably easier to find specific information. A number of other innovative features also contribute towards making this a much more accessible piece of legislation-certainly far more accessible than its predecessor. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go through a few of these: an index of words and phrases used in the Bill which directs the reader towards the clauses where they are defined; the method statements that appear at the foot of some sections which explain the way the clauses operate, or provide a step by step guide on the carrying out of some of the most complex calculations; the standard rate calculations contained in chapter 3, which have made what were virtually indecipherable sections into much more useful provisions that, although still requiring a fair degree of concentration, certainly make it easier to calculate payment rates; and notes at the foot of some clauses which clarify points of interpretation or the relationship between the clause and taxation requirements or State laws, and provide a cross reference to other relevant clauses in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that there is general consensus among the relevant community groups and agencies that this Bill represents a fair outcome for a difficult and complex task. I have been in contact with a number of organisations which have been most interested in the process, and they have not raised any major concerns at all about this Bill with me. As I mentioned earlier, there have been some digs about what lawyers and legislators think is plain English but, generally, the word is that the Government has done a very reasonable job. Credit should certainly be given here where credit is due, and I commend the Government for its effort with this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some minor policy changes within this Bill. But these are generally positive and, if anything, improve the situation for clients. In fact, in many instances they actually implement what is already departmental practice. I will go quickly through some of these changes. There are minor changes to the pensions income base; compensation recovery; Social Security Appeals Tribunal requirements; debt and compensation recovery; benefit income test; information gathering and notification powers; sickness benefit; special benefit; and entitlement status. These are relatively minor changes and certainly we commend them. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we do not have any great problems with this rewrite. Therefore, we are rather surprised that this Bill will be taken to the committee stage, but we look forward with interest to listening to any problems that others may have found. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to amendments, the Australian Democrats would like to amend virtually the entire piece of legislation. However, we are treating it as a rewrite and, therefore, as it is not, we believe, the legislative vehicle for any significant changes in social security policy or practice, we will be leaving the many amendments that we would like to move until we see this Bill reappear in, probably, no longer than about a month. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would like to move on to some general concerns. While the rewrite may be a cause for praise in terms of its relative accessibility, it is the content of the Bill and the Government's continuing targeting of the victims of the recession-the recession which it admits that it engineered-that warrant condemnation. There are now significant numbers of Australians living in poverty. They endure a standard of living well below that afforded by ordinary, average Australians. They simply do not have access to many of the things more well-off Australians take for granted-regular work, education for them and their children, leisure and social activities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy to become bored by talk of poverty or homelessness, or people queuing for food or financial assistance. Unfortunately, as a number of media articles have pointed out to us in the last couple of weeks, the `I'm all right Jack' philosophy is well and truly entrenched in this country. Those people who are lucky enough-those of us who have jobs that we know we are going to be able to hang on to, have roofs over our heads and enough money to decently feed, clothe, educate and support our children-do not seem to have come to an understanding of how hard it is for a growing number of Australians to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> We must continue to acknowledge the human cost of this recession and squarely pin the blame on the Government not only for its policies which have got us into this position but particularly for its continuing unwillingness to assist the victims of these policies. We are facing massive increases in unemployment as a direct consequence of this Government's policies. More and more families across the country are finding it impossible to make ends meet. These are not just families in our cities but, more and more, families in rural communities.</PARA>
<PARA> This week the Adelaide Advertiser quoted a financial counsellor with the Para District Counselling Service in Elizabeth as saying that she was alarmed that people struggling to meet their basic bills were now cutting costs by forgoing food and medicine. Yet we still have no commitment from the Government to help voluntary agencies deal with the consequences of the recession that we had to have. The plain fact is that people on statutory incomes do not have enough money to live on. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now look specifically at some of the figures. I am using poverty lines released by the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research for September 1990. The line against which the income of a single adult was measured in September 1990 was $151.70 a week. Consider then the young single unemployed person aged 20 years or under, who is not living at home and who is barely surviving on $105.15 a week. Even if we include the maximum rent allowance of another $30.00 a week, that this person may have been entitled to, this young person is still barely surviving well below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA> The poverty line for single parents with two children was $255.40 a week in September. A sole parent with two young children, receiving a basic pension, additional pension for the children, the mother's and guardian's allowance and family allowance, would only be just on the poverty line with an income of about $225.60 a week. The poverty line for an unemployed couple was $316.10 a week in September. A couple with two young children receiving unemployment benefits, as well as other entitlements for their children, will have an income of about $310 a week or $6 below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA> It may seem that we have no great cause for concern if people are living just above or below the poverty line, but what the research indicates quite clearly is that the poverty lines are very basic levels of cost. If a family is surviving at the poverty line level, or even with a margin of a few dollars above or below it, it is barely covering its most basic needs and will be maintaining a very austere standard of living. For many of these families it is not just for one month or two; it is for month after month, indeed year after year. </PARA>
<PARA> The poverty line is a useful test of how families are living and, although it cannot be seen as a hard and fast measure of living standards, it is widely accepted, as Jenny Trethewey points out in her book Aussie Battlers, that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . families living just below and just above the poverty line share a subsistence living standard and a common battle to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, Jenny Trethewey's research is particularly illuminating because it shows a number of ordinary Australian families who are up against it and are battling to survive, through absolutely no fault of their own. As Bishop Peter Hollingworth says in his introduction to Aussie Battlers:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the families in this survey have had very limited control over their life circumstances and have behaved as responsibly as they could in upholding the interests of their children as their primary objective. </PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental causes of their problems relate to marriage and family breakdown, increased levels and longer periods of unemployment, high housing costs and low levels of government income support for children. All these causes point to the central issue at stake which is that it is intolerably hard to raise a family on a very low income in a society where living costs are so high. </PARA>
<PARA>What all this suggests is that there is a growing number of ordinary Australians and their families for whom life has been reduced to a question of daily survival. This is verified by the number of people turning up at-and being turned away from-welfare organisations providing emergency assistance and relief. These people are not knocking on the Salvation Army's door for the heck of it. It is not their idea that it is somehow enjoyable to beg for help from St Vincent de Paul. It is not some sort of holiday for them to have to wait for hour after hour in a community centre just to get food vouchers. They are cash-starved, their children are often hungry and they simply do not have enough money to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet what do we get from the Government and the Opposition? From the Government, we have had several years of hacking away at the social security budget until even the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) last year agreed that it simply could not take any more cuts. We have seen payments to young people slashed, a pharmaceutical charge introduced for pensioners and beneficiaries, and the introduction of a liquid assets test on applicants for unemployment and sickness benefits. We have seen a reduction in the availability of rent assistance and the introduction of measures which discriminate against pensioners and beneficiaries, while genuine reform of the taxation system slips further and further off the agenda. And as for the Opposition? It plans to cut people off unemployment benefits after nine months because it thinks, as Senator Alston said in an article by Adele Horin in the Sydney Morning Herald on 26 February, 1991:</PARA>
<PARA> The mere fact you will have a cut-off point for unemployment benefits will concentrate the mind. </PARA>
<PARA>No wonder the author of this article, Adele Horin, called the Opposition's policy `heartless in the extreme'. Apparently, according to the Opposition and Senator Alston, people on unemployment benefits are actually having a wow of a time, they do not really want to work or their minds are just not sufficiently concentrated on the task of looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish Senator Alston would talk to some of the families who are queuing outside our welfare agencies and explain his policies to them. He should talk to those people queuing outside the Adelaide Central Mission. He should tell that to the hundreds of young people who recently applied for one videotape operator's job right here in Parliament House, or the several hundred people who turned up for just two jobs with the Melbourne City Council recently. Tell it to the hundreds of unemployed people of all ages in my home State of South Australia who have tried anything and everything just to get a job. They are prepared to go to the Riverland to work in very extreme conditions for very low wages. They are prepared to do anything, as they are desperately seeking work. Senator Alston should also tell it to the 18 unemployed people-that is an old statistic; I would suggest it is even higher-applying for every job vacancy. That is only an average. That gives no indication that there are often hundreds of applicants for every unskilled job or jobs requiring low skills. </PARA>
<PARA> With the Labor Government's popularity in decline, Australians need to look very closely at the alternatives being offered to them by the Opposition. If they do, they will see that they are not just getting more of the same-they are getting worse. Essentially we have seen the Government move away from a social security system which was designed to be a safety net, which idea has had bi-partisan support for many years from many governments. Over the past several years, we have seen this Government start to pick at the safety net and stretch it until holes begin to appear. Today we are seeing the consequences of people falling through these holes. </PARA>
<PARA> Our social security system used to be driven by the attitude that we helped those who, through no fault of their own, were in financial need. We have taken significant steps away from that and have embraced the notion of targeting, which attacks the very concept previously underlying the social security system: it would apply universally to those Australians who lacked sufficient funds to maintain themselves and their families. Indeed, the Government has succeeded in making the system an administrative nightmare, with more and more hurdles being put in the way of those trying to seek minimal support. It has taken a targeting approach to its extreme, with no tangible social benefit to show for it. For example, in a report issued last year, the ACT Council of Social Service said:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1947 a Special Benefit was introduced to pay anyone in financial need who was not entitled to other Commonwealth income support payments, provided they were not involved in industrial disputation. The Department now has a set of administrative instructions in place which has divided this Special Benefit into 32 different granting categories. Apart from providing unproductive employment to staff of Social Security, such excessive regulation serves no other purpose than to make it more difficult for people in economic need who do not have an entitlement to other forms of Commonwealth income support to obtain any payment. This defeats the original legislative intention and serves no worthwhile social purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>This exemplifies the new Australian Labor Party attitude to income support. The concept of security has well and truly disappeared from our social security system. It is time we recognised that people need income security because they are without financial support. That is the reason we need a social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> What is going to happen as more and more holes appear in the safety net? What will happen as more and more people fall through this so-called safety net? Where does the Government think they should go? I can tell honourable senators where they end up. They do not suddenly miraculously get jobs or find other sources of income; their minds are not suddenly so concentrated that they can start up their businesses again or buy back the farm or go out and find a non-existent job. No, they end up on the steps of welfare agencies. I quote from the Adelaide Advertiser:</PARA>
<PARA> The debt project officer with the South Australian Council of Social Services . . . Mrs Margaret Galdies, described the lack of resources available to the agencies as a `sad indictment on society'. </PARA>
<PARA> `When agencies which are seen as a last resort by many can't help any more, where do people go?'</PARA>
<PARA>Surely, this must be a clear indication to the Government that not only are its economic policies not working but also the social security system is failing to provide adequate support for the victims of these policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition similarly welcomes the introduction of the Social Security Bill 1990. We see it as a major step forward to have a new plain English version of what has hitherto been an incredible nightmare, even for lawyers, let alone ordinary members of the public who have tried to wade their way through the current mishmash and complexities of the Social Security Act and the more than 100 amending Acts that have been added on since 1947. We therefore regard this as a very positive step, one that we hope will be replicated in other areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly, it has been said to us that the rewrite does not involve any major policy initiatives. I have to say that the Government has been less than forthcoming in detailing what changes there have been. A document headed `Policy Changes' has been made available. It seems to have emanated from the legal section of the Department of Social Security, but it is almost entirely concerned about the impact that these changes will have on DSS staff rather than on the policy nature of the changes. Therefore, I continue to require the Department to spell out the details of the changes to a greater extent and also to specify whether there is any cost to revenue involved. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of it, many of these changes seem minor and, as others have said, the agencies which are very vigilant in those matters have not, to date, expressed any significant concerns, although the welfare rights unit took the precaution of establishing a task force to consider in detail the implications of the Bill and, on the basis of the discussions that we have had with the unit, it is to provide to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs any matters of concern in the course of this day. If it does not have those concerns, then I imagine there would be no need for the Committee to have a meeting because it would mean that there really is not anything to contradict the Government's assertions that this is simply a rewrite and does not involve any policy changes of significance. I think, if we proceed on that basis, then we should all be welcoming what is, hopefully, going to be a new era for those who have to deal with the complexities of this legislation on a daily basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say a few brief words about the area of social security in general. I am prompted to do so, in particular, by the very selective and misleading remarks of Senator Lees. It is very unfortunate that those who address themselves to the human misery and plight of those who suffer from a range of disadvantages are not prepared to look at the causes of those disadvantages. Once again, we simply had a litany of complaints and political criticisms; but we had no attempt to address the underlying root causes of poverty. I think it has been said by many, and I certainly echo the sentiment, that the greatest antidote to poverty is employment. </PARA>
<PARA> What is critically needed at the present time is to get Australia back on the track, to re-establish a rising standard of living-one that will enable ordinary Australians to have access to jobs and not to have to be reliant on social security. To the extent that people are, despite their best endeavours, unable to obtain employment, there has never been the slightest suggestion that the Opposition would see them go wanting. That is why I find it somewhat distressing, but perhaps not altogether surprising, that Senator Lees would make no mention at all of the corollary of the policy that we took to the last election, which involved the provision of special benefits for those who were unable to obtain employment within a specified period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also, I think, somewhat less than frank for the Australian Democrats not to put that sort of proposal in an international context and to acknowledge that no other country in the world has an open-ended system of providing unemployment benefits. The Democrats seem to think there is no such thing as incentive; that one should simply take people at face value and, in effect, provide assistance to all those who ask for it. I do not believe that is the responsibility of government; it would be an abdication of responsibility. The Government's responsibility is to satisfy itself that people are in genuine need and that, despite their best endeavours, they are unable to look after themselves; that is the concept of a safety net which we continue to endorse. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly take the view that the voluntary agencies do a magnificent job and we find it surprising that the Government has been reluctant to provide any additional resources to those agencies despite the obvious significant increase in calls on their largess. We would certainly take a different approach. We would regard the agencies as much better barometers and judges of need and channels through which we believe resources could be provided much more effectively than through the current bureaucratic mechanisms. So I reiterate that we do not regard social welfare as a residual area. It is a critically important area of social and human need but it is not there simply for the availability of anyone who wants to call on it: it is there as a last resort. That, clearly, must involve targeting. </PARA>
<PARA> The notion that somehow we ought to have a universal system simply does not make sense in this context. It might make sense to Senator Lees and others in the context of superannuation or age pensions where it is often argued that we ought to have a national scheme that would be funded either by contributions made during a person's lifetime or simply through the tax system. But to argue that somehow social security ought to provide universal coverage is a nonsense. Who are we providing assistance to? Clearly, we have to define the eligibility requirements, and then we have to be satisfied that people are within those requirements. That is what targeting is about. Targeting is about the efficient delivery of social security benefits to those who are in need of them. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that one can eliminate the application of benefits to those who do not need them-either because they misstate their position or because of bureaucratic inadequacies-then one has a much reduced capacity to provide additional assistance to the very people Senator Lees is concerned about. That is precisely our concern; our agenda is not to go about reducing the welfare bill for the sake of it. Our concern is to ensure that the welfare bill, which on any calculation is a very significant proportion of government outlays, is used in its most effective manner. That means recognising the needs of those in the community who are the victims of a failed economic strategy that has seen the economy in decline and now in recession-with depression perhaps around the corner-and trying to assist those people in a range of ways. The last resort of those ways will be social security. Unless the Democrats are prepared to target and to look at those most in need then they have a nonsense of a policy. It seems to be again just another example of the Democrats wanting to wring their hands and pretend that somehow they are the only ones concerned about these issues, without any serious attempt being made to ascertain the priorities or to try to identify more effective ways of ensuring that people's needs are met in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the Social Security Bill is a welcome move. We hope that there will not be any unintended consequences that emerge subsequently but we do believe it will provide a boon to all those many users of the Act and whose numbers presumably are also on the increase at the present time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Companies (Insolvency Assistance) Amendment Bill, which amends the Companies Act 1981. That Act has now been superseded by the corporations law, but it remains in force in relation to matters arising before the new national scheme laws commenced. The new national scheme laws already contain provisions which are virtually identical to the provisions of this Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to allow a court to order consolidated meetings of a holding company and its subsidiaries to consider schemes of arrangement. Thus, where a group of companies is in financial difficulties and it is proposed to put in place a scheme of arrangement so that the group can continue trading in the interests of its creditors, this can be achieved by having the court order joint meetings of a holding company and its subsidiaries to deliberate on and approve a scheme of arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation at present under section 315 of the Companies Act is that a company seeking court approval for a compromise or arrangement with its creditors must first seek a court order for meetings to be held of the creditors or members whose rights are affected. Separate meetings of each class of creditor and separate meetings of each class of shareholder in relation to each company are normally required. </PARA>
<PARA> It became obvious in the case of the winding up of the Hooker Group in 1989 that this can be grossly impractical. The provisional liquidators in that case were faced with convening around 500 separate meetings of various creditors in relation to various subsidiaries in the group to approve the scheme of arrangement. The delay involved in convening and holding such a large number of meetings could obviously have disastrous ramifications for a company in serious financial difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is put forward in response to the Hooker case. It provides for a court to order consolidation of meetings where there are more than 30 subsidiaries or fewer than 30 subsidiaries but circumstances exist that justify the consolidation. The Opposition supports the Bill because it brings the Companies Act, the old law in transition phase, into line with the new corporations law. All companies which are in financial difficulties, regardless of whether they are covered by the old law or the new, will have similar mechanisms available to them in the consideration of schemes of arrangement. This is obviously a fair and equitable situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The very fact that the Government has been forced to introduce a Bill to facilitate the setting up of schemes of arrangement for companies in financial difficulties is a damning indictment of the policies that have brought about the appalling deterioration in this country's economy. For example, bankruptcies are increasing at an alarming rate. In the year to June 1990 there was a 10 per cent increase over the previous year. This increase, disturbing enough in its own right, was completely eclipsed by the 1990 September quarter figures which show an increase of 32 per cent over the September quarter of the previous year. Then the December quarter figures show an increase of an incredible 56 per cent as compared with the same quarter of the previous year. Yet, as we know, Mr Deputy President, according to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), this was the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government seems to have forgotten is that bankruptcies and company liquidations are not just statistics. Every bankruptcy and every liquidation is about a person whose financial problems are so severe he or she has had no choice but to resort to this drastic course of action. For all those who have been forced out of business due to the Government's policy of maintaining crippling interest rates and a massive drop in demand for products and services because of the recession, it must be small comfort indeed to know that, according to the Treasurer, it was a recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> At least this Bill will assist in some small measure by facilitating the process of liquidation in relation to holding companies and subsidiaries to bring the provisions in the Companies Act into line with the procedures set out in the corporations law. As I indicated, for these reasons the Opposition feels the Bill is worthy of support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Companies (Insolvency Assistance) Amendment Bill 1990. The background to the Bill is that a company in financial difficulties may make a compromise with its creditors and members and, provided the necessary formalities are complied with and the scheme is approved by a 75 per cent majority, a scheme of arrangement will then bind all members and creditors of the company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed scheme of arrangement must then be approved by the court to ensure that it is bona fide and not unnecessary or contrary to public policy. The court will then usually order the necessary meeting or meetings. Members and creditors may be directed to separate meetings where their interests are so dissimilar that they cannot consult together with a common interest. The court can also order separate meetings for particular classes of creditors, such as unsecured creditors or members; for example, ordinary or preference stockholders. </PARA>
<PARA> At each meeting ordered to be held by the court the scheme must be agreed to by a majority in number representing three-quarters in value of the members or creditors present and voting. After the meetings have occurred and the requisite agreements have been achieved from the members and their creditors, the court must ensure that the meetings and other statutory obligations have been complied with. Provided that public policy considerations do not preclude the arrangement, the court will sanction the arrangement and it shall bind all members and creditors of the company. </PARA>
<PARA> So far, so good. However, because of the above requirements, the scheme of arrangement remedy is a nightmare when a huge corporate group is involved. Since the 1987 stock market crash in particular, large corporate group crashes have become commonplace. One prominent crash was that of real estate giant Hooker Corporation. The proposed scheme of arrangement for Hooker would have involved about 500 meetings and could well have been unsuccessful. That company sought a change in the law for its specific circumstances. This was not acceded to. However, the need for general provisions to cover such situations was agreed to and they are now the subject of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will enable a court to order meetings of creditors of a group of companies with 30 or more wholly-owned subsidiaries on a consolidated basis where the scheme of arrangement will have the effect of transferring assets, property and liabilities to the holding company. This is expected to significantly reduce the total number and cost of meetings necessary in complex schemes of arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill was actually previously distributed as an exposure draft but has been modified since that exposure in one respect. The exposure draft only applied where there were at least 30 wholly-owned subsidiaries in the group of companies. The current Bill provides an additional power for the court to order a consolidation of meetings where there are fewer than 30 wholly-owned subsidiaries where the circumstances justify such an order. The Australian Democrats support the Bill, including this particular change, without amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government thanks Senator Hill, representing the Opposition parties, and Senator Spindler, representing the Australian Democrats, for their support of this very important measure, which is designed to facilitate schemes of arrangement for complex company groups by allowing creditors of different companies in a group to be grouped together for the purpose of approving the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite apparent, and it has been commented on by previous speakers, that what was needed was a capacity within the court to order meetings of creditors of a group of companies on a consolidated basis where the scheme of arrangement will have the effect of transferring assets, property and liabilities to the holding company. This consolidation will reduce the total number of meetings to a manageable number. </PARA>
<PARA> It was quite apparent that in some instances, where a particular collapse has led to many hundreds of companies being involved in a number of States, the number of creditors' meetings required may run into the hundreds. Of course, that can present an enormous impediment to the creditors of a group of companies seeking an arrangement or compromise. So something had to be done. The Government has believed for some time that this remedy is the best way to proceed. Indeed, all State and Territory governments under the ministerial council arrangements thought this was the way to proceed. Mr Bowen initially released an exposure draft on behalf of the ministerial council indicating that this was also the Government's view. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that time, interested groups, including the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia, the Law Council of Australia and the States corporate affairs commissions have all indicated their support. No doubt that is why the chamber is ready to pass this Bill during the course of today's deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important also to note that the power being vested in the court is an additional power. The court already enjoys certain powers under the Companies Act; it has certain discretions in determining the classes of creditors and protecting the interests of creditors. Of course, its paramount duty is to protect the interests of creditors. There is nothing in this proposal which displaces or modifies that very important overriding consideration that the court must direct its activities to securing the interests of creditors in this complex area. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the cooperation now forthcoming will enable these complex corporate structures, when they collapse, to be the subject of a much more efficient method of coming to a scheme of arrangement. I believe that it is also important that the provisions, which this Parliament has already included in relation to the new corporations law coming into effect on 1 January, be available in relation to the windings up which may have commenced prior to 1 January 1991. I believe that in so far as this Bill virtually amounts to providing for the pre-1 January 1991 situation of the policy, which the Parliament passed into law in relation to post-1 January 1991 corporations matters, obviously it should receive the support of this chamber. I commend its passage to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Family Law Amendment Bill 1991 is a reform Bill. Family law reform is always a controversial and difficult subject. This Bill has a long history and a long period of negotiation behind it, of which I will relate a little in a moment or two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset, I remind the Senate that the last time I spoke in this place on the subject of family law reform was just before Christmas when I was acting for my colleague Senator Brownhill, who was out of the country on parliamentary business. Senator Brownhill has had a project to encourage the setting up of a parliamentary committee to re-examine a number of aspects of family law which have been causing ongoing stress and difficulty within the Australian community, in particular the very challenging subjects of custody, property determinations, access, the cost of family law matters and such related issues. When I last spoke on this issue, I indicated that agreement had been reached between the Opposition parties and the Australian Democrats on a decision to set up such a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I hoped that the Government, recognising that it no longer had the numbers, would take the next step, logical and sensible in our view, and that was to come to the party and agree to cooperate in the formulation of a set of terms of reference that could best achieve the objectives of all within the Parliament who are interested in the subject of family law reform and, in particular, that the Government would then agree that the committee not only be a committee incorporate utilising senators, but a select joint committee that could bring into account the interests and expertise within both chambers of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Government at the last moment has seen the commonsense in that proposal and has indicated that it agrees to Senator Brownhill's proposition that there will now be set up again a joint select committee to examine the aspects of family law that I have mentioned, and other aspects. I commend those who have been involved in the process of negotiation, particularly my colleague Senator Brownhill who has pursued this issue because he believes that it is right and that these controversial areas of law need to be revisited and also on behalf of a very large constituency which has put its faith in him. He has demonstrated that that faith was well warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention that history because some of the aspects that are in this Bill before the Senate today normally would have been before that committee, and some issues of practical concern that will be raised in relation to this Bill and the reforms that we are being asked to implement into law today no doubt will be put to the joint select committee, probably to be known as the Brownhill committee. Therefore, the Parliament itself, in that considered environment, may well come back in some months time and say that the reforms that we might implement today could or should have been varied. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing with what is before us without the benefit of that committee's deliberation, at least we have the comfort of knowing that the issues encompassed in the Bill have been subject to debate for a long time. In particular the proposed amendments result from studies conducted by the Family Law Council and conclusions which are set out in two reports. The first report is entitled Child Sexual Abuse 1988 and the second Cinderella Revisited: Rights and Responsibilities in Step Families. The latter report was put down in 1986. In the case of one report for practically five years and the other for nearly three years, the advice contained within the committee reports has been considered and debated. Out of that process this Bill was produced and was put down in the House of Representatives in May last year, with an invitation that the public comment on the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> As is the normal case in family law matters, the shadow Attorney-General received considerable assistance from the community suggesting changes. That assistance came not only from the community, the clientele of the family law structure, but also from professional bodies. I particularly mention the assistance given by the Law Council of Australia and the Law Institute of Victoria. However, as is the wont of lawyers, the advice was not always the same. In fact, in some instances these eminent legal bodies came to the Parliament with conflicting advice, forming different conclusions on the same suggested reforms. Nevertheless, it is our responsibility then to decide what we are prepared to support, taking into account the advice of eminent persons.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes a number of amendments to the existing provisions of family law, particularly in the very difficult area of child abuse. The Bill makes amendments to provide for the reporting of child abuse by Family Court staff to State and Territory child welfare authorities. That is mandatory reporting and is one of the more controversial aspects of the reform package. </PARA>
<PARA> It provides for legal protection for Family Court staff who report child abuse to child welfare authorities; it provides for child welfare authorities and other interested persons to intervene in cases involving alleged child abuse; it limits the number of medical and psychological examinations for children obtained by parents involved in custody and access disputes; it inserts an express provision in the Family Law Act requiring the Family Court in certain proceedings to have regard to the need to protect children from abuse; it provides protection for witnesses from abusive or hectoring questioning, and it gives statutory force to the Family Court's practice of admitting hearsay evidence of statements made by children to adults about abuse suffered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill deals with the difficult subject of step-parent adoptions. It provides that a step-parent adoption does not put an end to existing custody, guardianship or access rights under the Act, unless the Family Court decides that the step-parent adoption is in the child's best interests. The Bill also deals with the question of transfer of custody or guardianship and makes an amendment to stop parents transferring custody or guardianship to non-parents by means of Family Court consent orders or by registering child agreements with the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other amendments of slightly less consequence. The first deals with stamp duty. It seeks to ensure that child agreements relating to ex-nuptial children enjoy the same exemption as maintenance agreements for children of marriage in relation to stamp duties that could be levied by State or Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA> It also empowers the police who are authorised under the Family Law Act to arrest a person and to enter and search premises for the wanted person. There are a number of additional minor amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I now deal briefly with the question of step-parent adoptions. I understand that in recent years there have been a number of cases where parents have used adoption procedures to establish a new family unit consisting of the children, one natural parent and a new spouse, being the step-parent. This has been looked at by bodies interested in reform of this area. I refer in particular to the previously mentioned 1986 report on step-families which was put down by the Family Law Council. It commented on the inappropriateness of adoption as a method of establishing the legal status of a stepchild in a step family. The Council preferred and recommended an alternative approach of allowing the Family Court to determine the parties' custody, guardianship or access rights under the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The clauses that are before us today make clear that a step-parent adoption does not put an end to existing custody, guardianship or access rights under the Act unless the Family Court decides that the step-parent adoption is in the best interests of the child. The Law Council has been somewhat critical of these changes. I understand it argues that the Court has adequate powers as things stand but, on balance, we have decided that further clarification and confirmation cannot do any harm. Because we definitely support the spirit of the amendments, we will be supporting them here today. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of transferring custody or guardianship, the Bill is designed to stop parents transferring custody or guardianship of children to non-parents by means of Family Court consent orders or by registering the child agreements with the Court. These provisions are aimed at ensuring that in future any arrangement that comes before the Family Court that involves conferral of custody or guardianship on non-parents will be scrutinised by the Court to determine whether those non-parents are suitable parents to have custody or guardianship of the child. The only objections that the Opposition has noted to that have been of an administrative nature-concerned about the administrative and financial impact that this might have. But in principle we support the reform and therefore do so in this chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention the exemption of child agreements from stamp duty. That is something that we support. I mentioned also the child maintenance provisions, in particular that part of the Bill providing that a child agreement, in so far as it makes provision in relation to the maintenance of a child, is of no effect if an application for administrative assessment of child support could be made in relation to a child under the provisions of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. We support that provision. </PARA>
<PARA> We support also the provisions that deal with increasing the police powers in this area-that is, the capacity of police, where they are authorised by the Family Law Act or a warrant issued under the Act, to arrest a person and, when they reasonably believe that a person to be arrested is in or on a particular searchable place, they may enter and search that place without a search warrant, presuming that the provisions of these amendments go through today. That reform has our support. Of course, police have similar adequate powers under other pieces of legislation-particularly State legislation-but it has been believed and demonstrated from experience that this extension is also necessary to adequately enforce the provisions of the Family Law Act. We accept that advice. I understand that it has in fact come from no less eminent a person than the Chief Justice, who called for this extension to ensure that police are able to apprehend people who breach domestic violence and other orders issued by the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an increase in penalties under the Bill. In particular, the monetary penalty for an offence of wrongfully removing a child from Australia is increased to $18,000 from the present $10,000. Someone who contravenes a court order will attract a penalty of $6,000 for a natural person and $30,000 for a body corporate, which is an increase. The offence of wrongfully publishing the identify of parties to proceedings will attract increased penalties. We support those changes. Particularly, I personally support the penalty that deals with someone who wrongfully removes a child from the jurisdiction, which has led, I know from my personal previous professional experience, to quite horrendous family stress in seeking to locate the child, fearing for the child's welfare and adequately seeking to resolve the domestic conflict over that child when the child has been removed from the jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the outset that the major reform contained in the Bill is that in relation to child abuse. One has difficulty in imagining many less pleasant subjects than child abuse. Regrettably, abuses of children do occur; and do occur within family situations; and do occur at times of family break-up. When they do occur, it is obviously important that the authorities, acting on behalf of the community as a whole, have adequate powers to properly intervene to protect the interests of the child. The family law in this country, as it deals with children, has been developed on the primary premise that the interests of the child should be paramount. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more difficult subject matters has always been that of the reporting obligations of officials when they come across circumstances of child abuse or alleged child abuse. Certainly, if I think of my home State of South Australia, under our State laws there are now, in many different areas, mandatory obligations to report evidence of child abuse. This reform that is put before us by the Government today seeks to impose mandatory reporting procedures where allegations of child abuse are made to Family Law officers. To do so has therefore required the Government to seek to define `abuse', which in itself is not easy. I readily concede that. Nevertheless, I accept that it is something that has to be defined if one is going to start imposing mandatory requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition have wrestled with this question and the detail of the Government's legislative proposal. Whilst we certainly believe that cases of abuse should be reported, we do believe that the drafting put to us by the Government is too wide. We do believe that its definition of `abuse' is too wide. In fact, some of our suggested changes were taken up in the other place by the Government; for example, to some extent, the definition of `abuse'-particularly, as I understand it, where it is in the very difficult area of psychological abuse-and some of the provisions have in fact been tightened. But we are still of the view that, when an allegation is made, the professional should be able to assess, in the circumstances of the allegation, whether it should be reported to other authorities. Therefore, we favour placing perhaps a greater responsibility on the professional to make that judgment than the Government does by its amendment, which is to, without discretion, oblige the professional to report the abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has also said-and the Government picked this up and accepted it-that, when an allegation of abuse is made against a person, that person should be notified of the abuse. We moved an amendment to that effect in the other place. The Government decided in its wisdom on that occasion to accept that amendment. We are pleased that that has happened. Nevertheless, we come to this chamber still believing that the provisions are too wide and that a discretionary procedure would be a better direction to take. Therefore, I will be moving similar amendments on that issue to those which were moved in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that our direction in this issue is not misinterpreted. In no way would we want to be interpreted as having a view that abuse should not be reported and that it should not be regarded as horrendous; but there are cases where allegations are wrongly made and there is a responsibility to remember the interests of others. We have taken those into account and, as I said, we have placed the onus and the responsibility back on the professionals to use their good judgment and their experience wisely. That is the rationale of the amendment that we put in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned a hearsay question in passing. It has been the practice of the Family Court to accept hearsay evidence in terms of an allegation that has been made by a child to an adult. In this instance, which is an unusual instance, we accept that practice. The court has always got a discretion as to how it receives that evidence and the weight that it places upon it. The Government, however, by its amendment, has sought to legislatively formulate the practice. We do not think it is necessary; we think that it is further limiting discretion. I think that we have some support from professional bodies in our view in that regard. I understand that the Law Council of Australia in particular has regarded the Government's amendment as unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> We did not press our view in the other place. We were proposing to move an amendment to that effect, but accepted in the end that the Government's amendment does not go much further than to formulate in written form what is an existing practice and, therefore, with the reservations I have just expressed, as was similarly put in the other place, the matter was not pressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Another difficult but important question is: who should have the right to intervene in family law matters? The Government, in its amendments, has sought to list those who will have a specific right of intervention. We believe that intervention should always be at the discretion of the court and that leave should be given. We have an amendment to that effect and we will be moving it today. It is an amendment that was put in similar terms in the other place. It also actually increases the list of nominated persons who have an interest and who have, therefore, the right to seek leave to intervene. We certainly believe that in the unique circumstances of family law in the interests of children there will be more cases than in other jurisdictions where leave is given for an interested party to intervene, but we do think that leave is the correct method rather than simply to provide a right in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We generally find in practice that leaving discretion to judges is a better method of operation in this area rather than being too rigid. We believe that the Government is seeking to be too rigid. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a provision included that I wanted to mention. It provides that a child is not to be physically, medically or psychologically examined for the purpose of evidence in proceedings without the leave of the court. We support that. It seems to us to be a sensible reform. </PARA>
<PARA> With those comments, I indicate, therefore, that we support the direction of reform contained within the Bill before us. We support most of the detail, but we will be moving again some of the amendments that we moved in the other place that we believe are still worth pursuing. I have mentioned them during this contribution, particularly that dealing with discretion rather than mandatory obligations in relation to child abuse. On the whole, as I said, we commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Family Law Amendment Bill 1991 today, I realise that everyone in this chamber would be aware of my interest in family law reform and my efforts in trying to establish an inquiry into certain aspects of the Family Law Act and interpretations of it. I would like to personally put on the record my thanks to Senator Hill for his help and assistance-I was away representing this Parliament at the United Nations last year-when this Bill was brought up for debate in an attempt to establish an inquiry into the Family Law Act. It was a policy of the Liberal and National parties to have an inquiry into certain aspects of the operation and interpretation of the Family Law Act at the last election. I am very happy that that will now come to fruition. I am also very happy that some members of the Parliament will now be supporting that inquiry. I thank Senator Spindler for his cooperation and support in getting that inquiry on the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Family Law Amendment Bill is one of a number of amending Bills to the original Family Law Act of 1975, and is indicative of the problems that beset family law. Indeed, there have been 21 separate amendments to the original Act since 1980 when the last parliamentary inquiry was undertaken into a review of the original 1975 Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This latest amending Bill has had an on again, off again history, but I am not implying any criticism of the Government because of that; in fact, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is to be commended for allowing this Bill to be exposed to public scrutiny and comment by various interested community groups.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of aspects of this legislation, both general and legal, on which the community has expressed views and concerns, but perhaps the most sensitive, and certainly one of the most provocative and emotional issues to become intertwined with family law is the question of child sexual abuse. I hasten to advise the Senate that I am in no way an expert, nor would I ever consider myself to be an authority on the question of family law. It is a very emotional area and I know the traumas and the problems that are associated with it. I think that my electorate has many more family law constituents than the electorates of any senator or member of the House of Representatives. Since this Bill was set up, people have written to me expressing their concerns that it was not working quite as well as was intended by those in this chamber and those in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem that there has been an increase in the number of sexual abuse cases. Whether the incidence is on the increase or whether more people are now coming forward to report them, I am not sure. Nevertheless, a number of sexual abuse allegations are being made in disputed custody cases. Therefore, I think it is vital that these allegations are investigated quickly for all concerned. In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General said, `The issue is significant in a number'-and I would contend many-`of family law cases'. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of whether mandatory or discretionary reporting should apply in such cases is difficult to resolve and there are arguments to support either view. I defer to the shadow Attorney-General and his superior legal knowledge on this question when he suggests that the arguments against mandatory reporting far outweigh those in favour. I believe that his view is shared by others in the field. Personally, I tend to support mandatory reporting in areas of child sexual abuse. When figures are available that suggest that one in 11 children born in New South Wales in 1987 will be reported and confirmed as abused children by the time they reach the age of 16, one can understand the extent of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the attention of the Senate, and would like it recorded, the appreciation people in the community have for the active role that Rosemary Sinclair plays as President of the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, known as NAPCAN, which is trying to create a climate so that child abuse will not happen. She is the wife of the right honourable Ian Sinclair, member for New England. </PARA>
<PARA> I will express a personal concern that it seems that allegations of child sexual abuse appear to be the popular line-for want of a better word-in disputed custody cases. I am concerned at the trauma which the child involved in the allegations suffers. A part of the original Act that seems not to have been addressed-I will not say neglected-in every case is the children who are involved in separations. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Macquarie, Mr Webster, said in the other place on this subject, the whole situation that surrounds child abuse is very disturbing. He said he did not think we had reflected enough on the implications of the situation for the role of the family in this area, and I endorse those views. The issue is one that we, as a society, really need to examine in far greater depth. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to the Bill and particularly those clauses which involve the taking of evidence from children, a difficult exercise at any time. In the criminal courts over many years it has been problematical, and certainly in family law cases even more fraught with problems. I note that the Law Council of Australia also expressed concern with this aspect of the status of evidence of children in child abuse allegations. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many aspects of this Bill and I think that Senator Hill has covered every aspect very well, in the way that he always does as the Leader of the Opposition in this place. Therefore, I will contain my remarks to those that I have just outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> Family law will never be perfect and we will never have legislation that suits everyone. However, while our proposed amendments are patching anomalies as they are brought to the attention of the legislators, I believe that the time is overdue for a proper overhaul and detailed examination of the legislation as a whole. I am happy to say that that time is now close at hand. I trust and hope that the joint committee to be set up next week will, because of its bipartisan support from all members of this Parliament, achieve wise counsel and be able to make recommendations for amendments to take away some of the concerns of, and the heartbreak for, people in the community. I support the amendments moved by Senator Hill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1991. I also wish to take this opportunity to comment first on the establishment of the joint committee of inquiry into the operation of the Family Law Act. I thank Senator Brownhill for his generous acknowledgment of my participation in developing the current terms of reference. It should be noted that this committee of inquiry now also has the support-somewhat belatedly-of the Government, and that the Government also adopted a constructive approach to the development of the terms of reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular, I am pleased that I was able to get agreement to include the costs of actions brought before the Family Court; that previous reports will now be considered, because we do not wish to reinvent the wheel; and that the adversarial nature of our law as it impinges on family court disputes will be examined. It has always been my view that at least two areas-industrial relations and family matters-should not be resolved in the terms of our adversarial legal system. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also pleased that the inquiry will include examination of and, I hope, recommendations on measures other than simply narrow legal amendments to the family law as it stands. By that I mean an examination of alternative methods of dispute resolutions; greater emphasis on mediation and counselling, including counselling well before a marriage is at the point of dissolution; and a generally more positive and supportive set of measures, including increased legal aid, than are currently afforded by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn briefly to the Bill before the Senate today. I note, as have speakers before me, that it deals with one of the most traumatic areas-child abuse-that has increasingly come to the notice of our society. It is one that deserves detailed and thorough examination by all of us. I am pleased that the Government has adopted a very constructive approach throughout the progress of this legislation, and has sought the views of the community as well as all parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats support the Bill as initially introduced and now including the Government's amendments. I do not intend to rehearse the detail of the legislation which has been put on record by Senator Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on two major points the Australian Democrats prefer the Bill and the amendments as they are now taking shape as provided by the Government, rather than the amendments proposed by the Opposition. One point is the difference between discretionary reporting and mandatory reporting. On the basis of the large discrepancy between cases of child abuse that are generally considered to occur in the community-and I concede that some of these estimates may well be out of court, so to speak-and the cases that are actually reported, one would have to take the view that we should make it obligatory for people to report any suspicions of such cases that come to their notice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that this is too important an area not to make it mandatory to report such cases. To the extent that the Opposition's amendments introduce an element of discretion in these matters, we believe the Government's version is to be preferred. We recognise that this is not a black and white case and that there are considerations on both sides but, on balance, this is the position which we will take. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter on which we differ from the Opposition is that we believe that an element of psychological abuse should be included in the definition of child abuse. We believe, on the basis of consultation with practitioners in the field, that it would be unnecessarily narrow and not realistic to exclude that element in the definition of child abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> Mainly on those two points I reiterate that the Australian Democrats will support the Government's amendments in preference to the Opposition's amendments. We note that one Opposition amendment which requires the service of a true copy of the notice upon the person who is alleged to have abused the child, or from whom the child is alleged to be at risk of abuse, has been accepted by the Government and we welcome that. I do not intend to prolong this debate, and simply reiterate that the Australian Democrats will support this Bill and the Government's amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the Family Law Amendment Bill 1991. I feel, as I am sure every senator in this chamber does, that any legislation that is brought before this House in support of the family and, in particular, the protection of children should be given top priority in view of the deep concerns expressed in the past not only by me but also by other senators on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation was first presented in May last year. Now, almost a year later, we are debating it. Given the Government's history in relation to family law, that process is typical. I listed myself to take part in this debate so that I could speak generally about the Family Law Act, its bureaucratic intrusion into the family structure and the subsequent effect that it has had on our national morality. Of course, we know of the deep concern in the community about many of the operations pertaining to the Family Law Act. This concern is not necessarily concern about the Act itself but often its subsequent consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Many areas associated with the Family Law Act cause a lot of concern. There is ample evidence to indicate that, regrettably, child abuse, in many forms, is common in our society today. It is essential to identify typical symptoms associated with any form of child victimisation and to establish the means with which to deal with them. The killing of the innocent unborn child for social and economic reasons and for gender engineering is in any thinking person's mind the ultimate in child abuse. I would encourage all honourable members and senators to think very deeply about and heed the cry of the innocent unborn. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that every assistance be given to promote early detection of abuse and protection for those who are unable to adequately verbalise their experiences. These traumatic experiences rob children of their childhood. Any changes in legislation that can be of assistance to reveal instances of child abuse must be commended in view of the alarming incidence of child abuse in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to make a number of general observations about the Family Law Act. This legislation is before us today because increasingly Australian men and women do not hesitate to tear up marital commitments, shirk marital obligations and abuse their former spouses and, in particular, their children either by neglect or by physical abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> It is 15 years since the Family Law Act came onto the Australian legal landscape. No-one would deny that this has left us plenty of time in which to examine not only its effectiveness but also many of the consequences of decisions in this field. Calls for amendments to, and reviews of, the Act have nearly been as long as the history of the Act itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Divorce is a dreadfully sad thing and, if it is to be dealt with, it has to be dealt with in terms of sympathy, firmness, fairness and justice. I do not believe that there is a person in this chamber who would want to go back to the arguments advanced just after the beginning of the second half of the nineteenth century. I do not want to do that and nobody else in this chamber would. But what we have to remember is that when there is a divorce it also represents the breakdown of another family unit. The family has been the basic unit in Australian society, despite the great changes that have taken place in recent decades. I do hope that, despite all the evidence to the contrary, the family will continue to be just that-the basic unit. </PARA>
<PARA> Shiploads of convicts may not have been the most promising material for establishing family life but their gradual emancipation and re-entry into free society, and the arrival of free settlers, ensured that the vast majority of colonists shared the joys and sorrows of family life. In earlier days the family was closely knit and its extended members remained in close touch with each other. Increasing mobility in society breaks up these close networks as people move from one part of the continent to another, and even overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The restriction of family size has seen the extended family go nuclear and brought greater exposure to hostile social forces. These hostile forces are increasing rather than diminishing. They are responsible for the loss of work opportunity; increasing poverty; a widening gap between the affluent and the needy; violence in society as well as in the family; the increasing liberalisation of laws with regard to pornography; the threat of war; and a prevalent sense of apprehension, acquisitiveness and the search for immediate gratification. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the family, large or small, is the basic unit of society and the health of society depends ultimately on the stability, well-being and harmonious functioning of that unit. It was once said that civilisation can be lost in a single generation if the value systems are not preserved and passed on through the family. This Act in its entirety has led to a disintegration of many of those value systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act was not a simple logical extension of previous divorce laws in Australia; it was a very radical and fundamental change. I believe that the Family Law Act itself was one of the most discriminatory, ill-considered and badly drafted Bills to ever be introduced into the Australian Parliament. It discriminated against women and against those men who do not want their marriages to be dissolved at the whim of the other part of the marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> Many leaders in the community from the professions, among the social workers and in the churches have pointed to the changes which have been introduced into the nature of marriage and threaten the stability of the family. The Act proceeded on the basis that men and women are equal in the matrimonial situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact of life that, the longer a marriage lasts, the more the women's independence, and particularly her economic ability to fend for herself, becomes less. This element is wholly overlooked by the Family Law Act. It fails to give women the protection and support to which they are entitled as wives and mothers of future generations of Australians. It takes away from women security and legal safeguards and, in the guise of enabling marriages which have broken down irretrievably to be dissolved with dignity, enables all marriages to be dissolved on the unilateral decision of either party on two months' notice. In other words, it reduces marriage to a purely temporary union with little or no protection for women and children. </PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act has turned marriage into a cheap, temporary union which may be dissolved on the unilateral decision of one party. It creates a climate which will lead to a lighthearted approach to marriage. Many of the predictions by speakers in the House of Representatives when this legislation was first introduced have come to haunt us. Frank Stewart, who was a Minister in the Whitlam Government at the time it was introduced, was a fierce opponent of the legislation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the cloak of removing injustice, humiliation and indignity from divorce, new injustices, new humiliations and new indignities are created. </PARA>
<PARA> What could be more humiliating, more unjust, or cause greater distress and hurt to a spouse than to be abandoned without cause by his or her partner merely at the whim of such partner as a matter of convenience on 12 months notice?</PARA>
<PARA> This is not divorce because the marriage has irretrievably or otherwise broken down; it is the destruction of marriage by abandonment. </PARA>
<PARA>Another speaker, Kevin Cairns, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The powerhouse clauses-</PARA>
<PARA>of the Act-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . concern the nature of the marriage itself, and make it clear that the package no fault is not a package that has any truth; that the so-called relegation of indignity and bitterness is not relegated. </PARA>
<PARA> All that is done is that it is swept under the carpet and allowed to fester in the hearts, minds, activities and feelings of those who have been wronged, which in most cases is the dependent partner in a marriage. It certainly is not a Bill which has anything to do with the rights or equality of women in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA>And that is what we are seeing today. Many honourable senators would be aware of the large number of constituents who have come to them with complaints. Let us ask ourselves what have been the social and economic consequences for the community of this Act? As predicted, the first consequence has been an increase in the number of divorces in the community. There are at present approximately 41,000 divorces every year in Australia; that is, one in every three marriages breaks down in Australia every year. What a sad and telling statistic. This compares with a yearly average, prior to 1975, of 17,000 divorces, or one in every seven marriages. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we have seen the provision of support services and court structures which impose a financial burden on the community. Thirdly, the parties to broken marriages suffer financial and emotional burdens in making new homes and in establishing new personal relations. Fourthly, the consequences of broken homes on children of such marriages have increased in proportion to the number involved. They have suffered psychological damage through family collapse, the loss of security, torn affections and both emotional and material disturbance. In a letter to the Australian newspaper the Bishop of Toowoomba said:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Family Law Act which made divorce available to either party after 12 months separation struck a heavy blow at marriage and the family. I believe that Act is primarily responsible, indirectly, for the present state of homelessness which affects families as well as children. </PARA>
<PARA>He asked whether some government would have the courage to examine seriously the content and implementation of the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say how pleased I am that my colleague Senator Brownhill has called for a review of the Act and that the Government has agreed to his plea in this regard. I, with other honourable senators, certainly look forward to the outcome of this joint inquiry that will be held. I understand from what Senator Brownhill has said that this inquiry will start work on this matter next week. I certainly hope that it will result in improvements to this Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret to say that socially our community has suffered directly as more of its individual components manifest partial or total collapse. Directly the community suffers because a family collapse contributes to an erosion of these values which buttress marriage and family. Financially, the community is obliged to bear a substantial portion of the direct costs of family breakdown. These costs include the maintenance of those parties and their children unable to support themselves without social security assistance; the administrative costs associated with increased demands upon the legal system; the increased demands upon by the Australian Legal Office; the increased demands for child-care centres, and the increased demand for services to deal with the psychological and physical ill health of disadvantaged one-parent families. </PARA>
<PARA> Indirectly the community bears an even greater financial burden. It is the cost of anti-social behaviour and the cost of the new generation of unstable marriages which become evident as the children of broken homes reach adulthood. Society has altered since the introduction of the Family Law Act and, as has been demonstrated, not necessarily for the better. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we will put in place legislation that will further determine the nature of the family and bring further stability and safety into the marriage relationship, particularly with regard to children. I do not think that there is any sinister conspiratorial attack on the family unit in what is being proposed in this legislation although I do not doubt that those ideologically opposed to the traditional family will experience some satisfaction over the situation. Rather, this legislation is the natural and necessary response of lawmakers acting prudently to achieve justice for the weaker parties and, in particular, children. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the whole situation that surrounds child abuse very disturbing. I do not think that we have reflected fully enough on the implications of the role of the family in this area. We certainly seem to be oblivious to the continuing erosion of those intangible bases of human relationships in marriage-the family and society-which this Bill both reflects and produces. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we are discussing a Bill which is tremendously important with regard to the protection of children, we still have some very glaring areas in our community where we are neglecting the causes of the problem. We also have to be able to say that we have done our utmost to make sure that the causes of this problem are fully dealt with and that we have a clear conscious. We should not be running around trying to find statistics and arguments which cast some doubt on the case I am putting forward. I believe it is correct. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, it is our duty to alert the Australian community to what is gradually but surely occurring in Australia. There is less compassion, self-sacrifice and self-discipline in human relationships. There is more and more bureaucratic intervention in those relationships and this too is not helping the stability of the family. Family values can be concentrated on and children can be made secure in the family situation. I think that this is very important when we think of the attitude to child abuse, the matter that we are discussing today. If we had more stable families there would indeed be less child abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very sad that intervention is necessary in this instance. It is not that I think these amendments are not needed; they are needed. But it is very sad to think that such a Bill is required and that we have to make provision for this kind of attention in the society in which we live. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join my colleagues today in making a small contribution to this debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1991. In doing so, I point out that this important Bill has a number of significant consequences for the way in which the existing Family Law Act currently operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Principally, it will require counsellors with the Family Court of Australia to report cases of child abuse to child welfare authorities. It also seeks to allow the Family Court to admit as evidence hearsay statements by children, and it will also protect witnesses from abusive, insulting, oppressive or repetitive questions. In addition, the amendments ensure that the adoption of a child by a step-parent will not, without the court's approval, end the custody, maintenance, guardianship or access rights of the child's natural parent. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill comes before the Senate after a considerable period of debate. Originally introduced into the House of Representatives in May last year, it was withdrawn in December to allow detailed consideration, amendments and input from interest groups. It is a disappointment that, when the Bill was considered by the House of Representatives in late February, the Government was not prepared to accept a number of the coalition's very important amendments. I will deal with them in more detail later. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by the discussion of this Bill to raise a number of issues relating to the Family Law Act. One has already been referred to by my colleagues, and I remember Senator Bjelke-Petersen raising the point. I and many others in this place share a common experience in having received distressing representations from constituents regarding the operation of the Family Law Act as it currently stands. These are particularly distressing personal matters in which one often feels powerless to act. If there is a common theme throughout these representations, it is the very contentious issue of custody of children and distribution of matrimonial property. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past few weeks at least four men, a couple of whom were very distressed, visited my office not only because of the custodial side of the marriage break-up but particularly the financial side. In one particular case the person speaking to me said that the arrangements that had just come to pass had taken away any incentive he had to continue in his line of work. He felt any extra income that he could generate was taken away from him. I do not wish to pass blame in this matter but, on the other side of the coin, his former wife was lucky enough to marry a person who was quite well heeled, and the person in my office felt it was unfair that he should have to pay so much money when his wife was so well off. I know that also works the other way. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the Family Law Act about 15 years ago heralded a new era in relation to the operation of family law in this country. There is no question about that. It removed the concept of guilt and introduced a `no fault, no questions asked' system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the introduction of the Family Law Act has removed a number of very significant burdens in relation to ending what could be considered unsuccessful marriages. We should realise, however, that at present there are around 41,000 divorces each year in Australia, as Senator Bjelke-Petersen just mentioned. This compares with the average, prior to the implementation of the Act, of 17,000-or one in seven marriages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Institute of Family Studies, in a recent report on the subject of divorce, has indicated that divorce and separation are costing Australian taxpayers $2 billion each year in supporting parents benefit payments, legal aid and the costs associated with the Family Law Act. No-one would advocate a return to the system where we had private investigators snooping around in an attempt to catch a partner out. Nor would we welcome the blaze of publicity which often accompanied the reporting of such actions. There is an increasing number of Australians who complete their dealings with the Family Court feeling distressed and cheated. In 1980-81 a parliamentary inquiry, chaired by my colleague the honourable member for Dundas, Mr Ruddock, examined the operation of the Act. Unfortunately, whilst this inquiry received bipartisan support and made a number of recommendations, its findings lay on the table. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, therefore, long overdue for the Act to be reviewed, and I welcome, as I am sure the Australian community will welcome, the review of the Family Law Act which has been instigated in the Senate by my colleague Senator Brownhill. It is a shame that he is not present to hear me put on record my congratulations to him for the very single-minded and forthright manner in which he has pushed this matter. I think in years to come the people of Australia will owe him a debt if what comes out of this inquiry, as he hopes it will, rectifies a lot of the problems being faced by people who, unfortunately, are being forced to separate and endure all those problems that go with it. The review will provide a very positive forum by which the community can bring to the attention of the Parliament difficulties currently associated with the Act and which, ultimately, I trust, we as representatives of the people will recognise. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the Family Law Amendment Bill, which we are discussing at present, I will address perhaps one of the most sensitive and controversial subjects relating to the Bill, that of child sexual abuse. This is a particularly distressing subject, but we cannot afford to put our heads in the sand and ignore it. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was established in Australia in 1894. Unfortunately, attempts to deal with this subject have been hampered because of a community perception that what occurs within the privacy of the home is nobody else's concern. Research carried out by the Western Australian Department for Community Services reported that 52.4 per cent of parents believe they legally own their children, and 64.7 per cent believe that what happens inside the family's home is nobody's business but the family's. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remember that the problems associated with such abuse are far reaching. My colleague the Hon. Ian Sinclair in the other place indicated that over 90 per cent of those who currently occupy the gaols around our country have been abused in some way as children. While such abuse is not necessarily sexual, it nevertheless highlights the scale of the problem of the abuse of Australia's children. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems which have confronted the Australian Bureau of Statistics, through its welfare statistics branch, has been the very difficult task of collecting data to provide an overview of the extent of this most serious problem. However, given the diversity of State legislation and the fact that many such instances remain undetected, the extent of the problem has been impossible to define. </PARA>
<PARA> What has become apparent, nonetheless, is that the increasing professional focus on this subject has identified that the number of children reported and confirmed as being abused has increased. Perhaps an example of the situation is the 1987 analysis by the New South Wales Department of Family Community Services research branch. Based on the data compiled by that report, it is predicted that 9 per cent of children born during 1987 will be reported and confirmed as abused children before they reach the tender age of 16 years. This is a very sad figure, but I believe it should act as a catalyst to us all to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions contained in the Family Law Amendment Bill relate to the recommendations of a committee established in 1985 by the Family Law Council to examine and report on cases involving allegations of child sexual abuse. That Committee recommended that the Family Law Act of 1975 should be amended to provide more explicit recognition of children's needs for protection against abuse. It also recommended that the hearsay rule not apply to children's statements and that notification of child sexual abuse should be made to relevant State or Territory child welfare authorities by legal practitioners, Family Court counsellors and others associated in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 of the amendment Bill sets out the procedure to report cases of child abuse. Clause 14 allows child welfare authorities to intervene in cases involving allegations of child abuse. Clause 17 will limit the number of medical and psychological examinations for children which parents can obtain in custody or access disputes. One of the more contentious clauses is clause 15, which will allow the practice of admitting hearsay evidence of statements made by children to adults concerning abuse to which they claim to have been subjected. As I have indicated previously, the coalition does not oppose the broad range of this Bill; indeed, we support it. But we have very real concerns about the application of some of these clauses in the practical sense because we believe that they may result in the Bill not functioning to its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal briefly with the aspect of the Bill pertaining to the mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse cases. This section will require court personnel, be they counsellors, welfare officers or registrars of the court, to notify immediately any suspected case of child sexual abuse. It could be argued that the introduction of a system of mandatory reporting may act as a deterrent. Experience in areas of jurisdiction involving mandatory reporting has shown that quite often groundless reports can be made and statements given which, with some very minor examination of issue, are proven to be worthless. It is certainly arguable that the introduction of mandatory reporting could discourage affected parties from seeking assistance from individuals such as court counsellors and that this would serve to inhibit the resolution of the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major aspects of any counselling situation is that of confidentiality. To remove that appearance will obviously seriously hamper the counselling process and the ability of the professionals involved in this work to pursue their roles effectively. The Law Council of Australia has already expressed its opposition to mandatory reporting and to murky conditions contained in the current Bill, which differentiate between mandatory and discretionary reporting procedures. It has been suggested that a more appropriate course of action would be for the initial reports to be made to the court and not to the child welfare authorities. This would allow the Family Court judge to direct proceedings in the most fitting manner. Personally, I support this view and trust that our amendment will be successful. Clause 15 seeks to introduce a section to allow the admittance of hearsay evidence of statements made by children to adults about the abuse they have suffered or are alleged to have suffered. The entry into the area of hearsay evidence is dogged with potential problems. Once again, the Law Council of Australia has been quick to recognise these potential problems. When the Law Council undertook its report on child sexual abuse, it recognised the uncertain state in relation to the admittance of statements made by children outside the courtroom. There appears to be no uniformity in this regard. On some occasions courts have accepted such evidence, but this, as I have said before, is not always the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Law Reform Commission has indicated that first hand hearsay evidence should not be excluded if it is the best option, the difficulty is in establishing what represents first hand hearsay evidence. Generally, it is regarded as a representation by a person who witnessed the facts referred to in their statement. There are also inherent difficulties, as the Commission indicated, in that it should be at the discretion of the court to reject such evidence if it was considered unfair that suitable notice had not been given to the other party. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment Bill which we have before us differs significantly from the views of the Commission, and we are therefore obliged to move an amendment. Briefly, I will outline clause 14, which inserts a new section 92a which provides that, where allegations have been made that a child has been abused or is at risk of being abused, five categories of persons are allowed to intervene in the proceedings as of right. These are: a guardian of the child; a person entitled to the custody of the child; a person responsible for the daily care and control of the child; a prescribed child welfare authority; and a person who is alleged to have abused the child. This provision does not include persons who have been granted access to the child and has been drafted in different terms to the existing provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I would like to acknowledge that the Family Law Amendment Bill is a bipartisan attempt to correct some of the anomalies within the existing Family Law Act, and the amendments proposed by the coalition attempt to clarify the points of confusion. The impetus for a review of the Family Law Act has now commenced. I know that this will be very heartening to many who have suffered profound emotional trauma as a result of their personal experiences with the Family Court. This is not to in any way lay blame at the feet of the Family Court but rather to concede that there are problems inherent within the current interpretation of the Act which must be addressed by the Parliament at a later date. We cannot allow another inquiry such as that which occurred in 1980, with little result. Ten years down the track we should learn in every possible way from our mistakes and address these matters in the short term rather than the long term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those senators who have contributed to the second reading debate of this most important Family Law Amendment Bill. I believe it is a most significant series of amendments which the Senate is considering this afternoon. I believe the seriousness with which the contributions have been made indicates that senators from all sides have deliberated long on the matters dealt with in the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The primary matter dealt with in this Bill is to do with those allegations of child abuse which can be made in the course of proceedings or in counselling sessions associated with the operations of the Family Law Court of Australia. Indeed, child abuse is a matter which is now recognised as one of great concern throughout the whole community. I notice Mr Kerry Berwick, former Mayor of Devonport, in the public gallery. He will know that the first occasion on which I had to perform a public duty as a senator in 1978 was when, on the north-west coast, I opened the first meeting, I think it was, of the Child Protection Assessment Board. Since that time, I have taken some interest in these matters-up to the reception of the report of the National Committee on Violence. That Committee published the horrifying fact that, if one looks at the age groups of the inhabitants of Australia and asks which age group is most vulnerable to being killed, that is, which age group is most likely to be murdered, the normal run of the mill reaction is to think in terms of young crims and thugs between 18 and 24, or the frail elderly who may be hit over the head by some intruder into their house. But the fact is that, overwhelmingly, the age group which is most at risk to homicide in Australia is those between birth and 12 months of age-twice as many per 100,000 as in the 18- to 24-year-old age group. That is the most extreme case of child abuse-the deprivation of life and of all the rightful expectations of the youngest and most vulnerable members of our community, those who have just been born up to those one year of age. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are many other forms of abuse, and these can become known to those who operate in the Family Court, either because parties make allegations to that effect or because the Court counsellors themselves or Court personnel become aware of the situation that is alleged and have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a child is being abused or is at risk of being abused. In that situation, the Government, after much consultation, has decided to clarify the law to make clear some of the areas of concern to Court counsellors and other Court personnel and, indeed, parties. The scheme proposed is that it be mandatory that a report be made when that reasonable suspicion of child abuse having occurred or being likely to occur has been aroused. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments have been guided by the findings and recommendations made by the Family Law Council in its 1988 report on child sexual abuse. I believe it is important to have the foundation of that report as the underpinning of this particular Bill. The Family Court has, over the years, established its own procedures to try to deal on an administrative basis with child abuse allegations, but this particular provision for mandatory reporting will make clear the requirement of our society in dealing with this most difficult area and it will also to that extent, in making clear what the responsibilities of court personnel are, provide them with a degree of certainty and a degree of guaranteed legal protection which will enable them to more readily make these particular reports of their suspicions to the relevant and well-qualified State authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In that regard, I believe it is important to recognise that it is the State welfare authorities, child welfare authorities and child protection authorities which have this expertise. There are many other groups in our society, and I too would like to acknowledge the work of Mrs Rosemary Sinclair in establishing in the public mind, through the national committee which she heads, the terrible incidence of child abuse in our society. But it is for the professionals, the child welfare authorities-without being unduly subservient to their expertise-which quite clearly are the ones which ought to have the prime carriage of investigating and dealing with these allegations once they are made. </PARA>
<PARA> To that extent, the Law Council suggestion that judges of the Family Court should vet allegations of abuse before they are sent to child welfare authorities seems to the Government not to be appropriate. The expertise for investigating these allegations lies with the State or Territory child welfare authorities, not the Family Court. The Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia has indicated that he regards that process as being too cumbersome, and he would not seek it, that is for sure. I believe there might also be some delay in investigation of allegations of child abuse if this procedure put forward by the Law Council and apparently attractive to some members of the Opposition were adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there has been some modification of the Bill in the course of its passage through the other place which has made some concessions in line with suggestions made by the Opposition. For example, the mandatory reporting is to be limited to the more serious categories of abuse. I understand that in clause 4 of the Bill `abuse' is now defined to mean:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) an assault, including a sexual assault, of the child which is an offence under a law, written or unwritten, in force in the State or Territory in which the Act constituting the assault occurs; or</PARA>
<PARA>(b) a person involving the child in a sexual activity with that person or another person in which the child is used, directly or indirectly, as a sexual object by the first mentioned person or the other person, and where there is unequal power in the relationship between the child and the first-mentioned person. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that accords very much with the proposal put forward by the Opposition in another place as to the definition of what should count as child abuse when one is considering the obligation of mandatory reporting. Once again, there will be no criminal penalty for failure to report. Administrative procedures within the Family Court will deal with those Court personnel who do not carry out their obligation. They will be burdened with that duty of mandatory reporting only where they come across the allegation of abuse in the course of their duties, and not otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> In trying to get the balance right, obviously this Parliament is being invited to tip the balance in favour of the reporting to relevant authorities so as to provide a chance for an abused child to be removed from that situation of abuse or prevent abuse from actually taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members have raised some other matters on which I wish to comment, which may save time at the committee stage. As far as intervention in proceedings as of right is concerned, the Opposition has apparently proposed that a person with access rights to a child, or any person with an interest in the welfare of a child, ought to be able to intervene as of right. This amendment is not acceptable. The Family Law Council looked at those persons who might be permitted to intervene as of right and the Government has looked at that report as the basis for compiling the list in proposed section 92a. </PARA>
<PARA> One ought to emphasise that an access parent will have a right of intervention in his or her capacity as joint guardian of the child or as the alleged abuser, and that ought to be kept in mind. Other people who have an interest, who have access rights or are considered to have an interest in the child's welfare-for example, quite often grandparents and other relatives or neighbours think they have an interest-can persuade the court that they can usefully contribute to the proceedings and get leave of the court to make a contribution to the court's understanding of the situation. So it is not as though such people are to be excluded; they simply have to seek the leave of the court. </PARA>
<PARA> Only in recent weeks the United Kingdom Parliament has moved very urgently to clarify the question of hearsay evidence in that jurisdiction to overcome a recent decision by the Court of Appeal that there was no legal basis for admitting hearsay evidence of children in family law proceedings. That has certainly been the established practice of the Family Court of Australia. I believe it is one way of protecting children from the necessity of being drawn into court proceedings as a witness, being called by a party in a custody or access dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, the Government believes that, whereas the hearsay rule is normally applied in proceedings in courts in Australian jurisdictions because the judge should have regard only to those matters which parties can speak of from their own knowledge as they appear before him as the arbiter or umpire in the particular dispute, in the Family Court the judge is not in that position. He or she is charged with the paramount duty of protecting the interests of the child. The child is outside the conflict, if you like. It is thought that the rule against hearsay cannot in all circumstances be said to be required simply because a person dealing with a matter has the status of a judge. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that I have dealt in passing with most of the concerns raised by Opposition members with the Family Law Amendment Bill, but I think they would concede that it has emerged from the other place with considerable alteration which meets, at least in some measure, their concerns. The Government was happy to adopt those modifications of the clauses. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, I think that the public will be interested, as the Senate gives its support to the second reading of the Bill, that we as a parliament are dealing with the very real situation where court personnel become aware of child abuse, or allegations of child abuse. We have provided a mechanism which requires them to inform those personnel who can best protect the interests of the child, to try to remedy the situation or indeed to prevent it occurring. For that reason, and because of the many other important amendments which are made to the Act by way of the clauses of the Bill, I commend the second reading of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>The first amendment deals with mandatory or, in our preference, discretionary reporting. The second is simply consequential upon that amendment and the third concerns intervention and our preference in that regard. Mr Chairman, pressing your liberty for a moment, I wanted to mention one matter earlier, which I now seek to put on the record, concerning hearsay evidence. I said in my contribution to the second reading debate that we had a different point of view but we were not going to press it. There was one incidental matter to that which was our view that where the practice is adopted, which is now going to be codified, of a child reporting to a parent and a parent giving evidence in circumstances where it would not normally be acceptable evidence, the person about whom the allegation is being made in that form should be advised. We simply put that on the record in this instance. Perhaps it is something that Senator Brownhill's joint select committee that is being set up might also look at-presuming it comes within its terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the two more substantial questions, I have put the argument for discretionary as opposed to mandatory reporting during my second reading contribution. There is nothing further I wish to add to that. We have had some discussion with the Australian Democrats and I understand that they are not with us. That is another reason why it is not worth holding up the Committee on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding intervention, in my speech at the second reading stage I put the argument that a better procedure would be that leave be sought for appropriate parties to intervene. We see no shortcoming in our alternative. We see the advantage that it gives to the court-the discretion. As I indicated, we have added to the list two extra categories of persons possibly seeking to intervene-in particular a person who has been granted access to a child and any other person with an interest in the welfare of a child. Those people should be deemed as groups with an entitlement to seek leave to intervene. So our list is extended by the extra two categories. At this last moment I ask the Government to give the amendments due consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, in the short time available to it, has given due consideration to the amendments moved by the Opposition in this place. I think we dealt adequately at the second reading stage with the mandatory reporting of child abuse. The Government believes that mandatory reporting will give the best chance that an abused child will be removed from the situation of peril, where that child is so vulnerable to sexual or physical abuse, or enable a preventative strategy to be adopted so that the child does not find itself in that very perilous situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This will be a matter of reporting to competent and relevant authorities vested with the expertise to deal with the allegation. In relation to that, this mandatory reporting matter has been of concern to court personnel. I understand that the professional organisation-the ethical and standards committee of the Australian Psychologists Society-has said that the Bill is consistent with the Society's code of professional conduct. I believe it can now be undertaken in both a legal and professional sense without undue concern by court personnel who may become aware of these allegations and form a reasonable suspicion that there is some foundation to them. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the hearsay matter, which Senator Hill touched upon, it is important to note that in the House of Representatives an amendment was made to clause 12 so that 70ba (2)-I know Senator Hill is taking a great deal of interest in this matter-now reads that the party must file a notice in the prescribed form in the court hearing the proceedings and serve a true copy of the notice upon the person who is alleged to have abused the child or from whom the child is alleged to be at risk of abuse. I believe that would cover Senator Hill's concern at least to that extent. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already dealt with the matter of intervention rights in passing in my contribution to the second reading stage of this debate. I emphasise that persons in the categories which the Opposition sought to give a right to appear before the court can appear by way of leave of the court. They simply have to persuade the court that they can usefully contribute to the proceedings. I believe in many instances that can be done, but they ought not to have a right simply by falling into a category as vague as those who have an interest in the child's welfare. </PARA>

<PARA>ABSOLUTELY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Warwick,</PARA>
<PARA>PPL MANAGED OCLS</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this letter is to report to you on:</PARA>
<PARA>. the work we have done (Section A);</PARA>
<PARA>. what went wrong (Section B);</PARA>
<PARA>. the conclusions I have reached (Section C.1);</PARA>
<PARA>. the reasons for those conclusions (Section C.2); and</PARA>
<PARA>. my recommendations (Section D). </PARA>
<PARA>SECTION A-THE WORK WE HAVE DONE</PARA>
<PARA>DOCUMENTARY</PARA>
<PARA>The documentary team examined all relevant PPL and Westpac files. </PARA>
<PARA>This exercise involved the consideration of at least 50,000 documents. Details of over 7,000 documents were entered into our computer system and approximately 1,500 documents were subjected to detailed review, because they were particularly significant. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result, for the purposes of the interviews described below, and for any subsequent purposes, we had and will have a capacity to use the system to provide extremely useful analyses of the documents. </PARA>
<PARA>For example, we can call up a list of all documents found in a particular person's file, or all documents authored and/or received and/or copied to a particular person. </PARA>
<PARA>This exercise has had three very significant benefits:</PARA>
<PARA>1. It enabled us to conduct the interviews described below against the background of what was said in the relevant documents. This greatly facilitated the efficient extraction of information in these interviews. </PARA>
<PARA>2. I can write this report, extremely confident that the assessments contained in it have been made in the light of the relevant documents and interviews based on the relevant documents. </PARA>
<PARA>3. If litigation should prove to be unavoidable, PPL is in a position to discover quickly and efficiently and at very little additional cost. </PARA>
<PARA>THE INTERVIEWS</PARA>
<PARA>A policy decision was taken not to interview ex-PPL employees, because it was thought that the risks of signalling the problem outweighed the advantages to be derived from such interviews. </PARA>
<PARA>The following people were interviewed in the light of an analysis of the documents relevant to their position:</PARA>
<PARA> 17 names listed-</PARA>
<PARA>All those interviewed were and, quite apart from this, interviews conducted against the background of a detailed consideration of the relevant documents lead to a far more accurate picture than those conducted without this advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>FIELD INVESTIGATION TRIPS</PARA>
<PARA>Each of the interstate offices was visited. These visits had three purposes:</PARA>
<PARA>1. To consider the documents held by the local office;</PARA>
<PARA>2. To interview the local state manager and relevant Westpac personnel; and</PARA>
<PARA>3. With the assistance of the local state managers' feel and knowledge of the attitudes and circumstances of particular customers, to form an opinion, on a state by state basis, of the extent of possible liability. </PARA>
<PARA>In Sydney, these functions were attended to, mutatis mutandis, by interviewing the relevant PMOs. </PARA>
<PARA>ASSISTANCE RECEIVED</PARA>
<PARA>I gratefully acknowledge:</PARA>
<PARA>. the counsel and assistance received from . . . and his Westpac legal team; and</PARA>
<PARA>. the enormous contribution made by . . . who managed the investigation summarised in this report with outstanding energy and skill. </PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY OF PPL's PERFORMANCE WITH MANAGED LOANS</PARA>
<PARA>Attachment 1, summarises PPL's position on a state-by-state basis. Overall, while managed, PPL-managed borrowers:</PARA>
<PARA>. had capital losses of $33.1m;</PARA>
<PARA>. had an unfavourable position vis-a-vis a totally unmanaged position of $7.6m;</PARA>
<PARA>. had an unfavourable position vis-a-vis a fully-hedged position of $12.5m. </PARA>
<PARA>SECTION B-WHAT WENT WRONG?</PARA>
<PARA>Late in 1984, PPL started to offer a managed FX loan product. </PARA>
<PARA>In early 1985, PPL's Managing Director was . . . Reporting to . . . was the General Manager, . . . Reporting to . . . were the executives who headed up the two sides of PPL's business, . . . heading up asset-based finance, and . . . heading up treasury. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . and . . . did not get on and . . . and . . . did not get on. . . . was close to . . . , who tended to view his performance through rosy-eyed glasses as a result. </PARA>
<PARA>Reporting to . . . was . . ., who headed up the PPL forex department. </PARA>
<PARA>It was not a good time to be marketing this product; the $A had been sliding against the $US for a year and was about to start its momentous downward slide against all currencies. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . started what was to become a tradition of weak management by sending . . . a memorandum in June, 1985 (part of Attachment 2) telling him that the product was being introduced against . . . wishes. Notwithstanding the chief executive's opposition, the product went ahead and a further 42 customers were to be added to the 22 which existed at the date of . . .'s memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . had reporting to . . . to dealers-. . . and . . . All three were generally regarded as competent forex people. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . did not share the generally high regard for . . . . . . disliked and distrusted . . . and their relationship was extremely stormy. In February, 1986 . . . was dismissed/resigned in controversial circumstances. . . . staff certainly felt that . . . had been badly done by and . . . resigned as chief forex dealer virtually at the same time, and was followed by . . . in April. </PARA>
<PARA>Those left to shoulder the burden were . . . and . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There were better times to lose one's forex dealing team. The $A was plummeting against all major currencies. </PARA>
<PARA>By mid 1986, the deterioration since February had been dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA>. The department was demoralised;</PARA>
<PARA>. Reporting systems with clients had broken down;</PARA>
<PARA>. The volume of dealing was far too much for the PPL system to handle;</PARA>
<PARA>. The dealers were relatively inexperienced;</PARA>
<PARA>. Clients were complaining about their crippling losses, and most of all, about an inability to communicate with the forex department. </PARA>
<PARA>These difficulties did not prevent a further 22 clients being signed during the first half of 1986, which worsened all the difficulties referred to above.</PARA>
<PARA>The brunt of the client complaints were taken by the state managers and PMOs who had the relationship with them. State managers and PMOs, for their part, found it impossible to get any sensible answers out of the forex department. All the time, the dollar dropped and dropped. </PARA>
<PARA>It was these pressure cooker circumstances which caused memoranda like . . . (. . .) in June 1986 (part of Attachment 2). This memo is trenchantly critical of the entire manner in which borrowers were being managed. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important to note that this memo was sent to all the PPL senior management from . . . down. </PARA>
<PARA>On 27th June an equally vituperative memorandum (part of Attachment 2) was sent by the Sydney PMOs to . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Early in July, 1986, . . . sent a memo to . . . (part of Attachment 2), which said that . . . regarded . . . as being responsible for several seriously deficient aspects of managed borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA>This memorandum is in very strong terms and it is staggering that the memorandum concludes by merely asking . . . to do better in future. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that . . . attitude may have been based on a view that . . . would not countenance action against . . . Whatever be the reason, it was a very weak conclusion to a very strong memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>By early July, 1986 then, there can be no doubt that all senior management at PPL were only too well aware of the gravity of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA>The failure of . . ., . . . and . . . to act decisively to redress the position is a tragedy, and it is on these three gentlemen that primary responsibility for the situation PPL faces today must rest. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, weak management tends to beget weak management, and one could summarise all management from the middle of 1986 onward by saying that it was management by memo and management by memos which were primarily designed to protect the author from responsibility, rather than to redress the position. </PARA>
<PARA>During the balance of 1986, the position continued to deteriorate; clients continued to lose money; communications with clients and with state managers and PMOs continued to be a disaster, and management continued to do nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA>By late 1986, there was a clear view within PPL treasury that the product should be abandoned. This met robust opposition from . . . on behalf of the state managers and PMOs, who took the view that to drop customers who already had much about which to complain was unwise. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this view correct. However, managed borrowing should not have been allowed to lurch on towards 1987 in a management vaccuum. </PARA>
<PARA>At the end of 1986, it was decided to merge the PPL and Westpac treasuries and to restructure the Westpac group's merchant banking operations. </PARA>
<PARA>. . ., . . . and . . . departed. . . . was appointed to head PPL's treasury operations, which included managed loans. </PARA>
<PARA>During the first quarter of 1987, the Westpac risk management unit (via . . .) was supposed to exercise a supervisory role over loan management. </PARA>
<PARA>This first quarter of 1987 was a period of non-management. . . . . . gave advice, but had no power to direct . . . regarded his management responsibility for managed loans as being purely nominal, and the position continued to drift. </PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the first quarter of 1987, it was decided to formally transfer the management to the Westpac unit. </PARA>
<PARA>This decision was not implemented as quickly as was planned. This was partly due to stiff resistance from Westpac risk management, who doubtless feared they were being handed a can of worms, and partly due to a lack of drive on the part of PPL executives. </PARA>
<PARA>The management vaccuum thus remained in force until late June, 1987 when most contracts were terminated and five managed customers were transferred to Westpac risk management. </PARA>
<PARA>In short, managed forex loans was a bad idea, introduced at the worst possible time, and badly managed. </PARA>
<PARA>The dollar fared well from late 1986 to mid 1987, and given the management vaccuum, PPL was clearly lucky that it did. </PARA>
<PARA>In September, 1987, complaints made by managed borrowers had come to . . . attention and he asked . . . of . . . to look into the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>This led to . . . letter of 7th September, which is Attachment 3. The views expressed in this report and in that letter are substantially the same. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of . . . letter, . . . was asked to direct an investigation into the matters raised in it. </PARA>
<PARA>SECTION C-MY CONCLUSIONS AND MY REASONS FOR THEM</PARA>
<PARA>C.1 CONCLUSIONS</PARA>
<PARA>1. According to PPL's own documents, PPL:</PARA>
<PARA> . told clients it would do a professional management job;</PARA>
<PARA> . told clients that it would adopt a conservative, `when in doubt, hedge' approach to risk management. </PARA>
<PARA>2. PPL's own documents acknowledge that:</PARA>
<PARA> . PPL did neither of these things; and</PARA>
<PARA> . this failure caused loss which would not otherwise have been incurred. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Trading conditions during the relevant period were such that all a prudent manager could have done is to have hedged and stayed hedged for the duration. This:</PARA>
<PARA> . was objectively what PPL should have done;</PARA>
<PARA> . would have been consistent with PPL's representations as to the policy it would adopt. </PARA>
<PARA>4. As a result of 1-3, a number of clients did significantly worse than the fully-hedged position. </PARA>
<PARA>5. PPL undoubtedly took points which, at best, exceeded its entitlement and to which, in my view, PPL had no entitlement at all. PPL probably switched transactions between its own account and its managed borrowers accounts. </PARA>
<PARA>6. The exemption clause in the Power of Attorney signed by managed borrowers will not operate to defeat actions which are available to those borrowers based on:</PARA>
<PARA> . point taking and deal switching;</PARA>
<PARA> . failure to follow the conservative management policy which PPL represented to clients it would follow. </PARA>
<PARA>7. As a result of 1-6, it is likely that managed borrowers would succeed against PPL. </PARA>
<PARA>8. The measure of damages will be:</PARA>
<PARA> . the amount lost via the taking of points;</PARA>
<PARA> . the profit lost via the switching of transactions;</PARA>
<PARA> . the difference between the fully-hedged position (plus, say, 20% to approximate the point at which clients should have been fully hedged) and the position actually achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>9. Clients will be slow to commence action because of:</PARA>
<PARA> . the breadth of the exclusion clause in the Power of Attorney will deter clients (who don't know of the deal switching and point taking and the damaging PPL documents) from commencing action;</PARA>
<PARA> . their lack of knowledge of how damaging PPL's documents are;</PARA>
<PARA>. the lack of success of OCL actions to date;</PARA>
<PARA>. the high costs involved</PARA>
<PARA>10. Given 9 and given full-time hands-on management by a suitable executive having total responsibility, suitably supported by state managers, it should be possible to keep liability at a manageable level. </PARA>
<PARA>C.2 REASONS FOR CONCLUSIONS</PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSIONS 1 &amp;2: THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS CONTAINED IN PPL'S OWN DOCUMENTS</PARA>
<PARA>I wrote to you on 22nd October and attached to that letter a collection of documents. </PARA>
<PARA>Many more documents have been examined and a number of them are very damaging.</PARA>
<PARA>I see little point in adding further documents to the bundle, however, because the documents attached to my letter of 22nd October illustrate the extraordinary extent to which PPL's own documents support the conclusions I have reached. The bundle is Attachment 2 to this letter. </PARA>
<PARA>All those reading this letter should read these documents-they are devastating. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION 3: TRADING CONDITIONS-THE OBLIGATION TO HEDGE</PARA>
<PARA>Between the beginning of 1985 and November this year, the Australian dollar depreciated:</PARA>
<PARA>. 53% against the Swiss franc;</PARA>
<PARA>. 32% against the $US;</PARA>
<PARA>. very significantly against virtually every other currency. </PARA>
<PARA>An inter-bank trader can have one of three postures with respect to any given currency:</PARA>
<PARA>1. long;</PARA>
<PARA>2. short; or</PARA>
<PARA>3. out of the market. </PARA>
<PARA>Importantly, when the inter-bank trader goes short or long, he is under no necessary added risk in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA>The risk manager is in a very different position:</PARA>
<PARA>. Firstly, he can't go out of the market-he is managing an offshore borrowing which is a fact of life;</PARA>
<PARA>. Secondly, if the loan is in currency A and the manager shorts that currency, his managed client is a double risk;</PARA>
<PARA>. Thirdly, if he keeps the managed loan hedged most of the time, the cost of the loan will equal (or perhaps slightly exceed) the cost of onshore borrowing. It is precisely to avoid these costs that clients have borrowed offshore and, regrettably, some of them would have had difficulties in servicing their loans at onshore rates;</PARA>
<PARA>. Fourthly, an inter-bank trader is aware that a certain level of buying and selling will tend to alter prices and can take this into account in his trading activities. A risk manager is not in a similarly fortunate position. If his clients are long a total of, say, $US100 million and he is going to close</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is an alternative view which asserts a market convention that a modest amount of points may be taken; the number of points being designed merely to recoup the costs of carrying out the transactions. </PARA>
<PARA>The PPL forex section made extensive use of a suspense account for significant periods of time. </PARA>
<PARA>The suspense account was used to `park':</PARA>
<PARA>. transactions which would otherwise have caused difficulties with Reserve Bank imposed limits;</PARA>
<PARA>. transactions before allocating them to a managed borrower or to PPL's account. </PARA>
<PARA>Transactions put into the suspense account were entered into suspense account books, which were kept for this purpose. These books have disappeared and an extremely diligent search has failed to find them. </PARA>
<PARA>The absence of these books greatly hinders the unravelling of transactions and this difficulty and the difficulty in establishing when, in the course of a day's trading, a particular transaction took place, have prevented us from quantifying the profits which PPL made from point taking. </PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding this, the following factors cause me to believe that a court would find that point taking occurred:</PARA>
<PARA>. the 6.4.87 memorandum from . . . which is part of Attachment 2;</PARA>
<PARA>. spot checks of deal slips and position sheets done at the direction of . . .;</PARA>
<PARA>. the extraordinary comparative profitability of PPL trading on its own account compared to its trading record for managed borrowers;</PARA>
<PARA>* the extraordinary trading volume which was otherwise at variance with PPL's represented management policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Deal Switching</PARA>
<PARA>The loss of the suspense books makes it impossible to form a firm view about deal switching. However, the position sheets disclose some transactions which would probably cause a court to infer that deal switching had gone on. I have interviewed a PPL employee whose first-hand observation was that some (albeit unquantifiable) deal switching did go on, and I think it probably did. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION 6: THE EXEMPTION CLAUSE WILL BE OF LITTLE ASSISTANCE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES</PARA>
<PARA>All managed borrowers signed a Power of Attorney which contained a widely drawn exemption clause. That exemption clause will defeat actions (both in contract and tort) based on a failure to exercise sufficient care and skill. </PARA>
<PARA>The High Court decision in Darlington Futures Ltd v. Delco Australia Pty. Ltd (68 ALR 385) makes it clear that, as a matter of construction, clauses of this sort will not be allowed to defeat claims based on point taking and deal switching, because these depend on allegations of deliberate dishonesty. </PARA>
<PARA>Even if, contrary to the view expressed above, the exemption clause was held to defeat a claim based in contract for point taking and deal switching, PPL would still face an identical claim based on breach of fiduciary duty. </PARA>
<PARA>In its Hospital Products decision (United States Surgical Corp. v. Hospital Products International Limited (156 CLR 41)), the High Court said that it was reluctant to introduce fiduciary duties into commercial relationships unless there was a genuine element of control by one party over the affairs of the other, with a consequent vulnerability of that party. </PARA>
<PARA>I have little doubt that a fiduciary duty existed here because of the total control which PPL had over the managed loan and the vulnerability of managed borrowers which resulted from this total control. </PARA>
<PARA>Liability for breaches of fiduciary duty cannot be contractually excluded because they are not based on contract. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act creates an obligation not to carry on business in a misleading fashion and this obligation cannot be contractually excluded. </PARA>
<PARA>PPL represented that it would keep clients fully hedged, except in advantageous situations, and failure to do this leads to a liability under the Act which cannot be contractually excluded. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION 7: MANAGED BORROWERS WOULD SUCCEED AGAINST PPL</PARA>
<PARA>This needs no expansion in the light of the discussion which has preceded it. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION 8: THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES</PARA>
<PARA>It will be obvious from my discussion of the difficulties of quantifying point taking and deal switching in Conclusion 6 that a court will face the same difficulties which I have faced and will probably not be able to make a precise calculation of the relevant loss/loss of profits. </PARA>
<PARA>This will not deter a court from doing rough and ready justice as best it can on the evidence available. This is clear from the long-established cases of Chaplin v. Hicks (1911) 2 KB 786 and Howe v. Teefy (1927) 27 SR (NSW) 301 and from the more recent decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Enzed Holdings Ltd &amp;Ors. v. Wynthea Pty. Ltd &amp;Ors (1984) 57 ALR 167. </PARA>
<PARA>The Enzed Holdings decision concerned calculation of damages for a breach of s.52 and it is thus authority for the proposition that a court will adopt a similarly robust approach to overcome any of the difficulties in determining precisely when hedging should or should not have taken place reviewed in my discussion of Conclusion 3. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION 9: CLIENTS WILL BE SLOW TO COMMENCE ACTION</PARA>
<PARA>The following factors will make clients slow to commence action:</PARA>
<PARA>. Breadth of the exclusion clause</PARA>
<PARA> For reasons discussed, the exclusion clause will not operate to defeat claims based on point taking and deal switching, but clients are unlikely to be aware that these breaches took place. </PARA>
<PARA> The exclusion clause will not defeat actions under the Trade Practices Act, but most clients will be unaware of how clearly PPL's oral representations are recorded in PPL's documents and will assume that proof that the representations were made will boil down to oath versus oath. </PARA>
<PARA>. Lack of Knowledge of the Damaging PPL documents</PARA>
<PARA> A number of management/personality/frustration factors which we have discussed led to PPL producing documents which were unusually selfcritical. Most organisations tend to produce documents which are unduly self-justifying. Most clients would not expect PPL's documents to provide them with the treasure trove which they in fact present. </PARA>
<PARA>. Lack of Success of OCL Actions to Date</PARA>
<PARA> Both reported OCL actions have gone against the borrower and one other was discontinued with considerable publicity. None of these actions involved managed OCLs but there is a tendency, nonetheless, for these results to act as a deterrent to action. </PARA>
<PARA>. The High Costs Involved</PARA>
<PARA> Many borrowers (particularly in these troubled times) are not flush with cash and they would doubtless perceive that PPL would defend proceedings grimly. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION 10: GIVEN SUITABLE MANAGEMENT, LIABILITY SHOULD BE CONTAINABLE TO A MANAGEABLE LEVEL</PARA>
<PARA>As I indicated in my discussion of Conclusion 4, the total extent to which managed clients' positions fell below fully hedged was $12.5m million. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not to say, of course, that clients will limit claims in this way; any client who brings action will probably base his claim on his total capital loss. </PARA>
<PARA>PPL can be reasonably confident, however, that a court would regard a comparison with the fully-hedged position as the appropriate starting point. </PARA>
<PARA>As discussed in reviewing Conclusion 8, a court would then reduce the difference between the fully hedged and actual position by an appropriate allowance (say, 20%) to reflect the fact that PPL was not operating with perfect hindsight. </PARA>
<PARA>This reduces the potential liability to approximately $10m, but with potential claimants affected by the matters discussed in reviewing Conclusion 9. </PARA>
<PARA>Shrewd exploitation of these difficulties, as discussed in the next section, should keep the loss to PPL at something like 30-50% of this potential liability, ie between $3m and $6m. </PARA>
<PARA>SECTION D-RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>PERSONNEL</PARA>
<PARA>My recommendations are straightforward and are essentially those made in Section 3 of my letter of 22nd October. </PARA>
<PARA>You will recall that I recommended the appointment of a suitable executive to deal full-time with these managed loans. That executive should have full authority over these loans, subject only to direct reporting to . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That executive should be supported by the relevant PMOs in New South Wales and the state managers. </PARA>
<PARA>The state managers should be clearly directed:</PARA>
<PARA>. that so far as managed loans are concerned, they are to report directly to the chosen executive;</PARA>
<PARA>. that managed loans are to be given the degree of priority determined by the chosen executive. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important that the above be implemented as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>STRATEGY</PARA>
<PARA>PPL's strategy should have the following key elements:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Keep close and cordial contact (with as productive a business relationship as possible) with all potential claimants. This must be done by the chosen executive and by the PMOs and state managers who have the personal contacts. . . . efforts in this regard in Adelaide have demonstrated just how effective this can be in keeping the lid on PPL's exposure. It is very important that the state managers in Brisbane and Perth be directed to spend all necessary time in keeping up these contacts and business relationships and to do so as a matter of priority;</PARA>
<PARA>2. Avoid litigation at any reasonable cost;</PARA>
<PARA>3. Bring borrowers onshore as quickly as possible;</PARA>
<PARA>4. Any concessions given to borrowers should only to be given in exchange for a complete release;</PARA>
<PARA>5. When particularly dangerous potential claimants come onshore, try and arrange this on the basis of a concession and a consequent release. My concern is that if these claimants come onshore without a concession, they may become bellicose once their reduced capital and higher interest rates start to bite. </PARA>
<PARA>6. Take all practical steps to avoid PPL's weaknesses being known outside PPL/Westpac boards and senior management. </PARA>
<PARA>Please don't hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can amplify. </PARA>
<PARA>With best wishes,</PARA>

<PARA>ABSOLUTELY PRIVATE &amp;CONFIDENTIAL</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Warwick,</PARA>
<PARA>DOES PPL HAVE ANY CRIMINAL LIABILITY?</PARA>
<PARA>WESTPAC'S CONDUCT OF MANAGED OCLS</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to my conference with you and others on 26th November. </PARA>
<PARA>You asked me to write to you about some matters raised in that conference. </PARA>
<PARA>These matters come into two categories:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Two matters relating to PPL's position:</PARA>
<PARA> . whether PPL or its employees have been guilty of criminal conduct; and</PARA>
<PARA> . whether it would be prudent for PPL to attempt to make recompense to managed borrowers to reflect deal switching and point taking. </PARA>
<PARA> I deal with these questions in Section A. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Four matters relating to Westpac's current forex trading activities, and in particular, their handling of managed accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> I deal with these in Section B. </PARA>
<PARA>SECTION A-DOES PPL HAVE ANY CRIMINAL LIABILITY?</PARA>
<PARA>A.1 POINT TAKING</PARA>
<PARA>There are two features of the relationship between Westpac and the managed borrowers which, in my view, preclude criminal liability. </PARA>
<PARA>A.1.1 PPL sold currency to managed borrowers as principal</PARA>
<PARA> It was the very essence of the contractual relationship between PPL and its managed borrowers that PPL owned the overseas currency that managed borrowers would acquire from it. </PARA>
<PARA> The essence of all criminal offences involving dishonesty is the acquisition by A of B's property. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult, in the sale situation described, to categorise the sale of property from A to B as criminal merely because:</PARA>
<PARA> . that sale takes place at a profit to A;</PARA>
<PARA> . the better legal view is that there is no contractual justification for taking that profit. </PARA>
<PARA>A.1.2 PPL's broad discretion</PARA>
<PARA>Under Clause 1 of the Powers of Attorney, PPL was given total discretion in its right to sell currency to managed borrowers. </PARA>
<PARA>The width of PPL's contractual discretion is such as to create profound difficulties in categorising a sale made pursuant to the exercise of that discretion as criminal. </PARA>
<PARA>POINT TAKING SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA>I adhere to the views expressed in my earlier letter as to the civil law problems created by PPL's point taking and deal switching. </PARA>
<PARA>These problems are civil. For the reasons given above, I see no question of criminal liability. </PARA>
<PARA>A.2 DEAL SWITCHING</PARA>
<PARA>A thorough review of all the relevant documents and the interviews described in my earlier letter failed to provide any basis upon which one could hope to convince a jury beyond reasonable doubt that deal switching had occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>As a matter of judgment, I believe that it probably did, but there is no basis upon which I, or a jury, could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA>A fortiori, there is no basis whatsoever for asserting deal switching with respect to any particular transaction or transactions, and this of course, is a sine qua non of any criminal liability. </PARA>
<PARA>It follows that the legal status of deal switching does not arise. </PARA>
<PARA>If the legal status of deal switching did arise, there are two factors which cause me to be confident that no criminal liability is involved. </PARA>
<PARA>A.2.1 PPL's broad discretion</PARA>
<PARA>I deal with this in A.1.2 above. </PARA>
<PARA>A.2.2 Difficulties in establishing allocation of currency to managed borrowers prior to suspense account entry</PARA>
<PARA>It is virtually impossible, when a suspense account is involved, to establish allocation prior to entry into the suspense account. </PARA>
<PARA>If this is not established, there is no prospect of criminal liability. </PARA>
<PARA>A.3 SHOULD PPL TRY TO RECOMPENSE FOR POINT TAKING AND DEAL SWITCHING?</PARA>
<PARA>A.3.1 Point Taking</PARA>
<PARA>My clear recommendation is `no'. </PARA>
<PARA>I say this for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA>i. There is no basis upon which we can establish what point taking took place with respect to what managed borrowers. </PARA>
<PARA>ii. Even if i. was not correct, any approach to managed borrowers would disclose a breach of contract which vitiates the exclusion clause in the Power of Attorney. </PARA>
<PARA>I strongly recommend that PPL reflect its proper concern about this in the relative generosity with which it approaches settlement discussions. </PARA>
<PARA>A.3.2 Deal Switching</PARA>
<PARA>As I indicated in A.2, there is no basis for making any assessment of any loss suffered by anyone as a result of deal switching. </PARA>
<PARA>There is thus no basis upon which recompense could be approached, and disclosure of this to managed borrowers would be even more serious than disclosure of point taking. </PARA>
<PARA>SECTION B-MATTERS RELATING TO CURRENT WESTPAC FOREX OPERATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>B.1 POINT TAKING</PARA>
<PARA>I confirm my advice that I doubt that Westpac could establish a contractual right to sell currency to managed borrowers at prices any higher than that available in a free market. </PARA>
<PARA>Given this, I think it unwise for any points to be taken unless there is a clear written agreement with the client which covers this. </PARA>
<PARA>It would obviously be unwise to approach the former PPL clients to seek this agreement, and it therefore follows that no points should be taken from former PPL clients. </PARA>
<PARA>B.2 ESTABLISHING THE MARKET PRICE BY SEEKING QUOTES</PARA>
<PARA>This is a related issue. Unless there is an agreement to the contrary, managed borrowers are entitled to buy at market price. This market price must be established by seeking quotes in the market and dealing with those offering the most favourable quote. </PARA>
<PARA>If that quote happens to be from Westpac, well and good, but Westpac must be able to establish that Westpac sought, and accepted, the most favourable quote. </PARA>
<PARA>A.3 ``PARKING''</PARA>
<PARA>PPL sometimes ``parked'' transactions in the suspense account in order to circumvent Reserve Bank limits. I have no reason to believe that Westpac is ``parking'' transactions for the same purpose. I stress that it is very important that it not do so. </PARA>
<PARA>B.4 CONSERVATIVE HEDGING POLICY</PARA>
<PARA>I am most concerned about recent losses suffered by the three former PPL managed borrowers during the recent slide of the $AUS against the CHF. </PARA>
<PARA>These borrowers were largely unhedged. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it important that the former PPL managed borrowers be kept fully hedged, unless and until there is a clear strategic appreciation of the $AUS against the relevant currency. </PARA>
<PARA>A fully hedged client may not like the interest rates, but he is suffering no losses and he can't sue. </PARA>
<PARA>A policy of ruthless conservatism is called for. </PARA>
<PARA>With best wishes,</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA>FRENCH LETTERS</PARA>
<PARA>23/3/87</PARA>
<PARA>Around 4.50pm Andy Fedas gave A Wong a ``last accurate'' set of numbers (customer's loans, rollovers, covers) after having revised it for 5 times. </PARA>
<PARA>Garth Carter &amp;Libby met Wong at 6.30pm to say that something is wrong with those numbers. </PARA>
<PARA>Legally Westpac and Westpac staff can't deal for PPL clients so Garth Carter said if A Wong deals on their behalf he will accept it between WP &amp;PPL for PPL to onward deal with clients. The CHF total exposed amount is around CHF 37.69M</PARA>
<PARA>24/3/87</PARA>
<PARA>A Wong covered CHF 37.7M in USD at 1.5200 after being unsuccessful with order to cover at 1.5290. Garth was informed immediately. A Wong asked Libby for exact amt. A Fedas rang to say Libby has nothing to do with it and Garth wasn't involved so he didn't know the right amt. Fedas advised A Wong has covered CHF 365,000 too much. Wong suggested he look for another small client to take on the cover as USD will fall quickly. Fedas rang back to advise the amt was in fact too small and we need to cover another CHF 504,000. </PARA>
<PARA>A. Wong covered the balance and wrote a bulk deal with PPL for CHF 38,223,486.12 at 1.51[ff] value 25/3/87</PARA>
<PARA>WP US/-CHF PPL CHF/-USD</PARA>
<PARA>WP RMU has not taken on responsibility of portfolio until we are legally under PPL employed. We are only assisting PPL on request. </PARA>
<PARA>(4) Special Customer</PARA>
<PARA>Theiss Watkins has certain understanding with A Fedas PPL as to method of management. A. Wong phoned Peter Irwin of Theiss Watkins today to inform him of the change of management, and explained the method will remain as per present RMU operation style. Irwin &amp;Wong agreed to meet in about 2 weeks to further discuss Theiss' considerations (mainly the Board approved A$22 million ceiling imposed on loans managed by PPL)</PARA>
<PARA>(5) F.E.C. Limits, Netting, Suspense Accounts</PARA>
<PARA>As A. Fedas noted, presently none of the discretionary clients has any approved F.E.C. limits, nor formal netting approvals, nor suspense accounts under clients' names. All deals are understood to be non-deliverable. It means PPL Treasury has been dealing on behalf of clients with no approved limits. (This explains why certain account managers are wary about cash impacts of our dealing mistakes). All deals are done to the rollover dates to avoid immediate cash impact as customers don't have suspense accounts to absorb dealing P/L On rollover date, all deals are offnetted or swapped out at market rate (no HRR allowed) so a cash P/L is crystallized. </PARA>
<PARA>Cash profits are treated as a restricted deposit under client's name. (Although PPL has no legal authority to restrict the deposit). Cash losses are funded by drawing a loan under clients name. </PARA>
<PARA>A. Wong discussed this with G. Mackie who will ask PPL ID to establish suspense account for each client to absorb trading P/L. </PARA>
<PARA>(6) Dealing Method</PARA>
<PARA>Due to (5), we must deal all PPL clients to their rollover dates until suspense accounts are established. </PARA>
<PARA>A. Fedas said RMU can do a bulk deal, give the amount to PPL ID who are then able to split them into each client's amount and date, and they will also deal the swaps out with our dealers. If the PPL ID can in fact do this,it is desirable to deal each client to their rollover dates to avoid the problem of understating or overstating the bottom line by revaluing at forward rates. </PARA>
<PARA>(7) Confirmations and Reports</PARA>
<PARA>Present PPL agree FX agreement does not restrict PPL. </PARA>
<PARA>As Westpac will become principal, PPL as agent, of FX deals</PARA>
<PARA>All deal details will be entered into Tandem system by PPL ID. </PARA>
<PARA>12/6/87</PARA>
<PARA>Met with Stan Davis, Peter Clarke on memo written by Qld State Mgr PPL: Thomas Booker</PARA>
<PARA>Points made:</PARA>
<PARA>1. T. Booker alleged that A. Wong a Westpac employee was ``managing the PPL loans pool, and was doing so without authority (legal) or knowledge of clients. Booker would not be under such impression unless he was told by some employee of PPL. It appears to be G. Carter. </PARA>
<PARA>2. If this memo goes into customer's file (and many other copies or replies or recounts of similar conversations will go into various customers' files), and if one of these customers bring PPL or WP to court 5 years later, under the Freedom of Information Act the customer's file will be brought to the Court of Law, when the memo will unearth, and it will implicate the Bank. Neither the Bank nor A. Wong will stand a chance. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Wong has met with G. Carter and T. Booker to ask Carter to write a (illegible) clear reply. Carter said he could not do so without implying that he had once relied on a single person (himself) who has no proven FX track (illegible). (He said perhaps say A. Wong was acting as adviser (which Wong told Barker was the real situation) until Fedas left, Wong was second. But in any case) it is difficult to make any sort of reply without having some implication on PPL. </PARA>
<PARA>4. PPL's customer received a report of their position in March then a second one after 2 months in May, under a totally different format and suggesting they have lost a lot of money. In addition, the numbers don't look right (perhaps due to clerical errors) The way it was handled made the customers feel that PPL (and/or WP) was trying to hide something. </PARA>
<PARA>5. Every time a deal is written by WP (Wong [&amp; staff) for PPL, it is a bulk deal between WP &amp;PPL. Then it is up to PPL employees to apportion it to respective clients and take them out to respective rollover dates. WP has never written any deal directly to PPL clients who are still managed by PPL. </PARA>
<PARA>6. According to PPL customer printout, there was no transactions between late Mar to late April for a month. Then late Mar to G. Carter, who sometimes did and sometimes did not act upon those suggestions. But G. Carter has repeated said to Wong : Do whatever you're doing with WP pool to PPL pool as well. So from 25/5/87 Wong did act for PPL and informed Carter later. But Wong &amp;Carter were on the phone at night on 26/5 about the market, so Wong did not really act for PPL until 25/5 or 26/5. N. Miles knew the arrangement but did not object to it. </PARA>
<PARA>However, although Carter gave Wong the instruction and with knowledge of Wong's Manager Miles. Neither Carter nor Miles represent the Law. Strictly from the legal point of view, Wong did seem to have acted without authority although authority was (transferred) implied from PPL &amp;PPL's staff. </PARA>
<PARA>7. Booker was implying to Wong in yesterday's meeting that due to Westpac's or WP's employee's doing, clients have been losing money. Again he was led to believe that from PPL source. </PARA>
<PARA>Due to Booker's conversations with all PPL State Managers about the situation (of reporting, losses, Carter-Wong joint market assessments, lack of information from PPL Treasury to clients or account managers), now almost everyone at PPL knows about it and may be led to believe what Booker believes. There may be many copies of that memo all over PPL and WP. </PARA>
<PARA>Davis &amp;Clarke's points:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Now that the memo is written, it may be too late to destroy every copy so Davis to ask Phil Deer to speak to all State Managers and tell them not to use the memo as official file. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Davis to get all facts from Carter and a reply. Suggested we meet again next week to see where we stand. Davis will issue official memo for files to state the case, and to state Wong did nothing wrong outside of authority. The situation where WP may have an employee acting for PPL at some instances even may seem to be default, was only due to confusion and lack of clear authority to the parties involved, leading to situations where and when proper decisions have to be made for the best interest of PPL clients, certain decisions were taken along with those made for WP clients. </PARA>
<PARA>15/6/87</PARA>
<PARA>O/D order to buy USD not done. </PARA>
<PARA>USD closed a little above 1.81DM, 1.50CHF. May see higher to 1.82DM before retracement. </PARA>
<PARA>Miles &amp;Wong concerns: don't scramble to buy USD. Wait &amp;see. H.K. public holiday. Mkt will be quiet. A$ well bid. </PARA>
<PARA>Garth Carter informed Wong:</PARA>
<PARA>Phillip Conwall (Allen, Solicitors)'s opinion is that better not to backdate secondment, but something in black &amp;white is recommendable. </PARA>
<PARA>As long as it was agreed between Stan Davis, Garth Carter and Neville Miles that secondment was to take place effective April-end 1987, it should then become official, whether there is secondment paper or not. So we need to put the agreed date/situation on file. </PARA>
<PARA>PPL's Roger Houghton &amp;WP's Chris Hardwick was working on the secondment. </PARA>
<PARA>Wong left O/N orders to buy USD/sell CHF in USD50M total for W[P]</PARA>
<PARA>16/6/87</PARA>
<PARA>O/N orders not done. USD higher but seems overbought. A$ bid. C/A deficit today. Wong left stop loss order to sell A$30M at 7150. </PARA>
<PARA>Wong spoke to Garth Carter:</PARA>
<PARA>Feel USD may be a bit overbought, but pool level to unwind at least 1/2 USD/CHF portfolio at 1.5000 or close to that level (correspondent DM at 1.8050-1.8100 level), A$ stable &amp;well bid. If fall below 7150 may see quick 50 pts. run and bounce again. G. Carter happy to remain open A$/US$ leg and covered US$/CHF leg until better level to unwind USD/CHF. </PARA>
<PARA>Position as @ PPL termination ($/Thirds Fully covered, A$/USD70% hedged), rather than leave exposure open. We feel it more prudent to continue as per the normal course as above, given the absence of client notification to discontinue management and our perception of downside risk this time. We request no reports/deal confirmation be sent to clients in the mean-time (nor to MOS's). </PARA>

<PARA>Thomas Nominees Pty Ltd No 1</PARA>
<PARA>Thomas Nominees Pty Ltd No 2</PARA>
<PARA>In reply to your memo of the 5th June 1987 on the above subject and further to our discussions I will formally answer the questions you raised, although as you are aware most of your questions, if not all, have been answered verbally.</PARA>
<PARA> . You stated you did not receive any reports on the above clients' positions between 7th May 1987 and 21st May 1987. Julie Cleary on the other hand has assured me they were sent and has cited South Australia as an example of an office which did receive most of their reports. I understand that subsequent enquiries found that some of the reports turned up in Western Australia and some have never surfaced. </PARA>
<PARA> . You stated that you repeatedly requested by telephone a copy of the report. In your memo you do not state who you asked although you implied that you asked me. At no stage did we discuss missing reports nor did anyone else contact me about the reports. The first time I became aware you were not receiving reports was at the time of receipt of your memo on the 5th June. Julie Cleary also did not receive a complaint about the lack of reports being provided to your office. </PARA>
<PARA> . ``Thomas Nominees received a [Tandem] report dated 27th May 1987 showing a debt/security rate of 81.68%.''</PARA>
<PARA> . While there certainly was a deterioration in the client's position the reason for the high security/debt ratio on that particular report compared with previous PC reports was that domestic loans to the client were also shown on the report and included in the ratio. Previously the PC reports had only shown offshore borrowings but in response to a number of requests from various PMO's, domestic loans were also included in the security/debt ratio on the new Tandem system. </PARA>
<PARA> . I understand from discussions with Elizabeth Wyse that the security mentioned in the report is not held against the domestic loan. </PARA>
<PARA> . You stated the situation was serious and that the position was out of your control as you were unable to monitor the daily position. I can only restate that if you had actually discussed the lack of reports with me I would have made sure you received the reports daily. </PARA>
<PARA>Answers to the specific questions raised in your memo are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>1. The loans were not managed strictly on a pool basis (the agreement did not provide for a pool arrangement). While deals were approximately pro-rated in practice this entailed some rounding up or down depending on the situation. With the exception of Thomas Nominees No 1 the other security/debt ratios did not differ significantly from one loan to another during the period you mentioned. The reason for the change by 3.11% of the account ratio of Thomas Nominees No 1 appears to be due to an oversight whereby a decision was made to leave the loan unhedged at rollover with the intention of unhedging the other borrowers on the same day. Apparently the latter decision was deferred and the unhedged loan was forgotten. This resulted in a loss of USD57,423.02 (AUD79,291.66 at 0.7242) for the client. In view of the fact that we appear to have made an error it is appropriate that the client be reimbursed for the loss. This will be the subject of a separate paper to the Managing Director recommending the writing off of the loss by PPL. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason for differences in the change of the security/debt ratio is that each client is dealt forward to their next rollover date. The rollover dates of loans rarely coincide, consequently when a decision if made to unhedge the borrowers a swap is done to the next rollover date. Consequently losses can not only be made through changes in the spot price but also through changes in the forward swap points. As clients' positions were individually hedged to their next rollover and these can differ from one client to the next by many months this can result in changes in the clients' relative positions. </PARA>
<PARA> You asked if the reports were checked the answer is yes although the client's ratio is not checked as it was always considered to be the roll of the PMO to review the ratio. </PARA>
<PARA>2a. At no stage was Westpac managing the clients' positions. All dealings were carried out between the client and PPL. From the time Haniff Abu Bakar left PPL, on the 24th March 1987, arrangements were made for Agnes Wong to advise Andy Fedas or myself of market trends and for her to inform us of strategies she was adopting for the Bank's clients. With the exception of a few occasions her advice, when offered, was always taken. </PARA>
<PARA>Arrangements were put in place when Andy Fedas resigned to second Agnes Wong and Neville Miles to PPL effective 18th May 1987. From that time Agnes and Neville managed the portfolio as employees of PPL. This was still the position up until the time of termination of the contracts by PPL on the 29th June 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>2b. </PARA>
<PARA>``The clients have not signed a new Power of Attorney''</PARA>
<PARA>This was due to the fact that the Bank's new pooled Power of Attorney was not ready immediately the decision was made to transfer the management from PPL to the Bank. In addition there was computer system constraints which had to be resolved and for a period of time personnel shortages. </PARA>
<PARA>2c. </PARA>
<PARA>``When will they receive one''</PARA>
<PARA>As soon as possible was the answer. This eventuated on about the 19th June 1987 and the 22nd June 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>2d. </PARA>
<PARA>``Will they be told PPL is not managing the facility anymore''</PARA>
<PARA>No, as the statement was not true up until the time of termination on the 29th June 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>2e. </PARA>
<PARA>``You assured me 6 weeks ago new Powers of Attorney would be in place shortly. Why aren't they?''</PARA>
<PARA>At that time the view was that a new Power of Attorney would be drawn up between the client and PPL permitting PPL to deal on the clients' behalf with the Bank. Subsequently the decision was made for PPL to step out of the roll of manager and for the Bank to offer clients an alternative service. This all took time plus the delays mentioned in 2b. </PARA>
<PARA>3. </PARA>
<PARA>Comparison of John MacDonald with your clients' positions. </PARA>
<PARA>It is impossible to compare the results of the John MacDonald group with any other client as this group of clients were not always managed by PPL. The client took an active involvement in the management of the exposure sometimes to the client's benefit and sometimes with the opposite effect. </PARA>
<PARA>4a. </PARA>
<PARA>``Why wasn't I shown how it worked before it [the report] was sent to the client?''</PARA>
<PARA>You were sent a copy and explanation. Unfortunately this must have gone astray. </PARA>
<PARA>4b. </PARA>
<PARA>``Why didn't I get a copy to enable me to monitor the position?''</PARA>
<PARA>See 4a. </PARA>
<PARA>4c. </PARA>
<PARA>``How was Ms A Wong selected to manage PPL client loans? What are her qualifications and track record as an FX dealer? Is she going to meet the clients?''</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly she only assumed responsibility for the management of the loans on the 18th May when she was seconded to PPL. Secondly she performs this role for the Bank and has done so for the last year. She is well qualified for the position and has been involved in the foreign exchange market since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not intended for her to meet the clients although if clients do wish to discuss their position with her they can do so quarterly by appointment. </PARA>
<PARA>4d. </PARA>
<PARA>``If the losses are as significant as I have been advised, what steps have been taken to improve the level of professional service given to managed clients. Are we to continue the service?''</PARA>
<PARA>There was little we could do to improve the service in terms of improving the clients' positions. It is an extremely difficult product to manage particularly with the thin volume of trading which takes place in CHF in our time zone. In addition the US dollar traded against the thirds in a particular unpredictable way during the period as did the AUD. </PARA>
<PARA>My view has been that we should discontinue the service, Andy Fedas also had the same view as did Brian Eggert. This view was formally put to Bruce Fraser, Tony Snape and Ron Regan at a meeting in February this year. A similar recommendation was made by Brian Eggert late last year. Our recommendation was to terminate PPL's management agreements as soon as possible. Bruce Fraser and Tony Snape refused to accept this recommendation as they believe that PPL had an ongoing obligation to manage the clients' FX exposure. </PARA>
<PARA>4e. </PARA>
<PARA>``Is the Bank's position on daily trading as bad as the managed clients?''</PARA>
<PARA>One can not make a comparison for a number of factors such as; the client always has a short Swiss Franc position and it can only be left open or hedged. As such the client overall can not go long Swiss Franc, any short (unhedged) position will not accumulate cash profits, only a paper result, whereas a hedge position can create negative cash flows on which the client has to pay interest. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bank can deal in any currency not just the CHF/AUD cross, secondly it can be short, long or square. </PARA>
<PARA>4f. </PARA>
<PARA>``What steps are you taking to:</PARA>
<PARA>- ``provide PMO's with regular reports''</PARA>
<PARA>- The report can be accessed by the PMO off the Tandem computer. </PARA>
<PARA>- ``provide professional information to clients on a regular basis''</PARA>
<PARA> Monthly reports will be sent to clients in the new format of which you will now be aware. </PARA>
<PARA>- ``provide professional dealers to ensure losses, if any, are minimised''</PARA>
<PARA> In my view as well as others, Agnes Wong is a very professional dealer. </PARA>
<PARA>- ``provide PPL staff with necessary information when requested''</PARA>
<PARA> A new unit employing Julie Cleary and Jenny Chandler, reporting to Bruce Glover, has been set up to handle the administration work involved with the managed borrowers. They will continue to be the first point of reference for information on clients' positions etc. </PARA>
<PARA>You will be aware by now that responsibility for the product has now shifted to Agnes Wong and Neville Miles. Responsibility for the administration work has been taken up by Bruce Glover with Julie Cleary handling the day to day work. </PARA>

<PARA>DATE:</PARA>
<PARA>31 July 1987</PARA>
<PARA>RE:</PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Currency Borrowers under Management</PARA>
<PARA>Further to your memo of 24 July 1987:</PARA>
<PARA>Point 1 My memo of 5 June 1987 Page 1 states inter alia-</PARA>
<PARA>The last report supplied under the old system was on 7 April 1987 and not 7 May 1987 as your memo now suggests. </PARA>
<PARA>Point 2 I categorically refute your statement that you did not know about the reports not being received. </PARA>
<PARA>Prior to 5 June 1987 (the date of my memo to you) I rang National Manager, Corporate Services, Bruce Fraser and informed him (as I was responsible for the level of exposure) that the reports had not been received. At his suggestion and as it was your area of responsibility, I telephoned you and requested the reports (please also refer item 2e and 4a). </PARA>
<PARA>Point 3 At the time of writing my memorandum to you I had not been informed on how the report worked. Since that date I have now had the opportunity of being shown by Elizabeth Wyse. Unfortunately this course of action was instigated by myself as no apparent effort had been made by Head Office to either inform or teach inter-state staff the new system. </PARA>
<PARA>Point 4 Refer Point 2 above. </PARA>
<PARA>Answers to specific questions raised in your memo are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>1. </PARA>
<PARA>The loans under management were all ``sold'' to the clients on the basis that the position was ``pooled''. This had been said by all previous PPL personnel ie. David Green, Peter Mahajlovic and Andy Fedas and more recently by Neville Miles to clients Thomas Nominees Pty. Ltd. when Martin Thomas of that company was in Sydney (29 June 1987). </PARA>
<PARA>How can you possibly say the reports were checked when your memo also states-</PARA>
<PARA>``The reason for the change by 3.11% of the account ratio of Thomas Nominees No. 1 appears to be due to an oversight whereby a decision was made to leave the loan unhedged at rollovers with the intention of unhedging the other borrowers on the same day. Apparently the latter decision was deferred and the unhedged loan was forgotten. This resulted in a loss of USD$57,423-02 (AUD$79,291-66 @ 0.7242) for the client''. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that if proper systems were in place and transactions checked this would not have resulted in a loss to PPL. </PARA>
<PARA>2a. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a pity that neither I, as PMO for Thomas Nominees nor David Johnston, as PMO of Melinos were informed of this change so that the clients could be informed. </PARA>
<PARA>2b. </PARA>
<PARA>When the decision was made all the paperwork required should have been in place. </PARA>
<PARA>2c. </PARA>
<PARA>No comment. </PARA>
<PARA>2d. </PARA>
<PARA>No comment. </PARA>
<PARA>2e. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite your claims in Point 2 it is interesting to note that you acknowledge we were discussing new Powers of Attorney six weeks prior to my original memo.</PARA>
<PARA>3. </PARA>
<PARA>No comment. </PARA>
<PARA>4a. </PARA>
<PARA>I can accept, on occasions, that paper flow can go astray however I cannot accept that so much had gone astray over such a long period of time. Since my report we have received every report on a daily basis. We certainly had nothing to gain from reports not arriving in this office. </PARA>
<PARA>4b. </PARA>
<PARA>See 4a. </PARA>
<PARA>4c. </PARA>
<PARA>No comment. </PARA>
<PARA>4d. </PARA>
<PARA>No comment. </PARA>
<PARA>Client, Thomas Nominees received a report dated 27 May 1987 yesterday (4 June 1987) which shows his debt/security ratio at a staggering 81.68%. Now perhaps I am reading this report incorrectly as I am yet to be shown how it works, but the deterioration, if this is correct, in 6 days trading is not acceptable. I have spoken to Libby Wyse who advised me that the position has deteriorated by some $450,000 for Thomas Nominees and as we do not have a report for Melinos, its position cannot be ascertained. I also spoke to Julie Cleary who confirmed that trading losses had occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Julie Cleary advised me she has sent these reports daily via our internal mail. David Johnston or myself are the only people in this office who open the morning airbag. We have not received any of these reports. Perhaps this may need to be taken up with the relevant staff on our behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> Ironically we have today (5 June 1987) received a report. It is the old type P.C. report dated 4 June 1987. The report shows the following debt/security ratio:</PARA>
<PARA>% change 21/5/87</PARA>
<PARA>to 4.6.87</PARA>
<PARA>A</PARA>
<PARA>94.59</PARA>
<PARA>+1.61</PARA>
<PARA>B</PARA>
<PARA>85.69</PARA>
<PARA>+1.58</PARA>
<PARA>C</PARA>
<PARA>68.11</PARA>
<PARA>+1.24</PARA>
<PARA>D</PARA>
<PARA>69.14</PARA>
<PARA>+1.61</PARA>
<PARA>This report is very different from the one which shows Thomas Nominees' debt/security ratio 81.68%. It does however reflect a further discrepancy in loan C compared to the others. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very serious position and, frankly, without reports, one which is totally out of my control as I am unable to monitor the position daily. </PARA>
<PARA>Questions now need to be asked, the main ones being:</PARA>
<PARA>1. If all loans are ``pooled'' and profits and/or losses spread amongst the borrowers, how can the loan to security ratio change by 3.11% for one loan (C) and the others change from 0.55%-0.59% in the same period. </PARA>
<PARA>If 1. above is a mistake, doesn't anybody check the transactions before the report is sent. </PARA>
<PARA>2. These two borrowers are managed under a PPL Power of Attorney. How can a Westpac employee (Ms A. Wong) be trading on their behalf and without their (the clients') knowledge?</PARA>
<PARA> . The clients have not signed a new Power of Attorney</PARA>
<PARA> . When will they receive one</PARA>
<PARA> . Will they be told PPL is not managing the facility anymore</PARA>
<PARA> . You assured me 6 weeks ago new Powers of Attorney would be in place shortly. Why aren't they?</PARA>
<PARA>3. State Manager Adelaide advised me one of his clients (John MacDonald Group) has lost $250,000 in the same trading period. How can he lose that amount on a $10 million facility when my client has lost approximately $450,000 (based on Libby Wyse's estimate) on a $7.3 million facility?</PARA>
<PARA>4. The new report sent to Thomas Nominees (dated 27 May 1987) is the first such report he has received under the new system. He faxed it to me and requested an explanation on how it works. </PARA>
<PARA> . Why wasn't I shown how it worked before it was sent to the client?</PARA>
<PARA> . Why didn't I get a copy to enable me to monitor the position PMO</PARA>
<PARA> . How was Ms A. Wong selected to manage PPL client loans? What are her qualifications and track record as a FX dealer? Is she going to meet the clients?</PARA>
<PARA> . If the losses are as significant as I have been advised, what steps have been taken to improve the level of professional service given to managed clients. Are we to continue the service?</PARA>
<PARA> . Is the bank's position on daily trading as bad as the managed clients?</PARA>
<PARA> . What steps are you taking to:</PARA>
<PARA> - provide PMO's with regular reports</PARA>
<PARA> - provide professional information to clients on a regular basis</PARA>
<PARA> - provide professional dealers to ensure losses if any are minimised</PARA>
<PARA> - provide PPl staff with necessary information when requested</PARA>
<PARA>In summary I have spoken to numerous people on several of the above issues. The responses in the main have been totally unsatisfactory with most people denying responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Garth, it is your responsibility as Group Treasurer of Partnership Pacific Limited for this area and I request of you the following:</PARA>
<PARA>. Answers to the above questions</PARA>
<PARA>. A reference point to service our daily information requirements</PARA>
<PARA>. your assurance that the management of these loans is being handled by competent personnel</PARA>
<PARA>. a point of contact for clients with the relevant Westpac personnel. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Mr President, and other senators. I acknowledge the point being made by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hill, that they are in fact lengthy documents and it is an unusual request that they be incorporated. I do not wish in any way to set a precedent, but I agree with him that they are of such public significance that under these circumstances their incorporation is justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is now acknowledged that here we are looking at a battle of mammoth proportions. It is a battle between ordinary Australians, in the circumstances in which they innocently find themselves, and a great corporate financial giant-in fact, Australia's largest private bank. The documents have been referred to, and are referred to within the documents themselves, as devastating. That is what has caused them to be a matter of such conjecture prior to this morning, when I think commonsense prevailed in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The other evening on the adjournment I spoke at some length to the second set of documents, which are now referred to as the French letters or the Paris documents. In the process of doing so I made an incorrect statement which I would now like to correct for the benefit of the public record.  Mr Stuart Fowler, the Managing Director of Westpac, quite rightly corrected me in his public statements this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussing the significance of discovery as a part of the legal process, I cited two cases-Quade and Rhame. I said that they were cases of litigants in dispute with Westpac. I was wrong; they are cases of litigants in dispute with the Commonwealth Bank. However, the point I was actually making on the significance of documents and the discovery of documents in the process of litigation is still valid. They are in fact cases relating to Commonwealth Bank documents. Having corrected that for the public record, I offer apology to Westpac for that mistake. Presumably, the Commonwealth Bank is now embarrassed by the points I made on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer briefly to comments passed by Mr Steve Martin, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. This morning on the radio he made reference, I think probably unfortunately, to people coming out of the woodwork as a result of these Westpac documents having surfaced and getting on the band wagon of litigation.</PARA>
<PARA> As one who has been involved for 2 1/2 years in the process of revealing the circumstances of these people, and who has related to the borrowers association for the whole of that time, I think what is happening is that people are not so much coming out of the woodwork and getting on a band wagon, but rather are being encouraged. Their morale is up; they now see a possibility of success and the recovery of massive losses. I would like to put a different complexion on what is happening as a result of these documents coming into the public forum. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn briefly to the first letters-the Belgian letters. The documents have been referred to in general terms as the Westpac letters but, of course, there will be more. So we are now having to differentiate between those that first arrived from Belgium and those that subsequently arrived from France. It has been claimed, by me and others, that these documents are potentially the most potent that have been before the Parliament for many years. They are confidential-absolutely private and confidential-correspondence between the law firm Allen Allen and Hemsley, the lawyers of Westpac, and Mr Warwick Kent, the Chief General Manager, Corporate and International Desk, Westpac. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two letters: one of 26 November, which in many respects is possibly the most significant; and one of 11 December. The document of 26 November is a disclosure to Westpac of the magnitude of its mismanagement and its undoubtedly-as will be subsequently proven-illegal and fraudulent actions in its handling of foreign currency loans. In the documents that I have tabled the names of individuals have been removed. That is not the issue at stake, even though the documents do apportion blame and actually attempt to sheet the blame home to three individuals. It has been suggested to me that there may be more than an element of scapegoating in that process. So the names of individuals have been removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The significant thing about the first three pages is that they emphasise how thorough Allen Allen and Hemsley has been. It has compiled 50,000 documents. Details of over 7,000 documents are in its computers, and the most significant 1,500 are readily available for reference. It has interviewed all of those involved in the field management of the process. It emphasises the fact that it has had absolute cooperation from those interviewed. In other words, the first three pages emphasise, `We have been thorough, and you had better believe what we are telling you, because it reflects the reality of what is out there'. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents then go on to summarise the performance in managed loans. That summary is very significant, and is now available for public perusal. It is worth noting that they really say that the whole process of offering these foreign loans, in the final analysis and with the benefit of hindsight, was a disaster. They say, for instance, that there can be no doubt that by early July 1986 all senior management of PPL, which is the subsidiary of Westpac, were only too well aware of the gravity of the situation of mismanagement. They use terms such as `non-management', `management vacuums' and `management by memos'. They say that, in short, management foreign exchange loans were a bad idea, introduced at the worst possible time and badly managed. They make reference to the fact that the first quarter of 1987 was a period of `nonmanagement'. These are the expressions used within the documents about the way in which this flawed product was not managed. Yet it is referred to officially as `managed foreign currency loans'. There is more than a touch of irony there. </PARA>
<PARA> They come to a series of conclusions, and those conclusions admit the fact that the bank breached fiduciary obligations-the fundamental obligation under law between banker and client. They admit to the fact that the relationship was breached. They admit that it failed to comply with the management parameters which it communicated to the public. In other words, it had created an image of certain things occurring, and it admits that that was not what happened internally. The documents attempt to identify those that were largely responsible for this disaster, and they actually name them. Whether or not that is a just allotment of blame, others will have to decide. And they attempt to identify the magnitude of the disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> In many respects the interesting aspect of this is that the documents go on to talk about damage control techniques. They go on to devise a strategy for minimising the impact of litigation. I have contended elsewhere, and I will contend yet again, that those strategies are in fact tantamount to aiding and abetting. They are tantamount to conspiracy to thwart the course of justice. In fact, the significance of the second of the letters is that it says, `Assuming that we are guilty, juries will never be able to find us so because the significant documents are missing'. The documents go on to say that it is highly unlikely that these litigants, or many of them, will be able to persevere long enough in the courts to be successful, because most of them are broken, not only financially but emotionally and in almost every other respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I will read what I consider to be the most damaging sentence in these documents. This is by Mr Jones, the principal legal adviser to the senior manager:</PARA>
<PARA>I wrote to you on 22 October-</PARA>
<PARA>1987, that is-</PARA>
<PARA>and attached to that letter a collection of documents. </PARA>
<PARA>Many more documents have been examined and a number of them are very damaging.</PARA>
<PARA>I see little point in adding further documents to the bundle, however, because the documents attached to my letter of 22 October illustrate the extraordinary extent to which PPL's own documents support the conclusions I have reached-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, disaster, abandonment of fiduciary relations, et cetera-</PARA>
<PARA>The bundle is attachment 2 to this letter. </PARA>
<PARA>All of those reading this letter should read these documents-they are devastating. </PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting from the assessment that is made by Allen Allen and Hemsley about this massive evidence that the firm is referring to. It says that it is devastating. It is interesting to relate those comments to what I have said on the adjournment debate-that instructions have gone out to destroy and shred and conceal many of these devastating documents. Those two points have got to be related. I would like to turn, just briefly, to the last section of the first letter, under the heading `Strategy'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>PPL's strategy should have the following key elements . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is a strategy, I would suggest, to reduce and minimise the just outcomes of litigation. It is stated that PPL's strategy should be to keep a `close and cordial' relationship with those that might be litigants-butter them up. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Avoid litigation at any reasonable cost . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, do not get into the courts if you can avoid it. Further it states:</PARA>
<PARA>Bring borrowers onshore as quickly as possible . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Any concessions given to borrowers should only be given in exchange for a complete release . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is complete release from subsequent legal action. The strategy is to offer concessions-in other words, I would suggest, bribe borrowers by concessions, then get legal release in exchange for those concessions. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>When particularly dangerous potential claimants come on shore, try and arrange this on the basis of a concession and a consequent release. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public interest I wish to raise does not have the glamour or excitement of the matter raised by Senator McLean. It should, however, be a matter that is of very great concern to this Parliament because it deals with actions of governments, and of this Government in particular, and it is something that this Parliament could do something about. Unlike the matter mentioned by Senator McLean, where legal remedies are available and law rights and courts are available to institute proceedings and recover moneys if the courts of our land find that wrongdoing has occurred, in this instance people cannot recover moneys because legally they have little in the way of rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite that it is a matter of some concern to me and to the people of north Queensland. It relates again to the town of Ravenshoe, which I have mentioned a number of times since I have been in the Senate and which colleagues of mine in the Senate from Queensland have also mentioned. It relates to matters that the Government has been very negligent in attending to. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three aspects that I want to raise today in the continuing saga of Ravenshoe. The first relates to just what happened to the $7m of taxpayers' money that was given by the Government to a mill in Ravenshoe for certain purposes. Secondly, I want to raise the matter of what is happening to the mill there. Thirdly, I want to raise the matter of money that is owing to business people in Ravenshoe. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these things are directly related to Government actions. All of these things have occurred initially through the World Heritage listing of the rainforests in the Ravenshoe area. There was never any argument that the rainforest should be protected. There was a lot of argument about where the boundaries should be and whether the drawing of those boundaries would ruin livelihoods, jobs and whole townships. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been attempting to find information about what has happened to the $7m of public moneys that have been alleged to have disappeared. It is very difficult to obtain information either from the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) or from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) or from their respective offices about what has happened to those moneys. I was, however, advised yesterday that a couple of weeks ago the matter of where those moneys were spent has been in fact referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions and to the Australian Federal Police for further investigation and, I understand, action. </PARA>
<PARA> It was announced back in October 1990 by the Minister, Mrs Kelly, that she was referring this matter to the Attorney-General for investigation and it has taken almost five months to get to the point where the matter is being referred to the police and to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is of some real concern that it has taken so long. These investigations, I would hope, would show what happened to it-whether criminal activity was involved. If criminal activity was involved with taxpayers' moneys, then prosecutions, hopefully, will be brought at an early stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole incidence of the giving of this money and what happened to it has been a scandal as far as the Government has been concerned. It shows the absolute negligence and flimsiness with which the Government pursued or oversaw that money. I have been told by Ministers in statements and answers to questions that the Government did keep a supervisory role in seeing that that money was spent. In fact, one answer from the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>Like any good business manager the Commonwealth did not let its loan go unwatched. Officers of the Department regularly telephoned the manager of the mill to seek information on progress with the retooling. The mill was visited by representatives on several occasions. The Department's financial advisers on this issue also monitored operations of the mill. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Minister said. My information is that the supervision was very patchy in that the Commonwealth, contrary to its statement, did let its loan go unwatched. It was more than a loan; it was taxpayers' moneys given in a grant and some in a loan. Basically they were unwatched, they were not supervised at all, and the money has disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA> The retooling of the Ravenshoe mill cost in the order of $3.58m, and a grant was given by the Commonwealth to do that. But I have figures-they have been tabled in the Senate before-that show that the mill paid for that retooling out of its own resources. That begs the question of what happened to the government money that was given for that particular purpose. There are suggestions of impropriety in what did happen to that money. The Government certainly did not oversee it. My investigations have revealed that the Government did not then bother to ask the people who would most know what happened to the money, what moneys came in and what went out. It did not then and it has not since, after all of the times this has been raised. The more one investigates this, the more one becomes suspicious of just what did happen to the money, and the more one becomes convinced that the Government, in spite of its protestations to the contrary, has played no proper role at all in supervising this large payment of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> Ravenshoe is only a very small town. The timber mill there has, as a result of World Heritage listing, been wound down. It has been propped up by the Government. The Government has, to its credit, attempted to do something with continuing grants; but the mill has reached a stage now where it has fallen further and further behind. The receiver has been in there for almost a year now and has been unable to run the mill profitably. The situation has now been reached where, unless the mill can be sold to an operator to keep it going, it will be sold piecemeal at a fire sale and will disappear from that town. </PARA>
<PARA> The town of Ravenshoe is only a small place. It achieves no recognition. There are no votes there. Ministers went there in its heyday, but since then they have kept well away. Minister Kelly did go through for a very brief trip, but there has been no real significance given to it. It has been brushed aside. I want to say to the Government that for as long as I am here I am going to keep raising this matter. It will not be able to brush it aside until some resolution is reached and some justice done there. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a couple of applications to buy the mill, one by an Aboriginal community and one by a private sawmilling concern which involves business people in Ravenshoe. In both instances, though, substantial government moneys will be needed to assist the bid to buy the mill out. I know that these are before the Minister at the moment, and I can only urge upon the Minister that she make a decision at the very earliest time. The mill is running down. Each week another group of people is dismissed, and I understand that in a couple of weeks there will be only a couple of caretakers left there. The mill will cease operations and it will be very difficult, in those circumstances, to restart it. If the decision on the sale is left for more than a week then it may be impossible to restart it, even if the goodwill is there to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge Mrs Kelly to make an immediate decision on that. I urge her to think wisely about it. There is a need for further government money, and whilst this does not always receive great support in these tough economic times I might point out that the assistance being sought is still much less than is left in the structural adjustment package which was specifically set aside for trying to do something about Ravenshoe. Even if it supports these applications, the Government will get out of this with much less expenditure than would have been the case if the original proposals for assistance had not proceeded. Although there will be a cost to the taxpayer, the cost is not going to be exorbitant. It is going to be less than was originally envisaged. But it must be decided soon, and I urge the Minister to think very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is in not only in the Government's interest but in the interest in the town of Ravenshoe that the successful bidder for the mill be in a position to carry it on in a profitable way. It is essential that the successful operator have the expertise and the wherewithal to do this. I understand both applicants are in that situation. It is essential, though, that the purchaser have the marketing network and the ongoing financial resources to keep the mill operating, so that we do not have to keep revisiting Ravenshoe as the years go on. It is important that a decision be made, it is important that it be made wisely, and it is important that it be made soon. </PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect concerning the town of Ravenshoe relates to the money lost by a number of business people and contractors in Ravenshoe because the mill went into liquidation. As I mentioned earlier, one would say that if they have a claim for money owing to them they should take proceedings. They cannot in this instance because, as the company owing the money has gone into liquidation, the laws of the land do not permit such action. But why I always say the Government should step in-and I can justify saying it-is that that situation arose and those people in Ravenshoe advanced credit to the mill on the understanding that the Government was proceeding to support the mill for a 10-year period. The Government had announced that and it had given money on a regular basis. The Government had indicated that it was supervising its money, that it was keeping an eye on things. </PARA>
<PARA> The business people of Ravenshoe, quite rightly, expected that with that sort of government supervision and that commitment to further government support they would have no risk at all in a commercial sense in extending credit on a short term basis-on normal 30-day or 60-day credit terms-to the mill. Because they trusted the Government, because they believed what the Government had said, they gave that credit and have now suffered tremendously. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned individual cases without naming them. But I again want to draw to the Senate's attention a couple of instances that were brought to my notice when I revisited Ravenshoe during the recess last week. One relates to an electrician, a good citizen of Ravenshoe, who extended credit to the mill on the strength of the Government's support. He has lost his whole business, his whole livelihood, his home there. He has lost the lot. He has lost his house and the family has had to move town, taking the kids out of school. I understand it is a very traumatic and sad experience for that family and it is an experience that is well known in Ravenshoe. </PARA>
<PARA> I visited another gentleman who had applied for assistance from the structural adjustment package but had been knocked back because it was said he had too many assets. Some other people in the same category did get some assistance but it is not adequate. This gentleman has some large earthmoving equipment-huge tractors worth $200,000 to $300,000 in their heyday-that would go in and get the logs out. They are now sitting idle. There is no market for them; they cannot be sold. This gentleman is a couple of weeks from bankruptcy as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked the Minister to allow the applications for structural adjustment relief to be reopened and for people affected to be able to reapply. It is within the Government's power to do that, and I think it would be a good way to do it. But so far this request has fallen on deaf ears. When it comes to wharfies who are sacked there is no problem in finding government money to give them $100,000 or $200,000 redundancy payments. When these little business people, through no fault of their own but through government incompetence, are put in this position, there is a way that they could be helped through the system, but the Government ignores them. Obviously if they had been union members or wharfies or something they would have got the money thrown at them, but because they are small businessmen, really down to their last cent, the Government is not interested. I do now urge, and will continue to urge, the Government to do something about them. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.14)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 February last the Senate resolved that there be laid on the table of the Senate on or before 5 March answers by three Ministers to questions which had been on notice for considerable periods in excess of the 30-day limit, together with an explanation for the delay in responding. Those answers were tabled by the respective Ministers on Tuesday last. I now wish to take the opportunity to comment briefly on the adequacy of the explanations given for the delay, because I do think it is time that we started to take the processes of the Senate more seriously than we have in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of answers were provided. I would like to deal with the answers tabled by Senator Bolkus in relation to two questions, the first of which was 97 days overdue and the second of which was 40 days overdue. Senator Bolkus-and I think in mitigation it can be said that Senator Bolkus was a captive of the Department of Mr Dawkins-says in his explanation:</PARA>
<PARA>I am assured by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training that Questions on Notice are dealt with as expeditiously as possible within his Department, having regard, of course, to the need to provide comprehensive answers to honourable Senators' questions. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not regard that as anything more than saying that we have an obligation to answer questions. He really has not addressed himself to the issue of why there was such an inordinate delay in respect of these two. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I note that, with regard to these Questions, each was asked towards the end of the last Sittings or early this year. Inevitably, there have been some administrative delays arising from the disruption to the Department's normal operations during December and January. </PARA>
<PARA>That is also pretty lame stuff. I trust that we are not going to be told that somehow the army of public servants advising the Minister are at their desks but not being paid or, alternatively, not at their desks and being paid. The fact of the matter is that there are staff available to attend to these matters at all times. One would have thought that the holiday period was relatively slack and would provide the perfect opportunity to have come up with the requisite answers, so I am not particularly impressed by that part of the explanation. Finally, the answer says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has further assured me that he and his Department will continue to accord the highest priority to the requirements of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>If we are going to have a continuation of the same, it is not good enough. I trust that what the Minister is saying is that in future his Department will accord the highest priority. I simply let the case rest in respect of those two answers and hope that the Minister will in fact be able to do better next time. </PARA>
<PARA> The next answer was tabled by Senator Cook on his own behalf. I must say that, in terms of relative culpability, Senator Cook was the least blameworthy and the most apologetic. His answer was a mere 40 days overdue. He said, in very humble terms:</PARA>
<PARA>At the outset I should state that I take my responsibility for answering questions on notice very seriously indeed. Processes are in place within my Department and my office to meet the deadline for answering questions set by the Senate, and in virtually all cases these work well. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably in this instance these processes failed, because of difficulty in assembling and clearing relevant data over the holiday period. My answer was provided to the Table Office on 22 February 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>That is no justification at all, because the resolution of the Senate was the day before. All that is really doing is admitting that once the balloon went up Senator Cook's office was able to deliver the goods within 24 hours. It clearly shows that if sufficient priority had been given to the matter it could have been provided a lot earlier. I say in general terms that Senator Cook does show a commendable acknowledgment of the importance of answering questions on time, and in effect pledges to do better in the future. On that basis, I am grateful for his response. </PARA>
<PARA> The final answers were provided by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) in respect of two questions, one of which was 47 days overdue and the second 35 days overdue. His explanations were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The preparation of the answer has taken longer than the 30 days set by the Senate because considerable time was required by the Department to establish the extent to which a detailed response could be provided. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is pure gobbledegook, saying that it took a long time because it took a long time. His second explanation was:</PARA>
<PARA>The provision of this answer took longer than 30 days because of the complex nature of the information.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I would have thought that absolutely no valid explanation was put forward in either of those two comments to justify the delay that was taken. Indeed, any competent government could already have asked itself last year the very questions to which answers were being sought. The Minister refers to:</PARA>
<PARA>the complex nature of the information required; particularly, the tabulated material in answer to question 4 relating to the results of the 1989/90 review of overseas-born pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA>If there is any point in doing the survey in the first place, it is in order to obtain the very material that I was asking for. I hope the Minister is not saying that the taxpayer has been put to all this expense to collate information, but nothing is done about it until other senators decide that they want to know the answers to certain questions. I do not regard those explanations as adequate, and I hope that the fact that Senator Richardson has chosen to give only a very cursory explanation does not indicate that he will not be pledging to do it a lot better in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to make brief mention of two other matters, one of which concerns Senator Richardson and the other Senator Button. During the August Estimates Committee hearings I submitted a question on notice to Committee C requesting all reports from consultants to the Department of Social Security. The request was not satisfied; the written response said simply that some reports provided by consultants are confidential. In the Committee of the Whole debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) on 13 November 1990, I again asked Senator Richardson for all the reports to the Department from consultants. The Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is no reason why something that is not confidential cannot be made available, and it will be. I undertake to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>So far nothing has been forthcoming despite a number of requests from my office, most recently a letter of 5 March 1991. Again I say to the Senate that if we are to be able to conduct the business of this chamber in a proper manner it is necessary for Ministers to honour the obligations that they have, particularly where a gratuitous undertaking is given as it was by Senator Richardson on 13 November. So I again ask that that material be provided as expeditiously as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button displayed a little more native cunning than others whose offices were contacted without satisfaction, because we have had a number of phone calls from Senator Button's office regarding two questions, Nos 318 and 363, explaining that answers were just around the corner and that if we could just be patient all would be well. Indeed, I had the pleasure of getting a letter from Senator Button to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, those two questions, answers to which are 77 and 63 days overdue respectively, have still not been answered despite repeated requests to the Minister's office. I again take this public opportunity to say-and I hope that in government we will measure up to the standards we are now setting-that it really is not good enough to promise to comply but then ultimately not comply. It is probably worse in many respects because it wastes a lot of time on phone calls and raises a lot of expectations. So, having said that, I trust that from now on we will see a much higher standard of response and a higher degree of promptness. I am sure that Senator McMullan will have much joy in conveying those sentiments to the respective Ministers. </PARA>

It may be a matter that you and the President might want to consider, without lifting it to too high a plane of significance. Senator Alston has given notice of a motion about the matter which he just discussed. There was nothing untoward about what he said and I took no objection to it, but I wonder whether it is procedurally appropriate for the continuing use of the debate on matters of public interest for discussion of matters on the Notice Paper.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. What action did the Government or the Minister instigate to prevent the closure of Australia's largest tin mine, located at Zeehan in Tasmania, because of the refusal of the Australian Workers Union, the Electrical Trades Union and the Australian Metal Workers Union to put the interests of the workers ahead of the interests of the union bosses? If the Government took no action, how does the Minister justify the Government's position to the 350 Tasmanians who have now lost their jobs? If the Government took action but failed, how does the Minister explain this further failure of the Government's disastrous industrial relations policy? What measures does the Government plan to take to provide alternative employment opportunities on the west coast of Tasmania?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just heard, prior to coming in for Question Time, about the lay-offs that are projected for Renison Ltd on the west coast of Tasmania. It is in that context that I note the question and observe that, to my knowledge, Renison has not contacted the Government directly to ask for our involvement. That being the case, some of the assumptions in the question about our having a responsibility in these circumstances cannot be supported. Indeed, if what Senator Calvert said in his question were true, I would expect in the normal course, and quite reasonably, that Renison would have contacted us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might also say that if matters of industrial action are involved and if this is the reason-and I do not concede in this answer that it necessarily is-remedies for resolving industrial matters are available to the parties. In the case of Renison, that is either, depending upon whether it is a State or a Federal award, through the auspices of the Tasmanian Industrial Relations Commission or the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Minister in his answer indicated that he had not had any contact from the employers. Since this matter has been going on for quite a few weeks, why has not the Minister been contacted by the union bosses or been advised by his advisers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1430" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The terms of the supplementary question are quite mystifying. To the best of my knowledge, no union official has contacted me about these issues either, and that is not surprising. The Opposition has an interventionist mentality in industrial relations. It believes that every time there is a dispute the Government should stick its big frame in and mess up the possibilities of the parties being able to resolve the matter between themselves. In the event of an industrial dispute, if the parties cannot settle it between themselves, and the onus is on them in the first instance to do that, there is resort to an umpire. That umpire is the industrial relations system. It works well in this country and should be used in the event of the parties not being able to agree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The element of the supplementary question which, frankly, I find mystifying is the intrinsic allegation that somehow or other my Department is advising union officials of what they should do in the conduct of a dispute. I think that is an extraordinary allegation to make and there is no foundation for it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answering this question, I would like to acknowledge the representations that I have received on this very serious problem from both Senator Sherry and Senator Archer. In fact, I had arranged meetings this afternoon with Senator Archer and, indeed, with Senator Sherry. I have some good news for them, so they can make up their minds whether they still want those meetings to go ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A serious problem arose just recently with the withdrawal of cargo centralisation arrangements which resulted in an increase of $1,000 per container for people in Tasmania. In addition, freight rates have been increased by approximately $800 per container against a base freight rate of approximately $7,200-that is, an increase of about 25 per cent-which caused a very serious problem for the dairy producers.</PARA>
<PARA> Following representations from both Senator Sherry and Senator Archer, I raised this matter with the Australian Peak Shippers Association against the background of the part X provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Part X deals with liner shipping services and, in particular, empowers the Australian Peak Shippers Association, which is the designated peak shipper body, to require the shipping conferences to negotiate such cost increases and to justify them.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the approach by the Australian Peak Shippers Association, the conferences concerned offered to reduce the freight rate by $1,000 per container during 1991 and waive the charge for the withdrawal of centralisation arrangements where the exporters use conference vessels when they call at Tasmanian ports. If Tasmanian dairy exporters can coordinate their shipments to take advantage of conference vessel calls, they will actually be paying $200 a container less than they paid in 1990. This should enhance the Tasmanian exporters' position in the North American market.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the major Tasmanian dairy exporters, not surprisingly, have accepted the revised offer by the shipping conferences. I would urge all Australian liner exporters and their associations to consider joining the Australian Peak Shippers Association and thereby take advantage of the safeguards which the Government has provided in part X of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>

It may be of information to Senator Crane to know that this is a dispute which, I understand, is over awards covered by the State jurisdiction in Victoria, the Victorian commission, rather than by the Federal commission and is thus more appropriately a dispute commented upon by the Victorian Minister, not by me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am asked how much money has been lost. I assume that that question relates to the loss of operational earnings by Heinz, those affected as suppliers of Heinz and the workers involved in the dispute. I do not have that figure to hand. I will see whether there is a figure available.</PARA>
<PARA> I am asked whether I endorse the tactics of the union. In the case of this dispute, the position is the same as in the case of every other dispute.

The appropriate government to consider action, if there was any, such as bringing the parties together outside the jurisdiction of the Commission to see whether there were grounds for reconciliation that had not succeeded within the jurisdiction of the Commission, is the Victorian Government, not ours. Senator Crane's question was leading to a question of the exercise of tort or laws of that nature. In the case of that type of approach, it is not my view that that approach in fact brings about a speedy resolution to the dispute. In fact, it is my view that that type of action extends and compounds the dispute, involves other parties that are not involved and puts matters of complex industrial concern beyond easy resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government has on many occasions demonstrated its commitment to assisting workers with family responsibilities to balance those responsibilities of their family and their working lives. One of the areas of particular concern to this Government has been to ensure the provision of accessible and good child-care. Last year the Government agreed to the introduction of work related childcare by public sector employees. These arrangements are part of the Government's goal to create 28,000 additional commercial and employer provided child-care places over the next five years, half of which are expected to be in the public sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The guidelines for child-care in the public sector have recently been clarified to ensure their full effectiveness. Under our policy, individual departments and agencies are responsible for determining what child-care arrangements will best suit their individual circumstances. As far as possible, agencies have been placed on the same footing as private sector employers by being allowed to subsidise child-care, if they choose to, from within their own budget, but without budget supplementation. A number of agencies are now investigating the possibility of sponsoring child-care for their employees.</PARA>
<PARA> A good example of where agencies are moving ahead with child-care is in the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). It has appointed a full time officer to handle its child-care implementation. The Australian Taxation Office has been investigating child-care since 1989 and has agreed informally with unions to five centre priorities in New South Wales and Victoria. The ATO has been operating a holiday care program in the Dandenong office since 1989 and is investigating other options such as joint ventures.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to all of that, there are investigations being carried out by departments and a number of statutory authorities and government business enterprises to actively develop work related child-care programs for themselves. For example, the new Australian Broadcasting Corporation buildings at Ultimo and Melbourne are expected to have provision for child-care. OTC is part of a joint facility in inner Sydney. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is establishing facilities at Black Mountain and North Ryde.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the issue of work related child-care in the Australian Public Service will undoubtedly be discussed at tomorrow's International Women's Day conference on women in the Australian Public Service. I look forward to hearing the views that arise from that conference, because I do think that they will be an important contribution to this subject.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer the Minister to his response to my question on 12 December last year in which he said that he would not be providing any additional support for voluntary welfare organisations despite the unprecedented increase in the number of people seeking help from such organisations. I also refer the Minister to an article in the Adelaide Advertiser of 5 March entitled `More need than cash in South Australia', in which South Australian welfare agencies reported that they were turning away more people than they were assisting because the incredible demand for financial help exceeded their resources. I ask: does the Minister acknowledge that the evidence from agencies such as those quoted in the Advertiser indicates that there are increasing numbers of Australians falling through the so-called welfare net for longer periods? Secondly, does the Minister acknowledge that the significant rise in unemployment is causing a great increase in demand for welfare agency services? Thirdly, where does the Minister suggest these people obtain help and assistance if such last resort agencies are not able to provide it? Finally, in view of the great demand on welfare agency services and the fact that they are unable to meet such demand, I ask the Minister again: if welfare agencies request assistance from the Government, is the Government willing to change its mind and provide additional financial support to them to enable them to cope with the human consequences of this recession?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a long question, and I think that I have got down some parts of it. I understand that in the first part of the question I am asked: does the fact that voluntary agencies in South Australia have reported increasing numbers visiting their premises mean that more people are falling through the social security net? I think the phrase that Senator Lees used was something similar to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, there is no question that unemployment has been increasing. I have been asked that question in this place quite a number of times and have said so. I do not believe, however, that that means an increasing number of people fall through the net. It is a pretty comprehensive social security net as it stands. It is available for those who are unemployed and, quite obviously, looking at the increased numbers of those on unemployment benefits, it is a net that people are increasingly using. Of course, that does not mean that those who are given the benefits of that social security net are necessarily living on a bed of roses. Clearly, many of them-particularly those thrown out of work in recent times-are in debt and are having--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a different question; I am trying to answer Senator Lees. Those people, particularly those who find themselves in debt and the unemployed, who are receiving a significant cut in their income will find life very difficult. Many of them have turned to welfare agencies. That is the role which welfare agencies have always fulfilled. In every developed country in the world those welfare agencies are there for that very purpose. If one were to go to the United Kingdom or the United States at the moment, one would find them in much greater use than they are here. With the significant rise in unemployment and people being turned away from these welfare agencies, where will they go? Those who are finding themselves unemployed, those Australians without work, are able to avail themselves of the social security net. I hope that they will continue to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I cannot pretend to Senator Lees that people who are becoming unemployed will not be going through hardship. Quite obviously many of them will, and that is something that no-one in this country can be happy about.</PARA>
<PARA> Will I do anything about a request from welfare agencies if I were to receive one? I certainly think if the welfare agencies come to me and quantify what they consider a need to be, I would be more than happy to talk with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer about the possibility of meeting that need. Quite obviously we would not simply turn our backs on them, not give them a hearing, and then not consider what they put to us. But, as yet-I cannot speak for my colleagues Mr Howe and Mr Staples-I am not certain whether welfare agencies have made requests of them. So far I have not had any requests for increases in welfare assistance along the lines that Senator Lees has suggested.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to advise the Senate that following proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission today the parties to the Container Terminals Australia Ltd (CTAL) agreement in Sydney-that is, Conaust and the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF)-have reached agreement in principle for the agreement at CTAL in Sydney. The parties, again by agreement, have established a working group and have given a commitment that they will tie up outstanding details of the agreement, the final drafting of the agreement, by the end of this month and will transmit that to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority which has to approve the final agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The significance of the proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission this morning is that the resolution of this agreement in Sydney paves the way for resolution of the outstanding issues in a large number of Conaust enterprise agreements in ports around Australia, including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Fremantle, Adelaide and my home port of Darwin. This will significantly increase the momentum of waterfront reform.</PARA>
<PARA> For the advice of the Senate, on Sunday 374 workers will leave the National Terminals company, a further 64 workers will leave the company at the end of this month, and 13 workers have already left employment in the port of Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA> This process was done by agreement. I stress that it was done not by the arbitration proceedings in the Commission but by the conciliation processes of the Commission in two meetings, and was reached by agreement of the parties. That is important in terms of the extraordinarily negative and damaging non-stop attacks that are continuing to be made by the Opposition on the union, the Waterside Workers Federation, in this process.</PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to correct the record because it is important to do so. The shadow Minister for shipping and waterfront reform, John Sharp, has concluded what is so far an unbroken record in issuing public statements that contain factual nonsense in his latest effort. It is important to correct the record.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sharp issued a press release last night once again attacking the WWF, predicting that the proceedings in the Commission today would be a disaster because the WWF would not agree. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Conaust had to go outside the Government's waterfront reform process in order to get results . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In the final paragraph, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The AIRC direction is a significant step-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the only accurate thing he said-</PARA>
<PARA>taken quite outside the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority ambit.</PARA>
<PARA>It is entirely within the process. This is the document, the in principle agreement, that lays out the detail of the process. Mr Sharp really has no excuse for his ignorance because the provisions for the involvement of the Commission are found on page one of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Commonwealth intervened in these proceedings before the Commission to assist the parties in reaching this resolution. We urge them again-I know them; they will-to achieve a speedy end to the final drafting processes that they have agreed on in the Commission today. Captain Richard Setchell has applauded the agreement as being a very significant step towards reform of the waterfront. The reason I say that is that when this process is successfully concluded it will not be due to any of the efforts of John Sharp or indeed me; it will be due entirely to the commitment of the parties to deliver the commitments they gave to the reform process at the beginning of it.</PARA>

SPC is an employer which employs workers covered by more than one union. Where that is the case, the Trades Hall or the regional Trades and Labour Council is the place at which the collective view of all of those unions is sorted out and dealt with when one employer is seeking one answer from the lot and the same answer from all of them. That is a quite legitimate role. SPC was pleased to be able to have a one stop shop in which it could discuss all of its issues with the unions concerned. So there is no illegitimate role in that case.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not saying that at all, and I wish that Senator Hill, as a lawyer who claims to be knowledgeable about the law, would learn a bit about industrial relations law. What I am saying is that, where an employer wants an answer from a collective group of unions, those unions are convened, in order to find their collective view, by the central council-in this case, the Trades and Labour Council. If it is a national case, it is the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That is what happened on this occasion, and it suits the convenience of the unions and the employers that that occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not intervention. That is not outside participation in the dispute. That is consistent with how the industrial relations model works. In this case, I underline yet again, because clearly the message is not understood, the SPC case was settled by agreement between all the parties after it was conciliated on by Commissioner Donaldson of the Industrial Relations Commission over the Christmas period, and the workers at SPC voted for that package and strongly supported it. That is a package which settles the issues in that plant, and I am pleased to see that that plant since then has been enjoying better levels of productivity than it otherwise might have done.</PARA>

The Government, also within the spirit of national cooperation and achievement with the States, has recognised the importance of moving towards flexibility in recognition of handwriting styles as well. However, the focal point that we have achieved is the establishment of the national curriculum collaboration in Australia. We have also recognised and launched the national project on the quality of teaching and learning. As I say, that is the record so far.

The Government's commitment to tackling the greenhouse threat is clearly demonstrated in its announcement of an initial package to reduce emissions under this national greenhouse response strategy within a fortnight of the decision to adopt the interim planning target. This package includes the development of an energy conservation information kit, which will be distributed to every household in Australia. Energy efficiency in residential and commercial buildings will be promoted through demonstration programs and the development of building codes. The Commonwealth itself will lead by way of example in upgrading energy management in its own operations. This program is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 14.2 million tonnes each year. The ecologically sustainable development working groups are in the process of examining options for achieving the target to reduce emissions cost effectively.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to energy efficiency and conservation measures, the working groups are looking at the use of solar, wind and other renewable sources of energy so that we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. I did agree with the expert's statement that we could do much more by using our incredible resource, namely the sun, which Australia seems to get more of than many other nations. In addition, the Government has directed the Industry Commission to perform an inquiry to examine ways in which industry can achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions consistent with the target. The Government is also supporting a number of research projects on energy production and usage technology as well as the potential of sinks to reduce net emissions. The Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology has carried out an extensive inquiry. Its report, released in January, has made a number of helpful recommendations on ways that we might reduce emissions. All that would lead us to believe that, far from being an empty promise, it is one which the Government takes seriously and is well on the way to implementing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is it a fact that, contrary to the outburst by the honourable senator in the chamber yesterday, there is no continuity in payment for Austudy but rather payments are backdated and that in 1991 the minimum period for students to survive without any income support was 9 days, and that was for people with access to bank accounts on a Saturday? Is the Minister aware that some students who applied for Austudy in November and December 1990 are still awaiting payment and that in 1990 students who were eligible for Austudy were without any income support for up to four months between consecutive years of study? Is the Minister also aware that, according to an internal document of the Department of Social Security dated 19 February 1991, that Department has identified many students who face acute financial crisis until payment of Austudy in the new academic year? Is the Minister concerned that the Department of Social Security has turned away students, refusing them any income support on the basis that they are eligible for Austudy, and then referred those students to welfare relief agencies? What will the Minister do to provide continuing and intending students with financial support before the start of the academic year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the basis of the information supplied to me and provided to the Senate yesterday, the answer to the first part of the question is no. In respect of those students who applied in November and in December last year and are waiting, I made mention of the fact yesterday that the Government has set, through the centres involved, goals for achieving turnarounds for applications for Austudy. Those goals have been surpassed by a pretty impressive percentage amount. Those goals provide for a turnaround within 21 days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know, and nor would I be expected to know, of the internal document of the Department of Social Security. However, I said yesterday-and I repeat today-that if there are students with financial difficulties and for whom there is financial urgency, then there is the capacity for payment through counter cheques at the access centres. I recommend that process, which is obviously there to ensure that the sorts of people whom Senator Bell is concerned about have their needs met. If there is a specific case, Senator Bell should put that to me, preferably by correspondence. I am sure he has a supplementary question. I hope I will be able to answer that as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I can certainly satisfy the Minister; I have a supplementary question. I think that the Minister said that there were goals which had been met by the Department. I heard him describe the goals yesterday as being a response within a certain number of days. My question is: does that response include payment or is it merely an acknowledgment of the application? What use is the goal if it is only to respond but not make a payment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The usefulness of the goal is to ensure that about 80 per cent of applicants receive initial response to an application within 21 days. In terms of the payment, the important part of my response yesterday was that there is capacity for those in financial urgency to have that need met in a very quick and direct way with the over-the-counter cheque facility. When we are talking about an 80 per cent or a 90 per cent achievement of a 21 days response to applications, some people do not have those applications responded to within that period. There are obviously reasons for that which go to aspects such as valuation, processing and a checking out. However, I go back to the point I mentioned earlier: for those in dire financial need there is a very quick and direct facility.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health give an assurance that the new Medicare card to be introduced this May will not have to be presented at a pharmacy now or at any time in the future in order to qualify for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall that Senator Boswell asked some questions along these lines before Christmas. It has to be recognised that the Government decided that the Medicare card should play a role in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme as a result largely of indications from the Auditor-General's reports that that particular scheme was subject to fraudulent activity and that there needed to be a method of ensuring that those who took the benefits of the scheme were entitled to the very considerable subsidies offered to other Australians through the tax system to enable them to have access to drugs which are prescribed for them at a reasonable cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the question of the presentation of a Medicare card, I think I also emphasised before Christmas that in a sense this is more for the protection of the pharmacist, the dispensing chemist, than for the person presenting the prescription for it to be filled. In other words, the pharmacist has to make a judgment as to whether the person is well enough known to him or her to enable the pharmacist to take the risk in relation to dispensing the medicine at a particular rate of benefit; in other words, at a particular rate of subsidy. The pharmacist then seeks to be reimbursed. It is the dispensing pharmacist who needs to satisfy himself or herself that the person claiming the concession is eligible for it. That is to ensure that the pharmacist is reimbursed under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> As I think I also pointed out before Christmas, most local pharmacists have a very good working knowledge of the range of pensioners or other persons entitled to a benefit who come regularly to their pharmacies. There will be no need for a special check in that particular instance. The reissued Medicare card will be a convenient way for pharmacists to establish their customers' eligibility for concessional pharmaceuticals if they are in any doubt. It will not be compulsory to use a Medicare card if people can satisfy their pharmacist of their identify or eligibility in some other way.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell asked about the issue number and made it appear that that was a new requirement of the reissued Medicare cards. Just before coming into the Senate for Question Time, I looked at the Medicare card of a member of my staff. The current Medicare cards have the issue number on them. There are three blocks of numbers on the current Medicare card. The final single numeral on the card-in this case, in the name of the member of my staff-indicates whether this is the fourth time on which the Medicare card has been issued, as opposed to the third time. The reason for that is that if it is alleged that the card has been stolen or lost, that fact is punched into the computer alongside the issue number of the card. If that card is presented and the issue number comes up-for example No. 3, lost or stolen-it would be clear that a person without an entitlement to present that card has been making or attempting to make use of it. So, the issue number is already on the Medicare card. It is a very important protection and will simply be maintained with the reissued card.</PARA>

I have just spoken to my learned medical colleague, Dr Herron, and he tells me that at the moment the Medicare card has only one number on it.

But certainly there will be nothing which would be a cause of concern to the Privacy Commissioner, Kevin O'Connor, who has endorsed this new arrangements and, in fact, whose advice was taken in relation to this reissue of the Medicare card. He has endorsed the changes to the card and, I believe, in his endorsement lies the security of those who are concerned in these matters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health. I draw the Minister's attention to two issues regarding AIDS, both recently highlighted in the media. The first issue involves a proposal from Western Australia for compulsory testing for HIV AIDS of all blood samples taken in that State. Secondly, I raise the results of a recent survey which claimed that there was an increase in support for the quarantining of people with HIV AIDS in Australia. Could the Minister advise the Senate whether it is intended to compulsorily quarantine people with HIV AIDS and whether the Government intends to fund compulsory testing for AIDS.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Foreman for his question which arises out of a proposal, I believe, of the Opposition spokesman on health in Western Australia, Mr Kevin Minson, who suggested that all blood samples should be tested for HIV indications. That would be a wasteful, irresponsible and an unnecessary response to the question of HIV and AIDS in the community and reveals a depth of ignorance about the disease and its transmission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been estimated that the cost of implementing Mr Minson's proposal would run into many tens of millions of dollars, as hundreds of thousands of blood samples collected would have to be subjected to the particular tests in laboratories that he suggests. In Western Australia only 109 cases of AIDS and 581 cases of the HIV infection have been reported-about 0.3 per cent of the population. So honourable senators can see that the proposal is out of all proportion to the problem evidenced in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Foreman also asked about quarantining those who are carriers of HIV or who are suffering the AIDS disease. The fact is that there is some community concern about isolating or quarantining those who suffer from this disease. This is unfortunate as I believe that it reveals that many in the community are still very ignorant about the way in which this disease is transmitted.</PARA>
<PARA> In June 1990 a survey commissioned by the Government found that over a six-month period in 1990 approximately one in four Australians supported the idea of isolating people with AIDS. I believe that that is a reflection of the fact that so many Australians are still not aware that HIV is not highly infectious and is only transmitted in very specific ways.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that education efforts are paying off. But much more needs to be done. Only this week an article in the British medical journal, Lancet, commended Australia for its strategy on AIDS. The way in which that education program can allay prejudice and discrimination against people with HIV is to be commended but obviously it needs to be reinforced.</PARA>

I refer to the Minister's answer to Senator Schacht at Question Time on 13 February and to the Minister's past determination to keep on asserting that his comprehensive settlement is the only hope for peace in Cambodia which, on 13 February, the Minister said is `inching forward'. I ask: how can he possibly consider such a settlement to be `still well in sight' when he admitted on 13 February that three significant issues-the demobilisation provisions, the weapons custody arrangements and the acknowledgment of past genocide-are still unresolved? Is the Minister prepared to consider moves by the Hun Sen Administration to hold elections in Cambodia so long as they are genuinely on a fair and open multiparty basis? Now that Australia has normalised relations with China, what new initiative is the Australian Government taking in discussion with China to advance a solution for the Cambodian people?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, including genocide because there is a particular formula on the table which involves a forward looking reference rather than a backward looking reference. It is our judgment that, on the basis of conversations we continue to have with all the relevant parties, at the end of the day-although not before a round table conference is finally convened-we believe that that issue will be capable of resolution. That is a judgment not just based on instinct-it is a judgment based on a lot of knowledge and a lot of discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do propose to keep pressing forward for the comprehensive settlement solution even though it is, as I have recently described it in a letter to the press, an achingly, frustratingly slow business. We take this view simply because of our continued very strong belief that it is the only way to bring to an end the protracted and tragic civil war in Cambodia; because, I will repeat, in our judgment and that, indeed, of all the other players, including the United Nations key countries, that is the only way that China will be persuaded to withdraw its support, including in particular its support of arms materiel for the Khmer Rouge. It will only be persuaded to do so in the context of the comprehensive settlement where the neutrality of Cambodia is internationally guaranteed and there is no prospect of the country coming again under the hegemonic influence, as people like to describe it, of Vietnam. That is China's traditional strategic concern for the region. That is why China has taken the course that it has, not out of any particular love or affection for the Khmer Rouge, and it is that that can only be addressed by the kind of comprehensive settlement we are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA> Any one-sided solution which seeks to recognise and arm and equip the Government of Phnom Penh to deal with the Khmer Rouge threat simply misunderstands the significance of that external support for the Khmer Rouge and misunderstands the necessity to break the nexus of that external support which can only be done under a comprehensive settlement.</PARA>
<PARA> We are continuing to plug away. Mr Costello, as has been indicated in some press reports, is presently in the region and talking again, as I have been talking regularly, to the co-chairman of the Paris conference, Ali Alatas. He is hoping to go to Hanoi and Phnom Penh within the next few days to engage further in discussions on this. Certainly, we are still talking very directly to China. I have taken the opportunity with several recent high level visitors to express certain views on how the matter might be resolved. We genuinely believe it is capable of resolution.</PARA>
<PARA> There are no new particular initiatives that we are presently contemplating. It is just a matter of trying to keep the attention of the major players engaged-it has obviously been distracted by the Gulf war-and to move the process forward in the way that I have indicated.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the final point of the honourable senator's question of course we cannot guarantee that the Khmer Rouge will not play some kind of role in a post-settlement Cambodia if it is successful in a free and fair election conducted on a level playing field by a United Nations supervised administration. If the people of Cambodia, under those circumstances, are prepared to entrust the Khmer Rouge with some share of power in a democracy so constituted, then I do not honestly believe that it is for us or for anyone else to second guess that.</PARA>
<PARA> What the whole present United Nations plan is about, however, is avoiding a situation which was a flaw in the original peace proposals circulating a year or more ago. We want to avoid the situation where the Khmer Rouge is given a share of executive power as part of some transitional arrangement without earning it at the ballot box in a properly supervised election. So that is the basis on which, despite all the systematic disinformation which continues to be peddled by Mr Pilger and others who are impressed by him, we continue to press for the United Nations peace plan.</PARA>

However, it does not follow from that that that is a credible alternative solution to the whole problem of Cambodia or something that in itself will necessarily advance or assist the process of bringing to an end the civil war, for all the reasons I have just indicated; because the Khmer Rouge will continue to be supplied externally-in particular by the Chinese, for the reasons I have indicated-and the Khmer Rouge simply will not be prepared, I believe, to foreswear the military option simply because the Phnom Penh Government conducts some kind of internal election. It is an attractive option. It does move the process forward in some ways, in terms of conferring additional legitimacy, but it does not address the basic nub of the tragic problem of Cambodia.

<PARA>QUEENSLAND'S SHARE OF HIGHER EDUCATION GROWTH</PARA>
<PARA>In allocating growth among the States and Territories, the Commonwealth takes account of a range of factors, including current levels of participation and unmet demand, and projected further demand associated with population growth and increasing Year 12 enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA>Having considered these factors, the Commonwealth has recognised Queensland's case for a share of growth above its population share. This is also the case for some other States.</PARA>
<PARA>The growth allocations provided to Queensland by the Commonwealth are such that Queensland will receive 25% of all additional intakes in 1991 and 23% over 1991-93, well above its population share of 17%.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1990 the higher education participation rate was slightly below the national rate: 39 per thousand 17-64 year olds compared with 40 per thousand nationally.</PARA>
<PARA>There are other States, notably NSW, which have the same or lower participation rates than Queensland: NSW's rate was 37 per thousand, Tasmania's 34 per thousand, South Australia's and the Northern Territory's both 39 per thousand.</PARA>
<PARA>It is estimated that, on 1990 figures, an additional 13,200 students would have been required to bring NSW, Queensland, South Australia, and the Northern Territory to the 1990 national rate. In particular, NSW would have needed 9,800-students, compared with 1,300 in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>The level of unmet demand in Queensland was estimated by the AVCC at 3,300-4,800, well down on the 1989 figure (4,000-5,900). The AVCC's estimates of 1990 unmet demand for NSW and Victoria were 3,700-5,400 and 4,200-6,300 respectively, both higher than in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>The proportion of Queensland secondary school students proceeding directly to higher education in 1990 was 25.1%, above the National figure of 23.1%, and higher than any other State or Territory, except the ACT. In NSW the transition rate was 21.6%, below both the Queensland and the national figure.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth considered in detail the case for growth in each State and Territory in coming to its decisions on the allocation of 1993 growth (reported in its recently released Higher Education Funding for the 1991-1993 Triennium).</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth consulted closely with the States as part of this process, through the Joint Planning Committees which exist for each State and Territory, and it would be quite inappropriate for the Commonwealth to be dealing separately with Queensland, outside the normal process.</PARA>

<PARA> In the case of Renison Ltd, I can say that I am disappointed that Renison has decided to close its tin mine in Tasmania and regret the severe economic consequences of the decision. Renison's decision follows a long term deterioration in the tin market and continuing losses incurred by tin producers. Renison's mine is the world's largest underground tin mine, and the company produces 90 per cent of Australia's output of tin concentrates. Falling tin prices led the company to put forward a restructuring package involving a lower operating level, a reduction in the size of the work force and an erosion of working conditions at the mine. This plan was rejected by the work force. Renison has had difficulties in the past in gaining access to high grade tin deposits in Tasmania because of what it cites as environmental considerations. This may have been a contributing factor to the financial difficulties of the mine. Renison has advised that the mine will be placed on a care and maintenance basis and it will review costs and the market situation if this justifies a decision to reopen the mine.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; At Question Time today I was asked a question by Senator Winston Crane about the dispute at the Heinz company plant in Victoria. I can supplement my answer by saying two strikes stopped production from 22 February to 4 March at the Heinz food canning plant at Dandenong, Victoria. The first dispute involved 400 members of the Food Preservers Union who stopped work over the dismissal of two employees. The matters went before Commissioner Donaldson of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Government believes that the Commission was the appropriate forum to deal with the issues in dispute. The striking members met on 4 March and voted to accept a proposal negotiated between the parties last weekend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second strike involved 80 members of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union (AMWU) over the matter of a long running demarcation issue with the Electrical Trades Union (ETU). The matter came before Commissioner Peterson of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on 6 March and was adjourned into private conference. The AMWU and the ETU have agreed to hold further discussions on the matter which has been relisted for further hearing on 18 March. All striking workers returned to work on 5 March.</PARA>
<PARA> The other element of that question was a question of costs. I have no estimate that I can vouch for. I can say, though, that Heinz has estimated that it has lost $9m in sales, and growers and transport operators have lost $1m, and that striking workers have forfeited half a million dollars in lost wages.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answering my question last Tuesday about whether Department of Social Security regional offices were giving correct information to clients about the relevance of the deeming rules to beneficiaries other than pensioners, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) claimed that my office's survey which found that 15 of 31 Social Security regional offices were giving inaccurate information about this matter was not a fair survey of Social Security. Yesterday this was reported in the national media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This cast doubt on the accuracy of the staff of my office, the survey in particular, and me. The Minister, in doing so, failed to recognise that a similar survey by the welfare rights unit, conducted in New South Wales earlier this week, also found that more than 50 per cent of the 22 regional offices contacted were unaware that the deeming rules applied to sickness benefits. Nine of the 22 offices incorrectly claimed that the deeming rules did not apply to sickness benefits, whilst three offices were unsure whether they did or not. This second survey, in conjunction with my own survey, conclusively showed that the client contact officers in social security regional offices are not aware of the applicability of the deeming provisions to beneficiaries. I ask that the Minister put his own house in order before he casts aspersions on mine. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA>(a) notes that Senator Vallentine disrupted debate yesterday in the House of Representatives by shouting abuse from the Senator's gallery; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) calls on Senator Vallentine to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) apologise to the Speaker of the House of Representatives for her improper and unparliamentary behaviour in disrupting a most serious debate in that chamber on a matter of vital concern to all Australians-</PARA>
<PARA>We remember that it was the Gulf war debate-</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) apologise to the Senate for behaviour bringing the Senate into disrepute, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) undertake as a Senator to abide by the principles of bicameral parliamentary democracy in which the elected representatives of the people are entitled to participate in debate without harassment or intimidation from the public galleries. </PARA>
<PARA>Today, almost two months after that event, Senator Vallentine submitted a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives which has just been tabled in that House. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Leo,</PARA>
<PARA> I write concerning an incident in the House of Representatives on Mon. 21st Jan. 1990 whilst the Prime Minister was delivering a statement on the Gulf War. </PARA>
<PARA> My interjection, from the Senators' bench in the gallery, was not a planned action; it was straight from the heart, as I strongly oppose Australia's involvement in the war with every fibre of my being. </PARA>
<PARA> However, that does not excuse my interjection from that place of privilege-</PARA>
<PARA>with which I think all senators would agree-</PARA>
<PARA>and I apologise for any difficulty you or the gallery attendants experienced then or later, caused by my action. It was not my intention to embarrass you as Speaker, and I'm sorry about that aspect of the incident. </PARA>
<PARA> With best wishes,</PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA> Jo Vallentine. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of that apology, I am withdrawing my notice of motion. However, I must say this about the apology; it is belated and clearly grudging and, to my mind, does not really meet the requirements of good taste and discretion and the responsibilities of a senator. Nonetheless, it is a recognition that her interjection from a place of privilege could not be excused by her strong feelings on this matter, but I do express concern that, in effect, the apology is really to Mr Speaker and to the gallery attendants rather than the House of Representatives. But if that suits the House of Representatives, that is its business. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also disappointed that Senator Vallentine chose to do this simply by writing a letter to the Speaker without referring the matter in any way to this chamber to which, by the way, I believe she owes an apology, and did not have the courtesy to take this chamber into her confidence or to deal with us in a proper way despite the existence on the Notice Paper of this notice of motion dealing with her improper behaviour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The impact of the economic mismanagement of the Hawke Labor Government on Australian women is surely a matter of national importance because that impact has been both massive and appalling. Tomorrow, this Government has the hide to plan to celebrate International Women's Day. Some celebration! One might ask: what do the women of Australia have to celebrate tomorrow? When one looks at the importance this Government places on women, one has only got to start looking at the importance it places on this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is not one Minister going to take part in this debate. Although we have got the Minister responsible for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) and we even have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), all of whom have portfolio responsibilities in which women are extremely interested. But not one of those honourable senators has seen fit to place importance on this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It says something, I think, for the importance which they place on women, and I think it also says something for the shame they have for their mismanagement of the economy and, thereby, its disastrous impact on Australian women and, as well, of course, on Australian men. It is the sisterhood which is taking part in this debate, the troika of sisters in this chamber from the Left who march in on every debate every time there is anything to do with women. But we cannot see the Government, which is responsible for the mess, being prepared to take part in the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it is. Senator Brownhill will discuss the problems being faced by women in the bush. There is a disastrous situation in the bush now for men and women directly caused by this Government's mismanagement of the economy, directly as a result of its policies, and women in the bush are worried, and worried sick. They are lacking supportive services that they need as a matter of urgency. It is a disaster in the bush. If there were a national disaster anywhere else the Government would be looking to see what measures it could put in place. But is it interested in putting support services in for these families, for these women in the bush? No. Senator Brownhill will be discussing that matter in detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Reid will be looking at the problems being faced by older women in our community; the very serious problems of the women who are ageing and in poverty. She will be looking also at those mothers who are trying to support children on their own. It is a disastrous situation for those women in poverty traps in our society, because it is women who are bearing the brunt of the social fallout caused by the Federal Government's economic mismanagement. As the job market declines, as it tightens and the economic climate declines, women are being affected not only financially but they are also being affected in their health, their emotional needs, and ultimately those things take their toll on the family, even to the extent of the awesome and horrible announcement today by the Preterm Foundation in Surry Hills in New South Wales of the massive increase in abortions for married women. The executive officer of that foundation was saying how they have seen a 31 per cent increase in abortions by women because, as she said:</PARA>
<PARA> They can't afford to lose their income. </PARA>
<PARA>She also said:</PARA>
<PARA> They can't afford to keep a roof over their head if they lose their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>For women now jobs are not an idle distraction. If they ever were, they certainly are not now. They are a vital necessity in keeping their family's mortgage going; in keeping the food bills paid; in getting shoes for their children; and it is absolutely critical to these women that they maintain their employment. Pregnancy messes up all their plans and it causes them to totally face disaster. So these women-married women-who are wanting to have their own children, who are sad to have to queue up for an abortion, are going down to ask for an abortion. What more terrible condemnation can we have of this Government's mismanagement of the economy that married women in Australia are being forced to this situation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hon. Prime Minister, Mr Robert Hawke. I accept your rebuke, Mr Acting Deputy President. We will give him all the deference to which his office is due. He is singing a different song now when he is the one who is presiding over these awful figures. In January this year also there were 305,000 Australian women who wanted a job and could not get either a full or a part time one. That is up from 239,300 at the same time last year. I ask: what do those women have to celebrate on International Women's Day?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From 1983 to 1990, the number of women receiving sole parent pension rose by 9.8 per cent. Is that something to crow about? I suppose the sisterhood will probably crow that it is marvellous that there is a pension there for them to get. I would say it is terrible that they should need it. They would much rather be in work and that is what we should be trying to provide. But this Government has failed to provide it entirely. </PARA>
<PARA> Let it not be forgotten that the President of the Australian Council of Social Service, Mrs Merle Mitchell, has told us that by the middle of the year more than one million Australians, including nearly a quarter of a million children, will be dependent on unemployment benefit-something to crow about there, I imagine, from the sisterhood. I will leave Senator Reid to talk about the poverty traps, the sole parents and the number of women who are being assisted, if at all, through the jobs, education and training program for sole parents (JET) interviews. Only 5.3 per cent of the sole parent pensioner population actually received JET interviews last year. Yet we continue to hear about the JET scheme from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at housing affordability. In 1988, people living in Melbourne used 25.7 per cent of their average family income to pay off their home. In 1989, it had gone up to 34.2 per cent. The Government tries to claim that interest rates have come down and that things are a lot better. It should ask people who were paying 32.6 per cent of their income in 1990 whether they are feeling much difference. I would say they are still feeling the pain. In Sydney the figure has gone from 31.7 per cent of the average family income in 1988 to 41.1 per cent in 1989. It has gone up to 42.2 per cent this last year, in the September quarter. So much for interest rates coming down. People are still, in fact, desperately strapped for cash when it comes to keeping a roof over their head. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I think you will be interested to find that only this week the Tasmanian Minister for Community Services, Mrs Judy Jackson, acknowledged that some women in our State are paying up to 75 per cent of their income in rent. Is that something to celebrate? It is no wonder women cannot afford to have babies. </PARA>

When it comes to inflation, let me give the Australian Labor Party a few more clues because obviously its Ministry is out of touch. Inflation has been running at 8 per cent in 1989-90 and it will be well over the 6.5 per cent that the Government predicated for this year. The cost of living is putting ever more pressure on women who are juggling the family budget. All those women outside know that every word I say is true. I want to give some more figures. I hope honourable senators will bear with me because they are pretty appalling sorts of figures. I have the figures for some food items for 1983 and this year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans may not be aware that many Australian families are living on baked beans. It is their only hope of getting cheap protein in this country-short of cat food, I suppose. Strawberry jam has gone up 78 per cent. Laundry detergent has gone from $2.49 to $5.09 for a kilo-that is, 104 per cent. Are they going to be the great unwashed poor in Australia, or just the poor? The price of a loaf of white bread has gone from 83c to $1.41-that is, an increase of 70 per cent-and a litre of petrol has gone from 48.1c to 69.7c. In all this time the average weekly wage has grown by 75.6 per cent-that is, from the time this Government came into office until now. That is what those battling Australian families are trying to cope with. This Government, the sisterhood and the absent Ministers cackle and think it is all so very funny. But I tell them they are out of touch and the Australian people know exactly how hard it is to make ends meet, even if they do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is causing stress-related problems. Doctors are saying that they are seeing increasing numbers of stress-related illnesses, they are seeing marital breakdowns, they are being called in with child abuse and domestic violence and they are being involved in alcoholism. Surely to goodness honourable senators know that is true. A counselling agency in my home State only this week reported that it expects a 100 per cent increase in suicide calls this year. Mr Peter O'Sullivan from Lifelink in Launceston said that those calls are from people contemplating, threatening or actually in the process of suicide. It normally takes them about three or four hours to counsel people on those calls. Mr O'Sullivan said:</PARA>
<PARA>We've had 59 of those already this financial year and if they continue to come in at this rate we'll see a 100 per cent increase this year on last. What we deal with at Lifelink is only the tip of the iceberg. </PARA>
<PARA>Those on the Government benches may laugh, but it is a terribly serious matter. We know that small businesses around this country are going to the wall. Bankruptcies, to the September quarter, were reporting an increase on the same quarter of the previous year. They have been up 32.7 per cent and 56 per cent in the last quarters of the year. Almost one-third of all small businesses are owned and run by women in Australia because, as we know only too well, that is the one place where they can get some flexibility in hours and conditions of employment. It is probable that some hundreds of small businesswomen will go to the wall this year in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Why are they going to the wall? They are going to the wall because of high overdraft interest rates particularly, because their customers do not have the money to spend any more-they are either unemployed or they are worried they will become unemployed and they dare not spend the money. That is the reality of Australia today, all around the suburbs and the country towns. That is what is happening to small businesses and their customers. The overdraft rates that they were paying may have come down from the 23, 24 and 25 per cent that they were paying a year or so ago; they may be only 20 per cent. I say `only' with heavy irony because those who are trying to keep a business going with an overdraft of 20 per cent today are destined for disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Mandrake Keating does not seem to have any magic wand left. The magic dust is certainly not clouding the eyes of Australians any longer, certainly not those of women, who are essentially practical. The magic has worn off and there are no rabbits for him to pull out of the hat any more. He thinks he is a wizard, but unfortunately we all know the worst. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should also be condemned for the way it has managed its own work force. I have time only to give a couple of examples. The second annual report of the Australian Women's Employment Strategy finds that the relative proportion of women in male dominated occupations remained largely unchanged between 1986 and 1990, with women only about 20 per cent as likely as men to be employed in male dominated occupations. Within the Australian Public Service, the percentage of women in decision making positions remains low. Women greatly outnumber men at the lower end of the salary scale. Last month the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-and I am glad we have Senator Evans here, to make sure he remembers this-was publicly criticised as one of the worst performers in the Public Service in terms of equal opportunities, with a disproportionate representation of women at lower levels of responsibility and salary and no increase in the percentage of women in the Senior Executive Service in his Department since at least 1987. What does the Minister do or care about that? I am glad he is at least here to listen. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus might be here to listen, too. It is a pity he is not. Nine Comcar drivers were appointed in his home State of South Australia to replace those Comcar drivers who were made redundant at great cost--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Crowley wants the figures, that 36 per cent of women in superannuation funds includes those who are only on the Government's measly 3 per cent awards which it imposed on small business-not genuine superannuation schemes, but those pretend schemes designed to give the Government's union mates economic power. When the Government tries to copy our proposals to give women the opportunity to opt out of work and save their superannuation entitlements while they are having babies, what does it do? It restricts their opportunity to keep their superannuation funds going for two years, so as soon as one has a terrible two-year-old-a toddler-one is meant to go back to employment and leave him to somebody else, regardless of one's own wishes, because one is supposed to get back into work and save one's superannuation. How uncaring and impractical is that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could spend a lot of time talking about what the Government has not done or has done inadequately in the area of health, and it is appropriate really because of the problems caused to women's health by economic pressures. I do not have time to spend on this now, but one wonders why the Government is failing to speed up the availability of hormonal replacement therapy for women. It is frustrating for those working in the field and it is unfair. So much for the squawking on the other side. I am sure that Senator Crowley will love saying something about this, but the fact remains that these women are waiting for this care and cannot get it. A senior Health Department official is challenging the legality of providing funding for the National Women's Health Strategy on the grounds that it is discriminatory. Who is in control of this Government? Perhaps it is not the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe); perhaps it is the bureaucracy. One way or another the Government must wear the responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the Government even has Medicare turning women doctors into second-class citizens because of the lower level of rebates that many women are now being forced to accept with the new arrangements with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. That is all part of the Government's mismanagement of the economy. I could go into many other matters, had I the time. My colleagues will cover many more of the areas. </PARA>
<PARA> This country could be great; it should be great; people in Australia want it to be great. And yet what has happened? We have people worried sick about their futures. We need a government that will turn this country around and will invest pride in its people-like the SPC workers, who are proud of the productivity they have increased. Yet the Government fought that deal. This is a government for special interest groups, not for the women of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must express my thanks to Senator Newman for allowing us today to discuss the issue of this Government's achievements in relation to women. I do not, of course, agree with the first of many faulty assumptions that she made when she introduced this matter of public importance. I hope that I will be able to give her some idea of where she has erred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Early in her speech Senator Newman asked what Australian women had to celebrate. Had I two or three weeks, I think I might be able to tell her, with some assistance from my colleagues the members of the sisterhood, which Senator Newman seems to believe is a derogatory term. I assure Senator Newman that we all take great pride in being members of the so-called sisterhood; we take great pride in being members of the Labor Government; and we take considerable satisfaction in having been involved in policy development and now in policy implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> The selective citing of statistics, the faulty assumptions and the irrelevancies we have had from Senator Newman really do not do her justice. We could have had a debate at a much more useful level had Senator Newman managed to avoid some of the traps that are there for the unwary: for example, her assumption that there are vast numbers of women in small business going into bankruptcy. I would like to see some evidence to that effect. Our information-and it is not just Australian; it is also international-is that women are much less likely to go into bankruptcy. They tend to be better managers; they know their limitations; and they are not so likely to be speculative. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Australian Labor Party has realised that the main and most crucial issue in relation to the welfare of women is to establish their economic independence. I would like to remind honourable senators of a few things that have happened over the past eight years. For example, the retention rate in schools has been raised to over 60 per cent. Of that 60 per cent, far more than half are girls. This is an enormous change. In 1982, only 36 per cent of young people stayed at school until they reached matriculation or the equivalent standard. Enrolments in universities are now showing us an excess of female enrolments over male enrolments; even in the technical and further education system, which tended to lag, we see a great deal of improvement in the participation of women. The participation rate of women in the work force is at its highest level ever and is still rising, despite increasing unemployment. It is very unwise, Senator Newman, to look simply at the raw figures and to ignore the percentage rates. At the moment we have a female participation rate of 52 per cent- as I say, the highest ever-despite the fact that there certainly is increasing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also faulty to assume that women are worse hit by a period of downturn such as we have at the moment, in view of the fact that the highest rates of increasing employment are in the service sector, where women are represented most highly. Over the last eight years 59 per cent of the additional 1.6 million jobs created have gone to women. A lot of those certainly have gone into part time employment, but for many women this is the preferred type of employment during certain periods of their lives; certainly in returning to the work force, in coping with their families and in developing or maintaining their skills in order to return to the work force at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA> We note that Senator Newman has heard of some of the job creation and training programs. The only one she mentioned was the jobs, education and training program-JET. Between its inception in March 1989 and May 1990, nearly 11,000 sole parents participated in labour market programs, compared with only a little over 3,000 in the previous 12 months-an increase of nearly 300 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That program has been extended and enhanced in the 1990-91 Budget. Clearly it is a very successful program and, as I am sure the Senate is aware, includes a component to provide for children's services in order that women can return to education, training and employment. There has been a 28 per cent reduction in long term unemployed, incidentally, in the 12 months to November 1990 since the introduction of the Newstart program, which Senator Newman will recall, is designed to help those people who have been out of the work force for long periods of time. Some 12,000 women from the Newstart group have returned to the work force in that period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Women's Employment, Education and Training Advisory Group, which was established by this Government about three years ago, is providing an excellent source of information and advice to the Government and has recently established a steering committee on a national plan of action for women in technical and further education. I anticipate that that will be an extremely useful approach to that type of tertiary education, which is becoming more and more acknowledged as part of the tertiary education field. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very important aspect of improving women's employment possibilities and their long term employment possibilities has been the introduction of maternity leave which occurred more than 10 years ago. But just recently honourable senators may have noticed that this Government supported the successful Australian Council of Trade Unions case for parental leave, which now allows fathers to share the 52 weeks of unpaid leave which are available in the majority of private enterprise employment. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to matters such as income support, which Senator Newman managed completely to ignore as if it did not matter. I draw to her attention the fact that across the community generally real household disposable incomes per capita grew by 12.4 per cent between March 1983 and September 1990. This is a genuine figure, in percentage terms about the whole of the community and all household incomes. It compares with a growth of only 5.4 per cent between December 1975 and March 1983-a very real improvement on what occurred during the seven years prior to this Government's being elected. </PARA>
<PARA> The family package which was introduced by this Government has helped to increase the real income levels of the bottom 10 per cent of two parent and sole parent families with children by 12 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. That is an important increase in the disposable incomes of those families on low incomes or of those who depend on social security. At present more than 500,000 families, including 1.2 million children, are being helped with family allowance supplement payments or their equivalent in extra pensions and benefits. Including family allowances, this involves over $2 billion of Commonwealth funding for children and low income families. The average payment now to a family with two children will be $50 tax-free per week. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They received considerably less under your Government, Senator Walters. I remind Senator Walters of what I just said, because perhaps she was not listening. Between 1975 and 1983 real household disposable incomes rose by only 5.4 per cent. In the following eight years they have risen by 12.4 per cent-a 150 per cent increase on the previous seven years. If women are to be able to take their place in the work force to maintain or develop their economic independence, we have to make certain that our children's services are adequate to meet their needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have great pleasure in reminding Senator Newman of figures that I am sure she has heard before but perhaps which she would like to hear again. Since 1983, 77,500 new community child-care places have been created. The program that we have embarked on will substantially increase that number within the next two or three years. Since eligibility for fee relief was extended to commercial child-care centres in 1990, 890 centres have already been approved for fee relief, representing about 36,000 places. Some 50,000 new places will be created in the community sector, and it is expected that commercial and employer provided child-care will grow by 28,000 places. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure Senator Newman heard Senator Cook's answer to my question today about guidelines for children's services in the public sector, and his reference to the fact that there is now a set of standards which Commonwealth departments are expected to examine in the hope that many will follow the good example already set by the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, with the support of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The other ways in which the standard of living, the quality of life, the opportunities generally for women of all ages have been enhanced would make a very long and interesting catalogue. I would like to have the opportunity to embark upon it; it is difficult to stress too strongly that this Government has been very conscious of the fact that the way to assist families out of poverty is to ensure that the members of those families are able to take part in the work force and able to develop their economic independence. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another sector of the community which has been greatly assisted by the initiative of this Government in establishing the child support scheme. Prior to the start of the scheme in June 1988 only 30 per cent of court ordered maintenance was paid to parents with custody of children, and frequently this was paid at irregular intervals. The Child Support Agency now collects 71 per cent of all liabilities registered with it and the Department of Social Security distributes $10m each month to 138,000 children from broken families. There has been a rise in the average amount of maintenance paid per child from $27 to $49 a week under the formula assessment. There has also been an increase, as you, Mr Acting Deputy President, will be well aware, in the amount of child support ruled by court orders from $27 to $39 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall working with Senator Aulich on this scheme two or three years ago and our mutual concern about the low level of court orders generally at that time. Work carried out by this Government, with a great deal of assistance from a number of professional people, and particularly Mr Justice Fogarty, has established a level at which we believe children should be supported by the non-custodial parent, given certain qualifications. That scheme is now in place. As a result of introducing this scheme there has been a rise from 26 per cent to 37 per cent in the proportion of sole parent pensioners receiving maintenance payments-that is an increase of 42 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In a relatively short period of time it is a matter of considerable satisfaction to us and a matter on which the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security should be strongly commended. This has its side effects, too, and a particularly good one is that because of this increased level of maintenance payments by non-custodial parents the amounts of pensions being paid to sole parents have been able to be reduced, and therefore have reduced the call on the welfare budget. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, Senator Newman made a lot of very wild assumptions. She referred to a matter which was the subject of some recent publicity-the number of terminations that are being sought by women in Sydney. Although she did not actually quote from that article--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I beg the honourable senator's pardon. She said that some women are saying that they cannot have babies because they have to keep their jobs. Perhaps we should be looking very carefully at encouraging women to use contraceptives rather than resorting to terminations. If there is this genuine concern amongst women in the community about their fertility, there are-on the whole but not always-certainly other ways of dealing with this than having to depend upon terminations. I expect that, if the matter were investigated more closely, it might be seen that the story could have been a little more complete.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Newman also made some statements-and I have no reason to doubt them at all-about the numbers of people suffering from stress, particularly women who are threatening suicide. Indeed, this is an extremely tragic state of affairs and it certainly needs some more investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> What was it that the coalition recommended as one of its very few firm policies in relation to fiscal matters? I seem to recall some reference to a consumption tax. I wonder how that is meant to enhance the well-being of families; how that is meant to really increase the standard of living and the quality of life of women and their children, particularly as women always bear the brunt of increasing prices and inflation rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Newman's reference to the current inflation rate probably was a little uninformed. I suggest that she have a closer look at some of the answers to questions that have been asked over the last two or three days and not leap to the sorts of conclusions that she has been tending to draw today. </PARA>
<PARA> As inflation falls and interest rates are cut, we will find-as we are already finding-that housing will become more affordable and much of that stress will be relieved. But at the same time, we in the Government very much appreciate that stress is being place on families and on women in particular. We appreciate that this can affect relationships within their families. We know the effect that this has on children. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go back to what I was saying originally. As much as we regret the downturn in the economy, Australian women in 1991 are in a far better position to cope with that state of affairs than they would have been, and certainly were, in 1982. I can recall being in this Parliament at that time and taking part in a debate not unlike this one. There are now far more women in a position to earn their own living or to contribute to their own economic independence. There are far more young women with much better opportunities as far as education and work force potential are concerned. Those are amongst the many things that Australian women have to celebrate on 8 March, International Women's Day 1991. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are astonished that the Opposition chose to propose this matter of public importance when Australian families and women, about whom they profess to be so concerned, are suffering hardship because of policies which, in large measure, the Liberal and National parties have actually supported in this chamber. For example, I remind the Opposition that it supported the Government's move to take widows off the class B widow's pension when they get to 45 years of age and put them on the unemployment benefit; something that has been the cause of great hardship and increased impoverishment for many of the women affected ever since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also, the Opposition was keen on cutting Austudy to 15-year-olds in their last two years of school. This has been particularly hard on women in South Australia and Western Australia who are single parents and who have 15-year-olds in Year 11. They are experiencing difficulties because of the school systems in those two States especially. We have had calls and letters from these women who have been forced to take their children out of school, causing them and their children enormous distress and damaging the future life prospects of their children. Presumably, these particular groups of women and others are not the ones that the Opposition is concerned about today?</PARA>
<PARA> Women make up the majority of those living below the poverty line in this country. Women, as a group, spend more time in that position below the poverty line than men do. Yet every time the Opposition actually manages to come out with an economic or taxation policy, it is essentially directed away from the most disadvantaged members of our community-most of whom are women, as I have said-and towards the more well-off. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles has just referred to the concept of a broad-based consumption tax. Marian Sawer, a woman of note, writing in Australian Society in 1989, pointed out that such a tax would result in a redistribution from `the purse to the wallet'. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>Beneficiaries (of the tax) will be those on or above average weekly earnings-overwhelmingly male-while the costs will be borne by low income earners, pensioners, beneficiaries and those responsible for household purchasing, the majority of whom are women. Proposals to compensate households through the social security system for the regressive effects of the tax will increase the economic dependence of women. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, proposals to compensate through the social security system will also create poverty traps at the margins, as we have seen already with the targeting of the social security policy by the Hawke Labor Government. All that the Opposition proposes to do is to increase the poverty traps, increase the economic dependence of women and increase the tax burden for those who can least afford to meet that burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Marian Sawer mentioned average weekly earnings. In spite of nominal equal pay in this country, we still find that the latest figures show that there is an over $140 per week discrepancy between the average weekly earnings of males and females. Clearly, women are least able to cope with those sorts of policies. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are going to be critical of the effect of the Government's economic policies on women, I think we are also entitled to ask: where is the benefit for Australian women in the Opposition's economic policies? I point out that earlier today in this chamber one of the women on the Opposition side moved an amendment which, in essence, opposed support for Australian industry. This would have the potential to create even higher unemployment in the future than this Government has already meted out. I find considerable irony in the fact that a little later in the day another female colleague should propose the matter of public importance that we are now debating. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be clear: Australian women are bearing the brunt of this recession. There has been a very real feminisation of poverty in this country. I refer here especially to the desperate situation of many sole parents, the vast majority of whom are women. At least 50 per cent of sole parent families headed by women live in poverty. Amongst the major reasons for this fact is the lack of financial support from former partners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, as Senator Giles has said, has taken steps, strongly supported by the Democrats, to do something about this through the child support scheme. Progress is taking place. Nevertheless, for many of those sole parent families it remains the case that lack of support from the former partner drives them into, and keeps them in, poverty. I think until we have a maintenance guarantee for all children, which we still do not have under the child support scheme, that will continue to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Enormous difficulty is being experienced by women trying to re-enter the paid work force after years at home or, in the case of many women, particularly those in the older age groups but still of work force age, attempting to gain, perhaps for the first time for many of them, some form of relevant and employable qualifications. This is in spite of the Government's scheme which looks good on paper but access to which is very difficult for many women, particularly those who are geographically isolated or those who are socially isolated by their lack of experience, by their lack of self-esteem, by their lack of English language and often, too, by their lack of financial support to engage in those exercises. The social security review, headed by Bettina Cass, found that women are twice as likely as men to depend on social security for their major source of income. </PARA>
<PARA> Just this morning my colleague Senator Lees spoke about the fact that the social security system in this country used to be driven by the attitude that we would and should help those who, through no fault of their own, were in financial need. Senator Lees went on to observe that under the Hawke Labor Government we have taken significant steps away from that concept and embraced the notion of targeting. Indeed this Government bruits on the international scene its pride in the very highly targeted social security system which we have. Targeting attacks that very basic concept of helping those who, through no fault of their own, are in financial need. Part of that concept really was, and has to be, that such support would apply universally to those Australians who lack sufficient funds to maintain themselves or their families. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of this shift in philosophy has been particularly hard on women. It is a philosophy strongly supported by the Opposition, which has brought on this matter of public importance today. It is well documented that women suffer most as public expenditure diminishes because they are disproportionately dependent on the public sector for services and income support as well as employment. For example, through the cuts in funding by this Federal Government to the State governments have been the consequent cuts in the home and community care scheme. The particular groups of women affected by that are the elderly and women raising disabled children for whom that sort of support is less available. </PARA>
<PARA> Women are the carers in our community and they have lost out as cuts in that area alone have come through from the Federal Government to the State governments. There are, of course, particular problems faced by rural women. Government moves to impose an assets test on the family allowance galvanised rural women into action. They mobilised behind the campaign to remove the assets test from the family allowance which was proposed in the last Budget and to at least exempt the family farm from that test on the family allowance supplement. For many rural and farming women these supplements constitute their sole source of cash income from which they feed and clothe their children at this time of extraordinary rural downturn. To these women the family allowance is a matter of being able to put bread on the table; it is a matter of their family's survival. </PARA>
<PARA> That mobilisation did lead to a breakthrough. The Government and the Opposition continue to be intransigent on the issue of exempting family farms from the assets test for the family allowance supplement, Austudy and the assistance to isolated children scheme despite the obvious benefits that would flow to rural women and children. These benefits are only what we can call justice in a situation where assets do not mean liquidity. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that there are over 77,000 increased community child-care places. Senator Giles spoke on this matter a little while ago. Because this Government was starting from such a lean base after the years of the coalition Government, there is still a great shortage of affordable child-care places. Demand continues to grow, and that is a natural consequence of the increased involvement of women in the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA> A paper put out by the Australian Institute of Family Studies tells us that in 1989, 56 per cent of families with dependent children had both parents in the work force; that is, families where there are two parents. We spoke recently with community based child-care providers who were primarily concerned about the affordability of child-care during the current recession. They spoke of women who simply could not afford full time child-care and had to make impossible choices between earning a decent living or contributing to maintaining their family's standard of living and giving up work to care for their child. </PARA>
<PARA> I express the Australian Democrats' concern of a report I heard on this morning's AM program about the deep distress that is being caused to married women seeking pregnancy terminations on economic grounds. I will refer to the comments made by Sue King, the Executive Officer of the PreTerm Foundation in Sydney on AM this morning. She said that these people are having to cope with huge financial dilemmas. She states:</PARA>
<PARA>It's their whole life experience at the moment; it's not just having to terminate a pregnancy at this time, it's their whole life experience that they're going through. They haven't got any money, they don't know where the next penny is coming from. They're worried that they're either going to lose their business, they're worried that they might be losing their home. A lot of these people have a lot of difficulty in either scraping together the money to buy their existing children shoes, or pay for a school excursion or whatever it is. The most basic things which we all take for granted become huge problems for a lot of these people. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that speaks volumes for the distress that is caused to women at this time. I also refer to the concerns that have been expressed about the increasing unemployment and the effect that has on women. Virginia Dowd, the Managing Director of a national financial group, Women's Investment Network, expressed a number of those concerns in an article in the Canberra Times on 2 January. She states:</PARA>
<PARA>The group, which manages the financial affairs of about 20,000 Australian women, had found its services were being increasingly sought by women, many of whom had been retrenched or feared losing their jobs as the recession deepened. </PARA>
<PARA>This has occurred since January. In this article, Virginia Dowd tells us something that we all know. She states:</PARA>
<PARA>Women tend to be concentrated in support-staff roles and in a downturn, these are the first jobs to go. What's more women make up over 77 per cent of part-time workers-and, again, part-timers are vulnerable in a cut back. </PARA>
<PARA>Nowadays most women are providers and, for them, this economic downturn is removing financial independence but, perhaps even worse, removing their ability to support their families in the way they need to. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has nothing better to offer women on this issue. That is why I think we find it somewhat extraordinary to be faced with this matter of public importance today. It does not require a recession, however, for women to have financial difficulties. I raise here, just briefly, the Democrats' concerns about the difficulties being faced by Robin Greenburg, the majority owner of the Perth-based finance advisory group, Western Women Management. For the past 11 months she has been trying to change the financial status quo. She has struck enormous problems-problems which we are attempting to get to the bottom of. There is an enormous amount of what appears to be obstruction and, indeed, a great deal of media vendetta in her home State of Western Australia. It is obvious that statutory authorities must do their jobs thoroughly; nevertheless, there is a nasty flavour of discrimination about this issue and the Democrats will certainly follow this issue up. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there are many areas where women still face difficulties. Those difficulties are obviously exacerbated in a recession. Nevertheless, nothing is offered by the Opposition that is of any great benefit to women; indeed, particularly with its tax and economic policies, women face an even more difficult future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy-Mr Acting Deputy President. It is not a good way to start a debate on something that is so important to the people of Australia. In debating this matter of public importance-the impact of the economic mismanagement of the Hawke Labor Government on Australian women-not surprisingly, I wish to direct my remarks specifically to women in rural Australia, and obviously that is why I addressed you in the way I did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am disappointed that no male person on the other side of the chamber will be speaking in this debate, because I believe the plight of women in our society at the moment is something that all of us should be thinking about. There is no indication of the representation in this place of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women in the other place. I know that Senator Newman definitely represents the status of women in this chamber on behalf of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few weeks we have heard quite frequently-especially from me-about the plight of the rural communities and the rural crisis that is crippling our country, most of it induced by the Hawke-Keating Labor Government. No matter how many times I raise the matter, what does not seem to get through to the government of the day is the cruelty that it is inflicting on the people of Australia. In fact, in November of last year the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Kerin, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The rural sector is vital to our national economy, and the rural community is vital to our national identity. This has always been the case in Australia, and it is not about to change. </PARA>
<PARA> That was over three months ago. Since then, we have seen wool prices collapsing and something like 4,000 small businesses going to the wall around Australia, many of them in rural Australia. Since that bold statement in November the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has published its annual projections of farm incomes and they have shown a drop across the board. In fact, the average farm net income will drop this year anywhere from 42 per cent for beef farms to 93 per cent for cereal grain operations. On average, across all farms it means a fall of some 67.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry faces a debt of $2.9 billion and the dilemma for woolgrowers at the moment is whether they accept the prevailing prices or not. Of course, they have to sell because they need the money to keep going. For some there is no choice; they have to sell their wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The wheat industry, as we know, is in no better shape. Figures provided by the Grains Council of Australia show that despite a 10.8 per cent decrease in farm production costs in 1991, and a 2 per cent annual productivity increase over the last 20 years, grain growers this year face a drop in income of 79.5 per cent for wheat and 93.8 per cent for non-wheat grain.</PARA>
<PARA> For those who are on a pay as you earn salary, that is probably hard to grasp. It is hard for a person to imagine what it would be like to have his income for the year cut to 10 per cent of what it was last year while still doing the same work or, as is the case on farms, more work. One cannot hope to understand what that does to families and particularly farm women caught in this bind with their families. It is, therefore, absolutely appropriate that on the eve of International Women's Day this chamber should focus on women in Australia, and most especially rural women. I am glad that Senator Newman brought this on for debate because it is so important for the very fabric of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an adage in the bush that the definition of a successful farmer is one who marries a nurse or a schoolteacher because each can provide off farm income. That adage has been updated in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, it is not merely frequent, but almost mandatory, that the farm wife work full time off the farm as well as do all the other jobs that are assumed to be part and parcel of living in the bush. It is not always possible. It is not always easy to do that because of distance or the fact that they cannot always get jobs anyway. Just think of the cost of fuel, and that impost being foisted on people in rural Australia by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot hope to explain to those who have no appreciation or understanding of it, just what constitutes running a farm. There is a special desire in people to undertake that sort of life. Until I came to this place I knew no other. But for women on properties it is not something that all of them were born to expect. The lifestyle is not an easy one to adjust to even in good times and even on the most affluent of properties. </PARA>
<PARA> Even on the closely settled properties there is isolation. The corner store is not next door and neighbours are either too far away or too busy for socialising. Husbands are often preoccupied. Even in good times the average day's work on a farm starts at 6 to 7 o'clock, which means that the wife, or the person helping in the house-the daughter, or whoever it is-has to get up much earlier than that to get the breakfast. The outside work usually finishes at dusk unless there is a crop to be stripped, and then it goes on for 24 hours a day. Meanwhile the wife, the daughter or the woman in the house is on call the whole time getting meals and looking after and supporting a husband or the people who are working on the farm. </PARA>
<PARA> At night, after that, there is the book work and the telephone calls to agents and contractors to be made, sometimes by the farmer himself but a lot of times by the wife. I know that my wife at home works late at night. I can ring her from here at 11 o'clock some nights and she will be still working in the office. It is a pretty lonely lifestyle for women on a farm to be working all that time and on their own. That is how it is in the good times. In the tough economic times foisted on us by this Government, the situation is far worse. </PARA>
<PARA> In preparing my notes for this debate today it was disturbing to find that very little has been written on the subject. A University of New England study done three or four years ago concluded that the prevailing ideology in the country is that men are the real farmers and that women not only accept this but also encourage the stereotype of themselves as homemakers; and they are. Even for those lucky enough not to have to go off the farm to work, there is more to the average day for the country women than for her city sister. </PARA>
<PARA> A National Farmer survey some years ago said that nine out of 10 women living on farms in New South Wales worked on the farm as well as in the home. In fact, almost 70 per cent of farm wives are the farm's business managers. On 5,400 farms women are the sole owners and managers. I would like to see a similar survey done today because that figure would probably be higher and, in addition, would show that significant numbers of women are also working off farm in additional roles. </PARA>
<PARA> A national survey of women in rural Australia undertaken by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet called, appropriately enough, Life Has Never Been Easy, surveyed 14,000 women across Australia with the assistance of the Country Womens Association. The dominant theme in that survey was the loneliness, isolation and lack of basic services available to them-services, at the moment, that are badly needed and are being curtailed or taken away. Again, an updated survey done today would, I am sure, reinforce those concerns that have been magnified so much more because of the economic circumstances facing them. </PARA>
<PARA> I was talking to a doctor the other day and one in 10 patients today who are taking tranquillisers are people in the bush-mainly women-or they are handling alcohol not as well as they should be. They are having poor sleep patterns, there are more break-ups and young people, especially, are being hit by this dilemma in the country at the moment. Even for those who do not regard themselves as the farm manager, the tasks are varied and frequent. The farm wife becomes the gofer-the spare hand at harvest, the message taker and the person who does all those other jobs-and all this is on top of housework and the crisis that they are suffering at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those people are the lucky ones. The Rural Development Centre in the University of New England did a survey on the role of women in alleviating occupational stress on the family farm and detailed the increase in the informal voluntary telephone network of farm women. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the implications of the rural recession has been to force family members to take on extra workloads to replace hired labour which is no longer affordable under the financial constraints placed on family farms. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, for many women this has:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . involved extra responsibilities in areas in which they have limited experience and skills and for which they receive little or no outside assistance or support. These women are finding themselves in a pivotal position--</PARA>
<PARA>They are filling it very well, but they are under stress and they have to do it because this Government has put this economic crisis onto Australian women.</PARA>
<PARA> The report also suggests that communication breakdown is another factor contributing to the stress experienced by farm women. Their husbands generally refuse to acknowledge the serious financial position of the farm and the women bear the brunt of the whole situation. I commend the report for reading to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson). Rural women need to educate the Minister on what life outside Canberra and Killara is all about. I bring the matter up because the Minister, when he visited Lismore recently, was quoted in a Lismore paper as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I've seen things here I've never seen before . . . It's hard to believe that in this day and age there are people living without electricity, having to rely on kerosene. And we are not talking about the middle of nowhere-I'm talking about 30 kilometres from Lismore . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If Senator Richardson were to go 30 kilometres from Canberra, he would find people without electricity. Many farmers have generators for their power needs because this Government thinks it is too difficult or too expensive to have the mains power connections and there is no incentive for them to have it done. If the Minister's appallingly limited lack of knowledge in areas outside Sydney is indicative of the rest of the Labor Cabinet, I am horribly concerned. The Government is not taking enough notice of women in the community. Only recently a television documentary was done on the farm crisis and the problems associated with women in this crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural women are also suffering from the Government's recent attempts to reduce the availability of family allowances by the use of the assets test. This was fought by the Opposition. The Government has done this at a time when farmers have little or no income-they are asset rich but dirt poor. The Government has been cold and heartless to the Australian people, especially to the women who work on the farms in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Austudy is one glaring example of the inequality that rural families suffer under this Labor Government. It is appalling that country families are being asked to repay Austudy grants because the Federal Government's valuation office has revalued properties, some of them as much as 70 per cent above valuations applied by the councils. In some cases the valuations were determined two years after Austudy payments were made. How out of touch is this Government that it can be playing with rural families in this way? How can it value virtually any rural property at present higher than previous evaluations?</PARA>
<PARA> The other day I heard of an instance of a person being burnt out by a bushfire. He had lost 20,000-odd acres of country, but he cannot even get Austudy so that his child can receive a better education. And the Government says that we have to have a better education for our communities! The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that by 1990 no child shall live in poverty. And we now have whole families living in poverty. Women are bearing the brunt of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I support this matter of public importance, on behalf of the males in the Senate, because no male Government senator has got up to support the women of Australia. I do it with honour. I am content in the knowledge that we on this side of the Parliament have someone fighting for the women of Australia, especially the women of rural Australia-and that is Senator Newman.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I certainly was not reading up on the subject; I was reading up on one particular issue that I thought was very important in this debate this afternoon. We are on the eve of International Women's Day. As Senator Newman said in her opening remarks, it is true that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) regards women and the status of women as so important that he is making a major statement in Brisbane tomorrow. Senator Newman and members of the Opposition do not seem to like this and I can understand why. They are a little sensitive. I know that Senator Newman does not have very much success with many of her colleagues in getting status of women issues on the agenda. I will come to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wondered what John Hewson was doing tomorrow for International Women's Day. My secretary rang his office, identified herself and said, `What is the Leader of the Opposition doing tomorrow? It is International Women's Day. Is he addressing women's organisations? Is he doing something special for International Women's Day?'. No, he is not. He is in Melbourne all day. I am happy for Senator Newman to correct me if there is something on his program that his secretary is unaware of, but Dr Hewson's secretary advised that he has nothing planned. While the Prime Minister will be in Brisbane delivering a statement and giving commitment to the women of Australia, John Hewson probably did not even know it was International Women's Day until we reminded him. Even if he did know, he is not prepared to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman in her opening remarks went on about some of the issues of concern to her. I will not stand here and deny there are problems in the community, that there are problems that women face, that men face, that people face, that older women, younger women and disabled women face. Of course we are in a difficult economic climate and it is difficult for people around Australia and, as Senator Brownhill said, particularly in rural Australia. However, I do question some of the double standards that are presented in this chamber when members of the Opposition say, `The Government is not doing anything about it' and they fail dismally to tell us what they would do. We hear very little about what the Opposition would do about any matter, if it ever gets into office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, you are right. I would like to trace the history of the philosophy of the Liberal-National Party coalition in relation to status of women's issues and the needs of Australian families. To do this, I have to go back to John Howard and his Future Directions. To find out about his economic plans for women and whether his economic policies would have advantaged Australian women, we look first at the index and find that that document contained 109 pages of which only 1 1/2 pages were devoted to status of women's issues or women's policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, even though there were 1 1/2 pages we were none the wiser when we got to the end of them because there was nothing specific in terms of policy dollars. We do not know how much money John Howard would have been prepared to give to programs to assist women manage in a difficult economic climate. We do know that John Howard said that he was committed to smaller government and less interference. He was prepared to say that the Labor Government had elbowed out voluntary workers and the Opposition looked at introducing programs that penalised independence, self-reliance and self-help.</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly that does not spell dollars or assistance for programs for elderly women, for example. John Howard also said that the Australian Labor Party directed resources to public rented housing. Tut, tut! We would not want to see sole parents having access to public rented housing, according to John Howard. We all know what happened to Future Directions and to John Howard. But let us continue and just see what happened when Future Directions went down the gurgler. We then got the coalition's Economic Action Plan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before detailing some of the comparisons between the Hawke Labor Government and the coalition, I would really like to take up Senator Newman's point: because of the economic difficulties, the recession, in Australia today, many women are rushing off to have abortions, and how sad this is. I do not mind Senator Newman trying to score political points-that is her job and I would expect her to do it efficiently-but I do think that this is emotional claptrap of the highest order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have the statistics to prove it. In fact, there has been a major increase in the birth rate during the past few years, especially for women over 30. I will detail this. In the age group 30-34 years, there has been an increase from 83 births per thousand to 96 per thousand; in the age group 35-39 years, it has risen from 25.6 births per thousand to 32.5 per thousand. Similarly, there has been a small increase in the birth rate for women over 40 years having children. Far from us being able to say that all these poor Australian women cannot afford to have children, there is an increase in the birth rate. I think that is something that Senator Newman should read up on. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would just like to compare two documents which I think summarise the differences of approach between the Hawke Labor Government's commitment to where women fit into its economic strategy and where they fit into the coalition's strategy, if indeed they fit at all. These are not my quotes. The first quote is from the Australian Family Income Transfer Project, entitled Families and the Tax Package and the second quote is from The Coalition Parties' Family Tax Package. They contrast quite clearly the strategies that are adopted by the Labor Party and by the coalition parties. I urge all honourable senators to have a look at The Coalition Parties' Family Tax Package. The concluding remarks are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>* neither the Child Tax Rebate nor the Child Care Rebate would be available to families who do not pay enough tax to fully benefit;</PARA>
<PARA>* distribution of the benefits would go disproportionately to high income groups, with only 1.7 per cent of the package going to the 18 per cent of families receiving $14,000 pa;</PARA>
<PARA>* the long term objective to drop the top rate of tax even further would only benefit high income earners, half of whom have no children, giving gains to the most wealthy 100 times those of low income families;</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the Opposition's commitment to women and its commitment to women with children. Contrast that with the concluding remarks in Families and the Tax Package-I am sorry I can only use the concluding remarks-in relation to the Government's tax package:</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the Government's tax package redresses substantially all of the deficiencies in the tax-transfer system affecting families and single individuals, as identified in Families and Tax in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes in the tax scale benefit most those families receiving incomes around $20 000 per annum and have restored a significant proportion of income lost over recent years. The changes were certainly more beneficial than the indexing of the tax scale of 1983-84 would have been. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of family payments, a major boost to Family Allowances has restored much of the value lost since 1983-84. As a result the family tax concession has been greatly improved from its current level. </PARA>
<PARA> The benchmarks for assistance to low income families were met, so underpinning the incomes of all families with children. </PARA>
<PARA>I regret that I have not longer to go into details about the rural initiatives except to say that in the coalition's Economic Action Plan all those programs of assistance for rural Australia were going to be abolished. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think perhaps we should refocus on the topic of the matter of public importance that we are discussing today; namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The impact of the economic mismanagement of the Hawke Labor Government on Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA>I can scarcely believe that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will be making a major statement on women tomorrow. He is always making major statements on something, but we very rarely get anything that flows from it that is of benefit to the people he is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a major statement once about child poverty. Honourable senators will recall that child poverty was to end by 1990. But we know what the value of that statement was. Of course he will be making a major statement on women tomorrow; that is what he does on 8 March every year. It is designed to impress people, to bluff them into thinking that he is serious about women and serious about their welfare. If he were serious about the welfare of women he would be getting the economy right. He would be sacking his Treasurer (Mr Keating) and putting somebody in place who would get the economy on track so that women on low and fixed incomes would not be suffering as they are at present. Tomorrow will be more of the same from the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a leader who is committed to getting an economy in place which will benefit all Australians and which will particularly benefit women, and they will be better off as a consequence. We do not have handouts, promises or bags and bags of policies. We actually want something to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that none of the Ministers has seen fit to take part in this debate. I would have thought it was a matter of such importance that a Minister would have taken part and referred to what the Government was going to do to make the economy strong. I noticed an interesting thing while sitting here listening to this riveting debate: there does not appear to be a Minister in the Senate who has ministerial representation responsibilities for the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. I do not know, but that is certainly the literature that has been supplied to us in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Tomorrow is International Women's Day. It is a day that I certainly remember each year. I have two daughters-they are not twins-whose birthdays are on 8 March, so it is not hard for me to remember the day. It would be worth looking historically at the day: it dates back to 1910 internationally and in Australia from 1928. At various times it has been used to assert women's political and social rights; it has been used to review the progress that women have made; and, on occasions, it has been used as a day for celebration. The United States socialist Lena Lewis said in 1910-in fact, she declared it somewhat prophetically-that `International Women's Day was not a time for celebrating anything, but rather a day for anticipating all the struggles to come'. So it will be this year. </PARA>
<PARA> There will not be many women in Australia who will be celebrating International Women's day on 8 March 1991. Women who are living with the economic and social consequences of the Hawke Labor Government's policies cannot celebrate. I am thinking of the women who are now unemployed or those who are coping with the financial and social consequences of their partners being out of work, as is happening to so many. I am thinking of those struggling with high interest rates on their home mortgages and on their businesses. I am thinking, of course, of the rural women that Senator Brownhill has already referred to who are suffering economic disaster and devastation in country areas, not just those on the land, but those running small businesses in the rural towns who are suffering so greatly because there is no money to change hands in those areas. I am thinking of the older women of our community, vainly attempting to live out their lives with dignity and financial security in the face of years of high inflation, high taxation, economic uncertainty and now, of course, a lack of understanding of the new deeming provisions which have been wished upon them. I am thinking of the women whose children cannot get work at a time of growing unemployment and, of course, of the young women amongst them who are not able to get on with their careers and to get a start in life. I am thinking of the women who make up the 90 per cent of one parent families which are headed by women. They have nothing to celebrate. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise, of course, that no-one in Australia can escape the economic hardship that has been caused by this Government's deliberate policies of high taxation, high interest rates, high indebtedness and the high inflation that has flown from it as well. Women on lower incomes and fixed incomes have suffered particularly, those least able to buffer against the economic consequences of the Government's policies-policies that it has boasted about for eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true, and one has to admit, that on the propaganda front the Government has done fairly well. It has propagated the myth that it is concerned with the status of women and women's issues. There have been many committees, inquiries and policies-there will be another one tomorrow, of course-but the gains are often illusory. Much effort and time has been put in by women into submission writing and information gathering, but not much has been done that has helped women, especially those who are on pensions and the single income benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to a small portion of a report of a Congress committee, the Committee on Economic Well-being. I think this answers some of the issues that the Australian Democrats put forward. The Committee said a number of things, among them:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recognized that a strong economy is essential to the maintenance and improvement in any of these tiers. </PARA>
<PARA>The tiers were the various levels of social security and pensions that exist. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee therefore urged that the Administration and the Congress take steps to control unemployment, interest rates, and especially inflation, which significantly affect the elderly. </PARA>
<PARA>One would say that `the Administration' is a reference to the Federal Government. Oh, if only the Treasurer were listening and had the capacity to understand the effect that his economy has on those on pensions and on fixed incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> But rather than have a strong economy, what in fact have we got? There is not time today to go into all the details, but a little bit of information tells the story. We have a massive net foreign debt of $131 billion. Let us look at a bit of history. In 1969-70, the foreign debt was $2 billion. A decade later, 1979-80, $6.8 billion. That was perceived to be fairly high. It is now, as a gross figure, $165 billion, and as a net figure, $131 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at the situation in many different ways. Of course, we need more than the wool clip each year just to pay the interest on the foreign debt. I worked out yesterday that it would take 30 years of the wool clip to actually pay off the foreign debt, and that is without paying the interest each year as we go along in the meantime. That is the economic mismanagement that is making life so difficult and so hard for so many women; that is why it is necessary and relevant to discuss the matter as a topic today. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman referred to the article about the increasing number of married women having abortions which appeared in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald. Senator Reynolds seemed to think that that did not matter because the birth rate was increasing. I do not think those two things are related. I think it is a tragedy if women are having abortions because they feel they cannot look after a child. Ms Sue King, the executive officer of the Preterm Foundation, which is Sydney's biggest provider of abortions, was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We have a very strong perception that more married women are presenting for terminations because they cannot afford to lose their income. </PARA>
<PARA> They cannot afford to withdraw from the workforce and if they did withdraw it would probably mean losing the roof over their heads. </PARA>
<PARA>So even if the birth rate is increasing in some areas, there are women suffering in this fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> Many women find the question of child-care a very difficult one. Without going in great detail into the matter of child-care, the fundamental difference in the attitude of the Labor Party to child-care to that of my Party is that Labor regards child-care as a welfare issue and not as an economic issue. I think until it changes its attitude to that and sees child-care as an economic issue, continuing problems will exist for those who need quality child-care to enable them to participate in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning, in another debate, Senator Hill referred to the number of bankruptcies which had occurred, and the figures are worth noting. In the June quarter of 1990 there was a 10 per cent increase in bankruptcies over the same June quarter of 1989. In September 1990, there was a 32 per cent increase over September 1989. In December 1990 there was a 56 per cent increase over December 1989. I think we all recognise that that figure is growing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to talk about statistics in that fashion but every time there is a bankruptcy a family is totally disrupted in terms of its lifestyle. Its social life is disrupted; it probably has to move house or to a totally different area. The children have to change schools. The effect on a family is absolutely devastating. I think it is not good enough to just brush off these statistics for bankruptcies without having any regard at all for the social consequences to the people involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer also to sole parents. Ninety per cent of sole parents are women. We hear from time to time the myth that sole parents are mainly young girls who want to have a baby and get a pension. That is nonsense. About 3 per cent of women are in this category. Most sole parents are women attempting to get on with their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with the sole parent pension is that it locks women into being pensioners and does not do anything to encourage them to be in the work force or to try other options. As a family law solicitor, I have heard and know that a woman sole parent is frequently better off being on a pension than being in the work force. I think that is a tragedy. For every dollar she earns she loses money; she has to pay tax; she has to catch up with the Medicare levy; and she needs money to spend on child-care, transport and clothes. We make absolutely no effort to try to give such a woman a chance to escape from being on a pension, to escape from the isolation she is in at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer particularly to elderly people on fixed pensions who have great difficulty managing at the present time. Many have been caught with provisional tax. They are now facing the question of deeming. Deeming is a means of getting people to invest their money and earn income. The rate was set at 10 per cent at a time when the interest obtainable was 4 per cent higher than it is today. I want to refer to the interview the other morning of Mr John Barber on radio 2CN and what he said about the suggestion by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) that there are plenty of places where one can get 10 per cent. The Minister said that there were 29 accounts offering that rate or better. What nonsense, Minister. Mr Barber said:</PARA>
<PARA>We prepared our assessment on a basis of research that we've done with older people. </PARA>
<PARA>People need to be able to withdraw their money. However, there is an enormous number of restrictions on their doing so. Of the 29 banks that the Minister for Social Security spoke about, only two were able to offer accounts that actually met the criteria that pensioners needed. Pensioners frequently are not able to walk to 29 banks around the town to find out. To put people in this position at that age of their life is cruel and unconscionable. At the very least, those people over 80 years of age should have been excluded from the operation and not had to face the deeming provisions. Many of them are women. </PARA>
<PARA> So many utterly confused people have contacted my office. The provisions do not apply to some of them but they do not fully understand that. It is absolutely wicked of the Government to have introduced these deeming provisions. Certainly there would be people over 80 who could cope but a lot cannot. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating a letter from Senator Newman proposing that the following matter be a subject for discussion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The impact of the economic mismanagement of the Hawke Labor Government on Australian women.</PARA>
<PARA>One presumes from that that the Opposition wants to suggest that the impact on Australian women is negative and nasty. The Opposition spends a lot of time getting its facts wrong and confusing us with a range of statements that are so irrelevant as to be absolutely stunning in their irrelevancy. They have nothing to do with anything. Senator Newman, who led for the Opposition in this debate, is its spokesperson for women. And as Senator Margaret Reynolds said, it is women's day, so Senator Newman had to make a speech about it. For the rest of the time we are apparently included as citizens, which would be true because it would save Senator Newman telling us about the dramatic increase of women in the defence forces and other areas of interest of hers. They are actually categorised separately, Senator Newman. Does Senator Newman read them as citizens or women?</PARA>
<PARA> While I was out of the chamber, Senator Newman described the speakers for the Government as a `troika of Left women'. It depends what she means by Left, but by some definitions I am not strictly a Left woman-I am a Centre Left woman. I would suggest that was the first example of her being almost right, which would be the best I could say about her contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman did not tell us about her great quote about her commitment to women. I have reminded her of it before and she always springs up and says that she has been misrepresented. At the risk of that happening again, I will say that Senator Newman has said on the record that in times of economic difficulties women in sport should not be getting funding. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Newman" NAMEID="BE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said you had your priorities wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She did not. I remember quoting her directly at the time. Those words bore in my brain because I have an interest in women's sport. I was fascinated that apparently she is not committed to funding in sport being equitable. She could have made a much better case if she had talked about not funding sport at a time of economic hardship, but she wanted to take out women's funding. That is a fine definition of her attitudes to women. The best I could say is that her attitudes are confused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Newman tried to tell us a lot of things, including the price of items in shops. Senator Newman has Senator Walters's remarkable capacity to insist she knows what other people think, much less what they intend, and never bothers to quote what they say. To suggest across the chamber that I would not know the price of certain goods or, even worse, that I might never have gone to buy them is pretty risky stuff. I will resist asking her who does the shopping in her house. She will tell me that as she is a restaurateur, or at least engaged in that business, she has to keep an eye on the price of some of those items. I might ask her how many times she serves baked beans in her restaurant. The point is that it is a glorious irrelevancy. If she wants to make the point she can do so, but I must say that it does not go to the issue under debate. Whoever does the shopping in any household is quite irrelevant to whether or not people are suffering under the impact of this Government's programs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also clear that Senator Newman did not want to run through these programs. Senator Reid wanted to say that the Government has done a whole lot of things, but they are programs; they are not really a serious commitment to women. It is this Government that has put women on the agenda. It is this Government that keeps women on the agenda and it is this Government that has made all the difference, the absolutely huge difference, to women in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go to some of those points. Senator Giles spelt out some of them and she was absolutely right. There are more women in education; there are more girls staying on to year 12; there are more women in universities and tertiary institutions; and there is a higher participation of women in the work force than ever before. Women have the jobs, the education and the better opportunities under this Government and its specific to them programs. They have not been excluded; they have been included. Because sometimes they are not dealt with satisfactorily under the title of citizen, it is this Government that has put women on the agenda and made sure that they do have equality of opportunity and equality of training opportunities-equality of options for all sorts of things in their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Giles also said, one of the most important things that we know confronts women is the issue of income security. The Opposition spokespeople that I have heard today have suggested that our pension changes have not been of any benefit to women. I do not know how they can argue that our pension system is not good enough but that women would be better on it than getting into the work force. I say to the Opposition: get your thinking clear; you are a confused lot. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has finally got pensions to over 25 per cent of average weekly earnings (AWE)-a promise in Australian Labor Party policy for years. That has been achieved and the figure is now about 25.8 per cent of AWE. What is more, those pensions are now indexed. All other payments to families and women, particularly through the social security system, are now indexed. For the first time ever we have set benchmarks for the cost of children. Those benchmarks are indexed and I challenge the Opposition to stand up and say whether or not it would withdraw those benchmarks. When it gets into government-if it ever gets into government-will it withdraw benchmarks for the value of payments on behalf of the care of those children?</PARA>
<PARA> This Government established the Child Support Agency and introduced the tremendous child support legislation that goes with it. Senator Newman often suggests that she and the Opposition are the holders of the flame of the true family. It is this Government that has required fathers to pay for the maintenance of their children because it sees the importance of that responsibility by fathers to and on behalf of their children. I take Senator Powell's point that on some occasions the Government has been able to introduce such legislation with Opposition support. I note that the Opposition supported that legislation although, as is often the case, it put in a tedious little amendment that did not make much difference. </PARA>
<PARA> Going right to Senator Reid's point about poverty traps, the family allowance supplement was introduced to deal precisely with that issue. It is precisely because we recognise poverty traps that we understand the challenge for people coming off pension or benefit and going back into the work force and the costs entailed for such people. Therefore we introduced the family allowance supplement to go to working families on low income. It was introduced precisely to deal with poverty traps. The fact that we have not dealt with them all, or have not completely eliminated them, should not be used as an argument against the fact that we have done so much work and that we recognise the issue and put it on the agenda as being vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA> Over our time in office-I am not prepared to run through all the figures at this time-we have also introduced dramatic tax cuts. Those tax cuts have fallen most on people on low income, which is of course where we will find women in the work force in large part. Sitting in this chamber this afternoon is Senator Cook, the Minister for Industrial Relations. If anyone doubts what we have done in the work force I can outline some of the measures that have been introduced by Minister Cook. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kernot" NAMEID="XW4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He reminds us every day in Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If he does so every day in Question Time, it means that Senator Kernot has not yet grasped it. This Government has ratified International Labour Organisation Convention 156 to make a genuine commitment to the needs of workers with family responsibilities. As an employer, the Government has given the lead in employment conditions for workers with family responsibilities. It has done a number of things: it introduced permanent part time work in employment in 1983; it has provided 12 weeks paid maternity leave, plus additional unpaid leave for up to a total of 52 weeks, and, as Senator Giles said, that has now been extended to cover paternity leave. Senator Newman wanted to dismiss what she so disparagingly called the so-called sisters, but it is women who have sought equity in terms of changing a single mother's pension to a single parent's pension even though, as has been said, until recently well above 90 per cent of single parents were mothers. It is also true that we see the equity of parental leave, not confinement-if the Senate will allow a good pun-or maternity leave for women only.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has recognised the income security that comes with having jobs-employment. It is this Government that has put the bridging courses in place that Senator Reid wanted to dismiss. The Government introduced the jobs, education and training program for sole parents to get women who are on the pension into the work force through training schemes. The Government recognises the challenge for women who have been out of the work force for some time. It recognises the difficulty for people who are out of the work force and whose skills have now been passed over. It is this Government that has recognised all those factors and has put the programs, the policies and the dollar commitment in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not tell us what it would do. It simply says that life is tough. I would not have thought that any case was argued very well by the price of baked beans. But if Senator Newman wishes to stick to the price of baked beans, along with her women in sport crack, I suggest that is a fair measure of her commitment. It is not a sufficient analysis of the issue. It does not do justice to this Government's commitment to women. I would like to hear her say whether she would continue this Government's initiatives for women or whether she would withdraw them. If one understands what Senator Reynolds had to say about the Opposition's policy, the Opposition does not know what policies it wants for women; it would be inclined to withdraw them. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles made the very potent point that the Opposition will introduce a consumption tax. What will such a tax do to people on fixed incomes? What will it do to people who have restricted or limited savings? What will it do to inflation, to the price of goods and services and to the general economic situation of this country? I do not know that the Opposition is clear about it and I do not know how serious its commitment is. It comes in here and tells us that we have no policies for women-we have; the record is there-and that the economic situation is very difficult for women. We have the policies and the backup to assist women. </PARA>
<PARA> The best the Opposition could offer in that interesting document was 1 1/2 inches on child-care. I am still not clear what the Opposition wants to do with child-care nor where it sees the place of women in the scheme of things at all. Senator Reid suggested that the difference between the Government and the Opposition in child-care policies is that the Opposition sees it as an economic issue whereas, she claims, the Labor Government sees it as a welfare issue. Senator Reid did not write the draft child-care policy of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that I was one of its authors along with Wendy Fatin, and our arguments from the very beginning were that child-care is an economic issue and that that is the only way it properly can be seen. It is about income security for women and it is about justice in terms of opportunities and assistance for women who are at home and for women in the work force. That is how it has been argued. If Senator Reid does not want to see it that way, that is a measure of her blinkered view. It is not a welfare matter; it is a matter of justice and economic support for women who choose to be in the work force or to look for occasional care when they are in the voluntary work force or doing any of the other things women choose to do. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems the Opposition has is that this Government actually believes in those words `choice for women'. The Government actually believes that women should have the opportunity to exercise choice. The Opposition believes women have one role, that is, the role in the family and there they shall be confined by the Opposition and the Opposition's preferred policies. If the Opposition seriously believes in choice, it must support the Government's initiatives for women. Those initiatives are comprehensive and they go to a whole range of issues of concern for women and areas of women's life. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate, I heard Senator Newman somehow getting onto hormonal replacement therapy. I sincerely hope that was not a plea for need or something. I do not know what it had to do with anything. It certainly was not argued in terms of costs nor in terms of who was missing out or what. I have to say that, if the Opposition's health policy goes to hormonal replacement, that is a limited view. I would much rather ask the Opposition to tell us whether it is serious about introducing the voucher system, which would increase the cost of health for the majority of Australians, ensure that many people are not covered under private insurance and push up public expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> This is the Opposition that says it will lower public expenditure. Dr Hewson wants smaller government. But at least an extra $1 billion worth of costs will be incurred under the Opposition's proposed changes to Medicare. I think that that is a more significant issue to tackle in the health area than hormonal replacement. If there is an issue of concern about hormonal replacement, as with breast cancer screening and a lot of other things, this Government will look at it and will implement the necessary and proper changes. </PARA>

Tens of thousands of people have been thrown out of work. </PARA>
<PARA> As time is limited tonight, I would like to draw attention to all those women who work part time in various occupations right across this country, whose retrenchments are not shown up in the statistics. These women are often forced to go to work for economic reasons, for social reasons and for their own economic well-being. They are forced to go out to work to supplement the family budget and to enable them to finance a decent education for their children. As a result of this economic mismanagement these women now find themselves in dire economic straits because they lose contact with the community and they lose income.

Having said that, it is primarily a statistical body, but honourable senators will note from the membership that nobody who delivers health care in this country is represented on that board.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to return to some issues that I addressed last time I spoke on the Privacy Commissioner's report. I was concerned that the Privacy Commissioner had raised the issue of documents or information being provided to businesses and organisations by public servants for a fee. The Privacy Commissioner has expressed concern in his report that this practice is difficult to stop and seems to be continuing. On that day I said that I would be moving a motion, which I still intend to do, to ask the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to address that part of the Privacy Commissioner's report. I shall most probably be moving such a motion on Monday of next week. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise another issue which has been drawn to my attention since I last spoke on this matter, and it relates to Medicare information. Mr Wilcox, the General Manager of the Health Insurance Commission, in a submission to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in September 1988, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The greatest threat to the security of data comes from people who have access to it and who step outside of their functions to release it. There is one example of this in the many issues included in the Committee's hearings on 11 July and that relates to the disclosure of doctors' incomes in 1985. Here the only recourse is after the event through punitive actions contained within the legislation. The problem, irrespective of whether the information is computerised or not, is identifying who released the information and securing sufficient evidence to invoke the legislative provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>They were the same sorts of problems that appear to have been occurring with the Department of Social Security information that has been leaked and provided. In the examples I gave when I last spoke on this report I said that Medicare information had been available to credit organisations, organisations providing information to debt collectors. I said that, for $20 a hit, a bit of information would be provided from Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly important that I raise this matter at the moment, when the Government has announced that it will improve the integrity of the Medicare system by reissuing everyone with a Medicare card. That has raised this issue in my mind, and I have also been concerned about the cost of the reissuing of Medicare cards. I wonder whether it would have been necessary if better procedures had been in place to purge Medicare card records. An example of this appeared in Column Eight of the Sydney Morning Herald on 6 March this year. It made me realise that the system needed looking at long ago and that the Government is now trying to close the door after the horse has bolted, and it will cost us a fortune. The item in Column Eight read:</PARA>
<PARA>No wonder there are 300,000 more people on Medicare cards than the total population of Australia. After a lecturer's purse was stolen from her office at Sydney University last week, she phoned Medicare to say her card was among the things missing. Never mind, she was told, just go into a Medicare office and get another. No effort was made to cancel the stolen card. Make it 300,001. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister may say that the reason they are not bothering any more now is that the Government intends to reissue the cards and will not do anything more about it. I wonder whether that practice has been going on. The issue raised by the Privacy Commissioner is the very great issue of public servants releasing information to which they are privy and which is not appropriate to be released and where it is difficult to track down who has acted in this way and to punish them. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>The Companies and Securities Law Review Committee, as such, no longer exists and the role of the Committee has been taken up by the new Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which has a much more proactive law reform function than the former Committee, and the Australian Democrats welcome that. The new Committee has already produced major policy initiatives, including the vital questions of directors' remuneration, insider trading and regulation of unit trusts. There is still much to be done to repair Australia's corporate reputation. The commitment to assist the Government to remove loopholes from company law is certainly given by the Australian Democrats, and we expect some action by the Government in this area. </PARA>

A member of the public claims to have paid his annual company fee and it was acknowledged to have been paid on 23 January. However, the cheque has still not been cashed by the Commission. He was astounded and inquired about the fact that the cheque had not been presented. He was told that it probably would not be cashed until late April because there is a huge backlog of work. Clearly this is a matter that the appropriate Minister should address. It at least indicates some administrative laxness and lack of organisation in that office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is in only one sense a timely report. In every other sense it is most untimely. The report is for the year to June 1990 and it has been delivered to the Senate only in March this year. That is not timely reporting. It would have been nice to have been able to get a feeling as to where the delay occurred, if Mr Harris, in conveying his report to the Minister, had put a date on his letter. It may have been some time ago; I notice that the auditor's report is dated 18 December. We have to find out who is delaying presentation of these reports so that we know whom to blame and whom to give a bit of curry to. When the Chairman of a body such as this does not bother putting a date on his letter, it does not do anyone any good and does not help us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, it is timely in another sense. It is timely in the sense that the Sydney bid for the Olympic Games in the year 2000 has now well and truly become Australia's bid. The Federal Government has shown its preparedness to support that bid in both a financial and a manpower sense. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is on the Sydney bid committee, as is the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), and I am his alternate on that committee. That committee met for the first time yesterday in Sydney. The outstanding calibre of that committee and the amount of work that has already been done suggest that this bid will be outstanding. I think that it has an excellent prospect of success. </PARA>
<PARA> This bid by Australia for the Olympics-which, of course, will be held in nine years time-will not come up for decision until 1993. One would hope that by then a lot of positive decisions would have been made so that the Australian Sports Commission-which, of course, is heavily involved in the elite sports program, which relates entirely to Olympic sports-clearly will have a significant role to play in preparing Australian athletes for what we hope to see as the Sydney Olympics of the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are many other things that have to be done in this Olympic area before we can see a successful Games in Australia. For example, it is up to the Government to determine what it is going to do about the Newington Armaments Depot which adjoins the proposed Olympic area. The presently unused part of the Newington Armaments Depot will be required for some elements of the Olympic sports centre. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Government will proceed at a faster rate than it has in the past to do something about getting rid of the Newington Armaments Depot from its present site, which is in the centre of the western suburbs of Sydney; roughly in the geographic and demographic centre of Sydney. It is totally inappropriate for it to be there. My concern is that the presence of such an armaments depot so close to an Olympic centre would not be helpful at all to the bid. Whilst it is recognised that for some years now the Navy has wanted to move that armaments depot to Jervis Bay, the Government appears to have been putting a great deal of difficulties in the Navy's way. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the challenge now in front of the Australian Sports Commission is to do what it can to prepare Australia's athletes for that Olympic Games. I certainly wish it well in its endeavours. I wish the Sydney bid well in its attempts to get the Games for the year 2000. I wish all Australia's Olympic athletes the best possible good fortune in the run-up to those Games so that Australia can show the rest of the world exactly what it can do in Olympic sports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or girl. In respect of the matter that I heard Senator Baume referring to as I came in-the Sydney bid-I hope that this bid for once gets support from all Australian Olympic federations. I remind the Senate of what is well known as the night of the long knives, where every identifiable person who voted for Melbourne against Sydney was singled out, knifed off and removed from the committee. That was retribution for voting for Melbourne and not Sydney. There was considerable heartache and pain. It was something well known to those who were ultimately voting on a choice of a city for the Games that there was less than full and unqualified support for Melbourne. I hope that on this occasion we have full support. I notice already how some of the procedures of the past have been circumvented. There was an open bid, and the various capitals of Australia did not have to put up a bid of their own in the same way as Brisbane did for the Commonwealth Games and Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane all did for the 1992 Olympic Games.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the matters that trouble me is what I see as an incestuous relationship developing in sport in Australia; particularly at the administration level. It is more concerning now than it ever has been because the funding for all elite sport really now comes through the officials of the Australian Olympic Federation who happen to be also on the board of the Australian Sports Commission and who happen to be associated-very many of them-with certain elite sports. In my view, we have that unhealthy circumstance where people are finding themselves beholden for funds for their sport to an elite group of people in sport in Australia generally. It is one of the reasons that I have always opposed the allocation of funds for elite sport being in the hands of the Olympic Federation. However, I will save that for another time. </PARA>
<PARA> I observe that the Australian Sports Commission now seems to be better placed to fulfil the obligations and responsibilities which it has as a result of the appointment of Mr Ferguson and having some proper direction, leadership and, not least, good management. I am certain that we will not see the imbroglio and confusion which has resulted from previous events. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA> (d) believes the Australian Government should join with other like-minded Governments to press the Soviet Union to give early practical effect to the three referendums. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to speak at length on this motion today, but I do hope that it will be carried. I think it is important to encourage the people of the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania in their continual fight for freedom.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, you will probably recall that shortly after the staggering vote in Lithuania this Senate passed a motion noting that vote and calling upon the Soviet Union to facilitate the independence of Lithuania. Subsequent votes took place in Latvia and Estonia and also produced quite staggering results, particularly in Latvia which has a significant Russian population. It indicated beyond any doubt that the three Baltic states do desire a return to independence. It is the view, certainly on this side of the chamber, that they should be entitled to their wish. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition parties in this country have never accepted the de jure incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union. We have stood with them in their long fight for freedom. We have observed their courage at home in their own nations and throughout the world as they have maintained their fight, often in very difficult circumstances and, of course, they now feel that they are so much closer, but yet still so far. </PARA>
<PARA> We, therefore, in this motion call upon the Government of the Soviet Union to respect the results. So far the Soviet Union has been unwilling to do so, which we very much regret. So far President Gorbachev seems to be determined, at any cost, to hold the Baltic states within the Soviet Union despite the wish of the Baltic people. For someone who is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, that is something that we particularly regret. </PARA>
<PARA> The Baltic states were incorporated under the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, a moment that we should continue to condemn. It is a barbaric pact in international history. It is a wrong that needs to be righted even if it has taken so long to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In this motion we demand that the Soviet Government give the Baltic people their freedom. In the meantime, we demand that the Soviet Union renounce the use of force in dealing with the Baltic peoples because, as honourable senators are no doubt aware, force has been applied in recent times in each of the three Baltic states. Those who have resisted that force of Soviet troops have been killed and injured. It is a particularly depressing and regrettable event in what is supposed to be the evolvement of a new world order. </PARA>
<PARA> The last part of this motion is a critical part because we recognise that the Australian Government by itself can only do so much, but we do believe that if it were prepared to join with other nation states-perhaps encourage other nation states to come together to provide one voice particularly in the international fora, the United Nations, and at every opportunity to join together to press the Soviet Union-it is more likely that that united voice will have some effect. That is why in this motion, in paragraph (d), we seek that the Senate resolve that the Australian Government should join with other like-minded governments to press the Soviet Union to give early practical effect to the three referendums. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, I trust that this motion will be carried because although some of us perhaps think that these motions do not count for a great deal, they actually do count in the eyes of the Baltic people. They are seen as a sign that the Australian parliamentary representatives are prepared to stand with the Baltic people in their continuing struggle for freedom and, therefore, it is particularly meaningful to them. I therefore urge that this motion be adopted by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats commend Senator Hill for moving this motion and we will be supporting it today. Along with many other Australians, we have also been deeply moved by the determined way in which the people of the three Baltic states have sought to assert their sovereignty through the overwhelming votes of independence which have been cast in the referendums held in the last two months. Anyone who has an interest in events in the Baltic states just in this century will know that their struggle for independence is not a recent one. Some 50 years ago Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were sold off as part of some illegal deal between Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia. Ever since, the people of all three Baltic states have fought every inch of the way against enormous odds: against the repression that for many years typified the Soviet Union; at times against the indifference of the west; and in all probability against their own feelings of futility and hopelessness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite everything, the outlook for the Baltic peoples is more hopeful today than it has been at any other time over the last 50 years. However, we are under no illusion that in order for the three Baltic states to achieve their goal of independence as expressed in these referendums, much more will need to be done to arrive at that outcome. It is appropriate, therefore, that the Australian Senate requests the Soviet Union in the strongest possible terms to respect the results of these referendums and to finally and totally acknowledge the independence that rightfully belongs to the Baltic states. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Soviet Union has so far shown that it is unwilling to heed the wishes of the Baltic peoples. We all recall the recent economic blockade of Lithuania. In fact, an estimated half a million Soviet troops are still stationed in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In the past, the Soviet Union has sought to intimidate the independence movements by sealing their borders and imposing banking and diplomatic blockades on the republics. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears to be common these days for internal import and export contracts with the Baltics not to be honoured in Moscow. We should ask whether this is indicative of a policy aimed at non-cooperation and of destabilising the Baltic economies. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this, since the beginning of this year we have witnessed the vicious military crackdown by the Soviet Union in Lithuania where a number of people have been killed and hundreds injured, simply because they gathered in the streets of their capital to demand their freedom. That sort of behaviour on the part of the Soviet Union is totally unacceptable and deserves to be condemned. We hope that we will never again see a repetition of the Soviet military crackdown which took place in January this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be said, of course, that what the Baltic states are seeking to do is not so much to establish independence, but rather to restore an independent state which has been illegally suppressed by a foreign power. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania do not seek to secede from the Soviet Union because, in fact, they have never legally joined the Soviet Union. This is the foundation of the declarations of independence which all three Baltic states made earlier last year, and which have now been endorsed by the people voting in these referendums. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, membership of the Soviet Union for the three Baltic states was forced upon them by the notorious Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939. The people of the Baltics were never asked for their opinion about this union and, to their credit, they have never accepted it. Another irony in the Baltics' struggle for independence is that the Soviet Union's own Congress of People's Deputies had itself, in December 1989, recognised that the 1940 annexation of the Baltic republics was illegal and invalid. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to the 1940 annexation, the referendum votes held in Lithuania on 9 February and in Latvia and Estonia on 3 March were democratic as well as legitimate, and a true indicator of the people's wishes. These votes have been overwhelming declarations of independence. They follow the elections of last year where pro-independence candidates gained big majorities under slogans of democracy, independence and justice in all three Baltic republics. </PARA>
<PARA> All three referendum votes drew huge turnouts and, even though there was some doubt over which way the Russian and Polish minorities in all three Baltic states would vote, I understand that in all three a significant proportion of the Russian, Polish and German populations did, in fact, vote in favour of independence. For instance, in Lithuania, where only 80 per cent of the republic's population is Lithuanian, 90 per cent of the population voted for independence, implying that the independence movement there has significant support from the non-Lithuanian minority. This calls strongly into question allegations that most Russians in the Baltic states feel persecuted and need to be defended by Russian troops against the nationalists or separatists who are running the republics. Clearly, this is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to address some of the things which the Democrats believe this Government could be doing to give better practical effect to these referendums. As the Senate is aware, the Baltic peoples, in voting the way they have and in previously making declarations of independence, are appealing to the outside world to help them restore their independence and become full members of the world community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is most unfortunate that President Gorbachev has denounced the referendum results, claiming that they represent an attempt to obstruct his own referendum on the preservation of the Soviet Union, set down for 17 March. The Soviet referendum is intended to be the definitive and legally binding vote that will confirm the wish of most Soviet citizens that the Soviet Union should survive in its present boundaries. It asks whether voters want to preserve the country as a union of socialist, sovereign republics. Clearly, such a statement is unacceptable to Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and probably several other Soviet republics as well. In this context, the Democrats believe that Australia has an obligation to join with other like-minded governments to now press the Soviet Union to give practical effect to those referendum votes.</PARA>
<PARA> We note and welcome, for instance, a vote by the Parliament of Iceland on 11 February this year to recognise Lithuania as an independent state and to set up diplomatic ties as soon as possible in the capital of Vilnius. Indeed, the Scandinavian countries have understandably been the most responsive to the Baltic states' collective desire for independence. Nevertheless, that should not preclude more distant countries such as Australia showing the same spirit of goodwill to the Baltic peoples and assisting them to achieve their stated goal of outright independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Baltic states are on the road to full and complete sovereignty, and Western countries such as Australia should recognise as well as encourage the Baltic states on that road as much as practicable. The Australian Government could, for instance, do more to facilitate a greater number of joint trading ventures direct with the Baltic republics. We could also consider the export of wool and wheat stockpiles in the context of new sales trade agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of Baltic independence is not an internal matter for the Soviet Union. In spite of Soviet opposition and some embarrassing indifference on the part of some Western nations, we believe that one day Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania will re-establish themselves as self-governing states. Australia should declare its full support for that goal and do all it can to make sure that it is achieved. We commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I want to add my words of support for the motion moved by Senator Hill, on behalf of the Opposition, concerning the Baltic states. This is a subject about which I feel very strongly. I think it will be a very important achievement if, again, the Senate expresses its fullest support for the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia for their freedom and independence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Baltic nations are in a unique position. Of all the 15 republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, they are the three that were illegally annexed by Moscow into the Soviet Union. Lenin gave Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia their independence in 1918. At that time he said, on behalf of the Soviet Union, that the Baltic states would never again be the subject of territorial claims by Moscow. That independence was granted and for 20 years the Baltic states flourished as free and independent nations. They were members of the League of Nations. They competed in their own independent right in the Olympic Games that were held during that period. In every way they were legitimately free, independent, sovereign states just as our nation is today. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been said, that came to an end in August 1939 with the signing of the notorious Molotov-Ribbentrop pact-a peace treaty, a peace pact or a non-aggressive pact between the Soviet Union and Germany in an attempt by Hitler to fend off the risk of war on his eastern front at the time that he was about to go to war with Britain and Europe. One of two secret protocols attached to that non-aggressive pact annexed the Baltic nations to Moscow within the sphere of influence- sharing that was contained in the agreement. It is only in the last 12 months that Moscow has been prepared to accept even the existence of those secret protocols, despite the fact that they have been published around the world in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia face a totally different situation from any of the other Soviet republics. They are not legitimate members of the Soviet Union. They have never been legally incorporated into the Soviet Union and we, along with the rest of the Western world, have always stated quite firmly the illegality of the action taken in 1939 and consummated in 1940 and 1941 by the Soviets. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion moved by Senator Hill notes, first of all, the overwhelming votes in Latvia and Estonia in the last week or so, preceded a month earlier by a vote in Lithuania, in favour of independence from the Soviet Union. It was not surprising that the vote was so overwhelming in Lithuania because 80 per cent of the population of Lithuania is ethnic Lithuanian, only 10 per cent is ethnic Russian and the rest is essentially ethnic Polish. Of course, the expectation was that the vote in Lithuania would be very strongly for independence. </PARA>
<PARA> In Latvia and Estonia the situation was different. Only about one half of the population of Latvia is ethnic Latvian. Much of the remaining half is ethnic Russian. Despite that, something like 80 per cent of the turnout-and it was a very heavy turnout with in excess of 80 per cent of people participating-at the referendum last week voted for independence. There must have been a very large number of ethnic Russians who supported that vote for independence. The position was similar in Estonia on the same day where only 65 per cent, or thereabouts, of the Estonian population is ethnic Estonian, and most of the rest are Russian. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of the republics of the Baltic nations have voted overwhelmingly that they want to be free and independent. The first part of Senator Hill's motion calls for the noting of that overwhelming expression of view by the people of those three nations. Therefore, it also calls upon the Government of the Soviet Union to respect the results of those referendums, which of course the Soviet Government has up to date refused to do. As yet there is no indication that it will do so. But there is no shadow of a doubt that those referendums were legitimate; they were properly conducted and they reflected truly the aspirations of the peoples of the three nations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is despicable and reprehensible-almost unbelievable-that over recent months the Soviet Government has used brute force to quell the independence move in each of the three states-Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which I visited only 18 months ago. About 15 people were killed by Soviet brute force. Others in Latvia and Estonia have also been killed. Senator Hill's motion therefore demands that the Soviet Government unequivocally renounce the use of force in its dealings with the Baltic states and respect the normal modes of dealing between states. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, and most importantly, the motion expresses the belief that the Australian Government should join with other like-minded governments to press the Soviet Union to give early practical effect to the three referendums. Personally, I believe that there is much that the Australian Government and the Australian nation could and should be doing to put more pressure on the Soviet Union to recognise and act on the legitimate interests and aspirations of the Baltic peoples. It is not enough just to express the sentiments that have been expressed, for example, in the motion moved by Senator Gareth Evans I think yesterday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion that Senator Gareth Evans gave notice of yesterday does not really call on Australia to do anything; it just calls on the Soviet Union to do things. The rights of the Baltic peoples in this matter are so unequivocally correct and legitimate that it behoves all free Western and other democratic nations that believe in the rule of international law, that believe in basic human rights and basic proper relations between free and independent people, to make a much greater effort than we have been making in terms of pressure within the councils around the world in whatever way we can to press the aspirations, the legitimate wishes, of the Baltic people for freedom and independence. Therefore I very much hope that the Government will support this motion. The only difference is in the final clause. Senator Evans's first three clauses are identical with those in Senator Hill's motion. I am glad that the Australian Democrats are supporting Senator Hill's motion. I commend Senator Hill for moving this motion. It deserves the full support of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate the Government's support for the substance of this motion and to indicate that we will not vote against it. The Government's support for the substance should have been amply evident in the kinds of public statements that we have made, particularly in the answer I gave in Question Time just a couple of days ago indicating our response to the referendums and our very strong desire that that clearly expressed aspiration of the Baltic states people be rapidly translated into recognition of their right to independence by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics authorities. I do not think it is necessary for me to add now to what has already been eloquently said by other honourable senators in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a reservation about the form in which this motion is cast. That has been referred to by Senator Short. On balance the Government would prefer that a resolution coming out of the Senate directly address its target audience-in other words, that it call upon the Soviet Union give early practical effect to the referendums. Our preferred language in this respect was embodied in the alternative motion, which now appears at No. 131 on the Notice Paper. However, since the Australian Democrats have indicated that they are prepared to support Senator Hill's motion, it would be churlish of me to insist on the distinction at this point and, moreover, a waste of time. So I do not do that. In any event, I do not want to detract from the significance of this motion as a clear expression of the views of a House of the Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I repeat the point that it is preferable for motions of this kind to make a direct appeal to a foreign government where in fact it is a foreign government that is the subject of the motion in question. It might surprise honourable senators to know-but it is the case-that when these motions are passed, they do have an impact. Such resolutions are translated to the governments in question through official government processes, parliamentary processes. They are seen as an important expression of national will, national opinion, by the countries in question. They do have their effect. As a result it is important that, where it is appropriate to do so, the language of the resolution be couched in terms which makes the maximum impact on that audience-in this instance, to address the basic appeal, not so much to the Soviet Union but to the Australian Government to do things, makes it more of an in-house domestic kind of resolution rather than one that stands on its own feet as an appeal from a chamber of the Australian Parliament to an important international target audience. Stylistically, presentationally, in terms of its impact, there are some advantages in putting it in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA> In this instance there is no real further ground for preferring to change the terms of the Opposition motion. Quite often the Australian Government will resist the accuracy of suggestions in notices of motion that we initiate action or do something in some certain area because the clear implication is that we have not already done something whereas, in many of these situations, we have already initiated dialogue, we have already set in train some actions, we have already made representations and we have already pursued the issue. In those circumstances, we, as a Government, regard it somewhat inappropriate that we be called upon by the Senate to do something that we are already doing. That point arises quite often in the notices of motion that are given in this place. That is one of the reasons why the Government often has difficulty in accepting them simply at face value and wants to reshape them in certain ways. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to the final point that gets me to my feet on this occasion, and that is to say something about the process of treating notices of motion in relation to foreign affairs matters. In recent times-and there has been some acceleration of the practice-a number of notices of motion have been moved in terms which are genuinely desiring to get an expression of agreed parliamentary support for some particular cause passed by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> They are not just moved as a basis for scoring a political point against the Government. They are not being moved to create the foundation for a lengthy debate maybe two or three months hence, or maybe not at all. They are being moved because the senator in question genuinely wants to get a parliamentary expression, a senatorial expression, of concern of some issue on the record. They are moved often in the hope and, indeed, the expectation that the Government will accordingly be prepared to let the motion pass through the next day, simply on the nod, treated as formal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is prepared to cooperate in that process, when appropriate. There are many occasions when it is appropriate. Indeed, a resolution about the Baltic referendums, in the substantive terms of that moved, is appropriate this week. Indeed, a resolution about Sri Lanka, in particular one linked to the tragic assassination of Mr Wijeratne, is appropriate this week. It was also appropriate this week-although we do not want to overdo it, in terms of using the impact of these motions-to say something about the coup in Thailand and the Government's response to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not resist the appropriateness of these sorts of resolutions going through. However, we do have difficulty-I have tried to explain this to my counterpart and to the other parties here-with constantly finding ourselves confronted with notices of motion already given which are then the subject of representations to us just to accept them and to declare them formal, when we may have reservations of one sort or another. That then gets us into a scramble situation of seeking to move amendments or to get the motion withdrawn in its present form and, by leave, put in in some substituted form. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, we have taken the position that we are prepared to consider seriously and on their merits proposals for motions of this kind, provided there has been some prior discussion, some prior consultation, about the terms of the motion. It is not just a matter of the Government getting on its dignity and on its hind legs and worrying about nitpicking points. It is because we know the impact that these motions have overseas, because we want to maximise that impact and because we do not want to send any wrong or inappropriate signals that we do need to look at the drafting of these things very carefully. My plea to honourable senators is that if they want this practice to continue-and I agree that it is a desirable practice to have these things on the record-they get into some type of consultative mode with us before the notice of motion goes down so that, if possible, we can reach agreement on the text. </PARA>
<PARA> Very often, in my experience, it is very easily possible to reach such agreement. If we cannot reach agreement on the text, honourable senators have the right to move the motion in the terms they want, the right to put it on the Notice Paper and the right to pick it up in General Business time that week, if they want to give it that priority, or at some later stage. The Government is not denying that. We are perfectly happy to debate each of these motions on their merit in the terms in which they are moved. </PARA>
<PARA> I am simply saying that, where honourable senators are really about a non- partisan exercise in getting an agreed expression of opinion on the parliamentary record, it would be very helpful to the Government in the conduct of our international relations and in terms of getting these things right if we could go through a consultative process. I have to indicate that, unless we do have some such prior consultation, I simply will be unable to accept these motions as formal business and deal with them on the nod. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already communicated that position to the parties. I have made an exception for it this week in the context of Senator Hill's Thailand motion, but I do not really want to make any exceptions in the future. I hope that it will be understood from the nature of the explanation I am giving that I am not trying to score partisan points; I am just trying to describe the difficulties of having to scramble to pick up the pieces of terms of notices of motion which are basically okay but just need a little attention and reshaping to get them into a form which we will be happy to support and to see endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA> For another illustration of what I mean, I mention that specifically also in the context of the Sri Lankan motion, which is before us at the moment and which, I understand, Senator Hill proposes to adjourn. The Sri Lankan motion that appears on the Notice Paper is one, in Senator Hill's formulation of it, which not only expresses our deep regret at the assassination of the Defence Minister, not only recognises that the scale of human suffering is such that an immediate peaceful solution is imperative in Sri Lanka, but goes on to talk of the desirability of the Commonwealth initiating a particular peace process here. </PARA>
<PARA> There just is some difficulty about the Government supporting a motion of that kind, giving a formal endorsement to it, allowing the thing to go through on the nod. The difficulty-in a couple of sentences-is that we know what the Commonwealth's reaction is to such an exercise because we have already tested it. The Commonwealth has indicated an unwillingness to take this action unless and until it is stimulated by a request from the Sri Lankan Government. We have talked to the Sri Lankan Government about the possibility of it initiating such a request. For the moment that is on hold. It is a delicate issue that we want to keep in the forefront of the possible ways of resolving this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect, I acknowledge the very helpful contribution that Senator Hill has made in developing the idea of an Australian initiative and indeed a Commonwealth initiative. I do not seek in any way to denigrate or undermine the point that is involved in this. I am just saying that it is difficult and, we believe, inappropriate-maybe even counterproductive-for the Commonwealth Government to be supporting that motion in its present terms and, accordingly, we would want to redraft it. I did suggest a way of redrafting it by way of a notice of motion which I have moved. </PARA>
<PARA> This is just another example of the difficulties we have. As a result, it has made it probably impossible, in terms of available time, for the Sri Lankan issue to be now addressed, debated and an expression of Commonwealth opinion put on the record this week. In some ways that is a pity. I have said more than enough. On those issues where we are not trying to score partisan points but to genuinely express an Australian position in the international community on matters of importance to that community, I do think it is important that we get these processes right if we possibly can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In winding up the debate, I thank honourable senators who have supported the motion, in particular, apart from my colleagues, the Australian Democrats; and I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) for indicating that the Government at least supports the sentiment of the motion, even if it is not happy with all of the detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge the short lecture that we have had on procedures from the Minister, but I do say, with respect, that he has missed the point somewhat. Part of this issue is that we want to see the Australian Government do more than it has in the past. We want to see it join with other like-minded governments and press the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics at every practical opportunity towards the objective of the motion, towards the Baltic people regaining their freedom. I might say that the Australian Government, although it is in a better position at the moment than it has been, does not have a particularly good record in relation to the Baltic states. We will not forget, and the Baltic people will not forget, the position that the last Labor Government of this country took, which was to recognise their de jure incorporation. A coalition government had to reverse that position. Only recently in the debate on Lithuania, we had to strain-I think Senator Evans will concede-to get the Government even to accept and to use the word `independence' in the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> We really want the Government to be more up-front on this issue. We know that it finds some difficulty. We accept that the whole world has a worry about instability in the Soviet Union, the breakdown of law and order and the economic strife, but we do not believe that the answer is to go soft on this issue. We believe the Baltic people are entitled to their freedom and the Australian Government should have the courage to be up-front in saying so, and at every possible opportunity in international fora express that view. That is why we couched this motion in those terms, not only to call upon the Soviet Union to respect the vote of the Baltic people as expressed in these motions but also to call upon the Australian Government to be active in joining with other freedom loving nations to press the Soviet Union to respect the wishes of the Baltic people. I thank those who have participated and commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes with regret the assassination of Sri Lanka's State Minister for Defence, Mr Ranjan Wijeratne, which is part of a continuing cycle of death and devastation in the seven-year civil war which has claimed the lives of at least 14 000 people;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) recognises that the scale of human suffering is such that an immediate and urgent solution to the unrest in Sri Lanka is imperative; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) calls on the Commonwealth, as an appropriate organisation, to initiate dialogue with the Sri Lankan Government, with a view to offering its offices to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) seek to negotiate a ceasefire,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) examine whether the Commonwealth could contribute by monitoring the ceasefire and thus giving confidence to the parties involved,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) explore the possibility of a Commonwealth role in peace talks,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) help the parties by identifying the legal, constitutional, institutional and other changes which might be necessary to ensure a lasting peace; and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) examine what assistance Sri Lanka would need for its economic reconstruction. </PARA>
<PARA>As has been mentioned, I have agreed that the debate be adjourned to some appropriate moment, in particular to allow the Australian Democrats to further consider the detail in paragraph (c) which calls upon the Commonwealth to take action to try to help Sri Lanka towards a settlement of this ongoing tragedy. I do not need to relate to the Senate in the motion that I have put down the circumstances of that tragedy in any detail. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the fact that it is estimated that this civil war, and I think it is fair to call it a civil war, has claimed the lives of at least 14,000 people, including-as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) mentioned, and as I have put in the motion as drafted-the assassination of the Sri Lankan Defence Minister only a few days ago, which is just a further step in this ongoing tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have sought to do-and I thank the Minister for his acknowledgment and, in return, I am more than happy to recognise the contribution that the Federal Government has been prepared to make on this issue-is find some process that might break the deadlock that is occurring in Sri Lanka. </PARA>
<PARA> It occurred to the Opposition, in seeking to identify an international body that might be able to help, that the Commonwealth might be uniquely well-placed to fill that role. A basis of our reasoning for that was the fact that the nations of southern Asia are part of the Commonwealth and that it is a multi-racial body. It is, in some ways, searching for useful functions. There is a high level process taking place, which started after the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, to look for new roles and useful tasks for the Commonwealth. It struck me that the Commonwealth was a body with goodwill and experience in these areas that could use such faculties to perhaps assist Sri Lanka in finding a way through the communal differences that are at the basis of this ongoing tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> We floated that idea with a number of Sri Lankan organisations in this country-Tamil organisations and Singhalese organisations-and it received, overall, strong support. We then put it to a number of the non-government organisations (NGOs) in Australia under the umbrella group of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid. The NGOs indicated to us that they thought it was an idea with merit. We then put it to the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth; I did so by telephone and then later personally. The Commonwealth, through him, expressed some interest in the proposal but, as Senator Evans said in the previous debate, it said it believed that the initiative should come first from the Sri Lankan Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We called upon the Australian Government to help us in that regard. Senator Evans, when in Sri Lanka last year, raised the issue with President Premadasa. That was followed by correspondence between the President and the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). As I said a moment ago, we appreciate the fact that the Australian Government was prepared to pick up the idea and try to push it along. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, international aid organisations have continued to consider it a worthwhile idea. Civil war has not in any way ended; the saga of death and injury continues. International NGOs have been raising the issue and are suggesting that it is perhaps a mechanism which should be pursued further. I make particular mention of the lobbying that has taken place from the Refugee Council of the United Kingdom, Oxfam of the United Kingdom and CAFOD of the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Commonwealth, through the head of its secretariat, felt that the initiative must first be taken by the Sri Lankan Government, its own human rights section is particularly interested in the initiative and is encouraging it. I also place on record our appreciation for the very active support that the initiative has received from Amnesty International, which is putting in considerable effort to try to arouse international opinion towards supporting this idea. </PARA>
<PARA> It seemed to us that, after the Commonwealth adopted the position that it needed an initiative, or an invitation, from the Sri Lankan Government, the next best step was to encourage Commonwealth nations generally to informally urge the Sri Lankan Government to give that invitation-in much the same way as the Australian Government was prepared to do. We have been in the process, through NGO work particularly, of encouraging Commonwealth governments to support the idea. In turn, the NGOs have also been doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not say that the idea has languished. It has not, because there has been quite a lot of international activity for its support. Nevertheless, the Sri Lankan Government has not been prepared, as yet, to issue an invitation. On the other hand, the Commonwealth has not been prepared to take the initiative. That is what I want to achieve through this motion. It will be a good idea if the debate is adjourned because that will give the Australian Government some further time to reflect on it. I think that the Commonwealth can do more in taking an initiative. I accepted, on first blush, the Secretary-General's view that it was necessary to wait for the Sri Lankan Government to call for help, but I think Commonwealth countries can join together and, through their various means, communicate with the Sri Lankan Government and therefore be more active in offering help. Perhaps if they did so the Sri Lankan Government would be more receptive to help. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that this conflict will not be resolved through military means; the killing will simply continue for a while. The Sri Lankan Government feels that it is getting the upper hand. Its military will apply pressure for a military solution, but it will not be resolved through military means alone; it will be achieved only through a political solution. That is why we have said that the Commonwealth might be able to help the Sri Lankan Government not only in negotiating a ceasefire but also after that in looking for ways in which it might facilitate or help build bridges between the communities in Sri Lanka. It might be able to help by hosting the peace talks in some way. It can give thought to the legal, constitutional, institutional and other changes that might be necessary to ensure a lasting peace. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, it can bring its international experience to bear to help in that regard. It has that experience; it has the capacity to do so. It can then address the sort of international effort that would be needed to help Sri Lanka with its economic reconstruction because a cost of this ongoing conflict has been an economic one and the enormous suffering which has resulted from the economic consequences of an ongoing civil war, apart from the other consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> I will leave it at that, unless honourable senators wish to contribute further. At this stage I suggest we adjourn the debate on this motion until the next day of sitting. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted; debate adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes with concern:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the recent ANOP survey which shows that farm incomes will fall 67 per cent in 1991, resulting in a drop of $5 billion for the economies of rural towns across Australia,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the resumption of wool sales in the week beginning 4 March 1991 has seen a slump of 35 per cent in the price of wool, and that prices of corn, sorghum and other grains have fallen on commodity markets by $30 per tonne,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that while the Treasurer (Mr Keating) keeps telling us that this is the recession we had to have, the situation in rural Australia is far worse, with banks increasing their farm foreclosures and increasing numbers of farmers left with no other option than to walk away empty handed and bankrupt, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that the National Farmers' Federation and NSW Farmers' Association have, on 5 March 1991, handed to the Federal Government 35 000 letters from financially crippled farmers throughout Australia in an effort to demonstrate the severity of this crisis, but that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer chose not to meet this delegation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) congratulates those associations for attempting to bring to the notice of the Government the plight of rural Australia on which the future of this country depends. </PARA>
<PARA>In supporting this motion I remind the Senate that for far too long this country has ridden on the sheep's back. The rural sector, through its wool exports, has been the saviour of this economy time and time again. Finally, as might have been predicted, too many people have jumped on the sheep's back and broken it. Australia will just have to find some other method of transport. </PARA>
<PARA> What is really scary about this rural sector downturn is that the bottom has not yet been reached. Already, many people are really finding the hurt tremendously painful. Where else would one find 35,000 people to be moved to write letters to the Federal Government informing it of their plight? I would guess that for every one of the 35,000 people who wrote, there are at least another 10, and perhaps as many as 100, who are yet to put pen to paper and to cry out to the Government about their dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA> What has this Federal Government been doing about this dilemma? I remind the Senate of comments by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in the House of Representatives yesterday about certain Labor Ministers whom he said distort and lie about the past, manipulate the present, and are able to give false hopes about the future. That is a sad scenario. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls (ANOP) survey mentioned by Senator Brownhill in his notice of motion shows that farm incomes will fall 67 per cent in 1991, resulting in a drop of $5 billion for the economies of rural towns across Australia. Since that survey, the position has deteriorated enormously. I said before that the rural sector is yet to reach the bottom of this downturn. This survey is part of that proof. It says that farm incomes will fall 67 per cent in 1991, so the most we can experience in the rural sector downturn is about 20 per cent of the total impact, if one looks where we are this calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA> For farmers in Tasmania, the 20 per cent experienced so far has certainly been very evident in the pea and potato crops-not so much in wool, but that is yet to come. In the case of peas and potatoes in Tasmania, too many farmers have had to plough their produce back into the paddock because of the lack of demand, because of the state of the economy, and because of some of the cash resource problems of the processors which can no longer find themselves able to afford to pay the cost of storage while waiting to sell their goods. I am talking about the canneries, particularly Edgells, which is part of the Petersville group, and which is experiencing some tragic cash flow problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately this has happened to the pea farmers before. In preparation for such an event occurring they have been paying a certain percentage of their income from previous pea crops into a fund to compensate those fellow pea growers whose crops are left in the ground-a very sensible device. Mind you, the fund will be able to pay considerable compensation for one year but certainly not for two or more. Farmers, naturally, are quite resourceful people, particularly in Tasmania where the Acting Deputy President, Senator Aulich-I note him nodding with approval-and I come from. They are resourceful and resilient as can be seen by their advertisements in newspapers inviting the general public to come to pick peas for themselves. Senator Bell well knows the scenario, as he was teaching for a time on the north-west coast. Many of them, as we all know, are starting to bale the pea straw and sell it to nurseries in the hope they will be able to get some money to recover their costs for seed, fertiliser and irrigation. Unfortunately, little if any profit will be made.</PARA>
<PARA> This illustrates very well the impact of the downturn in one sector within the economy. The flow-on effects, unfortunately, of the policies which are predetermined by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the form of the recession that we have had to have are having an enormous effect on farmers. If farmers do not receive funds, they do not make machinery purchases; they do not go on holidays; and they do not spend as much money in the local stores. By the end of 1991 when the rural sector has experienced its full fall of not less than 67 per cent of farm income, there will be a lot of businesses in rural towns either financially ruined or certainly on the brink. Where all this will end is just too dreadful to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that Senator Brownhill's motion mentioned that the Treasurer still keeps telling us that this is the recession we had to have. That is an issue that goes down very sorely in the bush. In a recent Australian Business magazine there was an article by Geoffrey Leahmann who raised the question of whether we are in a recession at all, or rather a long term decline. In Mr Leahmann's words, the word `recession' implies that our problems are just the result of a cyclical downturn. I remind the Senate that there is really nothing cyclical about Australia's worsening current account deficit. I would also add that there is nothing cyclical about the rural sector's worsening situation. The Australian Labor Party has a lot to answer for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I rise to support Senator Brownhill's motion and to remind the Senate, as someone who lives and works in rural Australia-when I am not in Canberra, of course-that it is hurting out there far more than Australians living in the cities realise. I speak as the wife of a farmer, the mother of a farmer, and the person who pays the bills for the farm workers on our property, so I really know what I am talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have listened at various times in this chamber to honourable senators from the Government talking about what Labor has done for rural Australia. What they do not mention is the exorbitant interest rates the farmers have to put up with under the Labor Government. They do not talk about the big overseas debt that we have acquired under this Government. They do not talk about the high fuel prices that we have under the Labor Government-which they do nothing to try to bring down. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Brownhill's motion before us notes that farm incomes will fall 67 per cent in 1991, resulting in a drop of $5 billion for the economies of rural towns across Australia. The resumption of wool sales in the week beginning 4 March has seen a slump of 35 per cent in the price of wool, and corn, sorghum and other grains have fallen on the commodity markets by $30 per tonne. That sorghum really worries me because we have 140 acres planted at home and we know jolly well by the time we get the seed, and the fertilisers, and the fuel-here let me say that unfortunately this Government took off the subsidies from fertiliser which makes it even more expensive-and we pay wages, we will know that expenses have gone up and the price we are going to get on the market has gone down. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Treasurer, Mr Keating, keeps telling us that this is the recession we had to have, the situation in rural Australia is far worse. The motion continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . with banks increasing their farm foreclosures and increasing numbers of farmers left with no other option than to walk away empty handed and bankrupt . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then points out that the Government had been handed 35,000 letters from `financially crippled farmers throughout Australia in an effort to demonstrate the severity of this crisis, but that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer chose not to meet this delegation'. It is good to know that so many Opposition members and senators-Mr Kerin was also there-went out to the front of Parliament House when those 35,000 letters were brought in by truck. We know, from what those farmers told us, how they are hurting. The motion also says that we should congratulate those who have attempted to bring to the Government's notice `the plight of rural Australia on which the future of this country depends'. </PARA>
<PARA> I can tell honourable senators that when these farmers send their letters to Canberra, it is not a publicity exercise. They are facing massive reductions in incomes; they are facing what is being quite commonly referred to in the press as `our rural crisis' all across the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The profound shift in Australia's export earnings from farm products to other economic sectors has left primary producers with shrinking incomes. The far-reaching changes that this shift is engendering are by no means complete, although they are being speeded up by historically high interest rates and the impact of technology on such areas as the fibre market. These changes mean that we cannot afford simply to sit back and wait for the farm sector to be virtually depopulated. That really is what is starting to happen all over Australia. It is not only happening in the south Burnett where I come from but also in so many other rural areas. It is in the interest of everyone to control the process, to ameliorate its worst effects and to approach the whole issue with a balance of sympathy and energy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that rural producers are suffering. They are being hit by fuel pricing policies which might make a great deal of sense in bureaucratic compact Canberra but which add intolerably to the cost of living in remote parts of the country. These fuel pricing policies mean that the Federal Government Treasury coffers and the exchequers of the States, which impose the fuel taxes, are garnering rich profits from the crisis in the global oil market. This Government still believes that we need world parity pricing to demonstrate that we are fair dinkum about being part of the real world. In contrast, most people would argue that the national interest demands that we should seek to minimise the impact that events such as the Gulf war can have on our pockets through petrol prices and their effects on other costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, farmers are also being made to face financial risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices. Down the track, some of them will face virtual closure of their markets through changing demands and the advance of technology. Urban Australians-the great majority of this country's people-have very little grasp of the realities of making a living in the bush. To them, the country is a place to drive through on the way to a holiday. The problems of sheep farmers in the west, like those of Longreach grazier, Ron Button, which were featured recently in the Courier-Mail, are gross and intractable. Mr Button runs 9,000 sheep on a 12,000 hectare property, a business his family has been in for a century. This year will be very hard for him. Rising production and commodity prices, coupled with diving wool prices, are expected to reduce the family's income by more than 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Button would not be the only one who will suffer in that way. I am not referring, of course, to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) when I am talking about this gentleman. Imagine the hullabaloo if workers on award wages were told that their pay packets were to be slashed by nearly one-third over the next 12 months. I can just imagine what honourable senators opposite would say if that were likely to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Where it has not already fallen prey to agribusiness, the farm sector is very much a family affair. Yet such farms rarely make enough profit to pay each productive family member a living wage. I know about that because I have personal experience in this area. To that extent, farms are small businesses and should be seen as such by the tax man and the bureaucracy. But regrettably the tax man does not look upon it like that. Small wonder in these circumstances that farmers are getting restive. According to the President of the Queensland Farmers Federation, they are also getting ready to take to the streets. We had one example of that down south not so very long ago. Mr Lyndsay Hall, the President of the Queensland Farmers Federation, said that Queensland farmers will back a move by the National Farmers Federation (NFF) for direct action to highlight the fact that thousands of their colleagues are going broke. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one of those moves was the 35,000 letters which the Government received this week. I certainly believe that the Government should not be surprised if farmers decide to take further direct action. And yet, over the past months we have heard members of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) saying that there is no rural crisis. Mr Bill Bonthrone, the United Graziers Association President, said in a recent newspaper article:</PARA>
<PARA> The rural crisis was driving conservative, law-abiding citizens to call for militant action. </PARA>
<PARA> The anger is now so deep that only the catalyst is needed for an emotional explosion from the family. It could be fuel prices and interest rates that provide it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government and many of its members representing rural areas in my own State of Queensland do not seem to realise that there is a crisis in rural Australia. After many months of telling the Government what was happening, only late last year the Chairman of the ALP Caucus primary industries committee, the honourable member for Hinkler, Mr Brian Courtice, told the Australian Rural Times:</PARA>
<PARA> I certainly do not believe or agree rural Australia is in crisis or about to collapse, but there is no doubt wool and wheat have difficulties to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, since he talked about that in the House of Representatives, there is no doubt that the crisis has come as far as wool producers are concerned and the problem regarding wheat growers is still to arise. I am sure that that will not be far away either. I do not think Labor politicians will be very popular in the electorate of Hinkler. Mr Courtice said that the Government's monetary policy was correct and that any easing of the policy could see demand go through the roof again. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Rob Hulls, who took the late Bob Katter's place as the member for Kennedy, is a man who should know better than most ALP members about the plight of those in rural Australia as his electorate covers most of north-west Queensland. He rejected claims too that rural Australia was at crisis point. He said instead that the economic policies of the Government were working. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies to Mr Lavarch, the honourable member for Fisher, the electorate which adjoins the electorate of Wide Bay in which I live. He said that the suggestion that the rural economy was going to collapse as a result of high interest rates was an oversimplification. Perhaps Mr Lavarch should speak to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who has admitted that his Government's high interest rate policy was causing undue hardship and damage. </PARA>
<PARA> Another member that they should also speak to is Mr Lloyd O'Neil, who said that many farmers might be asset rich but were income poor, particularly with the rural downturn. I have no doubt Mr O'Neil is certainly telling them the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond doubt, the farm sector must live with the strictures that apply to all components of Australian society. Nationally-and regrettably-we are uncompetitive in world terms. We are paying for past delusions. We must, though, recognise the need to regulate the effects of fast-moving change on sectors of the economy which impinge heavily on individual lives. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to a letter that was recently published in the Brisbane Courier-Mail. The letter contains the comments of an ordinary Australian who is fed up with what is happening to his country and makes a plea to the Government to recognise finally the mess we are in. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA> I have had enough of watching the Australian Treasurer, Paul Keating, telling us his economic policies are working. We have:</PARA>
<PARA> Record current account deficits. </PARA>
<PARA> The highest continuous interest rates historically, which are doing irreparable damage not only to small business, but to grazing and farming industries as well as the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The greatest number of small business collapses in our history outside the great depression; an Australian dollar so high it has priced the export industries off world markets and dramatically reduced our opportunities to trade; a national debt which has, in only a few years, escalated out of all proportion. </PARA>
<PARA>He also wrote that the Government has given us:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a wheat industry which is about to receive the lowest first payment for many years; a beef industry struggling for survival . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I must say that over the years the prices in the beef industry have been reasonably good, and we certainly hope that they will not fall dramatically in line with wool and wheat prices. We all know that there are escalating costs and charges, as I said earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot claim that the rural crisis has only just hit. It has been warned continuously for years, and the evidence to show just what is happening outside our major cities has been around for quite some time. As long ago as 1989 we read of disturbing figures which showed that farmers were losing money fast, with costs increasing at twice the rate of income. This is under a Labor Government which then has the effrontery to claim that farmers are pleased with the Federal Government. I do not know what criteria the Government would use to make such a claim. But I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that if your income is being steadily eroded at the rate where the costs to earn it are twice the rate of the actual income, then I am sure that if you are a thinking Australian you would know that you were going backwards and you would not be too happy with that situation. Perhaps some honourable senators opposite would be happy to see their income being eroded as quickly as that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not much point in producing something if it cannot be sold profitably. I have said many times at home to my husband, `I don't know why we are silly enough to be farmers, because you spend all your money on costs and you don't get enough back'. I think that is a very good point, but he does not agree with me, so we keep on farming. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, it is not much use to so rationalise our rural sector that we eventually see the demise of the family farmer-the person who spends unrecognised hours and efforts producing the end product. These are some of the problems, as I see them, from a personal knowledge of what confronts the man and woman on the land. I was very interested to hear the debate on the matter of public importance that took place today, when Senator Newman led the debate on how the present scene is hurting rural women. I am very pleased to have had this opportunity to speak to the motion which was moved by Senator Watson on behalf of Senator Brownhill, and I have very much pleasure in supporting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no argument with the figures presented by Senator Brownhill in the first paragraph of the motion. They merely confirm what we all know about Australia's farms-at least what is known by those of us who take the trouble to communicate with those who live and work outside our urban areas. I have no argument with the description in paragraph (ii) of the motion, which is a matter of statistics. I have no argument with what is contained in paragraph (iii) and the description of bank foreclosures on farm properties. It is a description of what is taking place and is a matter that we must constantly bring to the attention of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats would not dissent from the description given in the fourth paragraph of the motion which observes that the National Farmers Federation and the New South Wales Farmers Association delivered 35,000 letters to Parliament demonstrating the severity of the crisis. That event took place and it is to our shame that it was necessary. One of the reasons the event was necessary was that the people involved were feeling a sense of frustration because this Parliament has not demonstrated through its recent actions that it has understood the severity of the crisis facing Australian farmers. I would like to look at some recent actions in this Parliament and, for Senator Crane's benefit, I shall not refer to the recent wool debate debacle but, instead, to actions which took place earlier today. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me look at the actions taken during discussions on the social security legislation. Senator Alston described our present economic framework as this Government's `failed economic policies'. I do not intend to debate that matter right now, but what I noticed when that action was taking place was that rather than provide Australia with a set of detailed alternatives, the honourable senator then proceeded to berate the Australian Democrats for showing concern for those affected by those failed polices. There was more than a hint of jealousy lurking in Senator Alston's remarks. I wonder why he saw the need to moan about the Australian Democrats for a full seven minutes of his 10-minute contribution to the debate. It seems to me that without the Australian Democrats the Opposition would have little to oppose because the coalition seems to agree with the fundamental assumptions of this Government's economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the approach to deregulation, privatisation, tariff reduction and targeting of welfare payments. It is the targeting that is causing what was described earlier today as `falling through the net'. The targets are defined with very little concern for those in the rural areas. By excluding from Government assistance and support so many of our Australian citizens who actually live in rural areas, this Government has revealed its ignorance of what really happens in our country areas and how the rural sector of our economy works. </PARA>
<PARA> In that targeting process, which is often described in this place with some pride by Senator Richardson, those families who own certain assets are excluded from certain benefits. Our farming sector is particularly disadvantaged. That sector of our community is sitting on a so-called asset, namely, the farm. The plight of rural Australia is made worse by this policy direction because farm families need to find cash to meet the shortfalls brought about by the very policies of this Government. Farming families, like all other families, need cash to meet the needs of young children. Although the family allowance is now not part of this target, the family allowance supplement is still put out of reach by the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> Austudy in particular is a problem because, to send a young person off to tertiary study-to leave the family farm, to live away, and to be set up with the clothing, textbooks, chattels and accoutrements necessary for that venture-requires the sort of cash that many rural families are now finding hard to lay hands on. If the potential supplementation of Austudy is denied through the assets test, then the burden is doubly hard. It is also hard because there is very little that those families can do to avoid such a situation. It is hardly possible to sell off a paddock in rural Australia today to pay for the education of a son or daughter. Such a notion, which I have heard expressed, is put forward by experts from the towns, because things do not happen that way in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from those difficulties, the fundamental approach to economic policy is an approach which is shared by both the Government and the coalition, but it has been shown to be completely misguided. A very interesting, entertaining and informative article in yesterday's Australian was written by Dr John Carroll from La Trobe University. That article substantiates the sorts of policy directions which would be supported by the Democrats and which have been espoused by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the fact that the Democrats disagree with the appropriateness of the economic tools of measurement which are used by the school of economists who have risen to manipulate the economies of Western democracies in the twentieth century; apart from the fact that the Democrats would challenge how we measure progress, how we measure the state of the economy and how we evaluate whether we are doing well or not; apart from the Democrats' contention that we should evaluate our resources in a finite sense and measure whether we are using them in a sustainable way or whether we are squandering them- apart from all those things, while we are operating within the present framework and using the present economic tools and devices, it is patently obvious that the policies of deregulation and tariff reduction have failed. If that is not apparent to any observer of what is going on in the Australian economy, then that person is obviously blinkered and unwilling to take an objective view. The policies have failed. The economy, the economic tools of measurement-they have all failed. This commitment to deregulation and tariff reduction does not work. More of the same will not produce a J-curve. </PARA>
<PARA> The beautiful figures are only beautiful in the eye of the beholder. Only one beholder still sticks to that terminology. Rather than more of the same, Dr Carroll's article proposes that we should recognise that this Government's present economic plans are based on the hope that Australia would either continue a mining exporting boom which did not ever seem to start, let alone continue, or develop export markets for other primary produce. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson said that it was not big enough. It was not long enough and it was never really there. To continue in the hope that such a thing will eventuate is really a cargo cult mentality which is pathetically misguided. Dr Carroll's article suggests two courses of action. I will quote from it in part. He says that the first course of action is to say that we cannot afford the imports, so we shall not have them; in other words, to forbid imports. Obviously, that is something which is politically and practically unwise and unattainable. The second course of action that he suggests is protection. He writes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In fact, it is the only course of action because to ban all imports will prove . . . socially devastating . . . Protection means Australian economic policy being once again governed by what earlier and wiser administrators followed as their principal and golden rule: balancing the overseas account. </PARA>
<PARA>The concept obviously sounds simple, but he gives further details:</PARA>
<PARA>The real choice is between two types of protection: protection done badly and protection done reasonably well. </PARA>
<PARA>That sounds simplistic as well, but he does give details:</PARA>
<PARA>Many economic rationalists still claim that the policies of the 1980s were right, they were just not given time to work. Wait another five years, or 10, and Treasurer Paul Keating's `beautiful trend' upwards will appear, by which is meant a significant number of internationally competitive manufacturers exporting vigorously to the rest of the world . . . The arithmetic makes this policy ludicrous, for `significant' means in the order of $20 billion in extra export sales. </PARA>
<PARA>Whether or not that is sufficient to dissuade people from seeing that such an argument is patently uncontinuable-if there is any such word-the other aspect to be brought to that discussion is the fact that the continuation of such a policy for another five or 10 years is, in itself, untenable. </PARA>
<PARA>The nation has suffered enough already during the 1980s. For the vague promise of the beautiful trend somehow appearing, exports being brought up to that sort of figure is really quite a frightening prospect because it is really only a vague promise. Further into Dr Carroll's article we are reminded, as I am sure many honourable senators would already be aware, of the recent closure of the Black and Decker manufacturing facilities. He reminds us:</PARA>
<PARA> The recent Black and Decker case illustrates the futility of gearing manufacturers to export. The Victorian factory, the only manufacturer of power tools in Australia, has just been closed. </PARA>
<PARA> Black and Decker had pursued a dynamic industrial policy, introducing new plant and equipment, taking care over training and investing in research and development . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These well-intentioned managers of this particular factory had invested in research and development, which had paid off. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>But production runs were too short. Export incentives would have had to be absurdly high to generate adequate sales, but Black and Decker could have done reasonably well in a protected local market. </PARA>
<PARA>It is our contention that such a local market should be seen not so much for its world competitiveness but for its benefit to Australia and also its strategic value to Australia-strategic in a social sense, as well as the usually emphasised military sense, and perhaps in an environmental sense-because to do what had been proposed just recently, to ship frozen potatoes from Canada to Tasmania to use in a processing factory located next to one of the world's finest potato growing areas, which Senator Watson has already referred to, is economic and environmental madness brought on by this notion that we have to be in the export business to survive. We do not. We can do everything we need to in Australia. For strategic, economic and environmental reasons, it is my contention that we should. There was another example given in the article that I have already quoted from of a Riverina company exporting pears to Japan:</PARA>
<PARA> The exporter was a medium-sized Riverina company which had done all that a government stressing exports might expect. It had found a good Japanese distributor which it had brought to Australia several times to observe the production process. It had regularly sent its own representatives to Japan. Its export was lean. But it could not match the advertising and sales expenditure of its larger competitors. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, out in the jungle, in the free trade world, even though the quality of product was beyond comparison, even though the practices that had been followed here were impeccably well advised, the competition that that particular company faced in Japan was out of its league. Here we had an example of a company which had spent millions becoming involved in that and had lost millions of dollars when, in fact, it was a perfectly worthwhile and viable company in Australia. That is the sort of company that we have no right to advise to change its act, to get into this export business, or to try to save the country by causing chaos to its own industry at home. We would be better advised to protect what we have, to look after what we have and to look after what we know as well. That is the sort of policy which can do a lot better than this misguided, misinformed and unworkable policy direction that we are trying to follow at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very first instance it is my belief that we need to accept the responsibility of applying a penalty to imports which is equivalent to the costs of production that we impose on our local manufacturers. We impose those costs as a society and they are accepted by our rural producers. I mentioned yesterday, in my short contribution to a debate on a report of the Dried Fruits Research Council, that we expect our primary producers to pay Australian award wages and all the add-on costs of employment, be they in the form of holiday pay, sick pay, payroll tax or the penalty rates that apply to shift workers. We also expect our primary producers to pay excises and tariffs on imported equipment, fuel and energy taxes and income taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> These sorts of things support not only the primary producers themselves but also all members of our society, and they are for the benefit of our society as a whole. Therefore, our society as a whole should also accept the responsibility of ensuring that whatever is imported into our country as primary produce should have applied to it a penalty which is equivalent to the sorts of penalties we apply to our local producers. </PARA>
<PARA> If such were done I think our primary producers would recognise that as bringing the rest of the world down, up or across to whatever is our level. Then we can start talking about a level playing field, which is a cliche so often trotted out by commentators. Then we can talk about fair play and fair trade. Then we can talk about looking after our rural producers. Then we can look our rural producers in the eye and say, `We are actually doing something for you. We are valuing your contribution to Australia's economy. We are ensuring that you are not the subject of unfair competition'. We can then accept the communication from our farmers and our people in the farming country of Australia, and we can say to them, `We are looking after you'. Until we can do that we suffer the shame of having 35,000 of them trying to communicate with us and trying to tell us that we are doing the wrong thing, which I believe we are. </PARA>
<PARA> We will support this motion because it expresses some of the frustrations that we feel when looking at the economic and rural policies of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the motion moved by my colleague Senator Watson on behalf of Senator Brownhill which really addresses four major tenets that affect the rural community. Those tenets are, firstly, that farm incomes will fall this year; secondly, the consequences that are arising from a slump of 35 per cent in the price of wool; thirdly, that we are gripped by a recession that we had to have, according to the Treasurer, Mr Keating; and, fourthly, the plight of rural Australia that has been so dramatically illustrated this week by the delivery to this Federal Parliament of some 35,000 pieces of correspondence that have been brought together by the National Farmers Federation (NFF) and the New South Wales Farmers Association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will deal with each of those tenets that I think we need to turn our attention to. The National Farmers Federation conducted a survey through the Australian National Opinion Poll (ANOP) which shows that farm incomes will fall by 67 per cent this year. A range of primary producers face massive falls in farm income. Cereal grain producers, for example, expect to lose 93.8 per cent of farm income this year along with wheat growers suffering 79.5 per cent, sheep meat producers 77.2 per cent and woolgrowers 66.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst is yet to come, unfortunately. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics says that although 1990-91 farm incomes are forecast to reach the 1982-83 levels in real terms, a further significant decline is projected for 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANOP survey also highlights major areas of concern for farmers including the financial plight of rural families; the quality of life in rural Australia; commodity prices; banks; government charges and policies; production costs and access to government benefits. If anyone tries to argue that all of these factors will not impact on government policies, then they must have rocks in their head. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to look very carefully at the burden of high interest rates and the high personal tax rates that so many of the Ministers of this Hawke Labor Government are guilty of collaborating on. I am reminded that in the Northern Territory and other areas of remote Australia there has been no adjustment to the taxation zone rebate scheme since 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The second tenet of the motion refers to the price of wool slump-some 35 per cent. The future for commodity prices is bleak. According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, world market prices for our commodity exports are likely to decline in real terms. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics also warns as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>If the slowdown in world economic growth were to be sharper and more protracted than assumed then medium term commodity market prospects would deteriorate further. </PARA>
<PARA>The third tenet concerns the recession that we had to have, according to Keating. Of course, people are waiting for the industry statement on 12 March to hear what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has to say about the future of industry in this country and, more importantly, how Mr Hawke and his colleagues intend dragging Australia out of Mr Keating's induced recession. Australia is now in a recession at least as bad as the one of 1983; in fact, it is now said to be the worst since World War II. Who can forget the words of Treasurer Keating in the last year or so? Let me quote some of them. `We won't let there be a recession'. Another one was, `We are bringing home the bacon'. Others were, `These are beautiful figures', `This is a recession we had to have' and, of course, `We have engineered this recession'. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth tenet of the motion refers to the fact that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are ignoring the farmers' delegations. Earlier this year the National Farmers Federation presented a submission to the Cabinet's structural adjustment committee in which it warned that the outlook for the farm sector was much worse than understood by the community or by the Government at that time. Indeed, it urged the Federal Government to address a range of matters in the 12 March industry statement. The accompanying letter to the Prime Minister from the NFF President, John Allwright, said:</PARA>
<PARA>If your Government is not prepared to accelerate the pace of industry reform, the farm sector may not be able to maintain Australia's mandate for leadership in the Cairns Group and the GATT process. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, a great deal of work is needed on the international front. Last year I had the pleasure of visiting a number of European parliamentary institutions on behalf of this Senate. I was deputy leader of the Australian delegation. We raised the issue of agriculture with members of the European Parliament. I will quote from our report which many honourable senators will have seen on their desks this week. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The discussion on agriculture, at times, was animated, with members reflecting their political interests. The MEPs generally stressed political, social and security dimensions of agriculture for their constituencies, regions and countries. They stated that some reforms, which resulted in civil unrest and demonstrations by traditional farmers, have been introduced within the EC. It was claimed that since the War, 10 million farming families have been displaced in Europe and that as responsible MEPs they must look after the people's interests. An Irish MEP said that he advocated differentiated support rather than overall support in agricultural subsidies and the EC should aim for this eventually. </PARA>
<PARA>It states further:</PARA>
<PARA>Delegation members were at pains to point out that Australia understands and appreciates their internal problems, particularly in the more depressed areas of the EC, which rely on subsistence agriculture, but maintained that with political will, reform and internal restructuring of the agricultural sector, the benefits will flow to all sectors in the economy, not only within the EC but throughout the world. Australian examples were given where government decisions have affected the rural sectors in the short-term but with long-term benefits to the country. </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday I also had the privilege of meeting again, during their visit to this Parliament, with many of those parliamentarians that I met in Strasbourg last year. I am sure that many members of this Parliament-the Senate and House of Representatives-took the opportunity to reinforce the views that we have to establish that we are not isolated. But it appears that the Government is isolated. I remind it that March is a make or break month. The ides of March is in fact upon this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government came to power on 5 March 1983. Now, eight years later, the Prime Minister faces one of the biggest tests of his political career with the industry statement of 12 March. Everyone is waiting to hear what the Prime Minister has to say about the future of industry in this country and, more importantly, how he and his colleagues intend dragging Australia out of recession. We want answers on unemployment. A recent Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd survey showed that the number of job advertisements last month declined 11 per cent, spelling bad news for school leavers going onto the market. We want answers on the economy. Australia is now in a recession at least as bad as the one of 1983 and, as I said earlier, probably as bad as any since the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> So far the Hawke Labor Government has refused to explain the nature and causes of our economic woes, let alone tackle the fundamental tasks required to overcome them. The industry statement gives the Prime Minister this opportunity. I understand that Federal Cabinet has considered between 20 and 40 possible initiatives, including tariff cuts, improved labour market programs, and improved depreciation benefits on new business equipment. Whatever the case, I trust that the Prime Minister will finally address the problems of people living in rural and remote Australia, particularly those experiencing economic hardship as a result of Labor's mismanagement-some eight years of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today we were reminded that International Women's Day will be held tomorrow. We should spare a thought for the 2 1/2 million women in rural Australia who, as my colleagues Senator Jocelyn Newman, Senator David Brownhill and Senator Margaret Reid so adequately pointed out today, are the real victims of inflation, unemployment and high interest rates. The Prime Minister's industry statement certainly has a job ahead of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting Senator Brownhill's motion tonight I will take a somewhat different approach from that adopted so far in the Senate. Before I do that, I bring to the attention of this chamber a couple of figures relating to Western Australia which are worth noting. It is early days in terms of our problem. After two months this year we have already had 468 applications to the Rural Adjustment and Finance Corporation of Western Australia, RAFCOR, for assistance. The total for the whole of last year was 199. Another figure that is relevant here is the number of people who walk off their farms and get the $30,000 to $35,000 walk-off grant. Last year the figure was 16; this year, in the two months to date, it is already 20-and we have not even seen the door open fully.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I challenge the Government. I am pleased to see that Senator McMullan and Senator Giles are in the chamber. I want to table a document which was sent to me from the Hon.

He is the Minister for Agriculture in the current Lawrence Labor Government in Western Australia. I would suggest that he is one of the few Ministers in that Government who has any rational integrity. I ask for leave of the Senate to table that document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will restrict my remarks because I know that other people wish to speak. In the time available to me, I will run through some of the recommendations made by the task force which was set up by the Hon. Ernie Bridge in terms of dealing with the rural crisis. I suggest to Senator McMullan, Senator Giles and other Government members who are listening that at least in Western Australia we have a Minister who is prepared to tackle this issue head on by putting together a bipartisan group which has come up with some recommendations which should be adopted. I agree wholeheartedly with many of these recommendations but I will not pass judgment on them all tonight. Obviously there are some that I do not support totally. I congratulate that task force and Minister Bridge for at least having the tenacity and the decency to tackle this issue head on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will run through some of these recommendations because they prove that something can be done in Australia rather than stepping sideways and blaming international markets and events overseas. I would be the last person to deny that they have not had an effect, but there is a hell of a lot that can be done in this country to overcome some of the problems not only in rural Australia but in Australia as a whole. Many of these recommendations go far beyond the farm gate; they go to the business people who operate in country areas and in the cities. First, I will touch on macro-economic issues. The first recommendation is:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government should allow the Australian dollar to reflect the underlying strength of the Australian economy on international foreign exchange markets. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important recommendation. We have been talking about this for a significant period. But this has come from a task force set up by a State Labor government. If the Federal Government will not listen to us, surely it will take some notice of some of its colleagues in the States. The second recommendation reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government should review its macro-economic policy settings with the aim of achieving a further easing of interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, this is not only a very worthy recommendation but also a very achievable one. One might ask why Senator Peter Cook, who represents John Kerin in this place, is not here in this chamber when we are debating this issue. The next recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth and State Governments should hasten the process of micro-economic reform in all areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only is the task force targeting the Federal Government; it is also targeting the State Government. The pace of the micro-economic reform has been quite disgraceful. Day after day we have listened to Senator Collins answering questions on waterfront reform. While I acknowledge what he said today about what is happening, I also have to ask what the hell has been going on for the last eight years. One can go even beyond that. I know this matter backwards. I know about all the reports that have been prepared. But why has the Government taken so long to act? There has been very slow progress. Recommendation 5 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government should hasten the introduction of the recommendation of the Garnaut report on industry protection. </PARA>
<PARA>One could ask why the Government has waited until the twelfth of this month to even address this issue. At this point we have no idea whether the Government will address it. Recommendation 6-an issue of great concern to me-reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Productivity-based labour market reform should be encouraged by both Commonwealth and State governments as both major employers. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an enormous opportunity here for the Federal Government to do something in this particular area. When one looks at the abuse of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission which has occurred in recent times-I have raised this matter here before-particularly with regard to perishable products where we have the most callous application of industrial or union muscle being applied to helpless victims, one can say to those sitting on the other side of the chamber: why does the Government not address this particular issue? These are real issues, which the Government could help to overcome. These problems relate not only to the rural situation but also the Australian situation. Recommendation 9 in the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Financial institutions should be required, by legislation, to disclose the effect of annual rate of interest on all borrowings. This should include all interest costs as well as all associated fees, charges and taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, this recommendation could certainly expose some of the so-called rorts that Treasurer Keating has been carrying on about in recent times. There are activities which are available to the Federal Government whereby it can expose some of these things rather than using rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some 70 recommendations in this document. I have asked for it to be tabled. I have only touched very briefly at the edges of it because I know that others wish to speak on this matter tonight. I shall conclude by referring to just one other recommendation. I want to pose a question to Senator McMullan and Senator Foreman, who are sitting on the other side of the chamber, regarding this recommendation which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government should exempt all rail authorities from fuel excise on distillate . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that one of the most iniquitous situations is that trains have to pay fuel excise which goes into road reconstruction. I ask those two honourable gentlemen sitting on the other side when they have ever seen a train trundling down a road. The payment of that tax by the rail authorities is the hypocrisy of lunacy. Why do the rail systems pay fuel excise which goes into the road systems?</PARA>
<PARA> I shall leave my comments at that. The document has been tabled. I want to give other people an opportunity to make some comments. But I shall throw down the challenge to those on the other side of the chamber and those who do not have the interest to come in here and to listen to the matter we are now debating that there are some opportunities where some action can be taken internally in relation to the opportunities that have been recommended by their colleagues in Western Australia, which could go a long way to alleviating the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting Senator Brownhill's motion which is before the Senate tonight concerning the crisis in the rural community, it has been noted that the Government has just the bare number of people present-only the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is on duty, and the Whip; no-one else is interested in the debate. It is of great concern to me personally and I am quite sure to the rest of the community that the lack of interest in the Government benches is so marked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The increase in the latest balance of payment figures is $1.6 billion, seasonally adjusted. Yet we have the Treasurer (Mr Keating) calling them beautiful figures; to be expected; on course and everything in the garden is lovely. He tells us that interest rates will not come down, although he does say that the banks could bring them down one half of one per cent. But he has no intention of taking any action that will bring them down. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has asked time after time not only in this place but also in the House of Representatives when the Treasurer will resign.

No so long ago the Treasurer assured us that he would not allow a recession to occur, that he would make sure it did not occur.

When we had the inevitable recession, we then had Mr Keating saying that it was the recession we had to have and even proudly saying that he had engineered it. We had to have it and he engineered it. He knew just what he was doing.

<PARA> We have the situation where the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) took absolutely no action when the employees of H. J. Heinz Co.

Australia has come to the end of its tether; bankruptcies are the highest in Australian history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has the Government done to help the farmers? I will tell the Senate what it has done: it has maintained high interest rates. We have the highest home loan rates; we have the highest real interest rates, that is, if we take inflation into account; and we have an arrogant Treasurer who says that it will all be maintained. The Treasurer is so arrogant that he would not even pay his income tax until he got a special letter from the Commissioner of Taxation saying, `Please, will you put in your tax return for this year? And, by the way, your tax return from last year is not in either'. The arrogance of the Treasurer is unbelievable, while other people get penalised if they are at all late. </PARA>

<PARA> I think, for example, that Senator Crane was at least one who made some attempt to look at issues that might be constructive-things that he thought the Australian Government might do that would be of assistance. I am not being critical of Senator Crane; I thought his was the most constructive contribution. Senator Crane raised certain issues that he thought the Australian Government should undertake, but none of them seemed to me to be things which were the policy of his Party or of the Opposition. He is entitled to raise issues without them being the policy of his Party or the Opposition; it is a democracy and this Senate is a chamber in which he is entitled to raise those issues. It seemed to me passing strange that the honourable senator would come in, raise issues about diesel excise, et cetera, indicating that he thought they were matters that the Australian Government should consider taking up when, in fact, they were not the policies of his Party. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, we found a number of the proposals being put up in terms of criticism of the Australian Government did not reflect the policies of the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance entitled Hospital Costs and Health Insurance because this is a major issue in the Australian community. It will not go away because, as the Australian population ages, health and health insurance will continue to be a major concern for policy makers and for us as politicians and parliamentarians in the coming years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee's terms of reference arose from the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. The Committee's broad reference was to report upon the effectiveness of the current health insurance industry structure. In particular, I will confine myself to the problems of Medicare. In the second reading debate on the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, my colleague former Senator Puplick described the Bill as:</PARA>
<PARA>the next step to patch up this ramshackle, shambling and discredited health system of Medicare . . . in the face of all evidence that what Medicare in fact requires is radical surgery. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Puplick's comments still ring true today. The Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Howe, has set up a number of inquiries to look into the present system, the national health strategy being the major one. We can only hope that out of all the inquiries and reports the Minister can implement some much needed reform. </PARA>
<PARA> This evening I particularly want to set the record straight in one part of the health debate, that is, the funding of Medicare. There seems to be a myth amongst the community that the Medicare levy, currently 1.25 per cent, covers the entire cost of medical and public hospital services. In fact, nothing is further from the truth. The Select Committee's report notes that expenditure on Medicare for 1989-90 was $7,497m, comprising $3,526.8m for hospitals and $3,969.8m for medical services. The Medicare levy raised $2,545m. The message that must be said again and again is that the Medicare levy contributes only one-third of the funding that is outlaid on Medicare programs. The Medicare levy does not cover medical and hospital costs in Australia-it covers one-third. The balance comes from general revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Until that one-third figure is indelible in the psyche of Australians, we will have the myth that Medicare is a panacea for the illness of the Australian community. It would be an interesting exercise to find out what percentage of the public are aware of this fact. Surveys show that 70 per cent of the community think Medicare is wonderful. That is the 70 per cent who have not tried to get into a public hospital. I bet the other 30 per cent have been on the hospital waiting lists. A fact that is not known by the community is that the costs of their demands for public hospital and medical services significantly exceed the contribution that they make to cover those costs in the form of their levy. </PARA>
<PARA> This is one of the fundamental problems with the Medicare system. The absence of any real price signal means that the demand for medical services in particular is too high. However, the distortions on the supply side cannot be forgotten. Without any notion of the true cost of services demanded and supplied, it is no wonder that there is an overdemand for and oversupply of medical services. The recently released Deeble report provides figures that indicate the overdemand and oversupply. Included in the report is the estimate that the cost of health care could rise by 44 per cent in real terms in the next decade, and that is just terrifying. Put simply, Medicare encourages the wasteful use of Australia's health care system. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be interesting to see whether the Government moves in the same direction and introduces a price signal as it did recently with the introduction of a $2.50 charge for pharmaceuticals. So far there has been no move in that direction. The Government has been purely hypocritical in this approach. The Government has been tinkering at the edges- `We will not let people going overseas have Medicare cover because they go away without full insurance and, because they do not understand their rights, we will take away those rights'. This is the sort of tinkering at the edges that goes on in trying to make some savings in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be no limit to the demand for increasingly costly medical services under this Government. This will not change as long as the Federal Government continues to spend only something like 3 per cent of its health budget on community health and prevention. The Government has succeeded in containing expenditure in a number of areas by, for example, reducing or cutting out Medicare rebates. I mentioned one of those earlier. The supposed high level of public support for Medicare will soon diminish if the Government continues to cut rebates and pass on the costs in the form of higher out of pocket payments by individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I wish to raise is that of underfunding of the public hospital system. The Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Howe, has admitted that public hospital capital expenditure was running at 7 per cent and 8 per cent of recurrent costs through the 1960s and early 1970s and has declined to 3 per cent in the 1980s. Capital expenditure on public hospitals has since remained at about the same level as that for private hospitals, although public hospitals represent 75 per cent of all capital stock. If we look at this appalling situation with regard to capital expenditure and add it to the problems encountered in the private system, we see that our health system really is in a critical position. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is making a good fist of destroying the private health industry. Today, just over 40 per cent of the population is privately insured compared with over 60 per cent when this Government came into office. By withdrawing its contribution to the health reinsurance pool, reducing the private hospital bed day subsidy and widening the gap between medical benefits and the schedule fee offered to private patients in public hospitals, and not permitting people to insure against that gap, the Government has massively increased the cost of private insurance, thus reducing the membership of and increasing the burden on health funds. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that a reduction of one per cent in private insurance membership equates to $120m in extra Government funds. It is no wonder that a number of the private health funds are struggling to keep their businesses open. What is the Government doing about this? Nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Senate Committee says that the maintenance of a high quality hospital system must be the Government's first priority. The Opposition believes it is vital that we have a healthy private industry as well and that it should be allowed to compete with the public system. If there is no competition, there is no increase in incentives and no incentives for efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs to restore choice and incentive, which are currently lacking in the system-choice for individuals between care in the public and private systems and incentives to take out private health insurance. What is needed is a system which will encourage the private sector and more appropriately distribute the costs between the private and public systems. </PARA>
<PARA> What we do not need is the current system that creates two classes of Australians: those who are placed on hospital waiting lists-and, as we were reminded earlier today by Senator Reid, many of those are older people-and those who are not. Those who can afford to take out private health insurance are guaranteed ready access to the public hospital system. No such guarantee applies to Medicare patients. </PARA>
<PARA> Only recently an Italian gentleman came into my electorate office in Clayton and said, `It is wrong; my wife cannot get into hospital'. I bet that, if he were included in a survey on Medicare, he would say that it stinks. It would not be polite for me to say exactly what he said to me on the telephone about the fact that his wife was waiting, not for elective surgery but for emergency surgery. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be extremely interesting to see what changes the Government has in store for the health system. With the report of the Committee in hand and the recently released second report of the national health strategy-the Deeble report-there is definitely no shortage of problems in our health system. These problems have been highlighted and should be addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Patterson for at least giving me the time to get here with leisure and to have the opportunity to point out that she clearly has not read the report of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance but has given us a preferred political speech from the Opposition that does not pick up on one of the issues in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very disappointing, and not of Senator Patterson's general performance. I could be tempted to try to counter what she has claimed in terms of the political statement, but we are theoretically talking to this report. I would urge Senator Patterson in her leisure time to read it. One of the things it said in its opening chapter was that the cheap, political polarisation of the health debate in this country is one of the principle reasons why it has been so destructive and why there is no immediate prospect of having a proper debate about health care and health care costs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting, and I note that the honourable senator failed to say to us, that this was a unanimous report; that the Opposition members on the committee actually endorsed it. They in fact endorsed Medicare in this report. That also, I think, was not brought to the Senate's attention by Senator Patterson. I think it is a shame because what this report says is that we should actually start focusing the debate on health care and health costs in this country on where the real problems are, not on beating up the old political rhetoric about Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the comments that Senator Patterson raised that gives me great pause, and one of the confusions often led by the Opposition, is that if we only allowed patients to pay a little bit then there would be a restriction and a restraint built into the health costs of this area. Then she proceeded to go on to say that sometimes the Government reduces the rebate and the patients have to pay a little bit, and this is outrageous because it is denying them their right to assistance. I do not mind which way she decides, but I do not believe she can have it both ways. This is an argument often used by the Opposition: let patients pay a little as that will put some restraint into the system, and then complain bitterly when there is some restraint put into the system. </PARA>
<PARA> But the other interesting and important point is that Senator Patterson fails-and the Opposition continues to fail-to understand that costs in the health care system are not engendered by patient demand; they are engendered by doctors supply--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, rubbish is probably a clear assessment of what the honourable senator assesses in this debate, but I do not think it is constructive and it provides no information. In this report there is an analysis that the usage of medical services is consistent over about the last 20 years, that is, it is not engendered by patient demand but it is largely led by doctors supply. Patients are not in the position to determine, as they are in other commodities, that they may want to purchase what they need, much less what is best for them. Until the Opposition grasps that the ordinary economic analysis does not apply in the health care area then it will continue to come up with the most amazing sets of proposals for health care policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently floated was the voucher system. I do not understand how the Opposition can do so; it must have seen the effects of the voucher system when it put it up as one of the five policies it had under seven years of Fraser-not exactly implemented, but at least outlined. Here it is telling me, or at least Dr Hewson is telling me, that he would like to see smaller government, restraint of fiscal policy and reduction of public expenditure; yet the Opposition is proposing a voucher system for health care costs that is bound to cost at least $1 billion extra from the public purse; that is a very conservative estimate, and there is no suggestion about where the Opposition will get the money from. </PARA>
<PARA> In this report there is the very important canvassing of the issue of waiting lists. What we were able to conclude is that one cannot conclude about waiting lists because there is no reliable data. I was interested to read an article in a medical journal the other day-unfortunately I do not have it; it is in Adelaide, so I cannot give the exact source. Certainly an Australian group of professional health analysts can tell us that the waiting list for surgery in Victoria is 20 per cent overrated; that is, one in five of the people listed for elective surgery is not in need of it. That should give Senator Patterson pause. In other words, what we have by waiting list figures are very, very rubbery indeed and we should be cautious about what we conclude. </PARA>
<PARA> What the report is able to say-and this is based on fact-is that when the Government proposed and actually contributed dollars of expenditure to reduce the waiting lists, that actually happened. By and large, that money, matched by the States over three years, was directed to reducing the waiting lists through opening surgical theatres, by increasing the professional staff who were needed-particularly nursing staff, theatre staff-and directly targeting, not so much the capital requirements, but the professional and administrative and operational theatre provisions, and the waiting lists fell. My understanding is that the waiting lists in Victoria have turned around and are slightly on the increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also impressed in meeting and talking with some of the professional people from the Health Department in New South Wales who told me that there are two ways of describing what happens in our public hospitals in this country. The Opposition claims there are 100,000 people on the waiting lists in this country, but the best figure, even though rubbery, that anyone will come up with is 70,000. That can be said, but it does not tell us that in New South Wales about one million people attend public hospitals in the course of a year. Some 50 per cent of those people attend through accident and emergency and are treated and dealt with within 24 hours. Of the remaining 50 per cent, 49.5 per cent are treated within a week. We can still appreciate that there are some 20,000 people who, at any one time, might be waiting for elective surgery, but if we continue to carp on the waiting lists and do not address the facts of what is happening in our health care system in this country we will continue to get this distorted view and the debate on health care poisoned by political rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much in this report that might help Senator Patterson and the Opposition. Indeed, we hope it will also help the Government, particularly through the Macklin inquiry. Our recommendations pick up the points about health insurance and the cost of it. We also make very significant recommendations in the area of private health insurance and recommend that there may even be an inquiry into this whole matter examining whether community rating and reinsurance is the way to go; it is producing its own inequities and problems, and it certainly is not assisting the private health insurance industry. That industry also needs to smarten its own game. We make comment about that in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate is not conclusive or closed in the private health insurance area. I would say the jury was still out, if it has even been appointed. But one point that has been overlooked, and Senator Patterson certainly skidded past it, is that people with private health insurance actually are the people who can then receive their service from the medical professions in the private system, and that is where the doctors fees are not capped; that is where the doctors are not constrained by the medical benefits schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the big complaints from people is that they say they have got their operation done through the private system and they have got a bill for many hundreds, even thousands, of dollars; this does not apply, of course, to most specialists, but there are some specialists charging well, well, well above the scheduled fee. They are only able to do that in the private sector for people who have private insurance. It is a very big area, and it is not assisted by saying, `Get people on private insurance and that will solve the problem'. What it will do, Senator Patterson, quite clearly, is blow out health expenditure in this country. She had better tell me whether she is planning, as the Opposition, to constrain health expenditure or whether she would prefer to go the way of America. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we have kept health expenditure at about 7.9 to 8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the last seven or eight years. In England, it is somewhat less than that. Canada has also got a reliable and reasonable figure. In America, with the mismatch they have there, the private system and free for all, their health expenditure is about 12 per cent. There is no way it will come down. Thirty seven million Americans are not insured and have very limited access to health care. </PARA>
<PARA> I would strongly recommend that we look very closely at the very good system we have in this country, focus on those areas of difficulty and try to solve them. If Senator Walters and Senator Patterson have that view, I would ask them to speak to their Opposition colleagues who sat on this Committee and concluded, as we did, that this was the way to have a look at it. Let us remove from the debate the issues that are not going to lead to a constructive addressing of the problems of health costs in this country-problems of ethics, of equity, of priority and of resource allocation; very large debates which we recommend should come into the community. My time having run out, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this Bill, which the Opposition supports, is to implement the provisions of the Hague Convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition. The Bill applies the Convention only to international trusts, not to domestic or interstate trusts, where it is possible that the law of the State or Territory may apply. States and Territories will be free to make their own laws to apply the Convention to interstate trusts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Convention was adopted in 1984 and became open for signature in July 1985. Pursuant to article 30, the Convention will not come into force until three countries have ratified it. So far only two have done so-Italy and the United Kingdom. A number of other countries have also signed it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hague Convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition is designed to address conflict of laws problems which may arise where some aspect of a trust, whether it be a beneficiary, trustee or asset, has a connection with more than one jurisdiction. This may arise, for example, where the settler and the beneficiary reside in different nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Problems are particularly likely to occur where one of the jurisdictions concerned is a civil law jurisdiction because they generally do not recognise the concept of trusts. The legal concept of a trust is peculiar to common law jurisdictions. The Convention requires civil law countries to recognise the trust; thus there is a clear benefit for common law countries, such as Australia, which become signatories. The Government has taken the view that common law countries should be seen to be enthusiastic about the Convention in order to encourage civil law countries, which do not derive a direct benefit in the same way, also to become signatories. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter I of the Convention specifies the law applicable to trusts and governs their recognition. The characteristics of a trust are set out. Chapter II is about the choice of law rules. Article 6 provides that a trust shall be governed by law chosen by the settler or creator of the trust and where no applicable law has been chosen, a trust shall be governed by the law with which it is most closely connected. This is determined by having regard to a number of matters set out in article 7, although that list is not exhaustive. </PARA>
<PARA> The present situation with respect to choice of law is complex. Where a trust has aspects extending over more than one jurisdiction, the common law rules of conflict of laws will determine which domestic system of law governs the operation of the trust.</PARA>
<PARA> Chapter III provides that a trust created in accordance with the law specified by the preceding chapter shall be recognised as a trust and what legal consequences flow from that recognition. The general clauses of the Convention are contained in chapter IV. These relate principally to conflicts of laws and other matters, including article 22, which states that the Convention applies to trusts regardless of the date on which they were created. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has particular concerns with respect to articles 16 and 22 of the Convention. Article 16 states that the Convention does not prevent the application of those provisions of the law of the forum which must be applied even to international situations, irrespective of rules of conflict of laws. The second paragraph of article 16 provides that if another state has a sufficiently close connection with a case, in exceptional circumstances effect may also be given to the rules of that state which have the character of the provisions mentioned in the first paragraph. It is provided in article 16 that any contracting state may, by way of reservation, declare that it will not apply the second paragraph of this article. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian courts will not give effect to foreign mandatory rules unless they clearly form part of the proper law of the trust. This article could create uncertainty for parties involved in setting up a trust; it does not specify what is a `sufficiently close connection'; further, it is discretionary in nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has been urging the Government to consider making a reservation to this article. Unfortunately, our representations have so far been without success. The Government has argued that there is a presumption that a treaty will be implemented in good faith and Australia rarely makes reservations, preferring unanimity between parties on the basis of an agreed text. The Opposition contends that the text of article 16 clearly envisages that states will have reservations in relation to this article. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore at the conference at which the Hague Convention was formulated, Australia voted against the inclusion of article 16 on the ground that it was unnecessary because the Australian legal system would allow foreign laws of immediate application to be taken into account without any specific provision for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's refusal to consider making a reservation is particularly disappointing in view of the fact that this rejection may be based on a mistaken interpretation of the opinion of Professor Michael Pryles, the leading Australian specialist on conflict of laws, sought by the Government on the issue of reservations. The briefing paper for the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) on `Reservations to the Convention', which the Attorney provided to the Opposition, notes Professor Pryles's opinion of 1986 that the choice of law rules in the Convention are very similar to existing Australian common law rules and that the only real point of departure was the second paragraph of article 16. The paper goes on to state that Professor Pryles was again consulted on this matter in February 1991, on the effect of provisions of this kind, and that on this occasion Professor Pryles `noted that while this is a departure from traditional Australian conflict of laws rules, it has no significant consequences'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has been in contact with Professor Pryles who expressed some concern that this is not an entirely accurate reflection of his opinion. While he acknowledges that the principle contained in the second paragraph of article 16 would be infrequently used, as a matter of principle of law it represents a significant departure from the common law position. For the few cases that could be affected by the application of the principle in the second paragraph of article 16, the consequences would, contrary to the suggestion of the briefing paper, indeed be significant. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia does not make a reservation to this article, it would not be the end of the world. But we should be aware that it has significant consequences. I understand that the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peacock, may be writing to the Attorney-General in the near future to set the record straight in relation to Professor Pryles's opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 22 provides that the Convention applies to trusts regardless of the date on which they were created. However, a contracting state may reserve the right not to apply the Convention to trusts created before the date on which the Convention enters into force for that state. Basically, this means that states can decide whether the Convention should operate prospectively or retrospectively. This is a significant departure from the usual application of treaties, which is prospective. Pursuant to this article, the Convention will apply to trusts created before its commencement, unless an appropriate reservation is made. </PARA>
<PARA> There would be an advantage for Australia in making a reservation in relation to this article in that Australian legal advisers would be given notice of the changes the Convention will bring about since it does not, after all, represent a departure from the common law rules. Naturally, it would be an advantage for Australia if civil law countries were to give the Convention retrospective operation, but even if Australia were to give the Convention prospective operation, it is unlikely that civil law countries would respond in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition urges the Government to consider making reservations in relation to articles 16 and 22. We have serious concerns arising out of the Government's refusal to lodge reservations to the Convention. We have formed the view that these issues are best canvassed in the context of an examination by a legislative and general purpose standing committee. As I understand that a decision has been made elsewhere than through the mechanisms of the Senate that this Bill be referred to the Senate Standing committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for a more detailed examination, particularly in relation to articles 16 and 22, I shall endeavour in the meantime to ensure that this anticipated exchange of correspondence between Mr Peacock and the Attorney-General takes place, and that might clarify or overcome one of the difficulties that I mentioned. I shall also take further instructions to see whether there are ways in which consideration of these aspects by the Committee might be limited to a manageable form, bearing in mind that I have received some representations about the volume of work that happens to be before this particular Standing Committee at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Trusts (Hague Convention) Bill 1991. The purpose of the Bill is to enact in Australian law the provisions of the Hague Conventions so that they may be given effect. The Bill is intended to provide machinery for identifying which country's law is to govern a particular trust and to provide guidelines for the recognition of that trust in accordance with that law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the name suggests, the Bill deals with the law applicable to trusts and the recognition of trusts. It is worth noting that trusts are a unique creation of common law countries and are generally not used in civil law systems. One cannot help wondering whether a large drain on tax revenue in our country is not in some way due to the invention of trusts, and I shall return to that point later. One may well wonder whether the comparatively speaking better state of the public exchequer in civil law countries is not due to the absence of trust provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention is designed to overcome potential conflicts of laws which may arise where certain features of the trust, such as its assets, beneficiaries or trustees, have connections with more than one jurisdiction. If the trusts are not recognised in one of these jurisdictions, as indeed is the case in civil law jurisdictions, the very existence and validity of the trust may be in doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Convention are mirrored in the schedule of the Bill which is divided into chapters and articles. Chapter I defines the ambit of the Convention and whether the arrangement is a trust covered by the Convention. Chapter II identifies the national law applicable to any particular trust and prima facie the governing law is taken to be the one chosen expressly or impliedly by the settler. Chapter III deals with the extent to which a trust is to be recognised in accordance with the applicable law by states that become parties to the Convention. Chapter IV contains a number of general articles, several of which limit the effect of the Convention in particular circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I have examined carefully the learned contribution to the debate that was made by Mr Costello in the other House and have noted his suggestion that there is sufficient uncertainty in articles 16 and 22 to warrant reservations to be expressed when we ratify this Convention. It seems to me at this stage, on a fairly cursory examination, that there is indeed some room for uncertainty in considering article 16. I defer further consideration until after this matter has been examined by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not share Mr Costello's view that article 22 contains similar uncertainties. I believe that it is fairly clear cut and certain and I cannot see the point of including that article in our further considerations. However, no doubt that also will be left to the consideration of that Committee. As a member of the Committee, I welcome the comment by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, that we will seek to find ways and means to limit the work of that Committee on this Bill, which does not require all that much detailed research. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to have the assurance of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) that the Convention will not impose new obligations on Australian courts to give effect to fraudulent or otherwise undesirable trusts. I am sure that everyone agrees that we already have a superfluity of such trusts in our legal and taxation system. I believe that the Convention allows precedence to be given to a contracting state's public policy. In other words, any amendments that we might wish to make in the future to our trust laws would not be impeded by Australia ratifying this Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to some considerations that I have indicated before might be made on trusts and their use in our taxation system. The classical distinction in the taxation of trusts and companies can be attributed to the general position that a trust estate is not a separate legal entity, whereas a company has a legal identity distinct from its shareholders. For some considerable time now trusts have been used for tax minimisation, tax avoidance and tax deferral purposes. In addition, the exemption of certain trusts from the need to furnish annual tax returns has been a catalyst for the use of the trust form for tax evasion. This has been compounded since 1984 by the ability of persons to transfer funds to and from Australia freely, even to tax havens, although the tax screening measures which were part of that have recently been found to be ineffective and have been dropped. </PARA>
<PARA> The need to extend the company tax regime to trusts was recognised by the legislation in 1981 when corporate unit trusts interposed in company restructuring were used for tax avoidance purposes. Division 6B of part 3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act was inserted to prevent these practices. However, these measures do not apply to unit trusts if 20 or fewer persons hold 75 per cent or more of the beneficial interest in the income or property of the trust. </PARA>
<PARA> These remarks are simply to flag our intention to bring forward legislation at the appropriate time to ensure that trusts which do not fall into certain categories which warrant an exemption are indeed taxed as companies are. The trusts that we would exempt from such a measure would be non-trading trusts in the public investment area, estates of deceased persons in the course of administration, trusts in respect of compensation for personal injuries and the general category of charitable trusts. I conclude by saying that in general terms the Australian Democrats support the Bill and look forward to the resolution of the remaining queries in the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the second reading debate on this important Bill, the Trusts (Hague Convention) Bill. I thank the Opposition and the Australian Democrats for indicating their support for the passage of the Bill which deals with what I am surprised to learn is a purely common law phenomenon known as a trust. I must admit that I had not realised that the concept of equitable obligations resting on a trustee in relation to certain property held in trust for a beneficiary was not also a concept or an arrangement known to civil law systems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I seem to recall reading in law school 25 years ago that trusts evolved, certainly in England, because the Franciscan friars, once they were seduced by the pleasures of living not in hedgerows but in buildings and yet maintaining their vow of poverty, arranged with the landowner to enter into what we now know as trust arrangements whereby the property would be vested in X, but the Franciscan friars would be the beneficiaries but, by not owning the property, would maintain their vow of poverty. I would have thought that Franciscans on the continent would have tried to do such a deal with their supporters also, but apparently they must have struck some other arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> That makes the point that this Convention is for the benefit of those of us who live in common law jurisdictions. In order to have the trust arrangement recognised and protected by civil law jurisdictions, which otherwise would find it quite an alien concept-particularly where the property the subject of the trust is in a civil law jurisdiction-it is extremely important that the trust arrangement be protected and subject to a regime of law which enables the beneficiaries and the trustees to be certain as to the legal principles that govern the trust concept, its recognition and its practical operation. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Convention is largely consistent with Australian common law rules of conflict of laws. I am told that adoption of the Convention would not require amendment of existing Australian statute law and would not cause substantial changes to existing Australian law. In particular-and I think this is important from Senator Spindler's point of view-it is true that those Australian laws which deal with matters of public policy and fiscal laws, as they are called in the Convention, would maintain their precedence. There is nothing in the arrangements that could be made by virtue of this Convention which would displace any taxation laws that attempted to regulate the use or abuse of trusts in relation to the moneys which should flow to the exchequer-I think that Senator Spindler adopted that particular expression. </PARA>
<PARA> I had a look at article 19 while Senator Spindler was speaking. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in the Convention shall prejudice the powers of States in fiscal matters. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the key to the particular concern which Senator Spindler expressed. I am not saying that he was not aware of that particular article, but it does merit being put on the record as being something which those who drafted the Convention had proper regard to. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also the case that mandatory laws relating to insolvency, succession, transfer of property, exchange controls, protection of cultural property, et cetera, are also covered as having the sort of precedence which they deserve. It is interesting to note that in the history of the evolution of the support for this particular Convention by Australia it was necessary that the Standing Committee of Attorneys- General have regard to the impact which the adoption might have in their various jurisdictions. It was in 1987, I believe, that they accepted that the Convention ought to be signed and in due course ratified by Australia. I think that some of them are interested themselves in enacting legislation to apply the rules of the Convention to what we might call interstate trusts; that is, trusts domestic to the Commonwealth of Australia but operating over State boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions have been raised about the matter of reservations which might properly be made to the Convention. Article 26 provides that a State may make such reservations in relation to certain articles. Of particular interest to the chamber has been the question of whether the second paragraph of article 16 is such that the Government would consider it necessary to make a reservation with respect to that second paragraph. It should be noted-and I do not want to go over the whole argument because we will possibly do this before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs-that the operation of that provision is attracted in only exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I think we need to concede, as apparently Professor Pryles indicated, that it could have significant effect in a particular case, those exceptional circumstances would arise, it is thought by the Government, so seldom that it does not consider it a cause for such concern as would warrant a reservation being made. In other words, I suppose that there is some trade-off, as Senator Spindler indicated, between certainty and uniformity. In this particular instance, whilst there might be some element of uncertainty theoretically introduced, given the fact that the second paragraph operates only in exceptional circumstances and admitting that it is subject to the discretion of the court-in other words, effect may be given, which is the expression used-on balance the Government believes that, because of the uniformity aspect in trying to get common law and civil law countries alike to adopt this particular Convention in its entirety and to encourage civil law jurisdictions to adopt this Convention by way of ratification, we should show wholehearted support for the Convention as it has emerged, though admitting that in the history of the putting together of the Convention Australia had misgivings about this particular second paragraph. That has to be admitted as part of the history of the matter. But it having been inserted and Australia, I believe, during that process having insisted on the adoption of the terminology `only in extreme or exceptional circumstances', I think the Australian Government takes the view that we can live with it; and the legal advisers can sensibly offer certain advice in relation to the operation of this particular Convention on trusts which operate in common law and civil law jurisdictions other than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also the question of perhaps a reservation to article 22 of the Convention. Once again, the goal of trying to attain greater international uniformity in the law relating to trusts is a strong inducement to the Government not to make a reservation in respect of article 22. I know that the Government considers that allowing the Convention retrospective operation will in fact better protect the position of already established Australian trusts where, as I say, for example, the property might be in a civil law jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that I have dealt with the question of reservations in an adequate, if somewhat summary, fashion. I believe that the Bill to give effect to the Convention on the law applicable to trusts and their recognition and for related purposes deserves the support of the chamber. I am particularly grateful to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) for his indication that he will try to facilitate the passage of this Bill through the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs so that the consideration, the deliberation, in that Committee does not become too lengthy. I commend the second reading of this Bill to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1990 is to increase the maximum levies payable for research and development from 50c to $1 a head, and the marketing and promotion levy from $1.50 to $2.50 a head on each pig slaughtered. The industry, through the Australian Pork Producers Federation, has requested the increase due to the fact that increases in the operative rate will allow the Australian Pork Corporation to maintain or expand its marketing and promotional program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present, the Government offers dollar for dollar funding for research and development to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. The pig industry currently pays about 0.35 per cent and wants to increase the amount. By doubling the legislative maximum to $1, there is the ability for the pig industry to lift its commitment to research to the 0.5 per cent level.</PARA>
<PARA> The whole range of research levies for agricultural industries is a positive policy. It means that these industries in Australia, matched with government support, provide a significant amount towards research in their respective industries. This makes Australian agricultural industries very productive as they are based on research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> Such advanced research within these industries means that the productivity in agricultural industries far surpasses that in other sectors of the Australian economy. In fact, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has indicated that the productivity level of agriculture in Australia was at least 50 per cent higher than it was for other sectors of the Australian economy. Consequently, if the productivity level was as high in other sectors of the economy, Australia would be a far more competitive country. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the legislation involves the $1.50 that pig producers currently pay per head for promotion and to run the Australian Pork Corporation. The Australian Pork Corporation and the industry have been involved in the new- fashioned pork promotions in an endeavour to increase the consumption of Australian pork. The pork industry wants to increase the levy for promotional activities from $1.50 to $2.50 a head. The actual increase in the levy to producers will be determined by regulation and obviously will be done over a period. The legislation will provide a gap or the ability for the amounts to be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> The increasing need for the Australian Pork Corporation and the industry to promote their products comes at a time when the industry is facing increased competition from international markets. The recent decision by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service in allowing Canadian pork into the Australian market will mean that the Australian pork industry will have to promote and market its product as free from disease and chemical additives. The industry will have to be one step ahead of its overseas competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noted in recent days the annual report for 1989-90 of the Pig Research Council which has been distributed to all honourable senators by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. This report draws our attention to many areas of research that are required in this important industry covering such highlights as nutrition and growth, health and disease, genetics and reproduction, welfare, processing, marketing economics, housing, effluent disposal and utilisation, communications, education and training. Of course, the industry takes that report seriously and it has some degree of relevance to all of the issues currently under consideration by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have as a member of my staff a press secretary who has a very good sense of humour, and probably something of a fetish with regard to pigs. It was very interesting that, when I mentioned this evening that I was going to be speaking on this Bill, she pointed my attention to a recent odd spot caption that she had picked up and added to her memorabilia collection. I would like to share it with the duty Minister Senator Collins and other honourable senators. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> A British expert says pigs are intelligent and choosy about what they drink. He found pigs shunned salt water but liked orange juice and milkshakes. However, he said they were not social drinkers and would not drink unless thirsty. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps there is a lesson in that for all of us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How do I follow that! The Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1990 is not contentious at all because, as we were told in the second reading speech by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), it is a levy increase which has been requested by the Australian Pork Producers Federation. It is also a levy which is appropriate and necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For me this particular levy is yet another example of the reasons why Australia's rural industries are clean and more productive and more attractive than many of their competitors both within Australia-as Senator Tambling has asserted with greater productivity than the manufacturing sector-and internationally when competing directly on open markets with international primary industry competitors. As Senator Tambling mentioned, the prospect of Canadian pork being imported into Australia is one which is not particularly welcome but which will bring a challenge to our industry, and our industry will be capable of meeting that challenge because of its productivity and its attractive product. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my contention-and I mentioned this earlier tonight-that it would be logical to subject a competing product from overseas to an importing charge which was equivalent to the sorts of production costs which we, as a society, place on our own producers. We, as a society, place certain charges on our producers and we give our producers the responsibility of carrying them. They quite willingly do so because they contribute to the community. As a community as a whole we should then accept the responsibility of placing an equivalent order of costs upon those imports which we allow into the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the logic should be continued to ensure that Canadian competitors in the pork industry face a charge equivalent to that which is put aside by our producers for research and development. We could follow that logic further and look at the other socially beneficial charges which we lay against our producers. That, to me, would be a way of ensuring that this Parliament could be recognised as playing its role in making the competition fairer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with that contention that I suggest we approach this sort of levy which has been passed with regard to several of our primary industries in the last few days, and I dare say there are a few more levies, charges and adjustments which will be coming to us in the near future. For the reasons that I gave at the beginning, we will not be opposing this Bill. It has been requested by the industry and is a desirable expenditure of money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to put on the Senate record information about the establishment of two new units that have particular importance in this place and in the understanding and consideration of Australians in general about matters to do with health and prevention of disease. I am drawing on the South Australian Medical Review, volume 4, No. 1, February 1991, which is the official publication of the South Australian branch of the Australian Medical Association and the South Australian Postgraduate Medical Education Association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two articles in this publication are worthy of note in this place. The first relates to the establishment of a unit to look at road trauma. The article states that a national road trauma authority is to be established. In mentioning the establishment of this authority, I acknowledge the driving force of Sir Dennis Paterson, an Adelaide doctor who was honoured with a knighthood in 1976 for his distinguished services to medicine. He is also the immediate past President of the International Society of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite often in this place we fail to notice that every year in this country about 3,000 people die from motor car accidents. That is equivalent to one 727 airliner with 150 passengers aboard crashing without survivors every 18 days. About 10,000 people are severely injured in vehicle accidents each year. In aviation terms, this compares with a 747 airliner with 350 passengers falling from the sky every 13 days. The 13,000 killed or badly injured in car smashes represent one 747 aircraft crashing every 10 days. </PARA>
<PARA> I presume that this article makes such an analogy to point out that if an airliner crashed we would be outraged. There would be inquiries and a horrified response from the community. But there is nothing like that kind of response to the 3,000 who die or the 10,000 who are left severely injured as a result of car accidents. To this point we have not had a serious national commitment to recognising the extent of road accident trauma and death. We do not even have a national injury register. Indeed, that is the first part of the program. </PARA>
<PARA> This program has enjoyed the support of the Federal Government, particularly Prime Minister Bob Hawke. As I have said, a national road trauma authority is to be established. Also, there is a proposal to establish a national register to collect injury data. We need to treat this matter more seriously. We need to put these facts on the public record so that people can recognise the horrific costs that these figures represent, the pain and suffering of those people who have to deal with a death in the family and particularly the pain and suffering of those who are left with members of their family severely injured. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, one of the regular recurring injuries suffered by the victims of car accidents is paraplegia or, worse, quadriplegia. There are not only very significant consequences for that individual and his or her family but also massive costs to the nation. The figures in this report indicate that road accidents are estimated to cost the nation more than $1.3 billion annually. It is quite clear that we are not outraged to the extent that those figures and costs deserve. We are not passionate enough about this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly congratulate Sir Dennis Paterson on his efforts to get the authority established. It has taken many years of cajoling and promoting to finally do so. We will now have a body that will be able to help us recognise the cost, the damage and the pain and suffering that result from motor car accidents. The authority has the bipartisan support of both State and Federal governments. As the authority establishes its work I hope that we see a change. Its principle functions will be to assess the causes of road trauma in Australia, in particular to identify areas of research that could assist in reducing the impact of road trauma; to advise governments on cost effective national policies that could assist in reducing road trauma levels; to take into account current industry practice and the need for international harmonisation of vehicle standards; to promote community awareness; and to identify the costs. Not only Sir Denis Paterson but also the governments, which have given the establishment of this authority bipartisan support, ought to be congratulated on getting this up and running. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to another item in the same report. The National Injury Surveillance Unit has been established under the national better health program. The Unit was recently officially opened by Hazel Hawke in Adelaide, where it will be based and administered by the Australian Institute of Health. This is another area that we have failed to recognise in terms of statistics, numbers and costs. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, injury is the single largest cause of death of people aged 1-45. More years of potential life are lost through injury than heart disease and cancer combined, up to the age of 65. Yet injury is a health issue which has attracted comparatively little research funding, even though investment in this area can achieve excellent results in prevention. </PARA>
<PARA> The unit has two main tasks: to develop injury control as part of public health policy; and to provide technical support for injury surveillance and prevention activities at the State, Territory and local level. </PARA>
<PARA>My colleague in this place Senator Cook has often drawn attention to the appalling statistics and cost of accident and injury in the workplace. I have just cited figures for road accident and injury. Yet somehow we still do not give those figures the same seriousness nor do we place the same significance on them as we do the figures for other causes that seem to be associated with more hype or more excitement. If an aeroplane crashes, we are very perturbed; if three times as many people-indeed, one in every 18 days, if I remember the figures-are injured in car accidents or at work, we do not give that situation anything like the same attention or recognition. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no routine national collection of data on the incidence and cause of injuries that occur at home, at school or during leisure activities. Again, this unit will be looking at that type of data collection. Recently, the report by Dr Egger on sports injuries in this country was released. I heard Senator Patterson in this place earlier talking about waiting lists and the appalling insufficiencies of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Egger said that the reason that many people are waiting for hip replacements in our orthopaedic units around this country is not the insufficiency of the medical services or even the hospitals but because they are asked to wait for the urgent treatment required by sports injuries. That ought to give us pause, particularly as many of those sports injuries can be prevented. </PARA>
<PARA> It is terribly important that we begin to recognise and to focus on injury, particularly as it is so preventable, particularly too because we have not actually put real understanding on the dollar costs not only in terms of pain and suffering but also in terms of health costs. Again, I remind Senator Patterson in terms of the stress on waiting lists. </PARA>

But Senator Patterson was claiming evidence about waiting lists to support a case against Medicare. I simply wanted to put that on record and to remind Senator Patterson what Dr Egger had to say. Until we actually have full information we cannot have an informed debate about health costs, about waiting lists or about the pain and suffering that go with accident and injury in this country. I commend my colleagues in the medical profession and in the national better health program for getting these two very important units up and running.</PARA></TALK.START>

Some propositions were put earlier in a genuine approach to address some of the key problems which are involved here and Government members are not even interested in them. How weak can Senator McMullan get to come in here and try to patronise me and to suggest that it is not Opposition policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other issue I want to address is the issue of the question that I asked in this place today with regard to the Heinz situation. That is a dispute that did not have to happen. It has cost $10m. It will send people broke because of stupidity. Why does Senator Ray not listen or does he endorse sending people broke? I suggest by his behaviour here now that he probably does. On that subject Senator Cook stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this is a matter in the jurisdiction of Victoria, not in the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>I invite Senator Cook to come into this chamber this very minute. Senator Cook committed the cardinal sin of not knowing anything about a dispute that is not a State jurisdiction matter but a Federal jurisdiction matter. The letter I have here spells out the situation very clearly. I hope Senator Ray is listening. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The award which covers food preservers at our Dandenong site is the food preservers interim award 1986. This is a Federal award to which H G Heinz Co. Australia and the Food Preservers Union of Australia are respondents. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote further:</PARA>
<PARA>A notification of an alleged industrial dispute was made to the Industrial Relations Commission of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Federal jurisdiction. Senator Cook did not have a clue what he was talking about. If there is one person who is totally responsible in this place for the abuse of the Industrial Relations Commission, in relation to its recommendations and orders, it is Senator Cook. Senator Ray is sitting over there. He said in this place, as did the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), that in terms of our foreign policy there was no place for appeasement. Yet every day of the year in this country we see appeasement towards the abuse of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Why does the Government not become consistent? A little bit of consistency in what it stands for would be appreciated. We on this side of the chamber, as we did in the other place, stood right behind the Government in terms of the Gulf. The Government cannot even say that about some of its members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely right. The Government cannot say that about its own colleagues; but we stood solid. When it comes to the umpire, Senator Cook's favourite word because he repeats it time and time again, honourable senators on the government side support the abuse of their umpire and a policy of appeasement goes on all the time. We see members on the other side of the chamber giggling away and chatting, and the man who has said that he will do so much for waterfront reform in this country and who has not even touched the surface is chatting away, glibly giggling. The abuse is particularly targeted at perishable commodities. Meat you cannot store, tomatoes you cannot store, and fruit you cannot store. Yet honourable senators sit on the other side of the chamber and allow the abuse of the umpire to continue while all of these tomatoes are being ploughed into the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Who are the big losers? The big losers are the babies of this country. We had a debate in this place today about the problems of women in this recession. The women of this country are the closest to the babies. Government senators support a policy of appeasement while, in effect, it is not tomatoes that are being ploughed into the ground, it is baby food that is being ploughed into the ground. I again refer to the letter. Point three states:</PARA>
<PARA>A notification of an alleged industrial dispute was made to the Industrial Relations Commission of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Federal jurisdiction. Honourable senators can mumble away over there-go for it Senator Ray. This matter was notified to the Federal jurisdiction. Senator Ray will probably stand up, as Senator Cook has done, and say that I have an obsession. I have an obsession while the person who abuses the current law in this country stands in this place. If honourable senators support this situation they should have the courage to stand up here and say that they support the abuse of the law, instead of being like Senator Cook who wanders around in circles and cannot answer a question. </PARA>
<PARA> Right now I want to mention some points of fact. I hope that honourable senators take note of these facts. This dispute was notified to the Commission on 19 February. Senator Cook had the tenacity to stand up here today--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are in their seats. I want to go through this. Senator Cook stood up today and he did not know what he was talking about. He came into this place and gave an additional answer. He chose, once again, to mislead this place. He committed the worst crime of all-a half truth. He chose to say that the dispute started on 20 February and finished on 4 March. But he was negligent, absolutely and totally negligent. I am sure that Senator Collins would not fall for that trap in terms of the waterfront. Senator Cook chose to ignore the other dates involved in this dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to take the Senate though this matter because it is important. We are talking about people ploughing into the ground their total year's earnings. We are not talking about the pay-packet of a week being ploughed into the ground. We are talking about 12 months of their income ploughed into the ground. Do honourable senators on the government side of the chamber-the gigglers-think that that is a fair thing?</PARA>
<PARA> On 19 February the dispute was notified to the Commission-the Government's Commission, the umpire. The Commission took note of the dispute and said that it would hear the dispute. What happened? On 20 February-the day after the matter was heard before the Commission-the workers went on strike. What an abuse of the law of this land. It is a disgrace. Anybody in this chamber or elsewhere who can support that has no morals and no principles. </PARA>
<PARA> Then what happened? These last two matters that I am talking about the brave Senator Cook chose to leave out of his explanation today. On 22 February the Commissioner recommended-and I have the recommendation here with me, and I will hold it up so that everybody can see it, and I am quite prepared to give it to anybody to read-how the dispute should be dealt with. Commissioner Donaldson -and the giggler is still going-recommended that the workers should return to work while the dispute was resolved. What did they do? They stayed out until 4 March. What is the result of that? Growers income is ploughed into the ground-absolutely ploughed into the ground. How can honourable senators sitting on the government side of the chamber have any pride in that? At the same time, $500,000 of employees' wages went down the drain. </PARA>

As I stand here tonight and I listen to the flippant approach from that side of the chamber, I can only conclude that those sitting on that side of the chamber do not care about our current account deficit. For their information, our current account deficit is about the balance between imports into this country and exports out of it. And every time we blow $1m or $2m, those figures will be worse off.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Deputy President, there is one person in this place who will be concluded eventually and that is Senator Collins. If he wants to keep interjecting, he can, but he is just saying, by doing that, that he supports the abuse of the Government's umpire. If he takes pride in that, then that is his problem. The Government's abuse of the umpire in this particular case has been absolutely and totally irresponsible. If Senator Collins wants to keep interjecting, I will stand up here and I will talk all night, because his Government's performance has no right whatsoever in terms of this particular dispute. The Minister has stood idly by the side. He did not even know, when we were in this place, that this dispute was under Federal jurisdiction. He stood up in this place and misled this Parliament. He said it was under State jurisdiction and that the Government was not going to do anything about it. He endorsed by default, by ignorance and by incompetence what has been going on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even if it was under State jurisdiction, the impact on the economics of this country surely would require any responsible Minister to at least inform himself of the facts. But no, he had to get on his little telephone after I asked the question and ring up and get an answer. Then he chose to ignore the salient facts in that particular answer. This whole dispute could have been totally avoided. More than $10m could have been saved if the Food Preservers Union had accepted on 19 February the decision of the umpire--</PARA>

<PARA> I am sure most of Australia now knows that today Westpac had a new found spirit of cooperation with the bank inquiry, and Mr Fowler, the Managing Director, appeared before the bank inquiry. All of a sudden injunctions are lifted, quite obviously in an attempt to put the best face possible on what was a public relations disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> We now find ourselves with access to these extremely important documents to which we have been alluding obliquely and directly for some weeks. I would like to respond to the public statement that was made by Mr Fowler today because he mentioned myself and John McLennan on quite a number of occasions in quite a long statement. Of course, that went to the nation tonight. Some of the points he made most definitely warrant at least an initial brief response, and later of course a more comprehensive one. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things Mr Fowler has not acknowledged and it has not been generally acknowledged in this discussion for the last few weeks is a simple principle in law which was drawn to my attention some time ago, known as misprision of felony. Lawyers have a curious way of describing simple concepts with most unusual phraseology-misprision of felony. I would like to explain to honourable senators what this is. It means any person who becomes aware of the commission of a felony is duty bound at law to make full disclosure to the crown to facilitate the laying of charges. Any person who fails to do so commits the offence known as misprision of felony. In other words, it is an obligation on every individual to report to the authorities a knowledge of a felony. </PARA>
<PARA> The Westpac letters are in the hands of so many people, including all senators-I gave them a copy-and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and Dr Hewson was fortunate not to have them because he returned them unopened, but the curious situation is that in law we all had the obligation not to return them to Westpac, as Westpac suggested in national advertisements that there was an obligation to return the letters to them, but quite the opposite. We all had the obligation to place the matter before the authorities. That is precisely what I was attempting to do by having them incorporated in Hansard and reported in the press. </PARA>
<PARA> This was not acknowledged in Mr Fowler's statement today. Instead, he projected a certain image of myself and John McLennan. To use some of his phrases, he said that the campaign we have been involved in has been timed to correspond with the commencement of the inquiry. That is true. It has been timed perfectly to correspond with the commencement of the inquiry. He said that it has been conducted by certain journalists and interest groups-one of the interest groups he is referring to is the Borrowers Association which is extremely interested in what is happening. He then referred to others who are prepared to traffic in stolen documents. </PARA>
<PARA>He did not explain what he meant by the term `traffic in stolen documents'. On the theme of stolen documents, my attention was drawn to apparently somebody who was standing outside a borrowers meeting recently and who had a sign up which simply said, `All the banks want back is their stolen documents'. Somebody stood next to that person with another sign which said, `All we want back is our stolen money'. It is a question of where one is placed in this whole hideous exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> I was accused today by Mr Fowler of being in breach of the spirit of the ruling of the President of the Senate on the sub judice principle. The only obligation I had under that ruling of the President was not to table and not to incorporate. It placed no further obligations on me, and the President acknowledged that only a few nights ago. Mr Fowler goes on in a series of quite empty allegations about what he sees as my obligations in relation to the Westpac position. He actually accuses my colleague, Mr Gilfillan. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>He is not only a member of the Australian Democrats, of which Senator McLean is a member, but must have been aware of the sub judice ruling of 12 February 1991 by the President of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>The President of the Senate gave his opinion and ruling but it was not the only opinion about this set of circumstances. In fact it was an opinion which differed from some of his principal advisers. There were quite a lot of opinions about whether the principle of sub judice applied. The fact that Mr Gilfillan chose not to share the opinion of the President of the Senate is utterly irrelevant. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This campaign has placed unprecedented pressure on the bank.</PARA>
<PARA>That is for sure. I do not feel in the slightest bit guilty about that. </PARA>
<PARA> He went on to say that it placed unprecedented pressure on the parliamentary inquiry-it sharpened the focus of the inquiry-and that it placed unprecedented pressure on the legal system and the judiciary in New South Wales. I would be surprised if the judiciary in New South Wales feels as if it is under unprecedented pressure by what our campaign to expose the corruption of Westpac has revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> He has the unmitigated gall to cite the principles of the bank in relation to bank customer confidentiality. I have tabled in this place over and over again examples of clear breaches of customer confidentiality by banks, including Westpac. He cites yet again the rather spurious argument about legal professional privilege. I have answered that on several occasions by citing the fact that legal professional privilege stopped at the point where Allen Allen and Hemsley proceeded to aid and abet. He goes on to cite the fact-and this is really the most devastating aspect of his statement-that:</PARA>
<PARA>Partnership Pacific Limited was a merchant bank subsidiary of Westpac. It was not wholly owned until November 1984 . . . it no longer operates and represented a very small proportion of the group's assets. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think the proportion in which it was owned by Westpac matters a damn. That is an utterly irrelevant observation to make. He goes on offensively to say that:</PARA>
<PARA>Fewer than 100 PPL clients had their accounts managed.</PARA>
<PARA>It does not matter if it was one, 100 or 1,000 who were destroyed by this process of fraud and corrupt practices. The fact is that the letters admit. The number of cases that it applies to is to be established by the bank inquiry or by a royal commission. He goes on to say that:</PARA>
<PARA>When Westpac became aware of these matters, as disclosed by the confidential letters, they were addressed in a timely and appropriate manner. </PARA>
<PARA>The appropriate manner was to cover them up, to enter into agreements with clients which required them in fact to concede their entitlement to litigation and even to enter into non-disclosure clauses. These were the appropriate arrangements, so-called, that were recommended by their legal advisers. The absolute absurdity comes in the final statements made by Mr Fowler when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>However your committee and the public should know that in relation to Westpac's approximately 850 loans offshore-</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how that ties in with the 100 clients, the 50,000 documents referred to in the letters and the $8.6 billion of trading in one six-months-</PARA>
<PARA>at October 1985, there have been no bankruptcy notices issued, only 10 matters where action has been taken in respect of security and only three of which have resulted in the sale of security properties.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course there have been only that many, for the simple reason that these poor people were enticed into a situation where they actually accepted concessions in exchange for legal releases and non-disclosure processes. That was precisely the strategy recommended by Allen Allen and Hemsley; it was precisely the strategy adopted by Westpac; and it is exactly the reason the figures are, as Mr Fowler says, speaking for themselves. My legal advice, which I will not table because it is referred to within this reference as preliminary legal advice to me, although I will certainly put it before the inquiry on Friday next week, is that my legal advisers have addressed the question of whether, on the material before us-that is, the two letters tabled and incorporated today-there is a prima facie case of criminal activity. The advice goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The material before us is sufficient to make out a prima facie case of obtaining financial advantage by deception, as contained in section 82 of the Crimes Act 1958, Victoria, as amended, which has been duplicated in the Crimes Act of New South Wales, 1900, as amended. </PARA>
<PARA>The advice may also raise a prima facie case concerning related offences dealing with false accounting, et cetera. The money earned from point taking and deal switching was used for the financial benefit, financial gain and financial advantage of PPL and, ultimately, Westpac Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The advice goes on to say that the most serious question is that advice given by Allen Allen and Hemsley renders the advisers liable; in other words, the lawyers themselves are liable. The advice states:</PARA>
<PARA> In our view, there is a strong prima facie case that the author of the Allen Allen and Hemsley letter has committed a transgression of the criminal law relating to aiding and abetting a criminal offence and/or of being an accessory after the fact to the criminal offence and perhaps being guilty of a conspiracy related to these activities. </PARA>
<PARA> In our view, therefore, there is a prima facie case of evidence that the solicitor concerned aided and abetted and was an accessory after the fact to the Commission of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Indeed, it is arguable that there is a prima facie case that the solicitor and all the chief executives of Westpac Banking Corporation who were privy to the solicitor's advice were guilty of the conspiracy to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, on the evidence available to us, a prima facie case to make out that such offences have been committed. The matter requires a full and complete investigation and could, in our view, only be properly accomplished by a full judicial inquiry such as a royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Criminal conspiracy is a crime under statutory legislation and is also a crime at common law. It basically may be defined as an agreement explicit or implicit of two or more persons to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. A conspirator may not necessarily have to do the act himself provided he agrees or consents to them being done and with full knowledge of them doing done. A conspirator may join a conspiracy after its commencement and thus be guilty of conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to aiding and abetting an offence, Lord Goddard CJ in Carter v Mace said:</PARA>
<PARA> If a person shuts his eyes to the obvious and refrains from making any inquiry where a reasonably sensible man would have made an inquiry, I think the court can find that he was aiding and abetting, certainly if he shuts his eyes to the obvious. We advise that this opinion has been confirmed by a senior consultant to this firm and also by a senior barrister at the Victorian Bar who specialises in prosecutions of white collar crime. </PARA>
<PARA>In closing, I am simply saying that the legal advice I have is that on the basis of the letters which I have now exposed publicly there is a clear prima facie case that criminal offences are being committed by Westpac, PPL and Allen Allen and Hemsley. I will naturally be placing the matter before the banking inquiry in the hope that that will lead to a royal commission and eventually that justice will be done on behalf of the many Australians who came forward in good faith to find themselves devastated by corrupt bankers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on a matter that is rather curious, to say the least, but I think it is a matter that should be cleared up and on the record. I am referring to an article that appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser of 26 February 1991 on page 27, as part of the column called `What's your problem?' This is a regular column in the Advertiser most days. It is a column that handles such devastating issues as `Where do you get a Norfolk Island pine?', `What legislation covers LPG?' and so on. It is obviously a service column that is well read in the Advertiser, and most daily newspapers have similar columns. On 26 February part of it was headed `New World Order: What is it?' Mr or Ms A.A. of South Plympton had written in and asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Are you able to explain (and print) the One World Order which President Bush and Mr Hawke appear to be ushering in lately?</PARA>
<PARA> This is the astonishing answer to that question. Obviously the person who wrote in was referring to the phrase which was mentioned many times in our debate on Tuesday in regard to the statement on the ending of the Gulf war. I quote the Prime Minister's statement, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn lastly to the new world order. The phrase has been much discussed in recent months. Most of what has been said has missed the fundamental point that the end of the Cold War has ushered in a new world order whether we like it or not. </PARA>
<PARA>Because that phrase has been around, as the Prime Minister's statement said, for some weeks, this person wrote to the Advertiser. Whether this letter was written to the newspaper as a matter of genuine information or was a set-up job I do not know, but this is the astonishing answer that the Adelaide Advertiser provided to that question:</PARA>
<PARA> The New World Order was the brainchild of Dr Adam Weishaupt, a German Jew who, in 1776, founded the Order of the Illuminati (a secret society). The concept was of a world government with a single economy. Dr Weishaupt also was involved in the French Revolution. From Illuminism came the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. Although banned and discredited in many countries, these protocols are identical with the aims of communism for the Western world. These originated from the Bolsheviks who brought about the 1917 revolution, of which the leaders mainly were Ashkenazi Jews. These aims were recorded in the United States Congress in the 1960s-presented by Dr D. Dodd, a former member of the Communist Party of America. Both the Aims and the Protocols were directed towards a New World Order. Dr C. Quigley, prestigious American historian, wrote in his book Tragedy and Hope that the people working towards a New World Order were highly cultured, well educated and had the best interests of the human race at heart. He studied their network of operations for 20 years from the early 1960s and documented links between big international finance and the formation of the NWO. Prominent international bankers, wealthy industrialists and politicians are involved in the implementation of this New World Order. President Bush frequently refers to it as do other prominent politicians, including Mr Hawke and President Gorbachev. According to Time Magazine, of January 23, 1989, the formation of a United States of Europe is planned for 1992, and this is a move towards a New World Order. The aims are a one-world super government and a one-world economy. </PARA>
<PARA>That completes the answer that the newspaper gave to that simple question and, as can be imagined, it created some astonishment in the Adelaide community. I did not read it, I must confess-I am not a great reader of `What's Your Problem?'-but although the answer may sound so ridiculous as to create levity, for the Jewish community of Adelaide it was an outrage. They wrote to the Prime Minister of Australia and sent a copy of the letter to me because I happened to be in recent contact on other matters with the President of the South Australian branch of the Jewish Community Council, Mr Jack Hines. Part of the letter that he wrote to the Prime Minister read:</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously the Jewish community here is incensed and I would imagine that you would be rather concerned to have your name attached to this type of reply. I am in the process of arranging an appointment to meet with the Editor of the Adelaide Advertiser to discuss this letter, and others. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to give some information further to this astonishing answer in regard to the background of this extraordinary description of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. I have been provided with information in an extract from the Encyclopaedia Judaica. This has a section explaining the background to this extraordinary fraud, and I will read it to the Senate to put it on the record. </PARA>

<PARA>Elders of Zion, Protocols of the Learned, anti-Semitic forgery aimed at showing the existence of international Jewish aspirations bent on world power. The specter of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy aiming at reducing the gentiles to slavery or exterminating them loomed up in the Christian imagination during the Middle Ages, growing out of legends about well-poisoning and plague-spreading. Some such stories claimed that a secret rabbinical conference had been held to work out a detailed plan for ritual genocide of the Christians. From the time of the Renaissance, at first in Spain, these legends turned on a political plot rather than a religious one: similar notions circulated in France and Germany, after Napoleon's convocation of the Great Sanhedrin . . . in 1807. They did not gain widespread popular credence, nor at first did the versions launched during the second half of the century by French Catholic authors . . . who associated Freemasons and Jews in an anti-Christian plot. In its latest version, the legend of the ``Elders of Zion'' was concocted in Paris in the last decade of the 19th century by an unknown author working for the Russian secret police (Okhrana); in all probability, it was intended to influence the policy of Czar Nicholas II towards the interests of the secret police. For his purposes, the anonymous forger adapted an old French policital pamphlet by Maurice Joly attributing ambitions of world domination to Napoleon III . . . which does not contain the slightest allusion to Jews or to Judaism. This ``dialogue'' was transformed into the ``protocols'' of an alleged conference of the leaders of world Jewry, who stated in summing up that, under the cloak of modern democracy, they already controlled the policies of numerous European states and were therefore very close to their objective. However the calculations of the Russian police misfired on that occasion: Nicholas II, impressionable and anti-Semitic though he was, detected the fraud, writing ``One does not defend a worthy cause by vile means'' in the margin of the manuscript submitted to him. The first Russian public edition of the Protocols, which appeared in 1905, did not attract much attention and was taken seriously in a few mystic and sectarian circles only. </PARA>
<PARA> The worldwide success of the Protocols dates from 1919 to 1921: after the widespread slaughter in World War I, the Russian Revolution in 1917, and the risings in Germany, many people felt compelled to discover a ``hidden cause'' for such tragic and momentus events. The text was widely circulated during the Russian civil war by propagandists seeking to incite the masses against the ``Jewish Revolution'' and undoubtedly contributed to the extensive pogroms perpetrated in southern Russia between 1918 and 1920. After the defeat of the White armies, Russian emigres publicized the Protocols in the West. Translations followed, but most reputable European news- papers, such as The Times of London, questioned their authenticity. In 1921 the English journalist Philip Graves pointed out the close similarity between the text of the Protocols and Joly's pamphlet; from then on, balanced and responsible circles refused to take them seriously. This was no bar to an enormous circulation of the text, which was translated into all the main world languages. In the United States it was even sponsored (until 1927) by the influential and popular Henry Ford I. </PARA>
<PARA> However, well before the Nazi rise to power, the Protocols found the largest number of adherents in Germany. The theory of the occult power of the Jews, sworn enemies of German-Christian culture, perfectly suited those reactionary propagandists who attributed Germany's defeat to ``a stab in the back.'' Right from the start the Nazi Party propagated this theme. The Weltdienst organization of Erfurt was specially formed to diffuse it and to strengthen ties with anti-Semites in other countries. In Berne in 1934 the Jewish community of Switzerland brought the distributors of the Protocols to trial, establishing in court that the work was a forgery, but this did nothing to diminish the zeal of its propagators. During World War II, the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion became an implicit justification for the genocide of the Jews; and Nazi propaganda relied on them until the last days of the Third Reich. Although since 1945 no more than bibliographical curiosity in the majority of civilised countries, the Protocols have been reissued in numerous Arab states and President Nasser of Egypt publicly vouched for their authenticity. A Spanish edition, published in 1963, was probably an attempt to prevent the revision of the Catholic Church's traditional attitude towards the Jews at the Ecumenical Council Vatican II. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a very long quote. I appreciate the patience of the Senate in allowing me to read it in full. I wanted to put it on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I draw attention to the fact that I hope that the Adelaide Advertiser has the courtesy to apologise and retract the disgraceful answer that it gave in a column that, I would have thought, was not really there to deal with the propagation of anti-Semitic views. I certainly understand why the Jewish community of South Australia is so outraged that the only morning daily newspaper in South Australia, which has a very wide circulation, would allow itself, even unwittingly, to publish such tripe, which even the most junior journalist reading any of the material would realise was obviously fraudulent and should not have been published. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to share with the Senate a couple of thoughts about what is happening to our environment, what is happening to our country, and a little bit about recycling. On 25 February, last Monday week, the Litter Research Association in Sydney, in conjunction with some Sydney companies, took a group of us for a look around what is happening as far as recycling in Sydney is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recycling is the fastest growing waste management technique employed by governments worldwide. For any waste management strategy to be successful, though, it must have the support of the public and industry, as well as State, local and Federal governments. That is why I am talking about it here in the Senate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> `Why recycle?', it is asked. The answer is that it reduces solid waste, conserves natural resources, reduces pollution and litter, conserves energy, generates jobs, and encourages and educates the community to protect the environment. I believe that recycling policies will be a part of everyone's future. This will demand lifestyle changes-some as simple as learning to separate the recyclables from the rest of our discards. The question is not if, but how and when. Because recycling on a large scale is new, it offers us an opportunity to plan it properly and get it right the first time around. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States and Canada, a landfill and incineration capacity gap is developing rapidly. Both Canada and the United States have adopted national polices to divert at least 50 per cent of garbage going to the tips by the year 2000. Over the past 40 years the mix of materials in municipal solid waste has changed in the United States. Most of the materials have increased in tonnages discarded over the years, with paper and paperboard, aluminium and plastics having especially notable increases. Other materials such as glass, ferrous metals, rubber and food wastes have shown very little growth or even declines. Glass and the ferrous metals, for instance, have often been replaced by other materials, notably plastics and aluminium. </PARA>
<PARA> The quantity of solid waste generated is growing in terms of tonnage and volume. Public awareness has increased. There is more recognition that all solid waste is of concern, not just specific components. There is much more emphasis on alternatives to landfills today than in the past. Specifically, the public attention is focused on recycling, reduction, degradability and packaging, especially for plastics. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia leads the world in the recycling of aluminium cans. Over 50 per cent of aluminium cans have been returned for recycling every year since 1981, which I think is a statistic that a lot of us might not have known about. There are over 1,100 buy-back centres throughout Australia. In 1988, over $24m was paid by industry to can collectors. </PARA>
<PARA> Polyethylene teraphthalate (PET) bottles are lightweight plastic drink bottles. The latest technology allows for the effective reprocessing of used PET bottles. About 50 per cent of soft drink consumed in Australia is packaged in those PET bottles. PET is recycled as a polyester resin to be used in the manufacture of items such as fibreglass boats, surfboards and artificial marble vanities. Many household food and beverage products are packaged in glass bottles and jars and these, importantly, are 100 per cent recyclable. Thirty-five per cent of new bottles are made from old ones, which I think is quite an interesting statistic as well. Currently there is a 25 per cent recovery of glass for recycling, and the chopped up glass is selling at about $90 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as paper is concerned, there are currently extreme difficulties with the paper industry, which has dropped the price by more than half. I know that that has caused problems for the people who collect paper, especially in country areas. They want to do the right thing but they are not getting a good enough market for paper in the major cities. Perhaps Australia should be looking at decentralising some of the areas that take in waste paper. The price is dictated by the world market price for waste paper. There is a worldwide glut of waste paper at present and obviously that is why the price has dropped. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as New South Wales is concerned, many councils are updating their recycling programs. Some have more than doubled their participation rate, with some introducing cash rewards for residents and some having contractor runs on a weekly basis. All of them are getting a very positive response. In the Local Government Association 42 councils have formed their own recycling cooperatives because they were receiving a raw deal from companies which buy their waste paper. Recycling companies are dropping their prices, forcing the councils to use their own funds. Recycling companies are cashing in on the increased environmental awareness of the community-which is great. Councils say that any profits should be ploughed back into local schemes or used to educate the public on the benefits of recycling. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was in America representing this Parliament at the United Nations I had the opportunity to visit people in New York and look at the economic problems of recycling, the need for more collectors, and getting a market for the recycled product, which is one of the big problems there. Obviously they have to educate people to use more recycled products. There is a lead time to get people used to using recycled products. In New York, for example, there is 27,000 tonnes of garbage per day and 13,000 tonnes of that per day is now being handled in pits as well as being landfilled. Of that, 10,000 tonnes is being picked up by private collectors to recycle. Of course, they are running out of landfill areas, which is one of the reasons why they are looking much more closely at recycling. </PARA>
<PARA> The State and Federal governments will give incineration facilities only if people recycle, which I think is well worth a thought. On the bigger scale, in America 160 million tonnes of garbage per year has to be disposed of. As I said, they are running out of landfill so they are moving more into the recycling mode. There are three different ways of recycling material: the drop-off method, which recovers up to 10 per cent of available recyclables; the buy-back method, which recovers up to 20 per cent; and the comprehensive kerbside method, which picks up 70 per cent to 90 per cent-that is in the PET recycling areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In the comprehensive kerbside method of recycling they collect aluminium, glass, PET, steel and newspapers. They use large 20-gallon storage bins for each house, which can be supplied as an incentive by the council. They use 30-cubic yard collection trucks for their recycling and they pick up the recyclables every week on the same day as the garbage pick-up, which is very important for people to get used to doing it all the time. They sort recyclables at a central facility and they keep participants aware and enthusiastic through education and promotion. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have to look at this in Australia. I commend the people in Sydney who are doing the recycling. On World Environment Day-which is 5 June 1991-the Keep Australia Beautiful Council will present its Vision for Australia award. Last year's winner was Comalco Aluminium, and it is doing a wonderful job in this area. I commend those people for the work they are doing and I thank the Senate for allowing me to speak for some seven minutes in the adjournment debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to refer to one of the consequences of the war in the Gulf, that is, the human cost not of the 100,000 or more people who have died in this tragic war but of the victims who are, sadly, refugees or injured people, or those who have suffered because members of their families have died in this war. I think it is the international responsibility of all countries, particularly those which were involved in the war, to help with the repatriation and the clean-up operations environmentally. They have a particular responsibility from a humane point of view to help people in all the countries that were affected by the war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War Inc (IPPNW) is an international body which was the recipient in 1985 of the Nobel Peace Prize. On 13 February, three Jordanian members of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War group began a rather dangerous journey from Jordan into Baghdad. The members of the group learned through eye witness accounts that there is a desperate need for nurses, anaesthesia and basic medical supplies to treat wounded Iraqi civilians. Of course, this has all been expanded now that the war has finished. But this report was gathered by these three brave Jordanian doctors who went into Iraq while the bombing raids were still raging. </PARA>
<PARA> Reports of amputations being performed by sawing off limbs without anaesthesia have come to us from the three physicians who have just returned from Baghdad, according to William Monning of the IPPNW's executive. They told of harrowing scenes in Iraqi hospitals with people screaming constantly because there was a lack of anaesthetics for operations that were being performed. The group also reports the destruction of at least five churches, 25 mosques and four hospitals in the Baghdad area. These people took their lives into their own hands to go in and make this report which has come out through that committee. </PARA>
<PARA> On 27 February-which was very recently-the IPPNW produced a report on refugees and displaced persons who will be the ongoing victims and the ongoing tragedy from this war. The report states that as the Gulf war ends, there are, in addition to the direct victims of the bombing and fighting, thousands of civilian victims in the Middle East, especially those in Iraq and Kuwait, and they are often unrecognised victims. </PARA>
<PARA> Civilians in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Israel and other parts of the region may suffer and die as well. They die not only from direct hits or flying debris but also from epidemics of respiratory infections, diarrhoea and malnutrition. People who are displaced from their homes are forced to flee their countries and they will fare the worst. They will experience death rates so high that they may exceed those of the combat soldiers. </PARA>
<PARA> This report from IPPNW looks at the impact of the war on the region's public health systems which were not all that fantastic to begin with in the pre-war situation. IPPNW estimates conservatively that over the next six months, in addition to many refugees who may be able to escape to neighbouring countries, approximately 5 per cent of the Kuwaiti and Iraqi population-close to one million people-will be displaced from both of those countries. It is also known from past experience that these internal refugees will die at rates far greater than those who have not been forced to flee-at a rate of one to two deaths per 10,000 people per day. This translates into an extra 15,000 to 33,000 people dying in six months, mostly children under five years old. </PARA>
<PARA> With attention, international aid and implementation of a coordinated plan, almost every one of these deaths could be prevented. This, I think, is the very important message that we, as one of the countries involved in the war, really have to take very seriously. Death and sickness rates will continue to rise as water mains and sewerage pipes remain destroyed and as overloaded health systems can no longer vaccinate children, let alone look after the sick and injured. This is not a new story but it reflects lessons learned from past wars and past dislocations. We have also learned how to prevent this death and disease. Thus, the challenge confronting the international medical community and public health officials is to act quickly to prevent as much unnecessary death and disease as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically, wars create two types of newly vulnerable civilian population: refugees who, by definition, end up outside the country of their nationality, and internally displaced persons who flee their homes to seek more secure areas within their own country. Of course, as we know from the massive internal disruption that is occurring in Iraq now, unfortunately, this will be a very familiar story there as well as in Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> As many as 1.5 million people may flee Iraq and Kuwait as a result of the Gulf war. Jordan, Turkey, Syria and Iran may receive an influx sufficient to precipitate public health emergencies in those countries. Past experience has shown that refugees will suffer the highest death rates in the period immediately following displacement. Experts count these rates in deaths per 10,000 people per day. Death rates for refugees will be far higher than for residents of the recipient country. Deaths will disproportionately affect children under 14 years of age, and of course in all of the countries of the Middle East that I have mentioned there is a very high percentage of the population which is under 15 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> Infectious diseases, such as measles, diarrhoea and acute respiratory tract infections in association with malnutrition, will claim most of the lives, along with epidemics of diseases such as meningitis. One report estimates that as of 4 February 1991 more than one million people have fled Baghdad since the beginning of the war. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, mortality rates amongst the displaced populations within a country have been far greater than for the non-displaced. One difficulty that hinders aid to internally displaced populations is that they are protected only in a limited way by international agreements on refugees. The Geneva Convention, the only agreement that protects their rights, requires only that the warring parties provide access to the International Committee of the Red Cross. In addition, relief programs directed at displaced populations are often the target of violence themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Persian Gulf region already has a legacy of displaced persons. The eight year Iran-Iraq war first created both a major refugee problem and large internally displaced populations. Prior to the Gulf war the United States Committee for Refugees estimated that there were already 350,000 Iranian refugees in Iraq and Pakistan; 500,000 Iraqi refugees in Iran; 500,000 to one million internally displaced people in Iraq, and one million people who were displaced in Iran. So there was already a massive problem before this Gulf war appeared on the scene. </PARA>
<PARA> Refugees and those displaced within their own countries are desperate people who may become completely dependent on outside means of support. Many have already suffered major physical and mental trauma as a result of war, and when they do gain refuge, it is often in crowded camps with the associated loss of dignity, privacy and control over their own destinies. </PARA>
<PARA> There is justified concern that many refugees from the Gulf war may remain in closed refugee camps for many years. For example, in 1987 only 1.5 per cent of the world's refugees were voluntarily repatriated; 12 per cent successfully settled in the country of first asylum, and 1 per cent resettled in a third country. In addition, there are 2.27 million registered Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza. They have been refugees since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, and the plight of the Palestinians deserves special attention in this situation. The Palestinians, as far as I know, are still living under a state of war in Israel because the curfews imposed upon them by the Israeli Government have not been lifted since the direct killing in the war stopped a week or so ago, so they do need special attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Most countries in the area immediately affected by the Gulf war have poor health status and low per capita gross national product compared with that of industrialised countries. For example, Jordan, Turkey and Iran have moderate infant mortality rates of 54, 74 and 91 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. But pit that against west European countries where infant mortality rates are eight to 10 per 1,000 live births. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, Jordan, Syria and Turkey, which have gross national products averaging around $1,500 per capita, compared with $19,000 per capita in the USA, will have great difficulty assisting their own displaced populations and refugees without international assistance. Iraq has a high infant mortality rate of 67 deaths per 1,000 live births, and 45 per cent of its population is younger than 15 years of age, so it is really a crucial situation in Iraq in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> IPPNW lists two phases of help which are urgently needed. The emergency phase, the first phase, is the one month to 12 month period during which death rates are greater than one per 10,000 per day, depending on the initial health status of the refugees and the response mounted to provide care and refuge for them. </PARA>
<PARA> High emergency phase death rates are mainly due to communicable diseases such as measles, diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections in conjunction with under-nutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Disease transmission is enhanced by crowding and poor housing, lack of sanitation and poor water supply. Resistance to infection is reduced by malnutrition, physical trauma and psychological stress. During the emergency phase death rates rise in all age groups but the increase is expected to be most dramatic amongst the one- to 14-year-olds. </PARA>
<PARA> In the post-emergency phase, death rates generally fall to the same level as those in the surrounding population and illness patterns begin to resemble those of the host population. However, many refugees suffer long term effects of exile, political repression and torture, including posttraumatic stress characterised by intense fear and sleeping disorders; depressive disorders that may or may not be accompanied by violence, substance abuse and suicidal behaviour; and psychosomatic disorders and psychosexual dysfunction. These are the long term effects of what it must be like to be in a refugee situation or permanently dislocated. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War group recommends four basic measures to minimise death rates and to shorten the initial post-displacement emergency phase. The four measures are the timely provision of: first, sufficient food rations containing adequate amounts of calories, protein, and essential vitamins and minerals; secondly, sufficient quantities of clean water; thirdly, appropriate interventions for the prevention and treatment of specific communicable diseases, including measles immunisation, oral rehydration for diarrhoea, and effective detection and case management of acute respiratory infections and malaria; and, fourthly, establishment from the start of a health surveillance system, especially surveillance of mortality, nutritional status and important epidemic diseases such as measles and cholera. </PARA>
<PARA> The next question that IPPNW asks is: whose responsibility is this situation? In any refugee crisis, the recipient country has ultimate responsibility for the care of refugees. However, the international community must provide resources and technical assistance to the countries that border Iraq and Kuwait who will otherwise have to shoulder the burden alone when facing a sudden influx of people. Yet promises of aid for refugees are not enough. Jordan has yet to receive adequate reimbursement from the international community for the $55m it has spent for refugee assistance following the August invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> IPPNW suggests the following steps for the prompt implementation of refugee programs: first, strengthen the capacity of recipient countries-that is, Jordan, Turkey, Syria and Iran-to provide technical assistance; secondly, fully involve the displaced communities in relief health programs; thirdly, ensure that the donor governments provide relief supplies that reflect the real needs of the refugees; and fourthly, where possible, provide alternatives to closed refugee camps to prevent the crowding and poor sanitation associated with closed settings. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, donated resources for refugee populations have varied in quantity according to the strategic importance of the host country to major donors, the level of media coverage, and the ease of access to the affected region. In the present crisis, the response through January was encouraging, with an estimated $61m out of a required $175m for 400,000 refugees for three months already donated or pledged. </PARA>

My plea to the Australian Government and the Australian people to lobby the Australian Government to this extent is that for every dollar that was put towards the Defence budget to pay for the Royal Australian Navy's efforts in the Gulf, that is, the ships which went to the Gulf to support the cash box coalition, the Australian Government has an equal responsibility to provide a dollar to aid the victims of the war in terms of either supporting the refugee programs or environmental clean-up. We have a far greater international responsibility to assist with the clean-up operations than many other countries because we were involved in the destructive process. For every dollar that we spent on the war effort we should be spending an equal amount on the reconstruction and clean-up efforts. That is my plea to the Australian Government. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Crane gave a fairly effervescent and, I might say, very spirited speech with some very rum quotes on subjects, scotched several assertions and put up a very stout defence tonight. He did at different stages challenge Senator McMullan and Senator Cook to come into the chamber. I must commend them on their restraint in not doing so. Trying to divine what he was saying tonight was a little difficult. Essentially he was raising the Heinz dispute and asserting that this Government does not care less about that. That is not true-as though we would be automatic supporters of the Food Preservers Union. I do not think it is very likely. I do not know the details of the dispute. It was essentially one to be settled by a State government rather than the Federal Government. More than that I cannot really add much to what he said. </PARA>

<PARA>The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce has entered into three (3) contracts with the Roy Morgan Research Centre since 1975. None of the agencies for which the Minister is responsible have entered into any contracts with the Centre.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) (i) In 1989, the Centre was engaged to design and conduct a telephone survey of 350 people in Sydney and 350 people in Melbourne to determine the public knowledge of, and attitudes to, the Multifunction Polis program. No alterations were made to the original contract because it was considered satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) In 1990, the Centre was engaged to arrange and conduct discussions with a range of young people so as to evaluate the public knowledge and perception of the Multifunction Polis program. No alterations were made to the original contract because it was considered satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) In 1990 the Centre was engaged to design and conduct a telephone survey of 350 people in Sydney, Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne and Brisbane so as to evaluate if there had been a change in the public knowledge of, and attitudes to, the Multifunction Polis program. No alterations were made to the original contract because it was considered satisfactory.</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) $12800.00</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) $20900.00.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) This contract did not go out to tender as Departmental instructions only require the use of the tendering process when the anticipated cost exceeds $30,000. The Centre was selected on the recommendation of the MFP Communications Working Party.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) This contract did not go out to tender as Departmental instructions only require the use of the tendering process when the anticipated cost exceeds $30,000. The Centre was selected on the basis that it already had the expertise to undertake surveys concerning the MFP.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) As for (c) (ii).</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The Roy Morgan Research Centre was asked by the Department to supply a copy of the questionnaire for the three surveys that were undertaken on MFP.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The Roy Morgan Research Centre did provide the Department with copies of the questionnaire for the three surveys. (attached).</PARA>
<PARA> (f) n/a.</PARA>

<PARA> (h) Copies of the Reports are attached.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) n/a.</PARA>
<PARA> (j) The Roy Morgan Research Centre did provide a computer printout of the results for the three surveys. The Centre was asked to undertake an analysis of the survey conducted on youth groups (ii) and provide the Department with an interpretation of the results. No interpretation of results was carried out by the Centre for the two telephone surveys (i) and (iii). The analysis of those results was carried out within the Department's Marketing area, which has special skills in this area and which is familiar with the nature of the MFP project.</PARA>
<PARA>  The two telephone surveys were interpreted on the basis of attitudes towards the MFP project by State and segregated according to whether those interviewed were considered to be Managers or representatives of the general public.</PARA>
<PARA>  The data was then analysed according to these broad groupings on the basis of their attitudes towards the MFP, for example whether they had heard of the MFP, and whether they thought it was a good idea etc. The data outlined in the surveys undertaken in 1989 and 1990 was then compared to see if a shift in attitudes towards the MFP had taken place, and what factors had influenced this change in attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA> (k) The results of the surveys were used as input into the Community consultation process that is now occurring.</PARA>
<PARA> (l) The proposal originated from within the Department.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Oestradiol patches have been considered by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) on eight occasions since December 1988. Consideration of the marketing application has been protracted because of the difficulty in identifying which actual formulation/delivery system had been used in those clinical studies presented in the marketing application.</PARA>
<PARA> This is important because patches used in early studies or marketed elsewhere might deliver the drug in a different way to the patches intended for Australia. This variation in drug delivery could result in differing clinical effects in Australia to those observed in the majority of trials presented.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently, the sponsor company, Ciba-Geigy, has been able to address ADEC's concerns, and, at its last meeting on 22 February 1991, ADEC provisionally recommended that `Estraderm' patches be given general marketing approval provided all outstanding quality and product information issues are resolved.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The way in which the patch proposed for marketing in Australia differs from others used in some overseas countries would be regarded by the sponsor company as commercially confidential information. I believe it would not be appropriate for me to supply this information at this time. I can assure you that the differences in patch designs were significant to the extent that concern was expressed at the clinical consequences of the variation.</PARA>
