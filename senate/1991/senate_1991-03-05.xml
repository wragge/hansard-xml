<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to the growing `Burkegate' saga and ask: is it considered appropriate for an ambassador to be interviewed by all television channels, do four major radio interviews-including trendsetting radio on `Ask the Ambassador', advertised in the West Australian that day-and press interviews in an attempt to get himself off a political hook? What instructions has the Minister given Mr Burke in this regard, after originally having instructed him not to make comment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are matters for the good judgment of the individual concerned. There is something of a convention that ambassadors do not comment on political or related matters. Before any of this current excitement culminated in proceedings before a royal commission, there were no court or similar proceedings pending which made it appropriate or legitimate for that normal convention to be modified. However, in the environment in which Mr Burke presently finds himself, being confronted by hordes of media questioners and others less well motivated from the other side of this Parliament and their fellow travellers, it is perfectly understandable that he should wish to put his own view of some of these matters on the public record. I have not sought to second guess his judgment in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question to ask the Minister. Do I understand from the Minister's answer that he is saying that it is quite all right for ambassadors to make political comment repeatedly over the duration of a week on any subject they may wish to choose?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1127" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is stretching a rather long bow on what I have just said. In the particular circumstances where an ambassador finds himself having the status of a witness or the subject of some inquiry before a royal commission, and in an environment where there is a fever of politically generated frenzy, about which the other side has been entirely shameless in this respect, and in an environment in which intense media interest has been generated by that political shark feeding frenzy that we have witnessed on the other side, it is understandable that the individual concerned should want to respond. In the circumstances I have described, where proceedings of this kind are pending and it is not a normal ambassadorial situation where one is being drawn into political comment generally, I repeat: I do not think it is appropriate for me to be second guessing the judgment of the individual concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Has the Minister noted claims made by some Opposition senators that price inflation is currently at the rate of 10.8 per cent or 10.4 per cent? Could such figures have been obtained only by multiplying the latest quarterly consumer price index (CPI) figure by four? If so, is this a legitimate approach to the measurement of price rises in the Australian economy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1127" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, my attention has been drawn to the comments which have been made about an inflation rate of 10.8 per cent. That sort of mathematics is impeccable, but is also misleading, misguided and perhaps intended to misguide. Maybe they are deliberate attempts to mislead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the benefit of those honourable senators concerned, I want to say something about the CPI. Simply multiplying one quarter's CPI does not give any indication of the trend in inflation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She could not have done that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps it was a charitable suggestion. She could have done that and worked out that we had an annual inflation rate of 2.8 per cent. That would be a rather dishonest exercise and one on which, I must say, the Government has never embarked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The CPI figure of 2.7 per cent for the December quarter brings the annual rate to 6.9 per cent, up from 6 per cent in the 12 months to September. I think it is conceded by all fair minded commentators including, I believe, the Leader of the Opposition, that that is largely due to the effects of increased oil prices and some basically State administered charges.</PARA>
<PARA> The important measure to focus on is the underlying rate which excludes items subject to administrative price changes, seasonal influences and interest charges. This rate has been on a downward trend from about 6.8 per cent in March 1989 to 5.4 per cent in the 12 months to December 1990. This is down from 5.6 per cent in September 1990. This provides Australia with a rare opportunity to continue to step down inflation. I might say that that is an opportunity which has eluded Australia and Australian governments for two decades. Under this Government inflation has averaged 7 1/2 per cent compared with 10.3 per cent over the Fraser years. So that is just one useful measure of comparison.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it is difficult for Senator Boswell to concentrate on a long answer such as this, but if he did he might understand better. I could take a previous decade too, but as Senator Boswell has difficulty in remembering the Fraser years-something which he has no doubt blotted out of his mind as he has difficulty in remembering that-it is no good making comparisons with previous decades or earlier decades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I want to make is that we have a good chance to secure a sustainable fall in inflation. This would be a remarkable achievement for Australia because we are one of the few countries where currently inflation is falling. The latest figures available--</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kemp interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp should stop chattering. The latest figures available for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris reveal that in the 12 months to the December quarter total OECD inflation was 7.4 per cent-Senator Kemp will remember that a minute ago I said it was 6.8 per cent in Australia-an increase from 6 per cent in the 12 months to the September quarter.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have the approval of Senator Alston. That is a great start. This compares with 6.9 per cent for the December quarter 1990. Over the same period the inflation rate in the United States was at 6.2 per cent, and the United Kingdom had an inflation rate of 9.9 per cent. Australia's inflation rate for the year ending in the December quarter was below that of the OECD and well below that of the United Kingdom. Australia in 1991 is therefore in a position to make our inflation rate competitive with that of the rest of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Is the Minister aware that the receivers appointed to act on behalf of the John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd are legally challenging the validity of the long term contracts with ANM Boyer and Albury Mills for the supply of newsprint? If their actions are successful, does the Minister agree that the resultant loss of 25 to 30 per cent of production from those two mills will threaten their viability and cause further loss of jobs? Does the Minister agree that this type of action by major consumers in Australia, apparently for short term gain, will create great difficulties, particularly in Tasmania, for the development of downstream processing of our natural resources?</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not aware of any legal challenge being mounted to the validity of these contracts by the receiver of the group.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories aware of the report of the Tasmanian Department of Parks, Wildlife and Heritage dated June 1990 and entitled Appropriate World Heritage Boundaries for a World Heritage area in Western Tasmania? Is the Minister also aware that this report, the most authoritative undertaken, has recommended that an extra 300,000 hectares of Tasmania's wilderness be added to the World Heritage list? Given that approximately 100,000 hectares would be placed in permanent logging zones covered by any Federal and State resource security legislation under any Tasmanian Government proposed forest industry strategy, can the Minister give a categorical assurance that areas identified as having World Heritage qualities or potential World Heritage qualities will not be placed in areas covered by any Federal resource security legislation? How does the Government propose to meet its obligations under the World Heritage convention to identify and protect areas of World Heritage significance identified in this report?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No country in the world has gone further in meeting its obligations under that convention than has Australia. We have more places nominated. Fortunately, of course, we are blessed with places of spectacular natural beauty to nominate. We have done our fair share, and more, and I do not think that any Australian could be anything but proud of that fact. Whether or not we want to do any more is a matter for consideration of the Minister. There are a number of other possibilities for nomination which can be examined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But in so far as the report to which Senator Powell refers concerns areas to be examined in Tasmania, all I can say is that I first heard of the report on Friday. Therefore, I have not read it; I am not certain whether the Minister has read it. As I understand it, it was published very recently, although I do not pretend to know on exactly what day. So what possible link there might be between the Commonwealth and the States, if they were to agree to resource security legislation with permanent logging zones in areas that this report has suggested might finish up in World Heritage areas, I really do not know. It is too far in the area of speculation. In any event, with the Government about to come to grips with this matter, I do not think it is appropriate that I pre-empt a Cabinet discussion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question. I ask the Minister to seek further clarification from the Minister whom he represents in this chamber. In doing so, I ask the Minister, too, why the report has not surfaced for this long period-over six months. Was that suppressed and, if so, why and by whom? When is the Government intending to create an indicative World Heritage list, which is required of it as an obligation under the World Heritage convention, a convention to which, it seems we need to remind the Government, our country is a signatory?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1129" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The supplementary question had a few parts and I hope I can recall all of them. The first part asked why the report has not surfaced and who suppressed it. I think it is a State government report, so it is a matter for the Government of Tasmania. I do not think it is up to the Minister, Mrs Kelly, to determine who suppressed it. It is not her report. I will not be asking her to do that, but I will be seeking further clarification on the report. Obviously, it is a matter of interest to me and I will chase it up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the indicative list-I argued fairly strongly at, I think it was, the 1988 meeting of the World Heritage convention that was held in Brazilia that we should not be forced to prepare indicative lists, and that was accepted by the meeting at the time. I did so because there were many in Australia who were actively misrepresenting what World Heritage was about. I believe that, had the Government sought to even begin to look at an area, even if that area fell way below a World Heritage nomination standard, it would create confusion, fear and, in some cases, panic and I did not think that was a good idea. I will not personally be urging Mrs Kelly to prepare an indicative list. Anyone who talks to those people who administer the World Heritage convention will find that they are more than happy with the role that Australia has played and wish other nations would do the same.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health. Can the Minister inform the Senate of the Government's reasons for reissuing Medicare cards?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1130" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Foreman and other senators will know that in the Budget session last year the Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Brian Howe, announced that the Medicare cards would, in fact, become general health care cards as part of the reform of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). They will be used as evidence for eligibility for both the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and for Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister, Mr Howe, is determined to give the pharmaceutical scheme administration more integrity than it has had to date. There have been problems in the past of people claiming pharmaceuticals at a concessional price when they were no longer entitled to it, and we did not have a mechanism for accurate and timely eligibility checking.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cards need to be replaced for many reasons, for example to ensure that lost and stolen cards are not inappropriately used; to set up a continuing basis for reissuing cards to minimise their misuse; to establish a regular checking system to identify people who have died or have left Australia; to improve the efficiency of PBS and Medicare administration; and to protect doctors and pharmacists from providing free or concessional services or pharmaceuticals to those who are ineligible for them.</PARA>
<PARA> People are often not aware that they need to inform the Health Insurance Commission of the death of spouses or relatives. Because the Health Insurance Commission has not had any systematic way of updating its records, more names of people are enrolled as eligible for Medicare benefits than there should be. Reissuing Medicare cards will let the Health Insurance Commission update its records to account for the people who have died or who have left Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> We will gain significant administrative efficiencies by incorporating information on a magnetic strip on the back of the card. This means that pharmacists and claims clerks in Medicare offices will not have to key in numbers. They will simply have to swipe the card and the claimant's Medicare number, the card issue date and the expiry date will be recorded without mistakes. Mr Howe has made a commitment that computer terminals and the swiping equipment will be publicly available in each capital city so that people can satisfy themselves about the information encoded in the magnetic strip on the back of the card. I think that will be of great interest to most holders of these cards.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Health Insurance Commission has been working very closely with the Privacy Commissioner to deal constructively with the privacy concerns which this change to the Medicare card raises. The Privacy Commissioner has approved the Health Insurance Commission's arrangements for reissuing Medicare cards, and the Health Insurance Commission will be working closely with him to develop guidelines for the way that they are used.</PARA>

Can the Minister explain on what basis invitations for this lunch were made by the Labor Party, and whether it is true that companies invited have been given to believe that attendance will give them an advantage in picking up contracts for reconstruction work in Kuwait?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can confirm that the board of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has taken what is certainly a major decision in recent weeks in respect of completely reorganising the air traffic control systems in Australia. The reason it is being done is that it goes hand in glove with the changed arrangements with the actual control of Australia's air space management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Patterson interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not going to happen. The current system, which is anachronistic, has got six air traffic control centres which are based on State boundaries. They do not actually reflect the traffic flow of the aircraft themselves. CAA has taken the opportunity to completely move away from this to a modern integrated system which will have two major centres, one in Brisbane and one in Melbourne, which will control all of Australia's controlled air space. Control towers will still continue to exist at airports and they will provide the same services they provide now with approach, departure and surface traffic management at the airport itself. There will be an increase in the safety factor, if anything, provided by this new system, because it will cut down the unnecessary number of sector hand overs of an aircraft from one controller to another as it travels across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to the last part of the question about the Birdsville races: the CAA will continue to provide the same service it currently provides for one-off events where there is a very large amount of aviation traffic to an area that does not normally receive it. The CAA will provide mobile control facilities at those events.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of interjections which I will not bother to answer, but one thing is quite clear: if Opposition senators want to interject about this, I remind them that they are the last people to get their act together in relation to this delegation. It was intended that this be a bipartisan delegation right from the beginning. It is quite astounding that the Opposition has been unable, it seems, to make a sensible selection in respect of that delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the delegation is simply to emphasise an issue which has been a running one between the Australian and United States governments over the trade enhancement program. It is hoped that the delegation will be a comprehensive one and will at least have some impact prior to the resumption of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Round on the United States Administration, because of essentially farm subsidies. That, of course, has done immense damage to Australian producers.</PARA>
<PARA> The delegation, which follows delegations which have been sent to the United States over many years by various governments, comes at the most important time of any of those delegations because the problem is greater than it has ever been in the past. So I think the Senate should wish the delegation every success. I understand that Mr Downer will be attending the delegation as a sort of late entrant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reports we have to hand to date suggest that the results of the referenda in Estonia and Latvia over the weekend on 3 March produced a very strong vote indeed in favour of independence. It will be recalled that the poll held in Lithuania in January, in which there was a turnout of some 84 per cent, produced a 91 per cent vote in favour of independence. That was a particularly high vote, of course, not least because some 80 per cent of the Lithuanian population presently resident in Lithuania are ethnic Lithuanians. It was not anticipated that anything like that result would be achieved in the other two states, where the percentage of ethnic Latvians, for example, is only 54 per cent, with the bulk of the rest being ethnic Russians and, in the case of Estonia, where the locals constitute only 65 per cent of the population. But in the event the figures were remarkably strong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been some confusion in press reports this morning right across the spectrum, but the latest figures available to me suggest that in Latvia the yes vote was in fact 73 per cent with a turnout of 88 per cent. So it was not a question of the election being boycotted by the Russian speakers; it was a very high turnout, in fact higher than in Lithuania, with a very strong independence vote. In Estonia, with a turnout of 83 per cent, the vote was 77 per cent. If those figures hold-and they are only preliminary estimates available to me-they are stunningly strong. Of course, they represent very clearly, as did the declarations of independence themselves made by the Baltic states last year, the aspirations of the Baltic peoples to rejoin the family of nations through peaceful and democratic means-aspirations which the Australian Government has made repeatedly clear it very strongly supports.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, without going back over the history of previous statements that we have made-I think our reaction to the very unhappy events in January is clear and on the record-I understand that Soviet and Baltic representatives have recently met to discuss the resumption of substantive talks on the future status of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. We are watching the situation very closely, hopeful that the proposed negotiations will take place in an atmosphere free of intimidation or threat of force. We hope-I know everyone in the Senate does-that those negotiations will produce results consistent with the legitimate aspirations of the Baltic people.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely; that is true. The data for the December quarter shows a large decrease in investment compared to the previous quarter. It has been felt equally in plant and equipment and in buildings and structures. The figures move fairly rapidly from quarter to quarter. For example, the September quarter showed an increase in total investment of over 6 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is also a large degree of variability in these figures across sectors, which I think is important. In the finance, property and business services sector, the falls were large. Manufacturing and mining recorded slight gains in investment for the quarter. That does not say anything about anticipation; all it says is that there were things in the pipeline but slight gains were shown in respect of manufacturing and mining.</PARA>
<PARA> Longer term data is perhaps a better guide to the investment performance of the economy. Manufacturing investment has been quite strong over the last few years. It has grown at an average rate of 11.5 per cent a year. I make the point that total investment performance has also exceeded past experience with business fixed investment equivalent to 12.9 per cent of gross domestic product over 1989-90-that is, two percentage points above the average.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the point of Senator Chapman's question is that we can all draw conclusions from those figures. I am pleased, in a sense, that the fall in mining and manufacturing investment is not as significant as it is in the service sector-not that I welcome that, but it is good that the figures are better in those two sectors. With regard to the national accounts figures, I cannot prophesy anything but I anticipate that there would be negative growth in this quarter.</PARA>

The amount of oil in the Gulf is estimated to be somewhere between one and two million barrels. To this point in time the efforts have been concentrated on protecting the desalination plants from fouling because the war itself has prevented a more comprehensive effort being directed to doing something about this massive oil spill, certainly the worst the world has ever seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of requests from Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to the international community, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has made available a technical expert in oil pollution and the Australian Institute of Petroleum Ltd has also made available one of its experts.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last question is yes, but I will come to that in the answers to the other questions. Last Thursday in Melbourne I had the pleasure of releasing a seminal work in industrial relations. This study, conducted by my Department, covered interviews with some 4,500 managers and industrial relations practitioners on the union side in 2,300 workplaces around Australia-workplaces representative of the spread of industry that this country has. The survey took two years to complete. It was supervised by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to ensure statistical accuracy and had a compliance rate of 87.5 per cent, which is near to the 90 per cent figure mentioned in the question. I think we can now confidently, for the first time, talk about what in fact is the case in workplaces in this country where more than five workers are employed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are three major issues highlighted by the survey which I think are important from a policy point of view. Firstly, there is a distressingly low level of communication between management and employees in this country compared with other countries. We languish at the bottom of the class in talking to one another in the workplace. Secondly, unfortunately there is little infrastructure in place for enterprise negotiations to succeed, which is a salutary comment, coming at this time with the national wage case decision, which will set down guidelines for enterprise negotiation, only weeks away. As well, there is a distressingly short life span for industrial relations representatives on the company side. Most hold their position for only two years, meaning that corporate memory in companies about industrial relations practices is quite short. There is equally a very high turnover rate on the union side with shop stewards, which perhaps means that frequently there is a recasting yet again of the wheel that was invented in the past.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the myths that were exploded by the survey is that Australian industry is in a constant state of disruption; it is not. Nearly three-quarters of all workplaces reported that they had never ever experienced industrial action. The second myth, I think, is that the arbitration system is inflexible; that myth is exploded comprehensively. A small minority of managers said that they thought there was some inflexibility. Overwhelmingly, most said they did not believe that. They were satisfied with the progress made in award restructuring that has been achieved; they were satisfied with the spread of hours and the hours of work during which they supervised their workers. Most of them overwhelmingly expressed no need for change in that area. The third myth is that the Australian workplace is somehow static and rigid and does not change. Eighty-seven per cent of companies reported significant organisational change in their enterprise in the last four years.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by saying that I have now received a press release issued by the shadow spokesman for industrial relations, Mr Howard. He should really get his facts right. This press release proposes to comment on this survey and to find some support for his esoteric and irrelevant views on industrial relations. One of the factual comments he makes in his press release is that the survey ought to have surveyed work places in which 20 or fewer workers were employed. If he had actually read the survey he would know that, of the 2,400 workplaces surveyed, 349 workplaces had between five and 19 workers. I am assured by the statistician that that is sufficient a sample in order to extrapolate views as to that section of the work force. Mr Howard is just factually wrong, unfortunately, again.</PARA>

There was sent to all of our regional offices, on 18 December if we need to be precise, an instruction which clearly indicated that the beneficiaries to whom the honourable senator referred were affected by the deeming rules. I cannot swear to every regional office in Australia getting it right. Some are accurate and some may make errors, and I certainly would not swear to the accuracy of the honourable senator's office, either. I would not regard the survey conducted by her office as a fair survey of social security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that, in making millions of decisions a year and in giving out millions of different pieces of information, some errors will be made. I would hate to think that the number of errors to which the honourable senator has referred could have been made. I do not know to whom the honourable senator spoke in those offices, but I am absolutely certain she would not have spoken to those to whom pensioners are referred when they ring. I do not believe there is anything like that amount of confusion in our own offices.</PARA>
<PARA> To get to what I consider to be the other part of her question, that is, what efforts are being made to notify other beneficiaries-there are very few, in fact, among the beneficiary numbers who will be affected by deeming. All of those who have come on stream in recent times have of course been asked questions. Where we can find from the financial information given to us that they are affected, they are given advice to that effect straightaway. By far the enormous percentage of the numbers comes from age pensioners and invalid pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not the case that there will be very many amongst, say, unemployment beneficiaries who will be affected. As they give us information which leads us to believe they are affected, they are contacted. If I were to agree to send a letter to every one of them, it would cost an awful lot of money. I did agree to send a letter to all age pensioners the other day. I think the final cost of that may come out to something like $700,000; certainly a lot of money.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it is always a temptation in any society fighting organised crime or dealing with national security questions to vigorously employ all means to achieve the desired social goals, and that includes telephone intercepts, but this Parliament has laid down very stringent rules governing the obtaining of warrants to enable the interception of telephones in order to deal with law enforcement and national security matters. They are set out in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to law enforcement, it is quite clear that the offence being investigated has to be of a serious character, such as murder or drug trafficking of a particular type, but the most important protection is that a warrant must be obtained from a Federal judge-not a magistrate or a Supreme Court judge but a Federal judge-in order that the intercept be lawfully undertaken. The judge has to satisfy himself or herself as to whether the particular lines of law enforcement investigation have been exhausted, which would leave telephone interception as a last resort in the investigation of a particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA> The warrant is issued to the Telecommunications Interception Division of the Australian Federal Police, which executes the warrant on behalf of the Federal Police or any State police force which may be participating in the telephone interception arrangements under the Act. A time limit of 90 days is imposed by the Act and extension is possible through the warranting procedure. Each warrant obtained by the Australian Federal Police is brought to my attention, and in relation to State police forces warrants are brought to the attention of the relevant State Minister. In relation to security matters, a warrant must be obtained from the Attorney-General, and in emergencies, where stringent conditions are once again imposed, it may be obtained from the Director-General, but I think only for 48 hours. The warrant is executed by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and may remain in force for up to six months.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Senator McLean's question about whether the tapping of any Federal parliamentary member's telephone has been authorised in the past five years, in accordance with long-established practice I will neither confirm nor deny that any particular person has been subject to telephone interception. I think I have indicated that there is, certainly in the case of law enforcement matters, stringent judicial control, and, in the case of both law enforcement and national security matters, political responsibility is taken by the relevant portfolio Ministers in relation to the obtaining of warrants for interception.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean claims that both he and a Mr John McLennan suspect their phones have been illegally tapped and asks me what they might do in this situation. Quite clearly the appropriate course-and it must have been known to Senator McLean-would be to contact the Australian Federal Police in so far as an offence under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act is alleged. I must say that when I first had some notice that this question might be asked-I got notice at about midday-my immediate reaction was to have phoned the Assistant Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, who deals with operational matters, in order to alert him to this allegation.</PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that rather than Senator McLean coming to Question Time and giving the alleged tappers public notice of the fact that he harboured these suspicions and that an investigation might be undertaken, he ought to have undertaken the very sensible course of contacting the Australian Federal Police. I understand that his office was advised over the lunch hour that that would be a proper course to undertake. If an irregularity in the line has given rise to this suspicion, then quite obviously it might be appropriate to check with Telecom Australia as to the technical reason for the irregularity.</PARA>
<PARA> The Telecommunications (Interceptions) Act prohibits anyone from tapping a telephone line except in the circumstances I have outlined. A penalty of $5,000 or imprisonment for a period of up to two years is provided for the offence. As to the question of parliamentary privilege, I believe that is a question which is best answered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration undertaking the bank inquiry. I believe that any concerns in that regard ought to be directed to that Committee in the first instance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Social Security aware of recent press reports urging the Government to cut spending by $3 billion and claiming that half of the savings could be made from restricting unemployment benefit payments? Is this possible? Does the Government support these or other cuts?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When looking at the question of cuts in social security spending, obviously there are a number of ways we can go. The Government, over the course of the last few years, has saved something like $8 billion by better targeting those who ought to be in receipt of welfare payments and those who ought not to be. We can take an alternative approach, which has been advocated by some people in the Opposition, such as Mr Reith and Senator Alston; that is, to cut people off unemployment benefits after nine months. That has always been tempered by a view that it did not really matter because people would go on to special benefits. During the last two weeks Mr Reith has effectively removed that possibility. He has said that there will be $3 billion in savings, not net savings of some hundreds of millions, and $1 1/2 billion of that will come out of social security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To put the matter in Mr Reith's words, he said, `This is a very sensible policy. It goes to one of the structural issues'. So he is saying to thousands upon thousands of Australian families, `You are a structural issue. So far as we are concerned there is no room for you in this country, there is no room for food at the table, there is no room for any comfort from governments'. That is pathetic.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pathetic is dead set the right word for Senator Alston. I agree with Mr Reith and Dr Hewson on one thing-not putting Senator Alston in the shadow Cabinet. They know when they have someone hopeless on the team.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also think that the problems go much further. Senator West also asked about training, which we have seen more about in recent days, the complaint being that one can save money by looking at that $73m that the Department has spent on training. I find that pretty extraordinary. There have been more than 300 major policy and administrative changes in five years. The Department has reduced fraud, it has better targeted our system, and it has made the system more efficient and more proactive. Those changes have involved millions of decisions-not just one, two or three, but millions of decisions. If one looks at what happened last year, what the training has done for staff in Social Security, one knows that all those decisions are appealable. Indeed, 6,500 of them went to appeal and two-thirds were found in favour of the Department. The reality is that training helps to deliver the goods.</PARA>
<PARA> If Opposition senators were out there in Social Security offices, particularly in times of recession when clients are coming in under stress and stress is increasing in the office, they would discover that that training is absolutely essential. We will not look on those who are displaced in this country as simply structural issues. We will retain the safety net. Senator Alston has to make up his mind whether Reith is right or he is. Are the people concerned to go on special benefits or are they to go nowhere? The answer, as we all know, is that under the Liberals they will go nowhere.</PARA>

<PARA>(4) It is anticipated that by the end of 1990-91 this percentage will be 50%. It should be noted that this corresponds to 66% of DSS offices.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) Sub-Program 4.1-Employment Access</PARA>
<PARA>The Job Search Training, JOBTRAIN, and JOBSTART elements of the Employment Access sub-program are delivered through the CES. Monitoring and administrative functions are performed both in the Department of Employment, Education and Training's (DEET's) Area and State Offices, and in Central Office.</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-Program 4.2-Community-based Strategies</PARA>
<PARA>CES Offices are involved in the operations of the SkillShare and New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) elements of the Community-based Strategies sub-program through:</PARA>
<PARA>- referring potential participants to SkillShare projects;</PARA>
<PARA>- acting as the principal point of contact with SkillShare project sponsors and responding to inquiries;</PARA>
<PARA>- promoting NEIS and providing information about the Scheme to clients;</PARA>
<PARA>- referring prospective participants to DEET State Offices/State governments and/or managing agents; and</PARA>

<PARA>(6) Sub-Program 4.1-Employment Access</PARA>
<PARA>The JOBTRAIN program provides opportunities for the long-term unemployed or other especially disadvantaged job seekers to receive vocational training based on opportunities in the local labour market.</PARA>
<PARA>JOBSTART is a general wage subsidy program which provides access to employment for job seekers who have experienced long periods of unemployment or face other disadvantages in obtaining work. Under the program employers receive subsidy payments for up to 20 weeks as an incentive for engaging and improving the employment prospects of these disadvantaged job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA>The Job Search Training Program aims to address the employment needs of disadvantaged job seekers by providing them with intensive instruction in job search techniques.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two components to the program:</PARA>
<PARA>- Job Clubs, which provide for intensive supervised training and job hunting over 3 weeks; and</PARA>
<PARA>- Job Search Training Courses, which provide 20 hours of formal job search training.</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-Program 4.2-Community-based Strategies</PARA>
<PARA>SkillShare is a community-based labour market program targeted at the most disadvantaged in the labour market. It operates as an Australia-wide network of local projects managed by non-profit community organisations or local government authorities (known as sponsors) with the skills and experience to assist long-term and other most disadvantaged unemployed people gain work and proceed to further education or training.</PARA>
<PARA>Sponsors receive funding to provide a range of practical, innovative activities and services responsive to the needs of the target group and taking into account opportunities in the local labour market. The relevant Area Director of the Department of Employment Education and Training, is responsible for the funding of SkillShare projects.</PARA>
<PARA>In line with the Government's efficiency and equity objectives for the labour market, SkillShare aims to assist long-term unemployed and other most disadvantaged unemployed people to increase their skill levels through:</PARA>
<PARA>- the provision of structured skills training and other employment-related activities;</PARA>
<PARA>- the provision of enterprise activities; and</PARA>
<PARA>- referral to other more formal employment or training programs or services.</PARA>
<PARA>NEIS provides assistance for unemployed people to set up self employment ventures. The Scheme operates as a partnership between the Commonwealth and either State/Territory Governments or private sector and non-government organisations. The assistance provides a comprehensive support package for participants during the crucial establishment phase, increasing their opportunity to establish themselves successfully in permanent self-employment.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth provides 12 months income support, broadly equivalent to Job Search Allowance, and training in business plan development and small business management skills. This is complemented by start-up capital and business advice provided by State/Territory Governments or other organisations participating in NEIS jointly with the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>The target group for NEIS is unemployed people registered with the CES, in receipt of or dependent on Job Search Allowance or certain other Social Security benefits or pensions, aged from 18 years through to the ages for Aged Pension eligibility. Proposed businesses must be new, independent, reputable and assessed as commercially viable and meeting an unsatisfied demand.</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-Program 4.5-Aboriginal Employment</PARA>
<PARA>Detail of the various elements of TAP are provided in the explanatory notes and the DEET Programs booklet for 1989/90. Essentially, the sub-program provides wage subsidies and training assistance to assist Aboriginal people to obtain employment and to enhance the prospects for career development of Aboriginal people already employed. Assistance is also provided for Aboriginal participation in community enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-Program 5.2-Mobility Assistance</PARA>
<PARA>The primary aim of Mobility Assistance is to contribute to the efficient, effective and equitable functioning of the labour market by giving job seekers access to training and jobs which are not locally available, while also helping employers to obtain workers with appropriate skills.</PARA>

<PARA>SENATE QUESTION</PARA>
<PARA>(Question Without Notice)</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus: On 20 February 1991 (Hansard page 906) Senator Reid asked me a question without notice concerning the Government's response to recent reports on the Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) at the Australian National University (ANU).</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, the Hon Peter Baldwin MP, has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government commissioned a review of the Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) in January 1990 headed by Sir Ninian Stephen. In announcing the review, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the Hon J S Dawkins MP, said the need for a comprehensive review of the IAS had been recognised both by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) and by the University itself. The IAS had been established in 1946 and it was considered that it needed a new mandate to take it into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA>The Review Report (Stephen Report), which was presented to the Government on 5 November 1990 and publicly released, concluded that the IAS continues to have an important role to play as a major Australian centre of research and of research training at the highest level. However, it also recommended that the Institute's charter be extended to include the additional role of being a research resource for the whole of Australia's higher education research community and indeed Australian research generally. It recommended that the IAS should forge stronger co-operative links with State universities. This calls for some changes within the IAS.</PARA>
<PARA>In December last year, Mr Baldwin sought advice from Professor Chubb, Chair of the Higher Education Council, NBEET, on the implications of the Stephen Report with particular reference to the provision of higher education in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Chubb's advice to the Minister on achieving the Stephen recommendation in relation to the IAS was that national acceptance of the Institute would be most readily achieved if it were a free-standing research/postgraduate institute, as it began.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to advise the Minister that if this approach was adopted it would be appropriate to look to a merging of the ANU Faculties, the University of Canberra and the Canberra Institute of the Arts to provide a strong higher education resource for the ACT and region.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Baldwin is currently consulting with all interested parties in the ACT and the Government intends to move quickly to announce its decision on the future structure of ACT higher education to remove any uncertainty about the ANU's future.</PARA>

<PARA>SENATE QUESTION</PARA>
<PARA>(Question No. 427)</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Spindler asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 23 January 1991:</PARA>
<PARA> Why will Victoria, which has already experienced severe education cuts as a consequence of the ALP State Government's Budget, receive no share of the $9m of additional Federal funds allocated to the Disadvantaged Schools Program in the 1990-91 Federal Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus: The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA>- The Government has introduced a new national index of disadvantage for the allocation of 1991 Disadvantaged Schools Program funds, including the additional $9m made available in the 1990-91 Federal Budget. The index seeks to identify the most seriously socio-economically disadvantaged communities in Australia, and is based on 1986 Census data and an analysis of schools' catchment areas.</PARA>
<PARA>- The new index adopts the following six variables with the weightings indicated:</PARA>
<PARA> Occupation...50 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment...10 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Education...10 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Family Income...10 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Accommodation...10 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Crowding...10 per cent</PARA>
<PARA>- The basic index would have resulted in reductions in funding to the government school sectors in Victoria and the Northern Territory, and to the non-government school sectors in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. However, the Government decided that no State-sector would receive less in 1991 under the new index than it had in 1990. As a result, allocations for the potential losers are being maintained at 1990 funding levels in real terms at a total cost of $1.6m. Their enrolment ceilings are also being maintained at 1990 levels.</PARA>

<PARA>SENATE QUESTION</PARA>
<PARA>(Question No. 403)</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Short asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 17 December 1990:</PARA>
<PARA> What has been the number of persons registered for employment, and the unemployment rate, for each quarter since September 1989 for the Federal Electorates of Ballarat, Burke and Wills.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus: The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA>Data on the number of persons registered as unemployed and seeking employment (Unemployed Awaiting Placement) at local CES office or other small area level are not released as these figures are neither an accurate measure of unemployment, nor a reliable indicator of changes in unemployment, for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA>- coverage of job seekers can vary over time as a result of changes in labour market conditions, variations in administrative procedures and the effects of Government policy, especially the impact of changes in labour market programs;</PARA>
<PARA>- some jobseekers remain registered with the CES although they have either independently found employment or left the labour force but have not notified the CES;</PARA>
<PARA>- not all people seeking employment register with the CES for assistance; and</PARA>
<PARA>- at the local level the inaccuracies and distortions in the data which often occur are especially significant, and there are concerns that these figures may have been given undue emphasis in the past in determining plans and resource allocations in local communities.</PARA>
<PARA>In any event, the Department does not hold these data grouped into electorates.</PARA>
<PARA>The following table of unemployment rates is based on Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Labour Force estimates and provides the information requested by the honourable Senator in relation to the unemployment rate in the areas broadly covered by the three electorates.</PARA>

<PARA>Pursuant to Order of the Senate of 21 February 1991 I table an explanation for the delay in responding to question No. 388 asked by Senator Alston on 17 December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>At the outset I should state that I take my responsibility for answering questions on notice very seriously indeed. Processes are in place within my Department and my office to meet the deadline for answering questions set by the Senate, and in virtually all cases these work well.</PARA>
<PARA>Regrettably in this instance these processes failed, because of difficulty in assembling and clearing relevant data over the holiday period. My answer was provided to the Table Office on 22 February 1991 with the usual request that it be passed on to the Senator, but has not yet appeared in Hansard. The question was:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) What amount was spent by the department (a) in the financial year 1988-89; and (b) in the financial year 1989-90, for the purpose of training actual and potential staff.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) What is the estimate for the amount to be spent on training staff and potential staff for the financial year 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) For each of the years 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91, what was spent on, or what is the estimate for, salaries and payments in the nature of salaries paid by the department.</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) (a) $345,000 (b) $923,000</PARA>
<PARA>(2) $1,495,000</PARA>
<PARA>(3) 1988-89 $25,777,000 1989-90 $25,197,000 1990-91 $31,211,000</PARA>
<PARA>Note 1(b): From 1989/90 Departmental reports of staff development and training costs for Human Resource Development Surveys conducted by the Public Service Commission covered all identified items, including indirect costs such as salaries for staff attending courses.

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator MacGibbon asked me in Question Time on 21 February 1991:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it a fact that around December last year the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation called for expressions of interest from the aviation industry to operate and maintain its F27 aircraft? Is it a fact that contract has been awarded to the Civil Aviation Authority? If so, why are the regulators of the aviation industry competing in a commercial area?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to the honourable Senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO advertised nationally on 30 November 1990 inviting expressions of interest to meet their requirement for a suitably qualified contractor to operate and/or maintain its Fokker F27 aircraft for a period ending on 30 June 1992. A submission was lodged with the CSIRO by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) on the basis that the CAA's Flying Unit only be considered if aviation industry agencies cannot fulfil the requirements of the work.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the CSIRO has not finalised the assessment of the expressions of interest.</PARA>
<PARA> The CAA as a Government Business Enterprise has a policy which allows its Flying Unit to make specialist services available in Australia on commercial terms in circumstances where the aviation industry does not have the capacity to fully meet the requirement. On occasions at the industry's request, the CAA has previously entered into joint ventures in order to retain business in Australia which would otherwise have gone to foreign aviation interests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, I raise a matter relating to the decision that you made on Senator Alston's question, concerning practices of Ministers tabling explanations. I do not want to query your order other than to remind you that this is a very recent addition to the Standing Orders of September 1988. I do not know whether this particular question has been visited in the past. Certainly, it is not explicitly stated in the order that the Minister must give the explanation orally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I respectfully suggest to you, Mr President, that it logically follows from the order as drafted because the order provides for certain actions to be taken by an honourable senator if the explanation given is unsatisfactory. It seems to me that an honourable senator cannot make that assessment if a Minister is going to be allowed to table the explanation. The Opposition has no quarrel with his entitlement to table the answer, but the explanation as to why the answer was not given within the time constraints of the Standing Orders seems to me to be something that should be given verbally in order that we can take what action appears appropriate under the Standing Orders. </PARA>

But I also asked members of the Opposition to tell the relevant Ministers if they intended to raise this point at the end of Question Time.

<PARA>This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns.

<PARA>Tasmania is the smallest and southernmost island-State in Australia. It contains over one third of Australia's Rainforests and provides a unique environment for the tallest trees of the southern hemisphere.</PARA>
<PARA>In the past two decades Tasmania has lost nearly half of its remaining forest coverage, which has fallen victim to woodchipping and the Japanese paper industry. At present, Tasmania exports over three million tonnes dry weight of woodchips a year, taken from forests which the Government is supposed to protect-Australia's so-called National Estate. This same fate is due to befall Jackeys Marsh, North Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>This valley, nestling under the Western Tiers of Tasmania's Central Plateau, has an exceptional forest ecology of eucalypt and Rainforest trees, which support an abundance of life. The valley also contains a number of environmentally sustainable work projects. Despite its inclusion in Australia's National Estate and its ecological value the valley is due to be logged within the next twelve months. The residents of Jackeys Marsh ask for your help.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Peter</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations, Statutory Rules 1990 No. 394, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 14 February 1991. These Regulations were, of course, the second set of such principal Regulations made under the parent Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, the first set having been disallowed by the Senate on 16 May 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>Before this disallowance you gave a prompt and helpful undertaking to amend the Regulations to meet the concerns of the Committee. The present Regulations implement almost all of these considerable undertakings, for which the Committee is grateful. However, the undertaking to restrict the power of delegation of the Secretary under r.47 to waive or reduce fees to SES officers of the Department does not appear to have been implemented. The Committee would appreciate your advice.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee appreciates that any adverse exercise of a discretion to waive or reduce fees is now subject to AAT review and that this is an important safeguard for individuals. Nevertheless, as the Regulations stand it appears that the Secretary may delegate to any officer of the Department, no matter how junior, the power to waive or reduce unlimited amounts of Commonwealth revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also noted that the Explanatory Statement did not mention that various provisions of the Regulations implemented undertakings given to the Committee. The Committee would be grateful if you could arrange for this to be done in future such cases. This will allow the Parliament and the public to be more familiar with the types of concerns raised by the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your correspondence of 14 February 1991 regarding delegation of the Secretary to waive or reduce fees under the Regulations to the Therapeutic Goods Act (1989).</PARA>
<PARA>The circumstances under which the fees may be waived or reduced are set out under Regulation 45 with sub-regulations 45(1) and 45(2) requiring the delegate to exercise judgement in making the decision. Accordingly the delegations under these sub-regulations have been restricted to the SES officer level.</PARA>
<PARA>Sub-regulation 45(3) recognises the transitional status of particular applications which have been approved for supply, but have not yet been supplied, or are currently undergoing evaluation. The decision to waive the fee under this sub-regulation is purely administrative and consequently the Secretary's power under 45(3) has been delegated to the Senior Officer Class B/Senior Professional Officer A responsible for the administration and co-ordination of the evaluation process and to the relevant SES officers.</PARA>
<PARA>While the Regulations have not been amended to restrict the power of delegation of the Secretary under Regulation 47 to waive or reduce fees, the delegations which have been arranged restrict to SES level officers the exercise of any discretion to waive or reduce Commonwealth revenue.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Peter</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 18 February 1991 on aspects raised by the Committee of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations, Statutory Rules 1990 No. 394. The Committee considered your letter at its meeting of 21 February 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is grateful for your advice, which meets its concerns. The Committee normally prefers that legislation be amended to meet its concerns but in suitable cases administrative action is accepted. In the present case the Committee has accepted such action because the point at issue does not affect the rights of individuals. Any adverse decision on waiver or reduction of fees is now subject to AAT review, following your helpful implementation of suggestions of the Committee. The present point concerns the appropriate protection of Commonwealth revenue and the Committee is pleased to accept your advice that the steps taken should do this.</PARA>
<PARA>Although you did not expressly advise on the point, the Committee assumes that in future cases where legislation is amended to implement undertakings given to the Committee, that this will be noted in the Explanatory Statement.</PARA>

<PARA>For some years now Australia has been faced with a major economic problem. That problem, of course, has been our increasing foreign debt--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the interjection. It has been brought about by the policies of Mr Keating. Increasing foreign debt is a major problem. It is interesting to note that officers of the International Monetary Fund are currently in Australia talking to the Government and, no doubt, reminding it that it needs to adopt policies to overcome that problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition parties have been spelling out the solution for many years. In simple terms the solution is, firstly, that we must become more productive and more competitive and, secondly, that we need to increase our savings and our investment in Australian business. They are simple propositions-not complicated. In a nutshell, we must become more productive and competitive and we must save more. This Government seems to be unable to implement policies to effect those ends. </PARA>
<PARA> We have debated these proposals so often that I think Government senators are now beginning to understand and agree with the proposal; but not the Australian Treasurer (Mr Keating). Faced with this major problem of increasing foreign debt, which is getting worse by millions of dollars every month, he pulled the big lever of high interest rates to cut imports. I ask you, Madam Acting Deputy President: how on earth would that increase productivity?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan is going to follow me in this debate. I ask him to tell the Senate how increasing interest rates would increase productivity. Does he agree with me that increasing productivity would have been one of the solutions to our problem and continues today to be one of the solutions to our problems? I ask him: how would high interest rates increase productivity? Of course, they would not. Then the Treasurer, having pulled that lever, kept it on too long, as we continued to tell him week after week, month after month that it was on too long--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In January 1990 you introduced it? That is about it. I understand that. Now we are faced with a major depression brought about by this Government's policy of high interest rates imposed at too high a rate and kept on for too long. This might have reduced our imports but it has destroyed investment in this country and it has broken the morale of many of the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This was the recession that Mr Keating had to have. Why did he have to have this recession? He and Mr Kelty have entered into an agreement which has left the Treasurer with no alternatives but to increase interest rates. The Australian community is now paying dearly for that liaison between Mr Keating and Mr Kelty. Has nothing been learned in the 60 years since the 1930s? Have those people over in the Treasury offices learned nothing?</PARA>
<PARA> When Senator McMullan gets up to speak, it will not do him any good to refer to the problems of the Fraser Government in the 1980s because at least the Fraser Government had two good excuses for the situation then-a world recession, which the Government does not have, and an Australia-wide drought, which broke almost immediately Mr Hawke was elected. So the Fraser Government had two good excuses for the problems of the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has had no such problems at all; it has had no excuse at all. It has introduced this recession for one purpose only-to cut imports. It has done that because it was not game to do any of the other things which should have been done. It did not have the courage to take on the trade union movement; it did not have the courage to break the agreement with Mr Kelty; and it did not have the courage to face the left wing of the Labor Party. What it did was squeeze the economy dry, and it is now carrying the responsibility for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Has the Government no compassion for what it has done to the people of Australia? Small business is hurting desperately-perhaps most of all. I might say that small business employs about 50 per cent of the work force and is responsible for about 40 per cent of Australia's value-added product. We know that small business does not have a high profile. It is not spectacular and there are few stories about it in the papers. But the hurt is deep. </PARA>
<PARA> Figures for the 1990 December quarter-the last quarter published so far-show a 56 per cent increase in Australia's bankruptcies over the December quarter of 1989. That included an increase of 69 per cent in Victoria, 60 per cent in New South Wales and 89 per cent in Western Australia, which my colleague, Senator Knowles, will refer to during the course of this debate. But they are only figures. Think of what it means to the people who have gone bankrupt-people who have given their all for their business but who are now owing debts beyond their ability to repay. Think of the effects of bankruptcy on them and on their children. </PARA>
<PARA> What about those people who have not gone bankrupt but who have had to sell everything in order to keep their business going? Close personal friends of mine-not quite my age, but approaching it-have had to sell their homes and all their assets in order to pay off their debts so they can keep their businesses going. They are working long hours-they have always done so-and are barely surviving. Their life savings have gone. They will not be able to make up the loss, even if their businesses could survive in the vile economic climate we are suffering at the present moment. I know of many who are in this position. I am drawing attention to them because they are not part of the bankruptcy statistics; they have sold their assets in order to pay their debts. It is perhaps fortunate that earlier in their lives they were able to save the assets which they have now lost. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the hidden consequences of bankruptcies? What about the employees who are being put off? We know that some of these figures are showing up in the unemployment statistics, but not all. It is no good quoting unemployment statistics. We must appreciate that there are a large number of people out in the community who have lost their jobs but who are still living on whatever capital they have left while they try desperately to obtain some decent job in this vile economic climate. </PARA>
<PARA> People living in my State of Victoria find that it is absolutely hopeless trying to get a job. Victorians have turned off their expenditure as they desperately try to save what little they have in the face of the Australian economic climate which has been compounded by the economic climate caused by the Labor Government of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> What do they say to the few people opposite who are prepared to take an interest in this debate? Are they going to sit there wringing their hands and waiting for something to turn up? Is that what they are doing? Has it never occurred to them that their Treasurer and Mr Kelty are still on the wrong track? What about those people who are working shortened weeks to help their employers survive? I will give another example close to me. The workers at Fletcher Jones in Warrnambool are now down to working a 4-day week. I picked up today's paper and read where the State Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Union of New South Wales, Mr Bill Taylor, talks about Australia's hidden unemployment problem. These are people who are not unemployed but are working shortened weeks. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Workers are having their wages cut . . . every week. In my 36 years with the motor industry I have never seen it worse. </PARA>
<PARA>He has never seen it worse. Mr Taylor said that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . while employees wanted to keep their jobs and accept a shorter working week, in the end they were only ``sharing out poverty''. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words `sharing out poverty' because that is what they are doing. Honourable senators opposite should not worry because the Labor Government will give them a $12 a week wage rise very soon and then they will be able to share out some more poverty as they take another cut in the hours they are working. Mr Taylor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There may be work for six months on a four-day week, but there is no guarantee they will have a job after that . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We should blame the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer, the Reserve Bank of Australia and in particular the public servants advising the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank. As I said earlier, have they learnt nothing from the economic history of the free market world? Have they learnt nothing since the 1930s? They are squeezing the economy like a lemon. I suppose that, if I were given the opportunity to talk with them, they would say to me-and I would understand it-`Look, it was not us. We told the Treasurer what it was all about, but he had this agreement with Mr Kelty, and the only thing he could do to stop these imports was to increase interest rates.'</PARA>

<PARA> Let me now turn to my State of Victoria, which leads the fall in job advertisements. In February there was nearly a 62 per cent fall in job advertisements. How would honourable senators like to be trying to get a job in Victoria? Retail figures have posted successive falls since December 1989, with Victoria recording a 7 per cent drop in retail sales volume over the past year. The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd's chief economist, Mr Ian Little, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The slump we saw in the December quarter-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in retail sales-</PARA>
<PARA>was very large-a 7 per cent drop is almost unprecedented-it is huge. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not uncommon for business spending to rise by 15 per cent in a year but consumer spending moves around in a much narrower band- 4 per cent to zero but a 1 per cent move in consumer spending is much more significant. </PARA>
<PARA>Victoria has been destroyed by the Labor Party. Victoria has a typical Labor government. It is taxing the life out of business. It is imposing taxes, charges and fees, including registration fees-anything it can think of-to raise revenue out of business. It is imposing burdens upon business, which might be reasonable in good times but are certainly not reason- able in bad times-and it is not removing those burdens as we pass into bad times. The Victorian Labor Government is taxing the life out of business and out of the ordinary people. It is allowing its big mates to make a fortune, probably and preferably by ripping off the taxpayers. That is mostly what happens under Labor governments. It has destroyed private initiative and enterprise and has brought as many people as possible down to the lowest common denominator. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me assure honourable senators that Mr Cain and Mr Jolly will long be remembered by the people of Victoria. Their economic mismanagement has been compounded by that of Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. Now Mrs Kirner is being run by the Trades Hall Council and her solution to Victoria's problems is to give the Trades Hall Council what it demands. That will just keep it quiet for a short time while Mrs Kirner, like Mr Keating, hopes there may be some miraculous solution for the `lucky country'. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that that is what Mr Keating is waiting for. Last week an article by Alan Wood, the economics editor of the Australian, referred to Mr Keating's scenario, `Hang on and hope that some miracle will save the nation'. Mrs Kirner is the same in Victoria. Laura Tingle in yesterday's Australian said that the economic policy of this Government is quite rudderless. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>Maybe the reason that the Government's thinking about fiscal policy seems to be either confused or rapidly changing is the result of two things:</PARA>
<PARA> First, it doesn't know where the economy is headed. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, it doesn't know where economic policy is headed. </PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly right. Together the Labor Party in Canberra and the Labor Party in Victoria have ripped the heart out of small business. They have destroyed the confidence of many hundreds of thousands of people in Victoria. They have made life intolerable for those people. It is all very well for Senator McMullan to look aside and smile. I know it does not matter so much here in Canberra. After all, the people of Canberra have fixed jobs, good government jobs. Frequently both spouses are employed in good government jobs. They do not have to worry about unemployment. Let me assure Senator McMullan and other honourable senators opposite that out in the real world people are hurting desperately. No doubt, in a few minutes time, Senator McMullan will tell us we should all just wait and next Tuesday along will come the new economic statement by the Treasurer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not in the slightest. I am about to talk about the subject matter, unlike some others, but Senator Knowles would not understand that. The proposal last week was that somehow or other the inflation rate in Australia was running at 10.8 per cent because we could multiply the quarterly rate of 2.7 per cent by four and arrive at this miraculous figure. I have searched the record of the quarter before when it was 0.7 per cent. Was Senator Lewis cheering that inflation was somehow 2.8 per cent? Of course, there was a deathly silence. He did not bother to make that point because it was not convenient. I would be quite willing now to say to him: when the next inflation figures come out, on behalf of the Opposition he should multiply that figure by four, and recognise that that is the inflation rate for Australia. Of course, it will be nonsense then, as it was nonsense two weeks ago. It is just an attempt to throw any old statistics around-do not worry about their consistency or accuracy-and hope that it will impress somebody who might have the misfortune to be listening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition choose different signposts at different times. As different problems arise in the economy and they are resolved, they stop acknowledging the examples they used to use. When Senator Chaney was in this chamber, he used to talk about the problems facing Australian families, highlighted by the fact of how many weeks wages it took to buy a car. Suddenly those opposite have stopped quoting that because that statistic would not count for them. They know that the prices of motor vehicles are falling and the weeks of wages that it would take to buy a motor vehicle are decreasing. That is quite clear. They do not like that statistic, so they have moved away from it. </PARA>
<PARA> When the job boom was going on, Dr Hewson said, `Anybody could create jobs, that is easy'. But now he is moving away from that because it is no longer con- venient. Those opposite shift from argument to argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in that critique, that shallow approach taken by those opposite, says that the problems facing the economy nor the social consequences for the individuals affected by it are not very serious; of course they are. Anybody who pretends otherwise-and nobody here will-would be doing a grave disservice. We have to give people the courtesy of showing some consistency and some intellectual rigour in our approach to it. With hindsight, people might say that we could have avoided the recession, we could have avoided slowing down the economy. Everybody acknowledged that it was a slow down we had to have; to their credit, members of the Opposition did not disagree with that. Why should they? As I understand it, nobody has disagreed. Perhaps we could have avoided the recession. Nobody disagreed with the need to slow the economy down except possibly the Australian Democrats, who advocate zero economic growth, but do not want anyone to lose his job. They may have disagreed; I am not sure. </PARA>
<PARA> There was some argument in 1989 about what mechanisms ought to be used, but not about the need to do so. There was a need to slow the economy. Everybody realised that we cannot continue to have demand growing at 8 per cent and output growing at 4 per cent. That cannot continue. Even with a magic wand we cannot double output overnight; it is not possible. We can increase it steadily and gradually over the years. Over the last seven years the rate of growth of output has been remarkably high in Australia, the record of economic growth in Australia has been very substantial. But it cannot be doubled overnight; the policies to do that do not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a very tight fiscal policy, the tightest fiscal policy Australia has ever had. Interest rates were used as the variable factor. It may well be-I do not think anybody would argue now-that interest rates were loosened too late. The information on which the judgment of timing was made was inadequate and interest rates were loosened too late. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had an amazing rewriting of history. Senator Lewis contends that the Opposition was urging us to loosen interest rates earlier. On the day that they were loosened-23 January 1990-the current Leader of the Opposition said that the Government was forcing the pace and we were taking a risk in lowering interest rates because it would cause a crisis for the dollar. He actually opposed the decision. He said that it was a mistake and we were doing it too early. Twelve months after the event he cannot pretend that somehow or other he was advocating that things should be done more quickly when, at the time, he was saying that they were being done too quickly. It may be that members of the Opposition think people do not keep records of what they say because it is not sufficiently significant to be recorded, but unfortunately they were. They opposed the reduction then and at every stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Significant measures to start to turn around the economy have been taken. Every reasonable commentator recognises that. There has been significant continuing lowering of interest rates. It is true that there is room for the banks to pass more of that on; much of it has been passed on. There has been a cyclical easing of fiscal policy-entirely appropriately, of course. One thing that most people have learned, but not Senator Lewis or the Opposition, in the last 60 years of economic policy is that there should be a cyclical element in fiscal policy so that when the economy is slowing the fiscal policy is eased to start to pick up that economy, to start to improve the economic performance. Of course it should, and everybody else thinks it should. There have been significant tax cuts at the commencement of this year, which will flow through to increased expenditure capacity for families. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the consequences of those policies? The package of policies is leading to falling inflation and creating the precondition for growth with lowered inflation. For example, Westpac, which I quoted the last time we had this debate in the Senate, in its February 1991 Market Insights revised its forecast for next year and said that it expected real gross domestic product growth to be 2.8 per cent, with inflation at 4 per cent. That would be a remarkable performance in Australian economic history. To be coming out of a recession and having a recovery at that rate of growth with low inflation would perhaps break forever the inflationary expectation cycle. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern for small business seems somehow to have been tacked on to this matter of public importance. I will address it to some extent, although I think the principal issue we need to be debating is the broader question of macro-economic policy. The best thing we can do for small business is to create a growing economy, to create opportunities which individual men and women and small companies can take advantage of. I did not understand the point that somehow or other small business, in particular, is the cause of the social consequences and problems facing families. I do not want to enter into any sort of textual analysis, there is no point in that, but it is just as painful to be laid off by Ford as it is by a small company. </PARA>
<PARA> The broad and most important thing one can do for any small business is to create a growing economy. A number of things have been done in recent times with the specific purpose of enhancing the climate for small business. I have been particularly concerned with tax. Substantial initiatives have been taken there to reduce the burden of compliance costs for small business: for example, by reducing the frequency of remittances and by trying to address the service needs of small business clients. The Industry Commission is currently examining the question of the availability of capital. We have improved the export market development grants scheme particularly so that small and medium sized firms can take advantage of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Coordinated measures have been taken by State and Commonwealth governments designed to assist small business in the first ever meeting of Commonwealth, State and Territory small business Ministers last year, and important initiatives are being taken in Victoria and New South Wales on a bipartisan basis, which I think is appropriate, to establish one-stop shops and to provide assistance for small business. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the real issue-the question of macro-economic policy. What is the Opposition's prescription? We did not hear anything about it from Senator Lewis, but we have heard it before. All Senator Lewis added today was an attack on public servants, suggesting that somehow or other public servants were responsible. Notwithstanding that nobody would want to trumpet the current economic circumstances as their proudest achievement, it is entirely inappropriate-and I will not do so from this side of the chamber-to say that the responsibility for the outcome lies with public servants and to attack them for the outcome. Those opposite can attack the Government for sure-that is why we are here and it is our responsibility-but not the people who provide the advice. They must continue to be able to provide free and independent advice. </PARA>
<PARA> What is it about this Opposition prescription that will help families? Is it the consumption tax? Such a tax would make it more expensive to have children, more expensive to raise them, and more expensive to buy food and clothes. I can see families all around Australia cheering and saying, `Thank you very much. That is the one thing we need at the moment-the cost of raising our children, buying our food and our clothes made more expensive'! My colleagues on this side of the chamber will dwell on that matter a little more. Will Opposition members help families by cutting expenditure; by threatening the very support that is provided to those who have lost their jobs; by threatening the indexation of family payments; by reducing the assistance to child-care, training, Medicare, rent assistance and public housing that go to make life for Australians in greatest need more palatable?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis spoke of squeezing the economy. Tightening fiscal policy in the way Opposition members propose is the sure-fire guaranteed way to squeeze life out of the economy. That is not surprising. We have always had the situation with conservative parties that their only anti-inflationary strategy is to squeeze all the life out of the economy by fiscal policy. That is exactly what their proposals would do. But they do not understand two other very significant aspects of what is wrong with their proposal on fiscal policy. They fail to understand the fundamental interconnection between public and private sector expenditure. All the reputable recent research in the United States of America makes it absolutely clear that public infrastructure investment is vital to the success of the private sector. If one is driven ideologically to cut all public expenditure, one will guarantee that there will not be a viable private sector. The most recent research is quoted in an article by Robert Reich in The Atlantic Monthly of February of this year as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a one-dollar increase in the stock of public infrastructure adds as much to the productivity of Americans as a four-dollar increase in the stock of business capital. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been significant research by Australians associated with the Reserve Bank of Australia to reinforce that point in the Australian economic context, namely, that the success of the private sector is significantly dependent on the volume of public sector infrastructure investment. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have these grave proposals about changing education policy associated with the fiscal policy of the conservatives, who fail to see the social justice or economic implications. Recent United States research, which seems to be consistent internationally, shows that schools with smaller classes and better paid teachers produce young people who command higher salaries once they join the work force. All the evidence is that, when the role of government in equalising the provision of those facilities is taken away, the greatest assistance is provided to those already privileged. That is exactly what would follow from the Opposition's education policies, but it also has significant economic policy consequences because we are failing to train the future generation of Australians we need if the economy is to continue to grow. </PARA>
<PARA> The consumption tax that the Opposition proposes to introduce will not enhance the living standards of ordinary Australian families. Cutting expenditure will threaten the living standards of ordinary Australian families and the Opposition's attack on wages will certainly impair the living standards of ordinary Australian families for whom Opposition members profess concern. They always wail and weep about the living standards of ordinary Australian families and wage and salary earners, but every time there is a proposal to increase that wage, they attack it, as Senator Lewis today attacked the proposal for a $12 increase. Opposition members try to deny this and suggest that we should have a magical flexibility which will increase wages. But we see when we look at the aggregate outcomes about which they talk that their wages policy can achieve its economic policy objectives only if the increase in wages across the economy as a whole is less. It is true that some individuals may be better off, particularly those who are already advantaged, but essentially such a policy will attack the living standards of Australian workers because their wages will be less. </PARA>
<PARA> Without a wages policy Opposition members cannot have an anti-inflation strategy. They cannot make such a strategy add up if they cannot control wages, and they cannot. It continues to be the Achilles heel of their economic policy. Therefore they come back to the policy of slashing public expenditure, irrespective of the social justice implications, because it is the only semblance of an anti-inflationary strategy that they have. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have for the first time in a generation, as every reputable economist in Australia recognises, the possibility of breaking the inflationary cycle and the cycle of inflationary expectations in Australia. But what do Opposition members propose? They propose a consumption tax that will put prices up and destroy that possibility, on the very eve of the most significant initiative that could be taken to enhance the long term viability and competitiveness of Australian business. It flows straight through into the price of capital for Australian business, which is always a problem for the competitiveness of Australian business and which is significantly influenced by the underlying rate of inflation. The expectation that Australians and people overseas have about inflation in Australia determines the long term bond rate; it determines the cost of money to Australian business. That has always been unacceptably high because Australia has always had an uncompetitively high rate of inflation. We are on the eve of the opportunity to break that. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to come out of this recession with any advantage at all, it is vital that we come out of it in a situation where we can have broken the back of inflation and the cycle of inflationary expectation which has bedevilled Australia for a generation. That is absolutely fundamental, and any reputable economist-and there are none speaking in this debate from the other side-would acknowledge that that is vital for Australia as to where it must go economically from here. That requires no consumption tax and a wages strategy with some semblance of a capacity to control it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, in the week leading up to 12 March, when the Government's major policy initiatives between now and the Budget will be outlined, debate on this matter so far and the speech made by Senator Lewis has not said very much about the Government, but it has said a lot about the Opposition. It has gone back to the traditional Opposition formula that we have always had from conservatives for a generation. They fight unemployment by putting people out of work, they fight inflation by putting up prices, and they improve workers' living standards by attacking wages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems that at least we agree on one thing in this chamber today, and that is that there certainly is a problem. It is unfortunate that we could not have heard a little more from the Government about its specific policies. I await with interest the statement that will be made next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for looking at the problem, a great deal of hardship is indeed being felt in the Australian community. It is being experienced particularly by ordinary Australian families, many of them facing either the unemployment of their breadwinner or the prospect of their young people who are now finishing their education spending a long time on supporting benefits because they do not have the opportunity to find a realistic job with any prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> Many are facing the collapse of their small business and many farmers are, indeed, this year working hard to see only a negative income as their reward. This is all largely through no fault of their own but through a Government created environment of high interest rates, reduced protection, reduced public investment in infrastructure and the mindless pursuit of financial deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> And still the recession deepens. Still ordinary families feel the blight of unemployment and financial ruin. But still we hear nothing specific as to what the Government will do in the short term, the medium term and the long term to alleviate the immediate hardship. Again, I say, I await with interest the statements to be made next week. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with all of this, and along with all the rhetoric and theories we have heard so far, there does not seem to be so much as a shred of sympathy, let alone concrete help, for the plight of those who have fallen to the bottom of Mr Keating's famous J-curve: those people who are now facing many months, if not years, of continuing hardship watching businesses that they have spent a lifetime building up crumbling around them. </PARA>
<PARA> Yes, Australia is hurting and it is ordinary Australian families who are hurting the most. It is all too easy to just look at the figures and not see the human and social costs of the recession. But we must look at these figures because they tell their own story. I want to go through a series of these figures now. </PARA>
<PARA> I will start with bankruptcies. These have skyrocketed as a consequence of the Government's high interest rate policies. The June quarter 1990 saw a 10 per cent increase over the June quarter 1989. By the September quarter 1990 there was a 32 per cent increase over September 1989 and the December quarter 1990 showed a 56 per cent increase over December 1989. In my home State of South Australia bankruptcies rose by more than 21 per cent in the December quarter. One can speculate only with considerable trepidation on what the figures for the coming March quarter will be, considering that the recession, the Government agrees, is continuing and is likely to deepen. </PARA>
<PARA> The second group of figures is the unemployment figures. Unemployment is reaching crisis levels. There are now 767,000 Australians unemployed-9.1 per cent of the work force; that is, 9 per cent of Australians are being tossed on to the unemployment scrap heap by a Labor government that does not even have the grace to apologise to them. Yesterday saw the Australian Council of Social Service predict that by the middle of this year one million Australians, including nearly a quarter of a million children, will be dependent on unemployment benefits. These appalling figures make a mockery of the Government's efforts to disguise the effects of the recession-the one that we had to have-and make it clear that child poverty, in particular, in this country remains a terrible and scandalous problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The third group of figures we should look at is job vacancies. Here the picture is certainly no brighter. The various indices used to measure job vacancies all show them to be fewer than during the corresponding period of a year before. Far fewer jobs are available for those people who are seeking them. In fact, there are now 18 unemployed people on average looking for every job. That is double the historical average. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, I turn to private capital investment. This has fallen for the last two quarters. This is the investment which will create the jobs we need to alleviate the hardship of those who are now experiencing the unemployment that they had to have. Where are the Government's solutions to this shortfall? Other than the mutterings of some Ministers and backbenchers, the issue of increased Government investment in public infrastructure barely rates a mention. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to look specifically at farming statistics. The statistics from rural Australia tell a similar story. A recent Australian National Opinion Poll survey showed that farm incomes are expected to drop 67 per cent in this coming year. Wheat farmers have, on average, only a 2 per cent margin-that is, the difference between their costs and prices-and out of this they must meet the living expenses for their families. Of our 120,000 farmers, 74 per cent carry an average debt of $225,000. What these figures show is that the small farming business is feeling the effects of the recession, and feeling them very hard. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we must look at the reality behind the figures. What do they mean? The rural figures mean that in country areas the number of children living in poverty is double the national rate of one in eight. If I refer extensively to an article in the Adelaide Advertiser of Tuesday, 5 March, we will see what the figures mean. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Cash-starved families in South Australia are now queuing for food and other assistance from welfare agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> But as the recession deepens and the number of people hit by unemployment and financial crisis rises, demand for emergency housing and food is outstripping supply. </PARA>
<PARA> More people are now being turned away from agencies than can be helped. </PARA>
<PARA> Help is no longer being sought just by welfare recipients, but by people in paid employment who can no longer make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> Four-day working weeks and cuts in overtime mean that many families are now struggling to meet their financial commitments and are going without basic necessities . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Anglican Community Services (ACS) at Elizabeth issued food and cash to 197 people in January, but was forced to turn away another 540. </PARA>
<PARA> The trend continued for last month. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say that 196 people were actually able to get help, but 247 had to be turned away. It continues as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The director of the Para District Counselling Service at Elizabeth, Ms Rosemary Thompson, said the agency handed out $3500 worth of emergency financial assistance in a three-day period in January. </PARA>
<PARA> The demand exhausted the agency's monthly budget and it had to refuse financial help for the rest of the month. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the article states:</PARA>
<PARA>When agencies which are seen as a last resort by many people can't help any more, where do those people go?</PARA>
<PARA>There is a series of other problems. I mentioned earlier the mindset that has gripped this Government on the issues of free trade and financial deregulation. My colleague Senator McLean has pursued for quite some time in this place the matter of the banks' unethical and irresponsible behaviour, and I will not go into it in any detail today. However, I wish to stress that it is clear that the banks have failed to support small and medium size businesses and that their practices have, in many instances, directly led to the ruin of farming families and small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year Mr Phillip Holt, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, submitted to the current bank inquiry that small businesses were paying higher charges for services since bank deregulation. He said that small businesses considered that they were not only getting fewer services from their banks than previously, but were also being forced to pay more for these services. </PARA>
<PARA> In a call for tighter regulation of the major banks, the submission of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures went on to say that deregulation of the banking industry had not led to small businesses enjoying the same improvement in their ability to borrow money that larger corporations have enjoyed. Surely it is high time that the Government agreed to hold a full inquiry into the banking system. But we all know why it does not wish to do that: it does not wish to admit that its bright idea to deregulate the financial system has fizzled into a monstrous disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> I get many letters from small business people, farming families and working families expressing their views that they have been severely damaged by this Government's policies and its seeming inability to address the issues. This is what is hurting them the most: the fact that this Government is not addressing the issues and the community is sitting back, watching and waiting and, indeed, hoping that some major initiatives will be forthcoming to at least show them that the Government acknowledges the severe problems that they are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add here that much of the legislation damaging to ordinary Australian business families over the past five years has passed through this Parliament because the Opposition has supported it. I just want to give one example as it is particularly relevant to this matter of public importance. The Opposition is currently complaining about the timing of company tax payments. On 15 July this year any company with a liability of $20,000 or more will have to pay 85 per cent of its tax liability up front. </PARA>
<PARA> When this legislation came before the Senate in 1989 the Australian Democrats accepted that there was merit in it, but we thought it was far too harsh on small business. The Liberal and National parties had identified the same concerns and spoke at length on those. That was, however, only their public position. When it came to the crunch in the Senate, the Opposition voted with the Government to defeat an Australian Democrats amendment that would have assisted businesses with less than an $80,000 tax liability. We see with interest that, while the Opposition says a lot, when it actually comes to voting in this place it often does not follow on with that final step. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to close by specifically looking at a number of Australian Democrat policies and initiatives. We have always had a strong commitment to small business. Aside from its significance as a source of employment, we believe it has a number of qualities essential to the national well-being-to say nothing of the fact that it contributes nearly one half of Australia's gross national product. In the past we have supported measures to assist small business, including the taxation assistance that I mentioned earlier. We have indicated our support for the recommendations in the Beddall report on small business, including strengthening the Trade Practices Act, the establishment of a small business institute and the deferral of capital gains tax when one business is sold and another one is purchased. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also been very active in this chamber in moving a number of measures to assist precisely those families which are the subject of this matter of public importance. In particular, I refer to farming families and I call again on the Opposition and the Government to look very closely at the fact that ordinary farming families cannot receive the assistance of the family allowance supplement and Austudy, not because their incomes are minimal-if not zero-but because they have assets which are tools of trade and which, surely, they cannot be expected to sell off piece by piece in order that their families survive. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also called on the Government to provide additional assistance for welfare agencies, to provide improved access for people in need of unemployment benefits, to adopt more vigorous policies in stimulating exports, to rein in the banks and to get serious about major reforms of the taxation system-particularly to remove the present biases in favour of unproductive investment and corporate borrowing rather than saving. </PARA>
<PARA> It was with great pleasure that I saw the call from the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) for the Government to get involved in the economy. ACOSS called yesterday for the Government to `become more actively involved in identifying and encouraging economic activities which are in the national interest'. I think the Government and the Opposition would do very well to listen to this sort of message coming from the community. </PARA>

<PARA> The ongoing pain and suffering inflicted on families by the impact of incompetent economic management of the Hawke government on Australian small business. </PARA>
<PARA>My colleague Senator Lewis put to the Senate a very succinct reason why we are concerned about this particular issue. It was quite concerning, to say the least, that Senator McMullan, in response, could only muster personal abuse of the Opposition and did not bother to even attempt to answer or touch on the issue at hand. He made many allegations and I will come to a number of those throughout my contribution. I suppose one of the most outrageous things he said was when he referred to former Senator Chaney always saying how long it took for an average family to buy a new car and how much of weekly earnings it would take to buy that car. He said, `They do not quote that any more'. Let me tell the Senate and the Government why we do not quote that any more. Average Australian families cannot afford new cars and no-one has bothered to tell the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Maguire says, `Come off it'. Why does he not go down to the car factories? Why does he not go down to Ford and find out how many days work it has lost? Why does he not go around to some of the motor vehicle yards and find out how many cars they cannot sell? Why does he not have a glance at a television station occasionally and find out that the new Ford advertisements state that Ford is selling cars at 1988 prices just to quit them? Senator McMullan has the audacity to say that we do not quote the figure any more. What is the point in quoting the figure any more? No-one can afford a motor vehicle. Come off the grass, get down to the reality of it. This is a very serious subject. There are people in Australia who are literally going broke at the rate of knots and Senator Maguire does not give a continental. The Government wheels Senator Maguire, Senator Loosley and Senator McMullan out every time there is an economic debate. We have heard Senator McMullan's contribution. It was nonsense the first time and it remains nonsense the twentieth time around because not a jot has changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has become almost commonplace to state the simple fact that this Hawke Labor Government is no friend to small business. When is this Government going to realise the effects that it is having on the whole country? This Government cannot avoid the responsibility for the general mismanagement of the economy that is destroying well managed enterprises, and it is equally responsible for the burden of uncaring regulation that further reduces their chance of survival. But the Government does not tend to care about all of that. It adds more regulations and it adds more bureaucratic control over small business. Its attitude is: let us play the new game of watching them go to the wall and taking all their employees with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Only today we learned that investment in new capital equipment has fallen by 11 per cent and that expectations for the 1991-92 financial year have fallen by 14 per cent. Once again, Senator McMullan said something along the line that all the Opposition does is throw any old statistic around. He is dead right. I say this in his absence because he has taken off and cleared out of this chamber. We will throw many statistics around. It is not a case of throwing any old statistic around, it is a case of quoting new statistics provided by his Government. If he is saying they are wrong, then tell us why. Just one more straw in the wind giving its own rebuke of the quality of Labor's economic management-spelling not only reduced profits but ruin for small business-is those figures that I have already quoted about the new capital investment. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no apology for returning to the theme of bankruptcy statistics that are so strong an indicator of what the Government is doing to small business. Once again, Senator McMullan would just accuse us of throwing any old statistic around. I will throw this one at him. Last year there was a 32 per cent rise in bankruptcies overall and a 57 per cent jump in the December quarter. In Western Australia the rises were 64 per cent-precisely double the national average-and 89 per cent respectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Eighty-nine per cent in Western Australia, and here Senator McMullan, and probably Senator Maguire and Senator Loosley who are yet to come into this debate, will say we just throw any old statistic around. If they think that 89 per cent is any old statistic that they can just throw away, then they should stop and think about the number of people who have been affected by those increases in bankruptcies. Again, this means the loss of employee jobs and points to a far greater number of enterprises that have closed their doors long before going into bankruptcy. I might add also that this means a loss of an awful lot of capital and that is capital that is lost forevermore to this country and lost forevermore to other people. In 1989-90, with a total of 8,500 bankruptcies, such losses totalled $643m. But in 1990-91 we are going to be looking clearly at a much greater figure since bankruptcies for the December quarter alone were 3,117. That is just for one quarter. Yet the previous year there were 8,500 for a whole year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Small businesses are stating quietly and factually that they are struggling with interest rates in this economic climate. Taxes and the abject failure of labour market reform have created a massive problem. Yet once again we had Senator McMullan saying earlier that the Government could not do anything about it as demand was growing at 8 per cent and output was growing at 4 per cent and that we chose to do nothing about it. To start with, we are not the Government; it is the Government's responsibility to do something about that. We have been maintaining for a very long time that we need dramatic productivity increases and that we must have those as part of any survival package for this country. Does the Government want to do that? No, because the Australian Council of Trade Unions-its political master-will not allow it to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has sought to bang on the head many productivity cases around this country-for instance, the Mudginberri case, the Dollar Sweets Co. Pty Ltd case and the SPC Ltd case-and it continues to do so. While it continues to do that it should expect to see more and more people out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixty-five per cent of firms reported a decline in turnover in the December quarter in a Western Australian business opinion poll taken recently, with 62 per cent expecting a further decline. That demonstrates the level of objectivity and hope that these people have in the future. Yet, once again, Senator McMullan said that a consumption tax and a goods and services tax that we in the Liberal and National parties are advocating was `not going to enhance the living standards of ordinary Australians'. He sure has not come up with any ideas of his own. </PARA>

<PARA> Small business is uncompetitive, especially for exportation of its goods. This Government will not do a scrap about making sure that it becomes competitive. Ah no, the Government says that that is its problem. Yet we have said that as part of our goods and services tax all exports will be tax-exempt. It will be interesting to see what happens with this miraculous statement on Senator Button's portfolio that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is to make next week-if he bothers to look at the export of goods to make sure that they are exempt, in line with the Liberal-National coalition policy. But we will have to wait and see until Mr Hawke makes Senator Button's statement for him. That will be interesting to watch-even more interesting for Senator Button. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government must also accept its full share of responsibility for the burden of compliance that shackles small business in good times and helps drive it under in bad times. This Government has created 22,000 new Acts and regulations during its term of office, adding to the estimated cost of paperwork for the business sector of between $4 billion and $8 billion. The total cost of compliance to business could run as high as $60 billion, or between 9 and 19 per cent of gross domestic product, tying up business capital. It is not good enough to have instituted a Business Regulation Review Unit when at the same time the regulations just churn out. There is no end to the regulations. But does that matter? No; the Government has set up a Regulation Review Unit. That puts the lid on that, supposedly. Australia is crying out for a true free enterprise approach to business regulation that will presume in favour of a free market unless shown otherwise, and that will insist that benefits exceed costs to business and to the community that depends upon small business. </PARA>
<PARA> How typical of this Labor Government that it forced through massive changes to corporate regulation last year without thought as to the added costs on smaller companies which must pay vastly increased costs if they want to issue a prospectus to raise needed capital. That is just the typical approach of this Government: put another noose around their neck, making it more difficult for them to do anything and more difficult for them to survive because, at the end of the day, we pay them all on the dole. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has retreated from his Budget surplus figures over the last week, which went from $8 billion to $1 billion in one statement and then, a week later, from $8 billion down to a negative-no surplus at all; a deficit. But does the Government worry about that? Did Senator McMullan mention it and will Senator Maguire and Senator Loosley mention it? No, because it does not matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The mere fact is that has come about because there is not enough tax coming from the business sector; there is not enough income tax coming from individuals who have lost their jobs and are on the dole, and therefore not paying tax; and there is not enough tax coming from goods that are sold because people cannot afford them. Senator McMullan said that we do not quote motor vehicles any more. We do not do so because none are being sold. That is why this deficit is likely to come about. We will wait and see whether Senator Maguire addresses that. I think I can predict his speech pretty accurately. As I say, I have heard it 20 times before. How typical also to have only reluctantly extended the deadline for the display of the new Australian company number on all documents, with the threat of fines and invalidation of the documents. It is more Big Brother coming in and putting the screws on. </PARA>
<PARA> The recession that the Treasurer said Australia `had to have' has worsened but not created the suffering that results when the small business sector is in trouble. We are in a depression; we are not in a recession. It has come as the last straw to many well-managed enterprises that could not be expected to cope with a succession of neglectful and harmful actions by a Labor Government whose deeds speak louder than its rhetoric. The Prime Minister should sack the Treasurer. If he has not got the courage to do that, the Treasurer should resign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis has submitted a matter of public importance on the economy which talks about the pain and suffering inflicted on families as a result of economic policies impacting on small business. Senator Lewis, a backbencher, was chosen by the Liberal Party to bring this matter forward this afternoon. He is not a frontbencher. It was not brought forward by Senator Short, for example, or Senator Parer, who are frontbenchers. Senator Lewis was chosen to lead the attack for the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lewis is not a good judge of the economy. He is not a good commentator on the economy. In fact, as recently as last month he made a major mistake in an economic speech in this place when, on 14 February, he claimed that the current rate of inflation was over 10.4 per cent. Senator Lewis followed me in a debate in this place in February and claimed that the annual rate of inflation was 10.4 per cent. That is what Senator Lewis, who submitted this matter of public importance today, claimed. In the very same speech, Senator Lewis went on to say that the rate of inflation was nearly 10.5 per cent. First of all he said it was over 10.4 per cent and then he said it was nearly 10.5 per cent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I had a close and careful look at Senator Lewis's speech, which is recorded at page 633 of Hansard. After examining it for some time I thought that the only way I could come up with an inflation rate of over 10 per cent, given that that is not the case-the inflation rate is not 10 per cent-was to multiply the current quarterly figure of 2.7 by four; in other words, multiply the four quarters in the year by 2.7. That was the only way one could get an inflation rate of over 10 per cent. But of course four times 2.7 is not 10.4, and it is certainly not 10.5. It is a wrong analysis anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that we cannot measure inflation on an annual basis simply by multiplying a quarterly figure by four. That is the level of Liberal Party analysis. One cannot do that because seasonal factors apply at different times of the year. Some quarters are heavily affected by seasonal products such as fruit and vegetables; therefore, one cannot assume that factors in one quarter apply right throughout the year. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis's central error in that analysis-he was the person selected by the Liberal Party to lead the assault on the Government today on this matter of public importance-was that he forgot that that particular consumer price index for the December quarter included the impact of the petrol prices as a result of the Kuwait crisis. As we know, petrol prices have already come down substantially. In fact, I think the price of petrol in my local garage in Adelaide is lower now than it was before Iraq invaded Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> That really makes the point about how fallacious this analysis is by Senator Lewis, who, after all, was chosen to front this assault on the Government benches. The price of petrol has already come down. It has not been high for 12 months of the year. That exposes the problems of multiplying quarterly consumer price indexes by four to get annual rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters also compounded that mistake on the Opposition benches by claiming that inflation was running at 10.8 per cent. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolute rubbish; it is not. The price of petrol has already tangibly fallen. This is voodoo economics in the 1990s coming from the Liberal Party. Senator Walters at least got it right: she knew that when 2.7 is multiplied by four the result is 10.8. She got the number right. As I said, Senator Lewis said that it was above 10.4 and nearly 10.5. Senator Walters at least got the figure of 10.8 right. On the basis of that analysis, perhaps Senator Walters should have been chosen to lead this matter of public importance; at least she got the arithmetic right, although the substance and the facts were wrong. The annual rate of inflation in this country is not at 10.8, 10.5, 10.4, 9.8 or 8.8; it is in fact at 6.9 per cent. That rate has applied from December 1989 to December 1990. It compares enormously well with the previous Government's record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the basis of those errors made by Senator Lewis and Senator Walters, it is pretty clear that the Liberals are just not capable of getting the sums right. That is the reality of what we have seen this afternoon. The simple analysis is that they cannot get the sums right; therefore, they cannot be competent economic managers. Of course, they are clearly not fit to run the economy.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a 6.9 per cent inflation rate and this is vitally important to small business. During Question Time today Senator Button correctly pointed out that under the conservatives in Britain, for example, the inflation rate is at 9.9 per cent. If we want to see how the Liberal Party policies would work in practice, were the Liberals to get into power, we need only look at the British Conservative Party policies because that is the model that they seek to emulate. The United Kingdom has an inflation rate of 9.9 per cent. Australia is also doing relatively well on the inflation front-and that is good news for small business-when we compare our rate with the rates of the 23 industrialised countries that make up the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The average inflation rate of those countries is 7.4 per cent-some half per cent above the Australian inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I admit, as framed in this matter of public importance, that there is pain and suffering in some sectors of the economy. We do not deny that there is a recession. Sections of small business are clearly hurting. But I think it is very important to note that the current economic situation reflects policies which were in place some time ago. After all, there are substantial lead times in economics. Moving an economic lever today does not create an automatic response tomorrow. What we are now seeing in the economy reflects the policy settings of 1990 and 1989. The tight fiscal policies in 1988, 1989 and 1990 were not ends in themselves; they were policies put in place for a very good reason-to try to reduce the impact of the balance of payments constraints on the Australian economy; to try to reduce the spill-over into imports that had been occurring apace in the Australian economy. That is why those policies were put into place-to slow down growth and the leakage from our economy into imports. It is a very well documented linkage in economics. </PARA>
<PARA> Policies have been adjusted enormously since the beginning of 1990. Interest rates have been significantly cut on five occasions. For example, in February 1990 official cash interest rates were 18 per cent; the inter-bank rates were 18 per cent. Late in 1990 those rates had been relaxed to 13 per cent. So there was a five percentage points reduction in those inter-bank interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Over that period the Government also took action to lower the level of the Australian dollar-the exchange rate of our currency compared with other currencies. Early in 1990 the Australian dollar was high. That made some of our exports relatively uncompetitive. The Government intervened to take measures to lower the value of the Australian dollar so that our exports would be more competitive and our imports less competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been a new round of tax cuts under the new version of the accord with the trade union movement. In fact, on 1 January Australian employees received two rounds of tax cuts, an initial round being supplemented by an extra round on 1 January. The aim there is to keep down wage demands on employers, including small business employers, to enable them to compete better while boosting the after-tax disposable incomes of Australian workers. Those tax cuts, which will help living standards, will cost $1.7 billion in the current financial year. The savings will ultimately be spent in the shops. They will help boost sales, production and investment. In that way the income tax cuts will help boost small business activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget that small business proprietors are taxpayers. These personal income tax reductions will benefit pro- prietors of small businesses who pay personal income tax. For example, a person with a taxable income of between $36,000 and $50,000 per annum will see his tax rate cut from 47c to 46c in the dollar. </PARA>

<PARA> In his matter of public importance, Senator Lewis talked about the pain and suffering inflicted on Australian families. I would like to know which families Senator Lewis is referring to. In May many Australian families will get a $12 wage rise from this Government as part of the wages and tax package worked out with the trade union movement. I would like to know here and now the Liberal Party's position on this $12 wage rise. I have asked this question in this chamber three times now and I still have not had a ringing endorsement from the Liberal Party saying that it will support this $12 wage rise. What are the Liberals doing about this flat wage rise, which will go to all taxpayers and which will, therefore, give relative benefits to the lower paid members of our work force? What is the Liberal Party's position on this $12 a week wage rise, which will clearly top up household disposable incomes?</PARA>
<PARA> What would happen under a Liberal government if ever there were to be one in Australia? Let us look at its policies. It is always talking about the need for a mini-Budget. Whether it is at the State level or the Federal level, Liberals always want mini-Budgets. Of course, in the Liberal Party, that mini-Budget idea is shorthand for expenditure cuts. To the Liberals, mini-Budgets equal expenditure cuts. But the Liberals cannot deliver the expenditure cuts. There is a big gap between rhetoric and reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at what happened in this place during the last session of Parliament. We proposed legislation to put an assets test on family allowances; the Liberals defeated that. We proposed to sell the Sydney-Moomba Pipeline Authority, which would have been a negative expenditure and would have had the same effect as an expenditure cut; the Liberals opposed that. The total of those two items amounted to $750m. That was the impact on this Budget as a result of the Opposition's policies. Yet the Opposition has the nerve to call for continued expenditure cuts. When it comes to the point of offering expenditure cuts, the Opposition walks away. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the rhetoric, all we can say about the Liberal Party's fiscal policy, seeing that we can rule out expenditure cuts, is that it refers to the consumption tax proposal. This is the tax the Liberals want on almost everything in the Australian economy. They want a broad based tax on items of expenditure in the Australian economy. This really gets down to the whole idea of the Rolls Royce-led recovery. The Liberals are really on about trying to get economic recovery in this country by making luxury cars cheaper. That is what they are on about. </PARA>
<PARA> At present luxury cars attract a 50 per cent sales tax. Under the Liberal proposal, these luxury vehicles would be taxed at the general rate, the same rate as would apply to food and clothing, that is, probably in the vicinity of 15 per cent to 18 per cent. My calculations show that the price of a vehicle retailing at $97,000 would fall by $20,000 under the Liberal Party policy. That figure of $20,000 happens to be the typical income per family in South Australia at this point in time. In fact, the Liberal Party policy is proposing to reduce the price of luxury vehicles by an amount equivalent to the typical annual income of a family in one Australian State. These are the people who propose to restore Australia's health by a Rolls Royce-led recovery. These are the limousine Liberals who are out of touch with ordinary Australian people. They propose unfair and socially unjust policies. They would tax equally Mercedes and margarine, yoghurt and yachts and shoes and Saabs. </PARA>

If they wanted to do something a little better, they could also get the governments of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania to resign along with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst Queensland has avoided this so far because of the lead-in of years of good management from non-Labor governments, the Queensland Labor Government should also resign before it has the chance to ruin that economy in the way that Labor governments have ruined the economies of all the States I have mentioned and the Commonwealth of Australia. I remind people that Mr Goss in his election campaign promised to do to Queensland what Mr Cain had done to Victoria. That is why we would like to get rid of Mr Goss. If Government senators had any influence at all, any concern about Australia, and any concern about the States, including Queensland, they would get the governments of the States I have mentioned to resign now before the real havoc occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> We are hurting and hurting badly. We have had eight years of mismanagement, of falling living standards and of reduced profitabilities, all hatched in a hotbed of hotchpotchness. We have had higher taxes and higher interest rates, and now we are getting onto high unemployment and a planned, organised, detailed, arranged recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh is the man whom the Government usually trots out for these debates. I understand there are two reasons why the Government has not trotted him out this time: one, he is not here; two, the Government would not want him saying what he wants to say about the economy. To quote Senator Walsh, the Hawke Government has massively stuffed up Australia, has massively stuffed up the economy. I am not surprised that Senator Walsh might say that. </PARA>
<PARA> All that is wrong with Australia is exemplified by a story I heard today from Mr Tim Fischer, the Leader of the National Party of Australia, when he talked about the debacle in the Heinz factory. Two workers there had received seven and nine notices, respectively, plus another couple in writing for their bad work practices. They were given another set of warnings and then sacked, which anyone in that situation would expect. The whole factory went out on strike and succeeded in ruining small businessmen who are the backbone of Australia. The workers did not care. It is just instructive. Mr Fischer went into the union office to try to talk to them. The posters on the wall of the offices were supporting the Iraqis and Mr Gaddafi. That is the sort of influence that runs this country. That is the sort of influence that operates that lot over there. </PARA>
<PARA> I know the Government is having a big debate now that the unions should not have control and Mr Howe is trying to make the situation more representative. But no, the heavies and the factions have got together and they will leave it as it is. It is those sort of people who are influencing this Government and that is why the Government is in the mess it is in. Families are hurting because small business is in rapid decline. </PARA>
<PARA> Freight costs in Queensland have continued to increase and they will get worse. This Government has spoken about sales tax on freight and has done nothing about it. The Inter-State Commission report into road transport charges has been completed. It has been estimated that, if the report is implemented, the cost of living in north Queensland will rise by $2,000 per family. </PARA>
<PARA> In the recent recess week, I came back from attending meetings with truckies and small businessmen in many towns in north Queensland. Their trucks are being repossessed with increasing regularity. They are petrified as to what this Government might do with the recommendations in the report of the Inter-State Commission. They note that this Government has continued to subsidise the inefficiencies in the rail system to the extent of about $3 billion because its mates in the union movement will not let it reform rail transport. Similarly, the Government's mates in the wharfies union will not let it reform the waterfront system that everybody knows should be reformed. This Government does not have the guts to do it because its mates will not let it. </PARA>
<PARA> What has this Government done about that trucking industry problem that I mentioned? I am sorry that I said that the Government did not listen because it has done something. It has called a conference on remote and rural transport needs. What a good idea. That was announced before Christmas. I remember that Senator Tambling and I wrote to Mr Snowdon saying, `What a marvellous idea. We give you every support. Congratulations. At last, a good initiative from the Labor Government'. Yesterday or the day before, we heard by press release that the Government is having the conference. It is inviting, to this open conference on transport needs for rural remote Australia, 90 people, 60 of whom will be government functionaries and public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> It would cost any small operator in the trucking business who wanted to go to the conference well in excess of $2,000 to get to Alice Springs from north Queensland. The trucking industry small business would not have that sort of money at this stage of the game because of the Government's policies. It would cost $2,000 and more just to get there. Once there, these small operators could make their views known at the Alice Springs Sheraton Hotel. The concessional rate especially for this conference organised by that lot over there is $160 a night. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator McMullan talked about the intellectual arguments on unemployment and the economy. I say to him that the people who are losing their jobs and the small businesses that are going bankrupt every day are not interested in intellectual arguments. They are not interested in the rhetoric and the clever academic phrases about the economy. They have seen their life savings go down the gurgler. They have seen the tragedy that it brings personally when they are going out of work. Many people who have never been out of work in their lives, who have always had employment-40-year-olds and 50-year-olds-are suddenly out of work. They are not impressed with the intellectual arguments and the smart figures that are thrown around. They know what is happening and they know that it is this Government that has brought this about. One does not have to be a professor of economics to work that out. One needs only to get out there and ask them. The Liberal and National parties have at least done that. We have got out and listened to people. It is obvious from the rubbish that, I say with respect, Senator Maguire gave us a minute ago that he has not been out amongst real small business where people are really hurting. </PARA>

<PARA> We on this side of the chamber would encourage people to work. I do not blame many of the people who are out of work and could get work but do not try and instead go on the pension, because they get more money doing that than they do when they are working. This is because we as a society-and this Government over the last eight years-have made it more profitable for people to be on the dole than to work. What we have to do is to give people the incentive to work so that they want to work and do not want to be on the unemployment list. We have to discourage those people who deliberately do not work because they are encouraged not to. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to reduce tax. We have to get tax from the avoiders. The Australian Labor Party supports the avoiders because it does not want a goods and services tax; that would get to the black market economy. Those opposite are now opposed to that. They recognised this argument some years ago, but now they have forgotten the black market that would be taxed with this. They are the friends of the tax avoiders. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me state very briefly some of the things that the Opposition would do. We would reform work practices, reform labour and encourage productivity. Since SPC Ltd has effected a half-hearted enterprise agreement, its productivity has increased 48 per cent. When questioned about it, it said that was only the tip of the iceberg. It was proved in Queensland with the voluntary employment agreements when productivity went up and up, and the Government has thrown it all away. It has an opportunity to do something about it. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) is not trusted any more, but the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is going to make a great economic statement in a few days time. I ask those opposite to tell him not to tamper with the words; tell him not to fiddle around the edges; tell him to do something positive, realistic and meaningful to fix the economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is probably the easiest way to do it-for the Government to resign. Real incomes for rural people-and farmers are small businessmen-will fall by 67 per cent this year. So it goes on. I have the statistics on bankruptcies and unemployment in Queensland, where I come from. They are running at enormous rates in north Queensland. In my area the newspaper said, even back in November, that this year is set to be the worst year for bankruptcies in north Queensland since records were first kept in 1930. That is a throwaway statistic. All the statistics are there. I do not have time to read them into the record, but everybody knows them. This has had an effect on families. The small businesses have failed, families have suffered and houses have been repossessed. People in rural areas which have no schools and who have sent their children away to school have had to drag them out of school. Anyone with any connection with those sorts of people will know the absolute trauma that that has on that family-on the parents for having to do it and on the children for being brought out of the schools. There have been record repossessions of motor vehicles. Families have been uprooted from their normal way of living and have moved to other towns in search of work. People's self-respect has gone, marriages have broken down, there have been health problems and life savings have beenruined-all because of the economic effect of this Government's policy on small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say again that if the Government has any sensitivity at all about this situation, if it wants to correct it, it should resign or take the opportunity in the next few days to say something positive and meaningful in the forthcoming economic statement. It should not fiddle with the edges. It should not give the smart, intellectual clevernesses that we have had from the other side in this debate.

A proposition was advanced by Senator Short which related to the economy, but similar conclusions could be drawn about the lack of meaningful contribution that has been evidenced by the Opposition. In the debate last week, as again was the case this afternoon, we saw absolutely nothing advanced which would in any way suggest a policy framework from the Liberal and National parties. Again we have heard nothing but simple rhetorical expressions. A handful of slogans have been bandied around and a few cheap shots have been taken, but nowhere in any of the contributions have we seen anything that approximates a policy alternative. Nothing that has been suggested from the opposite side of the chamber can in any way pass for a serious contribution to the making of public policy in Australia at the moment. There has been an analysis which is entirely lacking, and it leads me to conclude again that the Opposition parties simply lack credibility.</PARA></TALK.START>

One of the things that is evident in this country now, in terms of a debate on public policy, is the total absence of an institutional memory opposite; there is no collective response--</PARA></TALK.START>

I am delighted that Senator Macdonald has raised the issue of the consumption tax because, come the time of the next election, that is going to be one of the great issues that divide us and on which the Opposition will be judged. It will not be a judgment that will in any way be favourable to it. This afternoon, the Opposition has given us all the reasons supposedly why Bjelke-Petersen should still be the Premier of Queensland. We heard that from honourable senators opposite.

I thought that Bjelke-Petersen did as much damage to the honourable senator's Party and to the democratic processes as he endeavoured to do to us. I would be very interested to hear the honourable senator say at home, `Bring back Joh'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macdonald says that he opposes the capital gains tax, and presumably those opposite oppose it. Why should they oppose it? For what possible reason? Why should they oppose not only the introduction of a capital gains tax by this Government but also the regular implementation of it? Unlike the consumption tax, which has been embraced enthusiastically by Mr Reith and our opponents, the capital gains tax is both effective and fair. Unlike the consumption tax, which the Opposition embraces now as holy writ-it will be discarded at some stage but, currently, for the purpose of debate, the Opposition embraces it and speaks of it as holy writ-the capital gains tax can be defended on the grounds of equity; it is paid on profits. The tax is paid on the basis of income. Unlike the consumption tax, which the Opposition has embraced and which it trumpets, capital gains tax is not inflationary and, unlike the consumption tax, which the Opposition trumpets in this chamber, it is a conscionable way for tax revenue to be collected in the interests of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at another part of the conservative manifesto. We hear from those opposite a lot about pain. I am always interested to hear from the tories about pain-always. In terms of cuts in expenditure, who would find that painful? Let us stop and ask ourselves: who would find painful the $3 billion that Peter Reith is forever saying will be cut from the Federal Budget, especially now, as has been made absolutely and utterly clear to all concerned, that at least half of that $3 billion would come out of social security? As Senator Richardson made clear at Question Time today, there would be a lot of people below the poverty line who would find that extremely painful. I do not expect in any way to have an intelligent response from anyone opposite to the thought that people on social security might be spared pain as public policy; I do not expect that form of intelligent response in any respect from the Opposition. But the Australian people will know precisely how to make an appropriate judgment on that as policy: at least half of that $3 billion is to come from the social security budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at questions of fiscal policy and compare seven years of tory government under Fraser and seven years of Labor government. We inherited a $9 billion deficit-nine thousand million dollars Australian. That was the Opposition's record. The reason that we continue to talk about it is that the Opposition should never be allowed to forget it, and neither should the Australian people. That is the Opposition's record and monument as far as fiscal policy is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Do we call the current conservative manifesto Reaganite or Thatcherite? Those opposite enjoy both terms. Both, of course, are now discredited in their countries of origin, the United States and the United Kingdom. Or do we call the Opposition's manifesto voodoo economics or zombie economics, because either term is appropriate? We can take our choice on that. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of Senator McMullan's contribution, I was pleased that he quoted from Robert Reich's article `The real economy' in the Atlantic Monthly because there were some very important points made in that article, particularly in respect of public investment in infrastructure. Again, there is not a constructive or positive word from those opposite on matters of public infrastructure, aside from a recent endeavour to abuse people in the public sector. I quote from the Reich piece in terms of the transportation network in the United States:</PARA>
<PARA> In the early 1960s the United States began building a modern transportation system. Spending on infrastructure at all levels of government then absorbed almost four per cent of the nation's GNP; it held that position through the 1960s. That's when we-</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the Americans, of course-</PARA>
<PARA>began to build the interstate highway system, for example. The productivity of the American work force soared. But the growth of public spending on the nation's transportation system declined throughout the 1970s, just as our productivity growth declined. Infrastructure spending declined even more sharply in the 1980s-</PARA>
<PARA>we are dealing here with the Reagan period, of course-</PARA>
<PARA>to the point where the nation was spending only two per cent of GNP on building and maintaining infrastructure. Hence the spectre of collapsing bridges, crumbling highways, and rush-hour traffic jams extending for miles. </PARA>
<PARA> Although part of the decline in spending represents a failure to maintain existing infrastructure, spending on new infrastructure has fallen even more dramatically, from 2.3 per cent of GNP in 1963 to only one per cent in 1989. As Western Europe and Japan lay plans for `smart' roads, high-speed trains, and national information networks, America lies dormant; the nation has not even built a new airport since 1974. </PARA>
<PARA>That in very large measure is the Reaganite legacy. Those opposite would cut $3,000m more from the Federal Budget, with a consequent impact on public investment and on infrastructure. Senator McMullan drew the intelligent link between public expenditure and productivity; it needed only that by way of reinforcement. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the key elements missing from those opposite-we did not hear it on the debate on Senator Short's proposition a week or so ago; we have not heard it this afternoon-is what the coalition embraces by way of a wages policy, because none exists. There is no framework for a wages policy; that was the great failing when the Opposition was last in power. It is the great failing now. No-one on the Opposition benches has produced anything that remotely resembles something that is workable in the industrial relations framework, be it a theoretical framework, about which those opposite speak, or the realistic framework, through the Industrial Relations Commission, that exists in Australia at the moment. Those opposite cannot try to pass off their rhetorical flourishes for a wages policy. The employer organisations-the Confederation of Australia Industry and the Business Council of Australia-and the Australian Council of Trade Unions are realities. The industrial relations system in this country is a reality. Rhetoric will not get the Opposition home. John Howard talks about lengthening the working week; that is not a policy. No-one is going to endorse that-not at an electoral level and not in terms of public policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be delighted if the Opposition were to put us to the test on that by going to a poll promising to lengthen the working week; we would go to a poll committed to an orderly, predictable and stable industrial relations framework. I would be delighted if the coalition were to go to the next general election in favour of a longer working week. It would be the first time since the 1920s that the conservatives have endeavoured to lengthen the working week. The conservatives will not go to the polls on that. The silence of honourable senators opposite graphically illustrates that because they know that it will be abandoned; there is nothing more certain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development figures for wages progressions during the course of the coming year we can see that Australia is doing relatively better than the United States of America, the United Kingdom or most of the other industrial nations grouped under the OECD. Senator Cook made that clear at Question Time a week or so ago. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely and utterly comical when the Opposition suggests that there should be a degree of bipartisanship on economic policy and that, if only we were to implement its manifesto, it would be supportive. Let us look at an area where there should be a real degree of bipartisanship. I refer to the trade mission to the United States which is proposed-in my view properly-to comprise representation from the three major parties represented in the Federal Parliament, both at front bench and back bench levels. The Opposition cannot even get its act together on this; it cannot even propose a delegation without an internal row and some kind of public disagreement with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans has just entered the chamber. I do not think he would disagree when I say that one of the great issues confronting this Parliament at the moment is the trading circumstance, the need to revive the Uruguay Round and to deal, under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, not only with our trading circumstance but also with the tariff barriers erected in western Europe, with the American exporting enhancement program and with some of the other problems that confront us in this area. There are very few things which are more difficult, more vexed and which convey a greater sense of urgency to those engaged in public policy in this country. However, instead of a policy framework, we have stunts. I do nothing more than quote from Laurie Oakes's column last week in the Bulletin entitled `Birth of a stunt merchant'. It reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . with the introduction of television to the House of Representatives, Hewson. . .</PARA>
<PARA>as in Dr Hewson-</PARA>
<PARA>has shown himself to be a stunt merchant. In the process, he has demeaned the Parliament. He has demonstrated that those who feared television would lead to a decline in parliamentary behaviour, not an improvement, had reason to be concerned. And his performance has aroused a suspicion in the minds of some that this former professor of economics may not have quite the depth which most of us had assumed. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no depth in the Leader of the Opposition because there is no depth in the parties that make up the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am drawn into this debate as a former small business person. I can certainly sympathise with the wording of the matter of public importance put forward today by Senator Austin Lewis. Whenever we are called on to debate any economic policies, the response of the Australia Labor Party (ALP) is normally a trip down memory lane-how bad it was in the Menzies era, the McEwen era or the Fraser era. But where is the vision of the Labor Party? Where is it going to? Where is it taking us? Where is the future? The Labor Party refuses ever to debate that. In fact, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) has on many occasions had the right to put his Government's proposals before this Senate but he has never done so. He cannot defend the indefensible and sends Senator McMullan to do the job for him-a kamikaze pilot on a suicide mission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter of public importance refers to the on-going pain and suffering inflicted on families. I can tell honourable senators that in 1983 there was a bump in the economy-but what we are seeing now is a great crater in the economy. Honourable senators opposite do not have anyone on their side to explain to them what is happening. I do not think anyone on that side of the House really understands what is happening out there in rural Australia and in small business Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On Saturday night Senator Macdonald and I were at a trucking meeting which was attended by 400 people. One lady got up a put the rhetorical question, `How many people here have not had to go to their bank manager or their finance company to ask for assistance, help or adjustment?' I would say-and Senator Macdonald will bear me out-that of the 400 people in that room, there would not have been 40 who did not put their hands up. When these business people were asked whether they had needed to seek accommodation from their finance companies or bank managers, 360 of the 400 put their hands up. </PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable senators opposite realise the hurt and devastation that they are causing families? The Labor Party no longer deserves to be called the `workingman's party' because it has lost touch at the grass roots level. Honourable senators opposite do not even understand what it is all about. I challenge any one of them to come with me and to spend four or five hours just walking around the small business community. If they did so, they would see exactly how hard people are hurting up there. However, honourable senators opposite will not do so. They will not even go to the forums at which these issues are raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I have never seen such a shocking display of cowardice in my life as I saw last Saturday night when Senator Macdonald, Mr Hawker and I travelled great distances to attend the meeting in Townsville. Of the 400 people at the meeting, I do not think many would have been our supporters-maybe 50 per cent or 60 per cent, but not that many. They wanted to ask some questions of their Labor representatives. Where were they? They might have been at an ALP picnic for all I know because there was not one representative of the ALP at that meeting in Townsville. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and the State member for the area, Mr McElligott, were not there; no member of the Labor Party was there. There are eight Labor seats in that area and not one Labor representative turned up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, the Gulf crisis has been the subject of great debate in the Senate and of profound interest across Australia. I therefore think it appropriate that the Government should report to the Senate and to the nation on the outcome of the multinational effort to free Kuwait, on what that achievement means, and on what remains to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will know that allied military operations under resolution 678 have been outstandingly successful; they have achieved their objectives more quickly than expected, and with very few losses to allied forces. This is a cause for great relief. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's task force in the Gulf played a significant role in these operations, in cooperation with the forces of many other nations. We are proud of their contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussions are now under way to achieve a permanent cease-fire and a definitive end to the conflict under conditions laid down by the United Nations (UN) Security Council last weekend. </PARA>
<PARA> Proud and relieved as we are, this is not a time solely for rejoicing. Kuwait and its people have suffered grievously in the months since 2 August last year. And Iraq's people have suffered great devastation and loss. The Government has said throughout this crisis that we have no quarrel with the people of Iraq, but only with the brutal and dictatorial regime which has imposed on them, as on Kuwait, so much suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> With our allies we sought to avoid using armed force by all means possible. We only accepted the need to fight when it became clear that there was no other way to reverse the aggression of Saddam Hussein and to free Kuwait. But from the start of this crisis we have understood that the issues at stake were so grave that if all else failed, the world would be justified in using armed force to resolve it. </PARA>
<PARA> We were concerned for the people of Kuwait and for the future of the Middle East, and we were concerned for the economic consequences of a world oil market dominated by Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> But above all, we were concerned for the challenge that Saddam Hussein's invasion and attempted elimination of Kuwait posed to the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> It challenged each of us, as nations and as individuals, to balance our repugnance for war against our commitment to peace. It has forced us to study again the lessons of 50 years ago: that peace is bought at too high a price if that price is the appeasement of aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> In these aspects the Gulf crisis has drawn significance not just from the specific circumstances of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but also from the great historical event of our own time; the end of the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gulf crisis has been the crucial test of the world's hopes that, with the end of the Cold War, the United Nations would at last be allowed to fulfil the expectations of its founders. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, our hopes have been fulfilled by a great victory. We do not speak here of the military victory by the forces of the coalition-for military victory, however sweeping, must always be shadowed with the tragedy of those who have fallen on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> The great victory in the Gulf has been won by the international community, and by the United Nations itself. </PARA>
<PARA> At every step since 2 August 1990, the Security Council has focused the international response to Iraq's invasion. The Security Council condemned Iraq's invasion, it imposed economic sanctions, it authorised the use of force, and finally, last weekend, it stipulated the conditions for a cessation of hostilities. </PARA>
<PARA> These actions by the Security Council reflect the overwhelming consensus of the international community about the nature of Iraq's actions, and about the means to address them. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Security Council-nations large and small, developed and developing, drawn from every region of the globe-have truly represented the world's opinion that Saddam Hussein must not prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> Many nations joined in the military operations under the Security Council's authority. Pre-eminent among them has been the United States (US), which has used its power and influence with courage and generosity to serve interests which the United States shares with all the world. </PARA>
<PARA> But the coalition also included Arab nations such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria; European nations including France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Italy; and more distant nations like Canada, who understood, as we did, that the stakes in this crisis had no geographical boundaries. We owe thanks to all our allies in this endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, the Senate has expressed its support for the United Nations position on the Gulf crisis in a series of debates and resolutions. The Government has been grateful for the support of the Opposition on this vital issue. A decision to deploy forces to combat is the hardest decision a government can take, and we are grateful for the intelligent, principled and conscientious support we have received from this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last resort, this Parliament and this nation were prepared to meet the aggressor's challenge; we were willing to go to war, but only to preserve peace. With the overwhelming support of their country behind them, ships and personnel of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) were sent to the Gulf to help enforce sanctions and, later, to participate in operations under resolution 678 to expel Iraq from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> The heart of our contribution to the multinational military effort in the Gulf has been a naval task group of three ships: initially HMAS Adelaide, Darwin and Success; now HMAS Sydney, Brisbane and Westralia. The task force has also included a clearance diving team to help deal with the threat from mines. </PARA>
<PARA> They have all acquitted themselves honourably. They have earned the respect of their coalition partners in the multinational force for their skills and capabilities. Make no mistake, although our ships have not been direct participants in offensive action, they have played critical and hazardous roles. They played their part in turning back Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> They have been operating, and continue to operate, in a dangerous environment, and we are very fortunate, and very grateful, that they have taken no casualties. </PARA>
<PARA> Elsewhere in the Gulf we have had service personnel serving on exchange with allied forces, and up to 40 medical personnel serving on the US hospital ship Comfort. These people-including a number of reservists-have earned the respect of their colleagues and our gratitude for their service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to recognise the special service of those who have served in the Gulf since the commencement of allied military action on 17 January by authorising the award of the Australian Active Service Medal, bearing the clasp `Kuwait', to members of the ADF deployed in the Gulf on or after 17 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The award of the Active Service Medal provides due recognition of the service given by Australian Defence Force members during this conflict. It will be worn with pride by all who receive it-and rightly so. The Australians who have served in the Gulf have done honour to themselves, their service and their country. We now may honour them in return. </PARA>
<PARA> Our servicemen and women in the Gulf were supported in Australia by the work of many other members of the ADF, by contractors and by other government agencies. The Government's response to the crisis has been assisted in demanding circumstances by the Office of National Assessments, Defence Intelligence Organisation, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade-I interpolate to pay particular tribute to my own officers, led by Mr Rick Smith, for their supreme and sterling efforts throughout the duration of this crisis-Defence and Prime Minister and Cabinet, and by many other State and Federal agencies. They have our thanks. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also pay tribute here to the staff of Australia's embassies in the region, who have accepted serious risks in staying at their posts to help Australian citizens, protect Australian interests, and represent Australian views. </PARA>
<PARA> We look forward to bringing home our forces in the Gulf as soon as possible. This will be done in accordance with the decisions and requirements of the UN Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, although the war itself is we hope over, there clearly remains much to be done before peace can be restored to the Gulf region. First we need to establish the short and long term security of Kuwait and other nations in the Gulf region, and also undertake the reconstruction of Iraq and Kuwait-including addressing the humanitarian needs of the innocent victims of Saddam's aggression, even among his own people. We are pleased to see that humanitarian considerations are being taken into account in the administration of the United Nations' economic sanctions still in place against Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> How these tasks will be achieved depends largely on how things unfold in the Gulf in the coming weeks and months. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond these issues lies the fundamental need to address the longstanding problems of the Middle East. Since the start of the Gulf crisis this Government has been concerned to see whether a solution to the invasion of Kuwait could not become a catalyst for solutions to the deep-seated tensions in the region; in particular the future of the Palestinians, the security of Israel, and the struggle to implement a settlement in Lebanon. </PARA>
<PARA> There is cause to hope that the spirit of cooperation which has seen the Arab members of the coalition and Israel acknowledge, even if only tacitly, their common interest in confronting Saddam Hussein, may pave the way for a broader understanding of the possibilities of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> But there should be no illusions about the difficulty of finding solutions to these problems. The leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, by its support for Saddam Hussein, has gravely damaged its credibility internationally. But the voice of the Palestinians must still be heard. </PARA>
<PARA> And Israel, which during this war displayed admirable restraint against unprovoked aggression, may in some ways be more receptive to the logic of a settlement, but in other respects less so. </PARA>
<PARA> We will do what we can to assist the resolution of these tragic problems, and to help reduce the chances of future conflicts by supporting regional and global arms control measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has important trade interests in the Middle East, including in the Gulf. A central element of our policy will be to facilitate the resumption and development of that trade. The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett, will lead a trade delegation to the Gulf region next week, and we will appoint a senior officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the rank of Ambassador to coordinate the Government's Middle East trade strategy. We are also examining the establishment of a new diplomatic mission in the Gulf region. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn lastly to the new world order. The phrase has been much discussed in recent months. Most of what has been said has missed the fundamental point that the end of the Cold War has ushered in a new world order whether we like it or not. </PARA>
<PARA> The question we face is not whether we want a new world order or not; it is what kind of world we want. In every field of international relations-strategic, economic, ecological-the challenge of the 1990s is to define how the nations of the world will cooperate in the years ahead. The special importance of the Gulf crisis has been the chance it has given us to define the shape of this new order in the field of international security. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one believes that the world will be free of war and suffering but, because the world responded as it did to the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein, the new order will be one in which would-be aggressors will think twice before invading smaller neighbours; in which smaller nations feel more secure because they know that they will not stand alone if they are threatened; and in which all nations should know that the rule of law must prevail over the rule of force in international relations. That does not make the new world order any kind of utopia but it does make the world a much safer place than it would have been had Saddam Hussein's aggression been rewarded by his being allowed to keep Kuwait as the nineteenth province of Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> That is in itself a great achievement. This Government, this Parliament and this nation can be proud of the part we played in bringing it about and, perhaps even more, this conflict, brought as it has been so immediately and dramatically into our homes by television, may demonstrate the ultimate horror of war, its necessity as a last resort against perverse and evil leaders not masking the human degradation that war involves. </PARA>
<PARA> If nations, if men and women who can influence the decisions of their leaders, have learned this lesson, then we will not just have made the world a safer but indeed a better place, a place where the resources of mankind may, with security, be directed less to the means of their destruction, but rather to the uplifting of those in need around the globe. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We in the Opposition welcome the Prime Minister's statement and, even more so, we welcome the end of the war. I take this opportunity to commend the courage and skill of Australian service men and women who served during this conflict. They performed at a standard commensurate with the high reputation of the Australian defence forces. In thanking them we also acknowledge the support and commitment of their families who had to bear the anxious days, weeks and months that their loved ones were at risk in the service of their country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also want to take this opportunity to commend the leadership of the alliance, particularly President Bush who remained firm and consistent throughout. He managed to find that which is rare-the correct balance between force and restraint, which kept maximum pressure on the opposing force while always providing an opportunity for Saddam Hussein to meet the United Nations (UN) resolutions and to withdraw without his people having to suffer any further. We also commend Prime Minister John Major of the United Kingdom who acquitted himself ably, and clearly the leadership of Britain remains in good hands. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the political leadership of the alliance, and indeed its military leadership, performed so ably in this conflict we all recognise as a positive sign for the future. This is some comfort as the world moves into a period which may well be marked by considerable instability. It was not long ago that we were talking about peace dividends being paid. It has now been clearly demonstrated that that was a little optimistic. </PARA>
<PARA> The much-vaunted new world order which was to follow the disorder of the Cold War was clearly also a trifle premature. However, it is interesting to note that some, even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his statement today, are trying to explain it in terms of not necessarily a new stability, but of there having to be a new world order after an old world order. With great respect to the Prime Minister, that seems to be a case of some recent thinking. It was not long ago that certainly the international community was talking of a new world order that provided greater stability and security than in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some positive aspects that have come out of this conflict which, like all wars, was horrible and wasteful, no matter how just it might have been. I have mentioned the leadership of the West. It seems that we are now in a period of able leadership. The fact that some 30 nations were joined together under arms to enforce the United Nations resolution is a unique experience of collective security and it can give us some hope for the future. The fact that the United Nations could with such unanimity resolve to oppose the aggression is in itself a reason for cautious hope. I have always thought of the United Nations simply as a reflection of the resolve of the international community. It demonstrates some chance that the international community may be prepared to use the body in a way closer to that which was originally envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The support of the Soviet Union was vital to the alliance. Clearly the Soviet Union and its leadership did not find it an easy issue to stand up against a long term ally worried about the Islamic instability on its border but, nevertheless, with some wavering, it stuck. That must represent a hope for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The reward was achieved for defence preparedness, technological edge and superior training. It all paid off and that should be a lesson to us now. Investment in adequate defence security is still a good investment. Investment in alliances still appears to be as important as ever. There is also some new modest, cautious hope in that forces of the West and the Arab nations were prepared to work together to repel an aggressor. That could all easily change very quickly but for now it is a positive sign and a moment that should not be lost. </PARA>
<PARA> It leads us to address the challenges that lie ahead-how best to heal wounds, how best to seize new opportunities, and how best to work for greater stability and security than existed before the conflict. I will not try to say that Secretary of State Baker has a harder job than General Schwarzkopf but securing the peace might turn out to be a more difficult challenge than winning the war. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that as yet not a lot of ideas have come out of Australia on this issue. I remember in the earlier Gulf debate that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) said that constructive thought for the future would come in due course, but not a lot of thought has come yet. Certainly I invite the Australian Government to seek to make a positive contribution in creative thought, because nobody has a mortgage on all knowledge in this area and there is a role that Australia can play. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq's offensive capacity, it seems to me, has been largely destroyed. It will be some time before it can again threaten its neighbours. There is, however, an apparent political vacuum, which I feared and mentioned in the previous Gulf debate. It was probably unavoidable with Saddam Hussein having been so devastated. Internal revolution is likely and appears in some ways to have already commenced. A Shi'ite fundamentalist regime should not be regarded as unlikely. I note the latest press reports that the Kurds are also looking to seize their opportunity in the north. That should not surprise anyone when we reflect on the awful experiences that they have suffered in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, this vacuum raises new issues and indicates that the war in itself will not necessarily lead to a situation of greater stability and security. While Saddam Hussein was lobbing scuds on Israel he was a hero to many Arabs and, in fact, many Muslims in places as far away as Pakistan, Bangladesh and even Malaysia. I was in Pakistan at the outbreak of the war and I experienced some of that sentiment myself. But he failed so badly in the end that I suspect his memory will quickly fade. The underlying resentment, oppression, inequality and exploitation felt by so many Arab people and so many Muslims, however, will not so quickly fade and must be addressed. It is so important, therefore, that the victors-in particular, the United States-do not now act as an imperialist power. They must be sensitive to these deep feelings of distrust if a new order based on political solutions rather than just military victories is to evolve. </PARA>
<PARA> Two objectives are clear. First, there must be improved Gulf security guaranteeing that the weaker oil rich States will not be threatened by their more powerful neighbours. Secondly, there must be improved security throughout the wider Middle East region, which necessarily raises the question of the relationship between Israel and its neighbours which, in turn, is linked to the Palestinian issue. These two objectives are not totally unrelated. The accommodations and agreements reached in relation to Gulf security issues will unavoidably reflect understanding about the way in which wider security issues will be handled. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the first objective: the establishment of a credible Gulf security arrangement. Despite calls for Arab solutions and Arab security, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf emirates are likely to want to negotiate security guarantees with the United States. The United States is likely to accommodate those wishes, recognising that in such bilateral agreements they would best protect their own interests in maintaining oil supplies without having again to mount an enormously costly and difficult intervention as has been necessary to recover Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not likely to be any function appropriate for Australia in such a security guarantee, although the United States might seek to share the responsibility with a few major European powers. The United States guarantee would more likely be enforced by an ongoing maritime presence, increased intelligence facilities and perhaps improved airfields and security arrangements for rapid deployment. Any significant long term on the ground military presence would be counterproductive to building confidence in the wider Arab world, and statements from the United States to date appear to indicate that that fact is recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the immediate security of Kuwait during the process of rebuilding, it seems to me that this would be an appropriate function for a United Nations peacekeeping force under UN command. The UN could meet this function and would be less likely to raise the sensitivities of states such as Iran than the alliance force would do. There might be a useful role for Australia in this objective, bearing in mind our historical contribution to UN forces in the Middle East. I refer not only to UN forces but also to others. I remember the multilateral force serving in the Sinai which helped maintain the one peace treaty in the Middle East that stands today. I regret that it seems that Mr Hawke did not cover this potential for Australia contributing in this way in his address to the Parliament. I hope that that does not mean that the Labor Government has prematurely ruled out an Australian contribution in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> The alliance force is likely to remain, I presume for some little time, in and around Iraq-at least until peace has been guaranteed. Subject to what might happen within Iraq, it seems to me that it would be better if it was then withdrawn and disbanded, having served its purpose. Economic sanctions should be lifted as soon as the Security Council resolutions are satisfied and thus the objective of the alliance in relation to enforcement of sanctions would have been achieved. I see no reason for such sanctions to be maintained for an unnecessarily long period. I cannot see, for example, realistically how they would help with reparations. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia should take an interest in the process of the reconstruction of Kuwait and, I would argue, even Iraq. There is no doubt that our friends and allies will seize this opportunity to advance their interests, and Australia's markets of the past will not be guaranteed by our contribution to the alliance or our previous good trading relationship with Iraq. I note that the Prime Minister's statement refers to a trade mission to be led by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett, and I wish him well, but I have to say that the Government's record in relation to Middle East trade, particularly when I reflect upon what I can only describe as its incompetent handling of the live sheep issue, has not been good. I note also that we are now going to set up some missions in the Gulf states. I remind the Senate that it was only a few years ago that Australia was withdrawing its trade representatives from the Gulf states to Riyadh. It now seems that a lesson has been learned and that they will be returned to the Gulf. I notice also from the Prime Minister's statement that we are going to have someone of ambassadorial rank to coordinate our trade projects. Whilst I would not want to refer to that as gimmicky, because any effort is worth while, I think that something of greater substance will be necessary to protect and develop Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The second objective that I mentioned was a wider Middle East security, which is, of course, a more difficult objective. In some ways, Egypt has emerged with enhanced credit but it is economically impoverished, dependent on United States aid and will not easily be given the mantle of leader even of the more moderate States in a deeply divided Arab world. </PARA>
<PARA> Syria is stronger as a result of the war. President Assad may want to exert influence on the rebuilding of Iraq but he may trade that for further concessions in Lebanon. Whilst one is pleased about any peace in Lebanon, it seems that peace has come at the cost of effective control by Syria. One remembers, of course, the historic claim of Syria to Lebanon as part of Greater Syria. Syria wants Israel out of the Israeli security zone in southern Lebanon, and perhaps it is prepared to forfeit its claim to the Golan Heights to achieve that objective. The objective for Israel would be Syrian guarantees of an end to the Palestinian incursions. It is not inappropriate to say that it is fascinating to note the growing accommodation between Israel and Syria-traditional enemies-and it will be interesting to see how that develops. If it can develop to at least a more peaceful relationship than has existed in the past, then that is a positive achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> Jordan looks decidedly shaky in this evolving power play. Already some Israelis are again referring to Jordan as Palestine. The Jordanians are also mindful of the historical claim made by Syria on Jordan not dissimilar to the claim that was made by Iraq in relation to Kuwait; that is, as a post-colonial successor to a unit of the dismembered Ottoman Empire. </PARA>
<PARA> Israel holds renewed influence in the United States and enhanced influence in Europe. It will not, however, sacrifice security for peace. The restraint shown by Israel has introduced for the first time a sign that Israel can accept that its security interests may sometimes be best served by showing trust in other parties. It is a sign of hope when one tries to envisage a plan which will provide for an internationally guaranteed peace in the region. However, it does not, I regret, hold out much hope for the Palestinians, at least in the short to medium term. The Palestinians have lost a major backer in Iraq. Their leadership is discredited in the eyes of the West, financial sources such as Saudi Arabia and the Gulf emirates and political supporters such as Egypt. The best a moderate Palestinian leadership will be able to negotiate with Prime Minister Shamir for the foreseeable future, it seems to me, is some increased autonomy in the occupied territories, and even they would be now very difficult negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> It will not satisfy the Palestinians. It is not a homeland. As this conflict has shown, long term gains in the Middle East in the current world situation will only come out of peace; they will not come out of force. One thinks of Egypt getting back the Sinai as just one example. Therefore, if in such circumstances there can grow some increased confidence between a moderate Palestinian leadership and Israel, there can be some hope for the Palestinian people in their aspirations in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> In such circumstances, it seems to me that it would be difficult to see what positive measures could come out of an international conference on Palestine at this time. Again, I note that the Prime Minister's statement was silent on that issue. I hope that that does not demonstrate that he is sitting on the fence. It is an important issue upon which Australia should have a view, and we have the right to expect that view to be expressed by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggested in the previous Gulf debate that perhaps the United Nations working group or a representative of the Security Council would be better to explore whether the Gulf experience has freed up any of the previous fixed positions. I think that might be a more constructive way to go-to look to an improvement of relations between Palestine and Israel-than an international conference, at least at this time. I am afraid I see it as a long, slow process. Orthodox thinking has been that there will be no further peace agreements with Israel without first a resolution of the Palestinian issue. </PARA>
<PARA> That might be so, but one can now see at least the chance of a less antagonistic relationship with some Arab states. As I indicated a moment ago, for those of us who see confidence building as important, particularly in this region, that would at least be positive. In part, it will depend on the Arab organisations, and organisations such as the Arab League are extremely divided at the moment and even reuniting such organisations will be a slow and painful process. </PARA>
<PARA> A peace would make supplementary objectives, such as a determination to avoid an arms build-up in the region, more achievable. The lessons of the West's supply of arms to Iraq should be learned. Suggestions of qualitative restraint are being floated, though the ultimate outcome will depend on the major suppliers. It is unlikely that the United States would be restrained in either quality or quantity in relation to the supply of such states as Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Some form of international register on the supply of conventional weapons might be useful, in that transparency could facilitate political and diplomatic pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> The goal of a convention or other agreement within the region to limit weapons of mass destruction, although worth while, will also be difficult. It is hard to imagine Israel giving up its nuclear capacity, while Syria will justify its chemical weapons as what it sees as a necessary balance. Therefore, I say that securing the peace is going to be an enormous challenge. There are great uncertainties: Iran comes out of the war more powerful, but we do not know how it will use that power; Turkey's position is enhanced, but we do not know what that will mean for its large Kurdish community; the likely process of democratisation in Kuwait will have a flow down effect in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Emirates, and we do not know what that means; whilst we would always commend the democratic progress in the short term, it might lead to greater instability; a new leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organisation will evolve, but it might be more extreme. It is certain that the region will provide continuing challenges for the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia can now do in peace what it did in war: that is, in a modest but constructive way, be a useful contributor in the support of the UN peace keeping, as I have indicated; in diplomacy, as continuing efforts are made to find common ground; and in building bridges through trade and infrastructure development, education and other aid programs which are a contribution towards alleviating poverty in the region. Therefore, Australia can play a role. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same way as Australia had vital interests which have justified acceptance of a military role to enforce UN resolutions, so the same vital interests remain after the war. It is worth, I would suggest, investing a little more towards a more stable and secure regional environment and thus an ongoing peace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats share the relief of all Australians that a temporary cease-fire has been declared in the Middle East war and that a resumption of fighting between Iraq and the allied forces is most unlikely. We are particularly relieved that Australian service personnel are now very likely to return from the combat zone unharmed. We join the Government and the Opposition in commending them and our diplomatic staff in the region for carrying out their responsibilities in a competent and courageous manner. We hope to see our service men and women return to Australia soon, to rejoin their families and friends after their anxious weeks in the war zone. We, along with most Australians, will welcome them home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We welcome too the Government's award, outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his statement, of the active service medal. It is due recognition for these service people. I certainly commit the Democrats to working in the best interests of these new veterans, members of our Australian veterans community, in the same way as we have done in the past for veterans of all theatres of war. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to rebut in the strongest possible terms a suggestion which has been made elsewhere, but was particularly made in a letter in yesterday's Australian, that I and all members of the peace movement would be sponsoring acts of recrimination against those who have served in the Persian Gulf. The Democrats have consistently directed our opposition to the war at those who made the decisions and not at those who carried out the consequent orders. I know that the overwhelming majority of other members of the peace movement share this view. </PARA>
<PARA> Referring to the Prime Minister's statement, which we are debating, I want to allude to two paragraphs on page 3 which, to my mind, imply that-with regard to entering into armed conflict in the Middle East-the Parliament had some kind of role in those decisions, with which the Democrats did not agree. I think it is important in this debate to make it clear that this Parliament has not been the decision-maker, that the debates that we have had thus far have been after the fact rather than before the fact and that it should not be understood that Parliament has been a decision-maker. Those decisions have been made by the Government, largely in the person of the Prime Minister, and a small number of people-and, in the first instance, not even by the full Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats also wholeheartedly welcome Iraq's departure from Kuwait. Iraq's annexation of its neighbour was illegitimate and brutal, beginning as it did with an invasion, and had to be reversed. Again in his speech, the Prime Minister alludes to the question of appeasement and asserts that to do other than this Government chose to do, along with other coalition partners-to go to all out war-was to engage in appeasement. There is no sense in which at least the Australian Democrats and the vast majority of people with whom we have worked these past several months have been engaged in an exercise of appeasement. We strongly supported, as this chamber has been told, from the beginning the strong action that the United Nations (UN) first endorsed and supported. I have to ask in the context of appeasement where this Government, the other coalition governments and other governments around the world stood on the question of appeasement during the eight years in which Iraq perpetrated a war against Iran more or less on our behalf against Muslim fundamentalism. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible for us, in the context of the Prime Minister's statement, to endorse the Government's claim that a great victory has been won. The extent of the death, impoverishment and destruction caused by the war is now only beginning to be understood, and the extent of it all is rising. There are reports of outbreaks of cholera, for instance, in Iraq and there are reports coming in daily of carnage and of cruelty throughout the whole theatre of war in Kuwait as well. It is far too soon to claim that any kind of real victory will arise from the carnage. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that the video game reports of allied military prowess are no longer dominating the television news bulletins, the Democrats are concerned that the attention of the media and the public will turn away from the Middle East and that we will fail to learn the lessons arising from the aftermath of the war. As the full costs are counted, we must ask ourselves whether the price was worth paying or whether it could have been reduced without any sacrifice of principle. The final point made by the Prime Minister in his statement is this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if men and women who can influence the decisions of their leaders, have learned this lesson-</PARA>
<PARA>the lesson he refers to is that, in his words in the previous paragraph, war may, by necessity, be a last resort against perverse and evil leaders-</PARA>
<PARA>then we will not just have made the world a safer but indeed a better place . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is important to note that the people of Iraq were not people who could influence the decisions of their leaders, in the way that the Prime Minister points out in his statement. Indeed, at the beginning of his statement the Prime Minister referred, with some apparent compassion, to the suffering of the Iraqi people. The first page of his statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA>And Iraq's people have suffered great devastation and loss. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly they have-devastation, loss and suffering which they were already undergoing at the hands of their evil dictator. That was exacerbated massively by the decision to go to war and, as I say, the full cost of that is still not known. </PARA>
<PARA> When we are counting the cost-and we are talking about military casualties-it is important to remember that these were not people who could influence the decisions of their leaders. Indeed, those military casualties, in the vast majority, were conscripts. When they had the opportunity to defect they certainly did so. These people were not there from choice. That was part of the military victory, if you like-the very fact that this was not an army that was there doing something out of free choice. That is leaving aside the question of those civilians whose lives and homes have been devastated. </PARA>
<PARA> This must not be the last parliamentary debate on the Gulf crisis. A large part of the justification for the war was its alleged relevance to President Bush's grand vision of a new world order of peace, security and freedom. Whether the war has contributed to the peace, security and freedom of the Middle East will be much clearer in six or 12 months time. That would be the time for a further debate. The Democrats have a vision of a new world order which would meet the key challenges of the coming decade and the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA> The first pillar of such a new order is respect for human rights and support for democracy and self-determination of peoples as enshrined in the United Nations charter. In, say, 12 months time, the Democrats would hope to see this principle rigorously applied throughout the Middle East. We would hope, for instance, to see fully-fledged democracy in Kuwait, with voting under universal suffrage as per the charter of the United Nations. We expect the West to be responding to the human rights abuses of Syria's President Assad, so recently our ally, with the same outrage as it expressed over Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait-an outrage which we share. </PARA>
<PARA> We look forward to real progress towards a Palestinian state and assured security for Israel. We assume that the United Nations will have recognised the claims of the Kurdish people for their own state. We would hope that the civil unrest now growing in Iraq, fuelled in the south somewhat ironically by Shi'ite fundamentalism, will not lead to a destructive civil war, but that the end result, by some means, will be a more enlightened and humane government in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the new world order should strive for economic equity. In 12 months time-should we have this debate again-we would hope for progress towards a fair distribution of the Middle East's oil revenue. We also expect that the impoverishment of ordinary Iraqis, caused by their nation's massive debt and the destruction of its oil facilities as a consequence of the war, will be alleviated in a way that avoids the perils associated with the squeeze placed on Germany, for example, after World War I. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the new world order should be based on environmental protection and economic sustainability. In 12 months time, the Democrats hope that, after this latest reminder of the fragility of Middle East oil supplies, the industrialised nations will have made real progress towards an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and our own economic dependence on oil. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the new world order should be based on the just resolution of conflict, with emphasis on non-violent means. In 12 months, we hope to see an end to Syrian and Israeli intervention in Lebanon. We look forward to a comprehensive embargo on arms sales to the Middle East and progress towards arms reductions agreements in the global context. We expect that Syria's ambitions to become a leading regional power, based on Chinese and North Korean weapons, which it is now reportedly paying for with Saudi war donations, will have been thwarted by concerted international action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats hope that a new world order will produce all these benefits. But we are under no illusions that progress will be made on any of these issues, much less all of them. Indeed, the Government's statement has taken several large steps away from the grand new world order foreshadowed by the Prime Minister in earlier speeches on the crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Middle East war was not fought to usher in a new world order. It was fought to prop up an outdated and corrupt regime, an old world order based on inequalities in wealth and access to resources, selective and cynical support for human rights and democracy, and disregard for the environment. In 12 months time this will be much clearer than it is in the euphoria of a military victory. The Democrats look forward to further debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's statement claims that the outcome of the war is a victory for the United Nations. Again, the Democrats cannot agree. It would be far more accurate to describe it as a victory-if it is a victory-for the United States over the United Nations. In the early stages of the crisis, the UN did take charge by imposing the most comprehensive sanctions in world history. Thereafter, however, it was reduced to rubber-stamping the Bush Administration's military plans and actions, progressing from a naval blockade to an all-out war. The UN has been marginalised and its authority and standing have been damaged. Its role in the Gulf crisis is certain to be put under the international microscope. We hope that, 12 months from now, this will have stimulated an overdue debate on reforming the United Nations system. In no way at all should a global policeman be allowed to also sit as judge and jury. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to expand a little on the question of arms sales, which I was amazed to find did not rate a mention in the Government's statement. The most obvious lesson of the Middle East war is that the international arms trade is an explosive boomerang. It was fine, as I said, when Saddam Hussein was fighting a war against Muslim fundamentalism-a sort of arm's length policeman for people of the West and indeed of the Eastern bloc at the time. However, boomerangs do have a way of coming back. Having bought arms from many industrialised countries, including major Western powers, Iraq then turned those weapons against the interests of its suppliers, particularly the oil interests. </PARA>
<PARA> If the new world order is to achieve anything, major progress towards restricting the arms trade is essential. Australia, which has a strong international record as an advocate of disarmament, could and should play a leading role. Indeed, Senator Robert Ray, who I am pleased is in the chamber, was quoted in the Australian of 2 February as saying that this Government would push for a world review of arms transfers. I hope this idea has not been dropped. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats support a United Nations review of military transfers and conventional arms purchases. Indeed, a UN imposed moratorium on arms sales would be most appropriate at this time while such a review was under way. Australia should review its export guidelines. As foreshadowed, the Democrats believe that we and the Opposition in this chamber should set the ball rolling with a Senate inquiry. I am encouraged by Senator Durack's statements, whom I am also pleased to see in the chamber, to the media on 1 February this year. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy on the export of defence equipment is in total disarray and needs urgent revision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Shadow Minister for Defence, Senator Peter Durack, said today that the Government had ignored Opposition calls to revise defence export guidelines in spite of the problems created by recent export approvals. </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats agree with Senator Durack-this is a vital matter. We will bring before the Senate a proposal for an inquiry to deal with those issues. In that context we certainly look forward to productive discussions towards something positive here, in Australia, at least. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this is not really the time for us to assess the result of the war perpetrated in the Middle East. The Democrats regret that time was not given for the sanctions and diplomacy regime initially established by the United Nations to have some impact; five months was never enough time. </PARA>
<PARA> We regret the loss of life and the destruction to the nations involved and to the environment in the Middle East, and, indeed, as a consequence, to the global environment. We welcome home our Australian service people. We look forward to further debate on the questions of the Middle East and the Gulf crisis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is time for me to put some acknowledgments on the record. There is not a lot I can add to the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Senator Gareth Evans about the overall situation. I acknowledge the Government's and the country's gratitude to all Australian servicemen. I thank, first, those sailors who served on HMAS Adelaide and HMAS Darwin for their efforts in enforcing the sanctions. They had to leave at very short notice. They went to an environment that was very uncertain. At the time no-one knew the potential dangers. The fact that many dangers did not eventuate should not take away from the psychological pressure they were all put under. The ships Adelaide and Darwin did an enormous job in enforcing sanctions in the Gulf of Oman. They proved that they could work with other allied ships. They proved that they could have a high work rate and do their job very efficiently. To all their crew we must be grateful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The contribution of HMAS Success, which served in the Gulf for many months, was enormous. It serviced many ships in the Gulf. At the end there was a saying around the Gulf that, if the Success could not procure the equipment, it was unprocurable. Mr Acting Deputy President, your State gave the sailors on that ship an excellent welcome back last Saturday. They were all proud to come back to Adelaide and drop off the Army team. They had an Army team on board for their protection with the Rapier anti-defence system. We should acknowledge the role that they played. </PARA>
<PARA> I also thank those who served on HMAS Sydney and HMAS Brisbane. They were required to go into an even more threatening situation than that faced by those on the Adelaide and Darwin. They served in the Gulf with high commendation. The allies certainly appreciated their presence. They were given all sorts of roles in the Gulf. Again, it proves the benefit derived from the interoperability of equipment, well trained personnel and regular exercise with our allies. Those two crews certainly performed very well. HMAS Westralia joined and replaced the Success. It also paid a very active role in supplying the various warships in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> I also pay tribute to some other Australian servicemen. First, the logistics team, who went over very early and made sure that all our ships there were supplied correctly. It was only a small team of eight to 10, but they did an excellent job in making sure that the rest of our service personnel were well fed and well armed and that any maintenance equipment got there quickly and was quickly sent out to the ships. I would also like to thank, without naming, their host country for the enormous amount of assistance that the logistics team and visiting sailors received while there. </PARA>
<PARA> I also put on record our appreciation of the effort of the medical team-60 personnel in all. I am very grateful that they had essentially nothing to do. But they did have to wait and get ready and continue to stay ready for a potential job. We are all pleased that they did not have to do it. I understand that the hospital ships will be leaving the Gulf very shortly. I hope to see our medical team back here promptly. </PARA>
<PARA> I also put on record my thanks to the divers who had to leave in January. Very few of them were in fact deployed. I was one of the first to know that there would not be an amphibious assault because they were never deployed to the Gulf. However, most of them are now in the northern Gulf and most will be involved in mine clearance. For what period I have yet to make a decision. But I certainly believe that they can use their skills to make the Gulf safe for civilian shipping. I am sure that no-one in Australia would deny them that humanitarian role they can now play. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) for the transport job it did. At least once a week a Hercules would fly to the Gulf region with supplies, equipment and sometimes personnel. RAAF personnel also had to be on stand-by and face very rigorous conditions for Operation Ozone, the operation designated to get out Australian civilians from that region, if necessary. The RAAF performed very well. </PARA>
<PARA> I also compliment the diplomatic staff in the area, those that stayed under very onerous conditions and served their country very well. At times it is very easy to be glib about people working in Foreign Affairs and about their being in privileged la-di-da positions. But the reality is that they work extremely hard under very trying circumstances and serve their country particularly well. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate Commodores Chambers and Oxenbold, who headed our Gulf commitment at different periods. I also place on record my appreciation of the work done by Rear Admiral Doolan of Maritime Headquarters and, of course, his ultimate boss, Admiral Hudson. It is a very appropriate time for Admiral Hudson to be retiring, knowing that the navy that he has headed for the last six years performed so well. I also congratulate him on his promotion to full Admiral on the eve of his retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> I also put on record the hard work done in Australia by some of the Australian military people. It is hard to individualise, but I particularly congratulate Major-General John Baker from Defence Intelligence for his brilliant assessment of what was happening in the Gulf. Time and time again his predictions proved to be right. He impressed everyone with his knowledge. Sometimes his predictions were based not on any inside information, but just on what he regarded as military logic. So often it came true. I also thank Rear Admiral Taylor, who heads up Operations, for the excellent job he did. On the whole, Australian defence forces, from top to bottom, did a good job in this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> Some immediate lessons are to be learnt from the Gulf conflict. I do not intend to canvass all those here tonight. I have, through my officers, organised for a small parliamentary delegation to visit the Middle East for two to three weeks to have a look at the situation on hand. It is very hard to organise this in a hurry, so rather than going through the normal party room ballots, et cetera, which would have meant that we would never have got the delegation away, we suggested that the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade go to the Middle East. Senator MacGibbon and Mr Lindsay left yesterday. I hope that they will be able to go throughout the region to make their own assessment and report back to the Joint Committee, to the Parliament and to their party rooms on exactly what occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was putting on the record the Government's and the country's acknowledgment of the efforts made by the Australian Defence Force in regard to our Gulf commitment. I also noted the fact that a small parliamentary delegation was going to the region and that its members would report back to their party rooms and to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, some questions arise as to the future of our personnel in the Gulf. In regard to the Sydney, the Brisbane and the Westralia, a decision will be made following a formal cease-fire-and let us hope it will be in a few days' time-as to a timetable for their return. I indicated earlier that I think the medical teams will return fairly quickly but the divers may remain in the Gulf for some time clearing mines. Those Australian personnel who are on exchange with other units will either rotate back to those countries to fulfil the rest of their term or, if their term expires, will come back to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill raised the question of future security arrangements and was critical of the Government for not detailing them in the policy statement delivered today by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I think that is a very inept criticism. The situation is far too fluid at the moment to determine what the future will be. One does not know what the regime in Iraq will be. One has no idea of the role the United Nations will lay out and it would be far too premature to be making any bold statements on this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I must also put on the record the appreciation of this Government for the support by the Liberal and National parties. I think it is true of the major democracies involved in the Gulf conflict that in each case there was bipartisan support from the two major parties in each country. That did greatly enhance the commitment and the efficiency of the commitment. The service personnel very much appreciated the fact that this Parliament and at least 90 per cent of the Australian people were fully behind them in the Gulf. That was reinforced when the Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Tim Fischer, visited the ships over Christmas. It has been reinforced at the return of every ship. There has been a great turnout of Opposition and Government members to welcome those ships back. That is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> The scars of Vietnam remain. I am not revisiting the rights and wrongs of that. They have remained in the Australian Defence Force for 20 years, passed on from generation to generation. Of all the issues in the Gulf-be they conditions, medals, danger or anything else-the biggest concern and the first and most persistent question asked of me was, `When we return to Australia will we, in fact, be treated like lepers?'. Of course, the moment Darwin and Adelaide arrived, word sped back that that would not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight Senator Powell made a very unequivocal statement about the troops coming back and the Australian Democrats not taking a critical stand. On behalf of the Democrats she is right in doing that, and I welcome her statement. Her position is not true of all members of the peace movement but it is true of the majority of them. But even on Saturday we had to have the few clowns protesting at the wharf. I do not know whether they were demonstrating against the Government or the sailors. I quite expect them to demonstrate against the Government. Nevertheless, it still hurts the seamen who think that it may be against them. I would prefer to think that those people were demonstrating against the political decision makers rather than the Australian defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell could not resist raising the full Cabinet issue again. She asked why the full Cabinet could not have made the decision. It did so unanimously five days after the decision. This was another red herring. I thought that Senator Powell's speech was fairly defensive and I am a little disappointed that some of the lessons of the Gulf have gone over her head. However, past is past; let us look to the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be wrong if I did not make some comments on some of the other effects of the Gulf war. First of all, let me say something about Kuwait. In every war, propaganda always emerges about the horror of the other side. That is an inevitability and such propaganda is normally exaggerated. But it is very little exaggeration to say that Iraq's treatment of Kuwait, its destruction of Kuwait-the setting of fire to oil wells, the pumping of oil into the Persian Gulf, the mistreatment of Kuwaiti citizens-are very hard to comprehend. It is not simply just a propaganda exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Kuwaitis will have a very hard job when it comes to restoration and they will have to learn some lessons. I think the first lesson they have learnt is not to pump billions of dollars into a neighbour for the purpose of buying arms which in turn will be used against them. I hope they have learnt that lesson. They may also be a different society in the future with broader citizen participation within the government, probably with less dependence on and exploitation of guest workers. Kuwait really will go through difficult times. The days of the odd Kuwaiti citizen dropping a few million dollars at the tables in London should be far gone. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of Iraq, it is very hard to predict the future. My view is that reparations should be demanded of Iraq. But we should also give consideration to forgoing reparations if Iraq agrees to a constitution with a limited defence force-a defence force based on self-defence and not on aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and other speakers have noted that they have taken no pleasure-nor do I-in the quite heavy casualty rate that the Iraqis suffered. There are many wives, mothers and fathers, who will be bitterly disappointed and grieving in the next few months. We take no pleasure from that. On the other hand, I do not believe that the war and conflict could have been prosecuted in any other way. Our first responsibility was to our own troops and, in prosecuting the war in the way that it did, the coalition had that foremost in its mind. It is quite clear that many of the Iraqi troops were conscripts, many were there against their will, and many did not believe what they were fighting for. There was no doubt that if they had tried to get out, they would have been shot and their families punished. It is very sad for all those people that these things have been visited upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> It was also sad to reflect on the opportunities that were forgone by Iraq. It had many opportunities to bring this conflict to an end. How Iraq must regret that it did not respond to the 15 January deadline. And how much must Iraq also regret that it did not respond to the further American deadline before the start of the ground war. But it did not and it paid the price for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to say a lot more on this matter but I do want to respond on another issue. Throughout this whole conflict, this Government had its critics-I assume that they were just as critical of the Opposition, although governments always tend to be a primary target-of the decision to get involved. Their arguments were quite diverse-some better based than others. I thought that those who tried to draw analogies with Vietnam failed abysmally. They were simply trying to jump on the surfboard and ride on the wave of previous sentiment, and that failed fairly abysmally. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who tried again to introduce the red herring of conscription-on the whisper, on the talkback and in all of the areas that those people specialise in-did a fair bit of damage around the place. Again, that was very poorly based. There were others, pacifists, who took a very consistent position on this conflict as they have on many other conflicts. We can understand that. Many of the other critics were really recidivists from the old anti-American days. I believe that our reason for being involved in this Gulf conflict was one not only of self-interest but also of principle; it was a moral decision to be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose I spent a lot of time over two or three months wondering what my reaction would be to the first casualty. I must be the luckiest Defence Minister in the history of Australia never having that worry come to fruition. I dare say that there are other people in this chamber who were similarly worried. It is a great relief to know that there were no Australian casualties. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we were right to be involved in the conflict from the very start. I conclude by again thanking all those members of the Australian Defence Force, both here in Australia and those who served overseas, for a job well done. They have done this country very proud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the fourth occasion in a little over six months on which this Parliament has been called upon to discuss what is now usually called the Gulf war, although it was not when we first discussed it back in August. That is not entirely appropriate because of the enormous responsibility that we have to undertake in facing decisions of this kind. When I spoke in the first of those debates in August last year I said that I was very conscious of the fact that that was the most important speech that I have made in the years that I have been in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the events since August last year have unfolded, right through until the great news of last Thursday about the end of hostilities in the Gulf, the significance of the events which we embarked upon just over six months ago became more dramatic almost day by day. There was an extraordinary escalation of what was occurring throughout that period. Certainly it was not just confined to the last few days of the land war. Thankfully it lasted only a short period. It has been a major experience for the nation and for a new generation of Australians. There has been no more visible a sign of that experience than the 1,000 or more defence personnel who were engaged on our behalf as citizens of Australia in the sharp end of this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> At the very commencement of my remarks tonight, I would like to add to what was said by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) who has just spoken and by many others, including the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill), in extending the Opposition's gratitude to all those members of our defence forces who have taken part, particularly those who have been serving in the Gulf region, those who have supported them both in the Gulf region and back in Australia, and particularly the crews of the six Navy vessels who have played such a valuable role. It could have been a very dangerous role from the beginning and certainly became a dangerous role from the time the ships moved up into the Persian Gulf itself from the Gulf of Oman. As I have said before in this debate, as Australians we should be-and we are-very proud of the efforts of our servicemen and women who have performed their duties in the highest traditions of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it was very good of the Minister, with his intimate knowledge of those who served, to detail in his speech tonight the extent of that operation, the numbers of different personnel and the different aspects of the operation. I was pleased that he put it on the record. I associate my colleagues in the Opposition with the expressions of gratitude to all those people in the various capacities. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a very difficult task to get the first ships ready to leave at short notice. That in itself was perhaps one of the more impressive aspects of this whole operation. I think there was a week between the time that they were tasked and when they sailed from Sydney. Although it was a fairly frenzied task to achieve that result, it was achieved. To prepare the second fleet-the replacement ships HMAS Sydney and HMAS Brisbane-a great deal of additional work had to be performed at the Garden Island Dockyard, particularly in the case of the HMAS Brisbane, to get it in a safe condition to engage upon its deployment. The extent of the work that was done there and the timely way in which it was done to enable that ship to go with the vessels that went to replace HMAS Darwin and HMAS Adelaide was a most praiseworthy effort by all concerned. I want to particularly mention the civilian workers at the Garden Island Dockyard who really put their shoulders to the wheel and made it possible for HMAS Brisbane to actually be deployed when it was required. There was a very impressive joint effort by a large number of people. Of course, as I said, particular thanks must be primarily given to those who served in what became a theatre of war in the Persian Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> The other pleasing aspect of the operation over these months has been the overwhelming support of the Australian people for this exercise. That has been most important for those who served. They can be assured of, and indeed have already experienced, the obvious appreciation of the Australian people by the welcome home that was extended to the frigates in Sydney just before Christmas and HMAS Success at Port Adelaide the other day. When HMAS Brisbane, HMAS Sydney and HMAS Westralia return they will be received, as everyone wants to be associated with winners, with even more enthusiasm than those ships that have already returned. I do not think that there should be any worry in the minds of the Australian Defence Force or of the Australian community generally that there is going to be a lack of recognition for the efforts that our defence personnel have made. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it has also been important that there has been, on an official basis, bipartisan support in this Parliament also for the deployment of the force in the Gulf. I am pleased that the Minister has acknowledged that tonight. I am also pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) even acknowledged it in his speech in another place. I must say that I have been a little disappointed throughout this period that the Prime Minister did not seem able to bring himself to acknowledge the important role that the Opposition has played in this deployment and in this commitment of Australia; not just a commitment by the Australian Government or the Australian Parliament but a commitment very much by the Australian people, with few exceptions, and they have been the minority. It has been a very important feature of the whole Australian commitment to this operation that there was that commitment from both sides of the Australian political scene. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has pointed out today in another place, during the special sitting of Parliament in January every member of the Opposition in both the House and the Senate voted in favour of the resolution proposed by the Prime Minister. Where we have had some disagreements with the Government on very minor matters, I believe that we have sought to express those in a cooperative way which would assist the operation rather than in a negative sense, and certainly in no way have we tried to play politics. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a democratic society and people are entitled to express dissent. The only thing that disappointed me about those who dissented is the sense in which they sought to appropriate all moral value for their side, and in fact made claims that they represented the Australian view. That was a very significant, extraordinary feature of the speech by Senator Powell in this Parliament when we debated the Gulf crisis in January. Senator Powell seemed to believe that she was speaking on behalf of the majority of the Australian people, which was shown in the polls within a day or two-if we needed it-not to be the case. Certainly, for all of us on both sides who have supported this deployment, it has been very important to have the support of the Australian people. We did not need the polls to tell us that we had that support; we knew that from the feelings expressed so many times by people whom we have been meeting and from whom we have received that solid support. The decisions made by the Government, supported throughout by the Opposition, have now been fully justified. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I was surprised to hear Senator Powell saying tonight that we could not really say whether this exercise had been justified or not. It was not sufficient, apparently, that victory had been achieved with, in the case of Australian personnel, no casualties whatsoever and, in the case of our allies, extremely light casualties. That has been one of the outstanding features of this war as far as our side has been concerned. Regrettably, it has not been the experience for the Iraqi forces or, perhaps most sadly of all, the Kuwaiti people who have been so brutally treated by the Iraqi occupation forces. There has been a great loss of life there. There has been terrible damage in Kuwait, and a great deal of damage in Iraq, despite the fact that another notable feature of this conflict has been the ability of the allied forces air power to be on-target with their weapons and therefore to minimise greatly the damage that would have been caused in any wars of the past, as occurred particularly in the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> Comparisons that have been made between the sort of damage made by old-style bombing and now the limited damage from modern weaponry are very impressive indeed. Nevertheless, there clearly has been a great deal of damage inflicted on Iraq. Although the Australian Democrats seem to be emphasising that, it is not something we need emphasised; it is apparent. It is the conclusion that is to be drawn from this which is the important matter. The conclusion to be drawn is clearly that the world body, the United Nations, and those forces which, under the leadership of the United States, participated in giving effect to the decisions of the United Nations, have achieved the purpose in a very definite and clear way. I suppose that is why it can be clearly claimed to be a victory. </PARA>
<PARA> The critics who point to the devastation should bear in mind why that devastation occurred. It occurred simply because of the totally unjustified invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. There was the brutal occupation of Kuwait without any justification. It does not matter what form of government there was in Kuwait; the fact is that the United Nations is not there just to protect democracies from invasion by their neighbours but to protect nations which are members of the United Nations. That was the issue. In the end it was not simply a question of the interests of nations. It was not just a question of the economic interests; it was in the end a moral issue that this type of behaviour is not going to be tolerated. Certainly, it did become a question, I believe, of right and wrong. The action taken by the United Nations was certainly a most impressive exercise in its history. That was done entirely of its own free will. It was not being imposed upon it by any power. It is true that it could not have been achieved had it not been for the leadership given by the United States, and President Bush in particular, who has established himself as a world-class statesman and a most distinguished President of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should be proud that, as Australians, we were part of the wide response to the United Nations call for action to be taken, firstly with sanctions and, subsequently-unfortunately but by necessity-war, to achieve its purpose. But it was vitally important for the future security of certainly the smaller nations of the world-of which we are one-that those steps be taken by the United Nations, through the leadership of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and all those countries which participated in the necessity of this war. It was the only way that a result was going to be achieved, and we should be grateful that it has been achieved. My colleague the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hill, has indicated the problems for the future, and so have the Australian Democrats. They are great problems-problems that no doubt we will have to debate in this chamber on other occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in this debate let us reflect, as I have tried to do, on why it happened. We can regret very much the need for it; we can extend our sympathy to those who suffered from it; and we can express our horror at events such as the environmental damage that was caused, particularly by the actions of the offenders themselves with their firing of oil wells and their releasing of vast quantities of oil into the Gulf and so on. But let us not allow these concerns-or all the horror that we may feel-to deflect us from the fact that it had to be done and it has been done successfully and swiftly, and it has probably been done with much less damage by the military than has ever before been afflicted in previous conflicts of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> We can draw many implications for the future from this experience. I do not propose to dwell further on those which have already been mentioned by Senator Hill or by the Leader of the Opposition in another place. However, I would like to add that the Opposition believes implications can be drawn for our defence capability as a result of this experience. The Opposition is disappointed that the Government does not seem to share our concern about this matter. Although the Minister did not do it in his speech tonight, he has, as has the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on other occasions, claimed that the Government's White Paper of 1987 is quite adequate to meet exigencies of this kind and that we do not have to do more than keep it fine-tuned. That seems to be the view of the Government. However, the Opposition believes that a far more thoroughgoing review of our defence capability is required. </PARA>
<PARA> Problems emerged during this conflict. I do not want to dwell on them, but there were problems of a relatively minor nature in relation to getting the ships ready and having them sufficiently stocked. Such problems are obviously to be expected but there are perhaps lessons to be drawn from them. Certainly there is a lesson to be drawn about the adequacy of the size of our fleet. People may debate whether that is being addressed sufficiently with the new ships being built, but to say that we do not need to look at these matters seriously is, I think, foolish. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly there is a most important implication about the nature of weapons of modern warfare, their use, their production and the requirement for them. Perhaps no previous war has been dominated quite so much by technology and the nature of the weapons used, and we must ask ourselves whether we are sufficiently prepared for a modern war in light of the experience we have just been through. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many implications for our defence policy. I am pleased to say that the Opposition has embarked upon a thorough review of those which will continue for the rest of this year. I hope the Government realises that there are such major implications for defence policy and, instead of taking a negative attitude-as it has done so far-to the efforts of the Opposition in this regard, will also recognise that those defence capabilities must be under question in the light of recent events in the Gulf. I hope the Government will also agree with the Opposition's view that these matters should be addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks in this debate on the parliamentary statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on behalf of the Government about the Gulf crisis, which to all intents and purposes concluded with the success of the United Nations (UN) forces last weekend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously many ramifications of the success of the UN forces will be debated and there will be ongoing developments in the Middle East and in the Gulf area in the coming months, if not years. However, it must be noted that the decisions of the United Nations and the allies have been absolutely successful. The decisions taken by the United Nations in the period between the beginning of August last year, when Kuwait was invaded and occupied by Iraq, until the end of last week indicate that it has, in my view, come into its own. It has done so in a way that has vindicated what many of us-both in this place and elsewhere in the community-argued was the sort of United Nations we wanted. I make no bones about the fact that I have always supported Australia's involvement in the United Nations-sanctioned allied forces. I think our response was appropriate to our interest and to our role as a middle sized power in the world. Had Australia not participated in the allied forces, I think we would have been in dereliction of our duty as a middle sized power within the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that many people-perhaps not in this place but elsewhere in the community, although not a majority of Australians-opposed Australia's involvement because they claimed to be opposed to war. I suspect some of those elements based their opposition to our involvement on a fundamental anti-Americanism in their attitude towards international affairs. I think that has been most unfortunate and that they have allowed their judgment to be coloured by the fact that they saw this purely as an American inspired initiative, vis-a-vis what occurred in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> Had this been similar to the Vietnam conflict and had America been acting by itself without the sanction of the UN, I would not have supported Australia's involvement in the Gulf war. However, I believe one cannot have it both ways: one cannot argue for the United Nations to be effective in international affairs and yet when a crunch issue comes along bale out by saying, `It is all too terrible' or `Because the Americans may have too much influence and may have been able to convince the United Nations Security Council to vote a particular way, therefore we should all bale out on it'. I believe that is a negative approach fundamentally aimed at destroying the effectiveness of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> No other international organisation exists which can deal with these sorts of events as does the United Nations. We must make the United Nations effective. I, like many people in the community, have often complained that the United Nations has not been used as the appropriate forum to resolve disputes and to overcome war and deficiencies in the international political order. However, in my view, the Gulf war is the basis of a turning point in the international political order. In his statement the Prime Minister talked about a new international order. I think that is an appropriate statement and description; it is not overselling in any way the consequences of what has occurred in the past eight months in the Gulf war and the involvement of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> For something like 45 years since just after the end of World War II we were locked into what was called the Cold War, in which the two superpowers basically neutralised each other in the forum of the United Nations. The veto was used by both sides from time to time against the interests of the other. It was a sheer fluke that the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council of the United Nations when North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, thus enabling the Security Council to vote to take action against the North Korean aggression. Had the Soviet Union been present, it would have used its power of veto and that aggression would have gone unchecked. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the events of the last eight months have been most significant in that none of the five superpowers-some of them are not very super any more-with a veto in the United Nations Security Council used that veto to stop the UN carrying resolutions empowering member countries to take whatever necessary action was deemed appropriate to liberate Kuwait. I think in the long run that will mean that the superpowers can no longer, of their own volition, of their own choice, ignore the importance of the UN. I certainly will be one of the first people in this forum, or any other forum, to complain if, in the future, the United States, the Soviet Union or any of the five superpowers that have the veto in the UN Security Council choose to ignore the United Nations as the appropriate forum to overcome disputes, whether they be of a conflict nature such as the Gulf war or whether they be of more mundane or prosaic issues dealing with international law in the environmental area, international trade or developmental aid. The United States of America, the Soviet Union and the other superpowers have chosen to use the UN as the basis for the justification of their action. They got the support of the UN; they got the overwhelming support of the countries of the world irrespective of the ideological bent of many of those countries. Very few countries-maybe only two or three-used the forum in the UN to defend what Iraq did. Countries such as Cuba or the Yemen, which are presently on the United Nations Security Council, in criticising the allied military plans also made sure that they did not support the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> We had absolutely overwhelming support in the UN, in the family of nations, against what Saddam Hussein and his military regime carried out against Kuwait. I know that people use the argument that Kuwait is not a democratic country and has many features that we, in this country, would abhor. That is very true, but we cannot ignore the fact that one sovereign country chose to invade and wipe off the map another sovereign country-a sovereign country that was recognised by the Arab League and the United Nations as a sovereign country. I think that is a very simple and fundamental test that the United Nations looked at and chose to act upon. It is a simple, commonsense test that a sovereign existing nation was invaded and incorporated into the invading country. There was no pretence about supporting a revolutionary movement, it was just sheer naked greed on behalf of Saddam Hussein and his military regime in Iraq to get hold of Kuwait and the oil that went with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is correct for the Prime Minister to talk about a new order in his statement-a new order that we should all welcome. I know it is tragic that that new order, in part, has come out of a war which has cost many people their lives. I know that in one sense our media and the Australian people are very happy that no Australians lost their lives and that only a very small handful of people on the allied side lost their lives in this conflict. It gives me no joy, and it should give nobody in the world any joy, that quite clearly tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers lost their lives in the last 40-odd days of the war. What is particularly tragic is that they lost their lives because they had no choice in the nature of their government. They were conscripted overwhelmingly; they were conscripts. They were put into the army and if they objected or ran away, there is evidence from Amnesty International and other sources that their families paid a penalty. The Secret Police were used to ensure that they did not run away once they were placed near the front line or in the front line around the Kuwaiti area. Plenty of evidence is emerging that the Secret Police and special squads of the Iraqi army were used to ensure that there were no desertions, and if people deserted or were suspected of deserting they were executed. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it should be noted that only a totalitarian regime that has no compunction or no conscience can get away with imposing that sort of position on its own citizens. I hope that with the success of the UN and allied forces in the Gulf other tin-pot dictators in the world take note that maybe in this new order they will not be able to act with absolute arrogance towards their own people and have some assurance that because of the superpower rivalry that existed in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and much of the 1980s, they will be able to snub their noses at world opinion as to how they treat their own people. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be remembered that in the last 30 or 40 years during the Second World War period dictatorships started wars because they have no responsibility to the wishes and desires of their people. Those democracies which have attempted to be involved in wars or to start a war have paid terrible penalties, just like the Americans paid a terrible penalty in getting involved in the Vietnam war. In the end, it destroyed a presidency, it destroyed the moral position of the American people and it created enormous divisions in that country all because a democratic country went to war, in my view illegally, with no authority and no justification against a people in another part of the world; namely, Vietnam. But dictators do not worry about conscience. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the fact that a dictator has paid what I hope, in effect, is a supreme penalty for a dictator-losing power. Maybe in the next few weeks the Iraqi people will throw Saddam Hussein out and, hopefully, will adopt a more democratic form of government. I hope that other tin-pot dictators elsewhere in the world-and there are many still-take note of what has happened and note that the UN at long last has credibility and clout to deal with international issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Prime Minister has made it quite clear that we expect the new order to be able to deal more effectively with the long running disputes of the Middle East, particularly Lebanon and the Palestinian-Israeli issues. I support those remarks completely. I believe it will be absolutely tragic if, in this new order, this new environment that has been created by the UN's actions, we were not able to deal with the issues that have bedevilled the Middle East for so long. But closer to home, I hope that the UN peace plan, which Australia has played a part in putting together to solve the problems in Cambodia, will come back into focus in our own region. Only the UN has the opportunity of bringing together a peace arrangement in Cambodia that will stop what has been a 50 year war in one form or another in that part of South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> Burma is a country that is hardly ever heard of in publicity in the west because it has been locked away for nearly 35 years now. It has a military dictatorship which has totally rejected the democratic result of an election in May last year. When we raise issues about democracy and human rights in Burma, I hope that the military leaders of that country will not take so lightly the UN's decisions on debates about what they are doing to their own people. Various civil wars have been fought in the Horn of Africa-Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan. Unfortunately in the past many of them were provided as proxies for superpower rivalry. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the people involved in those countries now understand that the UN will be better able to get a peace settlement. Discussions are now going on in respect of the 30-year war between Eritrea and Ethiopia because the superpowers have agreed that this long, needless war can have a negotiated settlement. Even one of the worst political leaders in the world, who has created so much misery for his own people, Mengistu in Ethiopia, is starting to respond to pressure. He is talking about parliamentary democracy, and agreeing to the Eritreans having federal autonomy within Ethiopia. If such things had been agreed to 30 years ago by Emperor Haile Selassie, hundreds of thousands of Eritreans and Ethiopians would not have been killed. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another long running dispute that is taking place in the Western Sahara. This is an issue that most Australians would not have heard about. I do not know too much about it, other than the fact that for some 15 to 20 years there has been a form of guerilla war taking place in that area. That happened because the superpowers neutralised the effectiveness of the UN and it was unable to get a settlement of that dispute. As a result, many ordinary citizens in that area lost their lives or have suffered appallingly. </PARA>
<PARA> There have recently been successes in the UN because the superpowers have agreed to a new order. For example, the superpowers were able to impose a settlement on the recalcitrant countries of Angola, Cuba and South Africa, to enable Namibia to attain its independence. I was in Namibia only a few weeks ago as that country celebrated its first anniversary of independence. Namibia now has bright prospects of prosperity for its people as it has adopted a democratic constitution with democratic features and a democratic parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussions, debates and negotiations are now taking place to try to bring an end to long-running civil wars in countries such as Angola and Mozambique. Maybe they will come to an end again because the superpowers are agreeing that the UN is the appropriate body to resolve these disputes. Therefore, I think the Prime Minister in his statement is right to talk about a new order. The bottom line of a new order is that the UN will be able to protect more people from being killed by tin-pot dictators and idiotic military leaders around the world. I believe that the United Nations also will be able to encourage countries in the developing world, the Third World, to adopt more democratic features in their form of government. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that has not been remarked upon is that the countries that took on Saddam Hussein are democracies. Those countries had to debate whether to go to war. Their representatives have to stand up in forums such as this to explain to the people why such action is necessary. That is something Saddam Hussein has never had to do: he has never had to explain to his people. All of the countries that were involved in this dispute that took place many miles from their shores-countries in western Europe, the North Atlantic countries, and Australia-are democracies. I concede that some of the Arab countries that were in the allied coalition are not democracies. But I hope that as a result of the UN success, as a result of the successful allied military initiatives to free Kuwait, the feudal features of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the Arab Emirates, the military dictatorships in Iran and Syria, can be ameliorated so that the people in those countries can live a better lifestyle and have a better choice of the government they need and the government they want. </PARA>
<PARA> I argue that as Australia has participated in the allied effort to free Kuwait, we now have a moral right to say to Kuwait, to Saudi Arabia, to Syria or to the other Arab countries that we want them to improve the human rights of the people in their countries. We have the right to say that we want them to adopt democratic features and all the features that we in this country and the countries in the rest of the Western world hold so dear. If one asks the ordinary citizens in the Middle East-in Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Arab Emirates or Iran-whether they want a form of government in which they have some say or a dictatorship, overwhelmingly they will say that they want a choice of government. They want the right to criticise their governments or to change them. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that out of this very unfortunate episode of the Gulf war we may have the opportunity to encourage those countries in the Middle East that are not democratic to adopt more democratic forms of government. Australia has the right to put on the public record that that is what we want. As a member of the Labor Government, I shall certainly be encouraging our Government to put that on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental issue in the Middle East is that of the Palestinians and the associated issue of Lebanon. We will not get overall peace in the Middle East unless the Palestinians get their own homeland. It has been Labor Party policy for two decades that we support the right of Israel to live in secure negotiated borders, and also the right of the Palestinians to have a homeland with secure borders, with the Israelis and Palestinians living in peace as neighbours. I think the opportunity has now been established where we, again as a country which has participated in the allied effort to free Kuwait, should demand of the various players in the Middle East in the Palestinian-Israeli dispute that there be a peace conference in which all forces come to the table to negotiate, including the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). </PARA>
<PARA> Although I am critical of the PLO for the way it supported Saddam Hussein in a number of aspects in this war, I do not deny the right of the PLO to be a central force in the negotiations for a Palestinian homeland. Still the PLO represents the overwhelming aspirations of the Palestinian people. I am sure that if the dispute in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine is resolved, getting a peace settlement for Lebanon will be so much easier. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the Australian armed forces who have participated in the allied effort on the outstanding way in which they carried out their duties. They deserve every commendation from this Parliament and from the Australian people. I do not think that is in dispute anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Government took a tough, courageous decision in August last year to support the resolution from the United Nations calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and for the imposition of sanctions. I remember in this place in August and September last year that we were criticised for sending our ships to impose the sanctions on Iraq and to make them effective. Yet by early January of this year we were being criticised for not giving sanctions enough time to work by the very people who did not want us to make sure that those sanctions worked by sending our ships there to carry out the naval blockade of Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Right from the beginning we have been up-front in our involvement in the UN in supporting the resolutions and in the UN allied force. I think that brings great credit to this country. In five years' time or in 50 years' time it will be written that the decision of the Australian people and the Australian Government was correct. I think that is something of which we can be proud. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there has been large loss of life, particularly among the unfortunate conscripted Iraqi soldiers, I believe that in the end we will get out of this a stronger UN which in future will make it impossible for the Saddam Husseins of this world to take action such as Iraq did in August of last year when it invaded and took over another country. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the UN has given notice in its efforts over the last seven or eight months that tin-pot dictators have had their day. I hope that we can use our clout within the UN to argue against those dictators and their abuse of human rights. That is something which, in the long run, will stand the UN and this new world order in good stead. Therefore, I commend the Prime Minister for his statement. I commend the Prime Minister and the Government of which I am a part for their courageous role in ensuring that we stood up for the cause that was good and right, that is, opposing oppression by a military dictatorship against another nation. I commend the statement to the Senate and to the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the parliamentary statement on the Gulf crisis made on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) earlier today. I only want to make a few points. The main thing that I wish to say to the Senate is that the debate so far has been marked by a considerable non sequitur in the logic which is used to support the actions that have been taken with respect to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Very often in life one is faced with two mutually exclusive choices. If one takes one of those choices and certain things happen afterwards, it is not logical to assume that the other choice could not have led to the same outcome. That is the flaw in logic which lies behind the Prime Minister's statement and most of the comments which have been made upon it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position of the Australian Democrats is that we totally support the resolutions of the United Nations. The resolutions of the United Nations decried the invasion, they called for the withdrawal of the Iraqi occupation from Kuwait and they called, finally, under resolution 678, for measures to be taken including, if necessary, the use of force. At that stage everybody, including a number of spokespeople for the Government, recognised that sanctions were in place, that sanctions were being very effective and that sanctions would not bring about the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait within the little time which had been allowed-five months. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the prosecution of a war which, clearly, is a mutually exclusive choice compared with the continued imposition of sanctions, and which has resulted in the devastation of Iraq and the eventual withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. But it does not logically follow that had the alternative course been pursued-had sanctions been kept in place for some further period of months-exactly the same outcome may not have been achieved without the considerable loss of life and destruction of property which has followed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a simple matter of logic and it seems to have escaped everybody who has entered this debate tonight. I am not surprised that Senator Schacht does not see the illogic of his argument. I was a bit surprised that Senator Durack, with his legal training, did not see that what he was really arguing was not logical, that it was a non sequitur. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, it may well be that sanctions may have been kept in place for another three or four months, that Saddam Hussein himself may have started a military conflict and that we may well have finished up with very much the same situation that we now find ourselves in, that is, we may have been forced to use military force. What we regret above everything else is that for the first time-and this is where I come back to what Senator Schacht was saying-the nations of the world had come together and applied almost universal sanctions. Those sanctions were working, but they were not given sufficient time to see whether they would have achieved the desired outcome, namely, the withdrawal of Hussein from Kuwait without the absolutely incredible loss of life. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us remember that 100,000 to 200,000 people have lost their lives in this conflict, that the estimated cost of the war is $255,000m and that there have been absolutely enormous environmental costs. We face the largest oil spill the world has ever seen in an area where there are unique species which may well disappear for ever. We have seen the deliberate setting on fire by the Iraqi forces of some 700 or the majority of Kuwait's oil wells with massive air pollution, massive additions of greenhouse gases and massive loss of resources which the world desperately needs because oil is one of the most precious of fossil fuels. It is really in very short supply when one thinks of the totality of human existence on the face of this planet. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot say that those consequences may not have happened had we continued with sanctions any more than others can argue that we went to war because this was the only way that this very serious problem could be solved. The point I wish to stress is that we have lost an opportunity to establish a much better new world order, one in which the nations of the world come together and do not force a recalcitrant dictator-led nation to toe the line by the use of military force, with $255 billion worth of damage. We have lost the opportunity to see whether we could have achieved exactly the same end without that enormous damage to property and enormous damage to life. </PARA>
<PARA> Several years ago I was in the Middle East. I was part of a delegation as you will know, Mr Deputy President, because you led the delegation. You will recall that, as we flew over Saudi Arabia and having landed in Abu Dhabi, we looked out of the aircraft and we could see these perfectly green circles on a sandy white desert. We were told afterwards that they were areas where the Saudis were growing wheat under irrigation. The wheat was being sold at four times the then world price. </PARA>
<PARA> We also learnt later on that the water tables throughout that region were dropping so fast that within a very short period the aquifers would have dried up. Essentially, they were exploiting fossil water. We also learned on that trip that by the year 2000 that situation would obtain throughout the Middle East; that there would be no ground water left in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and, indeed, right down into Egypt; and that whole populations of many tens of millions of people would be dependent entirely upon annual rainfall. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe very firmly that the reason we chose a military solution to this problem so rapidly and so readily was quite simply the desire to have continued access to oil. Of all the United Nations resolutions-a list longer than one's arm-none has been prosecuted with the vigour that resolution 678 was prosecuted. Reflecting on what Senator Schacht has just said, I hope that the United Nations will now take up resolution 242 with respect to the Palestinians and that the Government of which he is a part will see that the United Nations takes that up most vigorously. None of those other United Nations resolutions have been prosecuted in this way simply because a significant resource, in terms of Western needs, was not involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I mention water is that this resource war in the Middle East will be as nothing compared with the resource wars of the future unless the new world order includes doing something about equitable access to resources, about the increasing population, which is becoming dependent upon those resources; and about helping deprived people around the world have a fair share of access to the resources. Of course, that also means the sorts of democratic revolutions to which Senator Schacht drew our attention. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other things that will be a necessary and absolutely vital component of the new world order is that we must stop the international trade in arms. I hope that in view of what Senator Schacht has said and what others have expressed tonight about dictatorships-Senator Schacht said that it is `only dictators that start wars'-perhaps as a first effort, Australia should move in the United Nations a motion to completely ban the movement of arms internationally to any nation which is not ruled by a democratically elected government. There are very few countries around the world ruled by democratic governments. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that those, in this chamber and outside, who have accused the Democrats of appeasement with respect to Hussein have totally ignored the fact that throughout eight years of the Iraq-Iran war, throughout a period when the Iraqis were bombing their own Kurdish citizens with poisoned gas, it was the Western nations which turned a blind eye to those atrocities and continued to supply arms to that obvious, brutal dictator and it was the Western nations, including the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which created the ability of Hussein to prosecute that war and to carry out the invasion in the way he did. If there is one thing which must mark this new world order, it must be that we stop the trade in international arms. Let us stop initially by not trading with any country which is not ruled by a democratic government. Not that one has not seen the overthrow of democratic governments and their replacements by dictators. One only needs to point to the example of Chile, which had a democratically elected government that was overthrown at the instigation of the United States and now lives under a brutally repressive dictatorship. I certainly extend the idea to stopping the international trade in arms altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that I remark on, which relates back to statements that I have made on many occasions in the Senate, is that in recent days a number of newspaper articles have been looking to the opportunities for trade and for economic advancement in Australia and other countries presented by the wholesale destruction of Iraq. Several economic commentators have pointed to the way in which inflation will be down, economies will boom and gross national products will rise because of the need to repair the $255,000m worth of damage caused by this war. I simply draw attention to the fact that the way in which we do our economic analyses, which leads us to those sorts of conclusions, should also lead us to conclusions that some of the ways in which we do our economic analyses are deeply flawed and not in keeping with real human values. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Powell said earlier, we also welcome the return of the sailors and soldiers from overseas. They are people who enrolled in the armed forces to do their duty. They have done their duty and they have done it well. We have no argument at all; we have only praise for those people. It is with our Government and with the other governments which so precipitately, in our view, took a course at a time when it was not necessary to take that course, when more time could have been given for sanctions, that our argument over this war lies. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply repeat my earlier assertion that it is not logical in any sense at all to assume that the outcome that we now have-namely, the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait-could have been achieved only in the way it has been achieved. Although one cannot prove this, it may well have been achieved through sanctions. That conclusion is just as logical as the one that has been drawn by many other people tonight, and it is a great pity. It is a great step backwards in terms of the effectiveness of the United Nations as a peacekeeping force in this world that that opportunity was not allowed to run a reasonable course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like all speakers, I am glad that the killing is over and, I hope, permanently. Like all speakers in this debate, as I said earlier today, I am glad that no Australians were among the many casualties. I am also very glad that the Australian forces will be home safely and, I hope, soon, to be reunited with their families. Indeed, they will be welcome home. But, unlike most other speakers, I will not wax lyrical about the rightness of might, the triumph of the United States led forces-better called the cash box coalition-or herald in the so-called new world order. I will say more about that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to disagree with most other speakers, both here and in the other place, that it was a just war. I am very, very sad that Australia participated in this war and that Australian service men and women were put at risk by a Labor Prime Minister quickly and foolishly rushing in to support a military solution to the crisis in the Gulf. This was not a war that we had to have. It should never have come to war and, as I have said many times since August, all other options were not exhausted-far from it. I support what Senator Coulter has just said about the fact that sanctions should have been given more time to work. I totally reject the claim of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his speech today:</PARA>
<PARA> We only accepted the need to fight when it became clear that there was no other way to reverse the aggression of Saddam Hussein and to free Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA>That is simply not true. We did not try every other way. We did not give sanctions a chance to work. We did not work hard enough in the diplomatic area. I do not think that Australia made one creative, diplomatic move to try to solve this crisis and, after all, that is the job of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). I am afraid to say that he failed badly once the Prime Minister had committed Australia to the path towards war. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proud to have participated in the peace movement's opposition to this war. Australians' voices were not heard by our Government, but the residue of disquiet within the community and within the Australian Labor Party will not suddenly disappear. Anti-war voices were raised and heard in many countries and in all countries which sent forces to the Gulf. All countries found that there was great opposition to the war mentality and to the prosecution of that war. Although our voices were unheeded by the powerful forces of militarism, I am proud to have stood against that tide which must become the way of the future if humanity is to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> Critics in Australia have claimed that the peace movement has failed and that might has proven to be right as a result of what is superficially seen as the speedy victory by the US-led coalition forces in the Gulf. In retrospect, a number of points need to be made for the record. The peace movement in Australia and I believe overseas as well-from all that I have read and heard from my colleagues overseas-was never in favour of appeasement and I do not know of anyone in Australia who advocated letting Saddam Hussein maintain his grip on Kuwait, despite the reference by the Prime Minister to the lessons of the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to some claims made in this chamber by honourable senators who should have known better-because they claim to have been members of the peace movement, although we never saw them at any peace movement demonstrations against this war-that we had not been critical of Iraq, condemnation of Iraq's aggression in Kuwait was clear and constant from those who opposed the war. Like those who supported the war, we were adamant that Iraq had to leave Kuwait. What we disagreed about was how Iraq should be removed. In the end, the war option was quicker than sanctions would have been, but the human and environmental costs are far more expensive than the sanctions option would have been. As Senator Coulter has pointed out, we will never be able to prove that sanctions would not have worked because they were never given a try. </PARA>
<PARA> We will probably never know the full extent of human casualties in this war. The estimates of 75,000 and 100,000 are probably conservative ones. There were the young men drafted into the Iraqi military, the civilians who were what the Pentagon now clinically refers to as collateral damage in bombing raids on military targets in Iraq, those who died in Israel as a result of Scud missile attacks, the casualties of the coalition forces and the Asian migrant workers-all of these were victims and represent the real cost of war, along with the victims of Iraqi repression in Kuwait. There were many victims on all sides. </PARA>
<PARA> These victims of war often seem to be forgotten as the military planners work out their strategies and even afterwards as the politicians who sent victims to their death claim victory. Where is the angst being expressed by anybody for the victims of this dreadful butchery which we have seen in the Middle East? Those who profit are the political leaders whose popularity rating always increases in time of war and the merchants of death who sold the weapons to Iraq during the last decade and who are now rubbing their hands with glee at future sales prospects in the Middle East-that is, unless we learn from our mistakes. We have only to look at the recent massive increase in share market values for companies such as Raytheon, Boeing and General Dynamics to see the proof of the obscenity of this trade by the merchants of death. </PARA>
<PARA> With reference to the global arms sales, I am glad that Senator Ray has said that he for one is thinking about the issue. I hope that he will have the foresight to withdraw Government support from the Australian International Defence Equipment Exhibition 91, the huge arms bazaar planned for Canberra in November this year. That withdrawal of Government support may lead to its cancellation, as happened with the Pacific Area Defence Equipment Exhibition in 1986. Interestingly, the Prime Minister forgot to mention the arms trade in his speech. What a gross omission. There was not one word in his statement about arms sales. After all, if we and other countries with which we choose to associate very closely had not been party to the arming of Iraq, this diabolical invasion of Kuwait would never have occurred and the war would never have occurred either. </PARA>
<PARA> Another huge omission from the Prime Minister's speech was the role played by the United States bases on Australian soil-much more significant than the contribution of our three warships in the Gulf. The war fighting role was not acknowledged by the Government but it was absolutely crucial. Those bases have got to go. Their negative value has now been absolutely proved beyond doubt, but it is a value which our Government will not admit to. These bases could be legitimate on Australian soil only if they were genuinely under United Nations control, and that is not the kind of UN activity which we have seen in the last few months-a United Nations which has been severely badgered and bullied by one of the members of the Security Council. That is the only way that we could allow these bases to continue on Australian soil, because their war fighting prowess has been proved. The fine-tuning of the targeting would not have been possible without the satellite pictures transmitted through Pine Gap. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it made it that much more accurate. Is Senator Newman interested in killing human beings? Is that her goal? Is that what she likes-killing human beings? The result of correct targeting is the death of human beings. That is what people on that side of the chamber seem to forget. They seem to ignore that there are dead bodies-over 100,000 of them-as a result of the accurate targeting that comes through bases such as Pine Gap on Australian soil. Those bases have got to go and the Government has to admit to the fact that that is the role of those bases on Australian soil. They are there to help with the war fighting strategies of our ally, and that is exactly what they did in this war. It was a very crucial role too, but the Prime Minister never mentioned it in his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now I am concerned about the future and what happens following this debacle. One of my staff was in the Middle East in June 1967 when the six-day war saw a fast Israeli military victory against Egypt, Syria and Jordan. He recalls how he went over from the West Bank to Israel and how everyone there assured him that at last there would be peace now that Israel had beaten the Arabs for the third time in 20 years. Having lived on the West Bank for a year, he begged to differ and said that although Israel might have won the war it would not win the peace unless it was a just peace. History has shown that he was correct. Triumphalism was the mood in Israel in June 1967, just as it is today in the United States. But peace is much harder to build, especially in a part of the world where the bitterness goes back many decades. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not optimistic about any settlement in the Middle East if there is a permanent US presence in the region acting as a focus for extremist anger and frustration. I certainly hope that Australia does not again fall into the trap of following the United States if its forces remain there. Our ships should be brought back immediately unless there is a United Nations peacekeeping force installed which would have to be very different in character from the cash box coalition which Australia so quickly and readily joined. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not feel confident that the United States will put the hard word on Israel to talk to the Palestine Liberation Organisation for extremist movements such as Hamas make even the PLO seem like doves by comparison. Any student of the Middle East knows that the PLO represents the vast majority of Palestinians and that if Israel will not talk to the PLO there is really no-one else to talk to. If the Prime Minister of Israel had said last year that he would open talks with the PLO there would have been no war over Kuwait. In the end, Israel will have to talk to the PLO, or there can be no peace. Sooner or later the demographic factor will overwhelm that country. Many nations have appeared and disappeared in less than 100 years. Israel could be one of them if it does not face up to reality. I sincerely hope that Israel avoids such a fate. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many questions to ask about the future role of the United Nations. Obviously the current situation is thoroughly unsatisfactory. This was never a United Nations war; nor was there any consensus that the war option was the right way to proceed-whatever the Prime Minister said in his statement about victory in the Gulf being won by the United Nations. It was more war by default in the absence of any other applicable mechanism. I believe that the United Nations was set up, as the preamble of the UN charter says, to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war; not to rush into war options again and again as fast as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been considerable doubts about the way in which the United Nations handled this war, given the lack of any effective existing structure to respond to the kind of aggression that occurred on 2 August last year. The Prime Minister echoed the United States Government in arguing that the war was acceptable in terms of the UN charter, but other qualified experts on UN procedure have grave reservations about this analysis. The United States, supported by Australia, took the position that article 51 of the UN charter, which affirms the right of individual and collective self-defence, allowed the United States to liberate Kuwait by armed force. The critics argue that this ignores the specific language of article 51. This permits:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . individual or collective self defence . . . until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. </PARA>
<PARA>Once the Security Council has adopted collective security measures under chapter VII of the charter, as it did with the sanctions initiated in August last year, member states, they would argue, are constrained by the charter from acting unilaterally or multilaterally to launch an attack. Essentially, the United Nations has to be given time to try all possible non-military forms of resolving a conflict before resort to armed force is taken up as a final option-and that was not done. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations was established to put an end to fighting, not to authorise the kind of high-tech slaughter that we saw in the Arabian desert last month or the bombing of cities, even if the planes were ostensibly seeking military targets. The key to a well ordered world is not the endowment of the United Nations with the coercive capacity of a planetary police force operating in the interests of the industrialised world, but the power of the credible threat of collective action to create conditions for seeking peaceful and diplomatic solutions to international disputes. It is a mystery to me that anyone can justify the deaths of perhaps 100,000 people or more in the name of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question mark hangs over the funding of these military operations. It is obvious that the United States cannot afford to lay out the kind of money that the Gulf war cost in order to counter every act of aggression that may occur in the last decade of the twentieth century. Member countries of the United Nations would be squandering scant resources were the United Nations to go on a war footing every time there was a resource dispute or a power struggle in which the United States decided to engage, trying to take the Security Council with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, massive reform is needed in the United Nations. It is very obvious that high-tech weapons cost a fortune. So does transporting tens of thousands of service men and women around the world. The United States and its allies hope to recoup the costs of the war by demanding reparations from Iraq, just as the allies demanded reparations from Germany after the First World War. I cannot help but ask whether the United States has any intention of paying reparations in Vietnam and Cambodia 16 years after a devastating war finished in Indo-China. Of course, we have not seen that happen. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to my next point-the issue of selective indignation. There have been many letters to the press since last August drawing our attention to other acts of aggression condemned by the United Nations but ignored by the great powers when it did not suit their interests to take action. I have already had a pathetic excuse given in response to a question I addressed last year to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade about the parallel between East Timor and Kuwait-a dismissive reply. Others have drawn attention to the occupation of northern Cyprus by Turkey in 1974; the occupation of Tibet by China; the occupation of West Papua by Indonesia; and, of course, the occupation of southern Lebanon, the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights by Israel-all since 1968. There was also the case of Iraq when it invaded Iran in 1980. The world community did nothing about that. Indeed, some 26 countries sold arms to both sides over the following eight years. It was the debt that Iraq incurred due to its massive expenditure on arms that in part led to its decision to invade Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the new-found enthusiasm by the United States for the United Nations, the United States Government has never given an adequate explanation of the difference between its intervention in Grenada and Panama and Iraq's act of aggression against Kuwait. The United States seems to engage in these invasions and expect the rest of the world to stand by and silently applaud it, as of course Australia did, much to my shame. I also believe that there must be substantial changes to the UN Security Council, as I said, reflecting the world that we live in almost half a century after the end of the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> I will address the issue of the new world order, given that Mr Hawke referred to it in the last part of his statement. He said that the end of the Cold War has ushered in a new world order, whether we like it or not. I do not know what was very new about the industrialised world lining up against Iraq in what was essentially a resource war triggered off by Iraq's post-war problems and its invasion of Kuwait last August. Nor do I know what was new about the use of superior fire power to win a war, right or wrong. A most perceptive editorial in the Canberra Times on 27 February observed:</PARA>
<PARA>The danger is that the next decade will be one of such disturbing upheavals that such qualities as humanity and commonsense might be obliterated. The winding up of the Cold War will certainly defuse the stand-off between the US and the USSR but it will also flood the world with surplus bombs, military aircraft and destroyers and turn loose into civilian life millions of demobilised soldiers. </PARA>
<PARA>I find that very worrying. This process is already under way with the United States intending to move tanks from Europe to Egypt that would otherwise have been destroyed. Doubtless, the Soviets will want to push their old military hardware in the Third World in order to raise cash from overseas while they are in such an economic mess. France and Britain have shown few scruples over selling military equipment, while Germany was so embarrassed by the revelation that it had supplied Iraq with the wherewithal to make chemical weapons that it is now offering Israel millions of deutschmarks as conscience money. It is not only the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, who has spoken about this new world order, but we have yet to hear from its proponents in the US exactly what it is. It is one of these undefined euphemisms that is very conveniently thrown around. </PARA>
<PARA> The most perceptive comment on the new world order to date has come from Neal Acherson, whose article on the subject was reprinted in the Canberra Times on 24 February. He asserted that the war in the Gulf was not the beginning of the new world order but the last act of the old one. He quoted the historian Immanual Wallerstein, who wrote in the Berlin Tageszeitung that the great American peace is now ending, not beginning. He went on to claim that we are not moving from a situation in which world peace is secured, but in the opposite direction. He drew a parallel with past empires which have felt it necessary to go on sending armies across continents and fleets across oceans long after they have ceased to be able to afford it. He foresaw a world where there would be three power centres: North America, Japan and Europe. Around them there would be grey margins, which would include North Africa and the Middle East, the Soviet Union, and the southern cone of South America. These countries will seek to enter the walls of the power centres and to become part of them. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Correspondingly, the power centres have an interest in keeping them out for as long as possible, maintaining them as dependent territories which provide raw materials and food and migrant labour when required and which will absorb the small part of foreign trade which is not exchanged between the rich three.</PARA>
<PARA>I suspect that Australia will see itself in this category. Already we are being marginalised with regard to wheat sales in the Middle East. It is unfolding right before our very eyes. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond the grey areas, there is the third helpless zone where most of the wars will be fought. This is a pretty depressing scenario, I must admit. The ideological enemy of the rich three will be nationalism, not communism. There are two kinds of nationalism: the genuinely dangerous kind that threatens the interests of the rich three, as Saddam Hussein did; and the tame sort, which can even be useful to the rich three at times. Neal Acherson warns that there will be much conflict as tame nations make the transition to dangerous ones. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA> Because we in the West have thought it more important to bribe their oligarchies than to help their people to justice, they have poverty and tyranny but now also modern weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, all the immigration laws and frontier barriers on earth will not keep the people of the grey and helpless zones out of the power centres for ever. </PARA>
<PARA>Those who designed the new world order after 1918 and 1945 had the power to enforce it. They do not have that power any longer. We may be entering a time when the rich will be well protected but the rest will be subject to a new degree of lawlessness. I think we in Australia are aware of this situation. We grasp at the coat-tails of the United States for protection but feel anger and hurt when United States agricultural interests come before ours. Finally, Neal Acherson comments that:</PARA>
<PARA>To realise, suddenly, that a promised new world order is no more than the dim reflection of the old and dying one, that ahead there is only darkness, is a terrifying experience. </PARA>
<PARA>That is why I am very worried about the Prime Minister's statement. It reflected exactly what Neal Acherson wrote in his article. If it is to be a new world order, it must be based on non-military forms of conflict resolution, an equitable distribution of resources and a just price to be paid for commodities. I see no signs of those concerns when the proponents of the new world order speak, mainly because they are not saying anything clear about what the new world order is. In fact, it is the poorest nations which pay the highest price in the Gulf war and its aftermath. I quote from an article by Tom Aston in the Post Courier of Papua New Guinea:</PARA>
<PARA>It is the developing world which is paying the true cost of the Gulf war. For the price of five British Tornado jets or six American F15s-around K210 million-</PARA>
<PARA>this writer is from Papua New Guinea, a Third World country, which is significant-</PARA>
<PARA>the 20 million Africans threatened by famine could be fed for a month. </PARA>
<PARA> While the West turns its eyes to the Gulf, the huge impact of the war on the developing nations is being largely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> A handful of oil-exporting countries in the south have made gains, but oil price rises have hit the poor hardest, forcing millions to walk rather than take public transport and denying slum-dwellers and villagers even the luxury of a kerosene lamp at night. </PARA>
<PARA> Weak economies have been drained of foreign exchange and, in effect, been hijacked by Washington. </PARA>
<PARA> The war, it seems, is not the beginning of a New World Order as President Bush claims, but rather a regression to the politics of insecurity and greed. </PARA>
<PARA> A rural clinic in Bangladesh could run for a month and afford to treat 4000 villagers for the price of just one bomb dropped by an American B-52 bomber-$11,000. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not have the latest count of how many of those bombs were dropped by B52s, but I know there were something like 75,000 bombing sorties from the US-led coalition forces. That is a lot of bombs; that is a lot of money; that is a lot of villagers going without health facilities, without adequate kerosene for their lamps, and without any transport facilities whatsoever because of this war. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In two days, the operating costs of the British military run to $16 million, more than the British government's contribution to African famine relief for the whole of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> For the price of 30 of Saddam's Scud missiles-$6 million-25,000 Eritrean families could be provided with enough seeds and tools to recover from the drought in northern Ethiopia. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America, it is the poor who are being hit hardest by the rise in oil prices since the Gulf crisis began. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very interesting. This writer, a Papua New Guinean, goes on to talk about the new world order and the way in which the United Nations has been largely nullified by the operation of this war. Tom Aston continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Rarely has the UN looked so powerless and irrelevant in influencing world events. </PARA>
<PARA> The war has halted the unravelling of the ideology of fear, insecurity and military posturing that appeared to have begun with the end of the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of a peace dividend that could have benefitted both north and south has gone. The dividend that could have been used to rebuild the world, is being used to destroy it. </PARA>
<PARA> If this is the birth of a New Order then why, for instance, has Washington forsaken Liberia, for so long a client state, where a famine now rages that could be alleviated for the cost of a dozen or so B-52 bombloads?</PARA>
<PARA> If this is the birth of a New world Order then surely we can look forward to the West halting the indiscriminate sale of arms of the kind that created Saddam's military machine, that have destabilised so many parts of the developing world and which divert funds that should rightly be spent on agriculture, industry, health and education. </PARA>
<PARA> The awful sophistication of the weaponry of both sides in the Gulf conflict bears adequate testament to the fact that for decades the scientific world's most brilliant minds have been engaged in perfecting the means of mass destruction and governments are engaged in marketing the products of their labors abroad or happy to stand back while others do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The legacy of misery from the Gulf war will be immense, not just in terms of the suffering caused by the military personnel on both sides, but to the civilians who either perish amid the fighting or flee their homes. </PARA>
<PARA>I would urge caring Australians to support Community Aid Abroad's call for funds to assist victims of this war and to encourage the Government to match dollar for dollar the war effort to the tune of $52.5m with a restitution and a peace effort. As a nation, we should be prepared to pay as much for patching up as we have paid for destruction-and we have paid plenty for the destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> Another casualty in any war is truth. We were fed such a line of propaganda from our Government and from the American Pentagon machine that I have to admit that I, too, was sucked in to think that the Iraqi military capability was much stronger than in the end it proved to be. It was nothing like the huge military machine that we were led to believe it was. </PARA>
<PARA> The real losers in the war are the innocent civilians and military killed on both sides in the war; the scorched earth, which will take years and billions of dollars to clean up; the Third World economies-particularly in south Asia where many of the migrant workers in the Gulf came from; and the Middle East region itself, which faces long term political instability. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy is that, when there was an opportunity to solve an international crisis by non-military means, the United States led 30 of the world's nations into waging war. This war was protested in each of those countries. War degrades the human spirit. We are all collectively debased by war. It does not solve complex problems such as those of the Middle East. The jingoistic justifications for killing thousands of human beings and for the devastation that has been brought in the name of liberty and democracy ring hollow in the light of the United States' selective indignation to other invasions and tyrannical regimes. On the contrary, as the aftermath will demonstrate very painfully, we are all losers when we engage in the brutality and wastage of war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I am pleased to be able to speak on the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the Gulf crisis. In opening his statement the Prime Minister said that the allied military operations under resolution 678 had been outstandingly successful. He also went on to point out that there had been few losses to the allied forces and that that was a cause for great relief. He also said how proud he was of Australia's task force. If those are the sorts of jingoistic justifications for killing human beings that Senator Vallentine is talking about, I condemn Senator Vallentine while I support the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am happy to associate myself with the Prime Minister's comments. Those sentiments are ones which I support, as indeed I support the detailed comments by Senator Robert Ray, the Minister for Defence, earlier this evening when he spoke of the men and women, soldiers, sailors and airmen, who served in our forces and in the allied forces in the rescue of Kuwait in the Gulf. I too express my joy at the safe return of the first of our men from the Gulf and I look forward with great enthusiasm to the return of the remainder of our men and women. I am delighted that they have not been injured in the Gulf crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> What a wonderful word `cease-fire' is. For those of us who have worried and wondered and waited since 2 August, and particularly since the outbreak of the war in January, there could be no more magical word than `cease-fire', something we had all been waiting for and worrying about. </PARA>
<PARA> I also remember the debate we had in the Parliament in January. In the five years that I have been in the Parliament, I cannot remember another occasion on which the purpose of the Parliament was more clearly demonstrated. Senator Powell and some of the others in her Party who have opposed the war-and Senator Vallentine, too-have in the past made claims about the parliamentary debate that we had in January and have suggested that it was all a farce and that, decisions having been taken by the Government, the role of the Parliament was irrelevant. I would deny that strongly. I think that those two days of debate were extremely impressive. I was very glad to be one of the senators who took part in that debate. I will never forget it. I hope that I shall never again be in a parliament taking part in a debate on whether our troops should be at war. Having been in this place at that time, I believe it was a flowering of the purpose of the Parliament to see people struggling with the concepts, struggling with a competition of principles, if you like, as to how they stood personally on the issue. It brought out the worst perhaps in some people, perhaps a few people; but for many it brought out the best. I think that was one of the finest hours of the Parliament, certainly in my time. </PARA>
<PARA> After the joy of the cease-fire and the pride in our personnel has to come a quiet assessment of where we have arrived. For every death and disability caused by this war there will be lasting anguish. We have a responsibility now to do our utmost to ensure that a lasting peace is found to salve that pain and to prevent more anguish and pain. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I intend to leave it to others to discuss the issues relating to the Middle East. I have already spoken twice in this chamber on this issue; once in January and once a couple of weeks ago. Tonight I will speak briefly about Senators Coulter and Vallentine, because there were some comments made by both of them to which I took some exception. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter paid great attention to the massive use of greenhouse gases and the loss of oil. He told us that sanctions might have been kept in place for three or four months and then we might have been forced to use the military option. He seemed to have little or no concern for the massive loss of life, the torture, the rape and pillage in Kuwait; yet he was prepared to allow sanctions to continue even longer than they did. It was during this time that this loss of life, torture, rape and pillage took place in Kuwait. I cannot understand somebody who would give the effect of greenhouse gases and the loss of oil a higher priority than the damage to human beings in Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine spoke somewhat on the same theme. She got really worked up and told us that sanctions should have been given time to work and that we did not try every other way. She talked of the victims of the war seeming to have been forgotten. Senator Vallentine did her usual stunt of coming into the chamber when she was about to speak, speaking and leaving. I only wish that some of the people who returned her to Parliament were aware that this is her normal contribution to the Parliament; it is a very perfunctory attendance in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine seems to claim some moral ascendancy over the remainder of the Senate. I take great exception to this because if she had been here throughout the debate she would have heard numerous senators on both sides of the chamber express sincere and solemn regret in terms of the victims of this war. She would have heard the concern that people here have expressed, as I have just now. Once again, she, like Senator Coulter, gave little or no attention to the Kuwaiti victims-victims from 2 August onwards; not just since the air war or the land war broke out. It started with the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine also got into top gear when she started to talk about bases on Australian soil. I think it is against her religion to say `joint facilities'. She talked about them in relation to our war fighting capacity. When I suggested to her that those joint facilities might have had a large role to play in the precision bombing that took place in Baghdad-bombing which enabled airmen to select military targets with much greater precision and accuracy than has ever been achieved in any other war, thus leading to a saving of human life which otherwise would not have been possible-she got into the most enormous rage and fury. I think it did her blood pressure no good at all. But those are the facts, whether she accepts them or not. That precision bombing of military targets was, of course, helped by the information that was made available by our joint facilities. We should be proud of it, not ashamed of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak, as others have before me, about the lessons that we have to learn from the commitment which we have just made in the Gulf. These lessons are not ones which should be learnt, tucked away in a cupboard and forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested when the other night, on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation program Lateline, the Russian spokesman Gerardy Gerasimov said:</PARA>
<PARA>The most important lesson of this war is that aggression does not pay. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that we do not forget that. I hope that all nations will remember that, because that is perhaps our greatest hope for peace. But aggression can and probably will happen again. </PARA>
<PARA> Today in the other place Dr Hewson talked about the principles, as old as the United Nations charter, on which order is based. He said that we are closer today to realising those principles than we have been for over 40 years; that we should be encouraged by that and not sceptical; but that it is right that we should be measured in our recognition of them. We should not delude ourselves that national rivalries and competition will suddenly disappear and that it is right to continue to value strong security relationships with our allies and to be prepared to bear the costs and burdens involved. He also said that the current optimism about international security issues is well placed but that there are many uncertainties. If and when aggression does occur again, we must be prepared. We must make sure that aggression will not pay in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The second lesson is the speed at which the problem arrived last August. It gave us so little time. It gave the world so little time to prepare the forces and the equipment to deal with the problem. I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that when we committed our ships in August we sent them away with weapon systems and communication systems being installed. As they left our shores the systems were being installed and work-up training on them was being undertaken. It was marvellous that there was the ability to get up to speed in such a short time, but we should not have to rely on it. We should have our people trained to the capabilities that they need at all times. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of our defence specialists have rested a large part of Australia's strategic planning on the notion that we will have a long lead-up time. I have a copy of the Dibb report in which Dr Dibb said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australia faces no presently-identifiable major military threat, and all conceivable threats would be preceded by a build-up of forces and a deterioration in relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> These judgements have been refined in successive reviews of Australia's strategic prospects and defence planning requirements, as mentioned earlier. The conclusion that Australia faces no specific military threat, and that substantial threat would take many years to emerge, continues to be valid. </PARA>
<PARA>But we had little or no warning of the crisis in the Gulf and we had little or no warning of the Fiji coups or the recent coup in Thailand. We cannot base our planning on warning times. We have to have a trained force with equipment ready to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The third lesson that we learn from this Gulf war is that high-tech equipment used on the modern battlefield cannot operate itself. The human component is as important as it ever was. Numbers are no longer the only criteria. Brain power and specialist training are absolutely critical. I was interested tonight in a comment which Senator Robert Ray made and which I support; that is, how interesting it is to compare a volunteer force with a conscript force, as we saw in the Gulf. One can think back to Vietnam, where the Americans last went to war with a conscript force, some of whom did not seem to know what they were fighting for. This time they knew. They were articulate, they understood and they had a commitment. We can compare that with the conscripts in Iraq. Motivation as well as training of intelligent human beings brought to a high level of ability is what we need for a modern defence force. </PARA>
<PARA> Precision bombing which so revolts Senator Vallentine can only take place with a combination of high technology equipment and well trained personnel. Today's weapon systems require long and intensive training in order to operate them effectively and with minimal harm to civilians. Training must be undertaken in peacetime so that we can never be caught unprepared. That, of course, applies not only to airmen and precision bombing but also to naval and ground forces and the job which we expect of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I was worried when I read evidence given to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry into the reserves. The Army gave a report to that Joint Committee about the 10 per cent reduction in activity levels applied to the Australian Regular Army in the financial year 1988-89 and the reserve having insufficient operating cost allocations to develop the White Paper directed capabilities, and it went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to, in some cases, achieve even minimum safe training standards. </PARA>
<PARA>That was back in 1989, but the situation continues very much the same. It is at a time like this, when we have sent people away to war and we realise day after day the awful carnage that war can bring, that we must remember for the future that we must see that these people are given the opportunity in peacetime to train sufficiently. We cannot send them away with insufficient training. </PARA>
<PARA> I was alarmed recently when I read a report of a court martial into the officers of the HMAS Darwin, in which Commander Warwick Conlin, the officer in charge of the navigation school at HMAS Watson, said that the Navy was trying to train too many officers, but that standards could be improved by reducing the number to allow more people time at sea. The report said that standards of navigation in the Royal Australian Navy have declined. Commander Warwick Conlin said:</PARA>
<PARA>Officers spend less time at sea than what they have in the past and that's been the cause of this decline in standards. </PARA>
<PARA>We should take note of that warning. We cannot afford to allow the skills so basic to the safe operation of our Navy to be diminished. If that evidence is correct, we should all be concerned about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, that court martial was told that HMAS Darwin, which ran aground during naval manoeuvres, had missed out on weeks of vital pre-exercise work-up. The purpose of the work-up was to identify any deficiencies in the ship and its organisation and to change them. HMAS Darwin's work-up was interrupted and it had insufficient time to carry it out. The end result was that HMAS Darwin had barely a week before she sailed for the RIMPAC exercises. That was evidence given by Captain Russell Shalders. We should be alarmed at that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I was concerned when only on Saturday, on HMAS Success, a senior sailor was talking to me and spoke about his worries at leaders in the non-commissioned officer (NCO) and officer levels in the Navy being promoted too early and without sufficient experience. All these pieces of evidence which I am putting together tonight seem to me to be directly related to the problems we have had with the retention of experienced personnel. They are a direct consequence, and we cannot allow them to go on. Having invested in recruiting and training the quality young people we need, we must make sure we make the services attractive enough to keep them because the loss of experience levels could be fatal for the training of those coming along behind. There is no substitute; we must pay the insurance premium for continuing peace by supporting a sufficient level of defence funding in peacetime. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget that wars are fought by young people. It was clear to anybody visiting our ships that the majority of them are crewed by people under 25 years of age. Our best chance of preserving the peace for Australia is to make sure that Australia appears credibly able to defend itself. That is the best chance of ensuring that our young people will not be required to die for their country. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his speech at the submarine keel laying ceremony in Port Adelaide last Friday said:</PARA>
<PARA>A great deal is spoken about defence self reliance. Today, with this submarine and with this construction project, we see the proof of Australia's capacity to provide, as ever before, for its own defence. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the reality is that we remain unable to detect illegal entry into our country. We remain unable to protect our shipping from mines. We remain unable to effectively go to the rescue of our nationals in neighbouring countries if opposed. We remain unable to keep sufficient men in the field for any length of time to deal with sustained low level contingencies in northern Australia. As I have already said tonight, we had a mad rush to add weapons and communication systems to the frigates before they could get away to the Gulf and the mobility of our land forces must also be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this lack of essential capabilities, the size of the Defence Force has, over the last eight years, been reduced from 72,000 to 67,000. In 1989 wastage from the defence forces reached its highest for the decade. Nine thousand two hundred personnel left, nearly 30 per cent higher than in 1983, the year in which the Government took office. Australia has an armed force totalling 67,467 as at 31 December last year. In the last financial year we spent $9 billion on defence. Both the manpower and the spending are extremely small when compared with the figures for our regional neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures that I quote now are also from the Military Balance, 1989-90. Japan has an armed force totalling 245,000 and spent $US28 billion on defence. India has an armed force totalling 1.4 million personnel and spent $US9.25 billion on defence. Indonesia has an armed force totalling 284,000 and spent $US1.4 billion on defence. China has an armed force totalling 3.2 million and spent $US6.1 billion on defence. </PARA>
<PARA> All these countries have reserve and paramilitary forces ranging from 58,000 to 1.8 million. Our reserves total only 29,000. These figures alone would suggest that, in terms of regional threat or military build-up, Australia is not the defence giant of the region, despite what some pacifists would claim. In fact, we are well behind most countries-even those not listed, such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan-in terms of defence manpower and spending. </PARA>
<PARA> It is widely acknowledged by many political and defence analysts that the South East Asia-Pacific region is less stable than most would like to believe. One only has to look at the recent conflicts in Bougainville, Fiji, and Vanuatu, the continuing conflict in Cambodia, the recent military coup in Thailand, and the tensions in India-Pakistan as well as in Myanmar. While the rest of the region is prepared to take steps to defend itself if the need ever arises, some Australians still complain that too much is being spent on defence. Since the end of the Vietnam war, debate on defence has tended to be unfashionable. Only now, because the Gulf war confronted us every night on television, are people being forced to look at defence, and debate has started once again. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence White Paper in 1976 which called for greater independence and self-reliance failed to be implemented and defence equipment was allowed to run down. Eleven years later, in 1987, another White Paper, predicated on self-reliance, was published and well received by many commentators. Four years later this plan is also faltering because the strategic situation is changing and because the necessary finance has not been provided. The Defence Budget has been at its lowest spending percentage of gross domestic product for 40-odd years, at 2.3 per cent GDP. In simple terms, the lack of resources has caused the White Paper to lose its credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps that is why the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has been forced into taking up a collection to pay for our contribution of medical reservists to the Gulf allies. In his statement today, the Prime Minister said that these service people who are serving on exchange with allied forces, and up to 40 medical personnel serving on the hospital ship USS Comfort, including a number of reservists, have earned the respect of their colleagues and our gratitude for their service. </PARA>
<PARA> Some gratitude, when Dr Bruce Shepherd of the AMA says that the attitude of the Government is that these people are wealthy doctors and the Government does not care about the costs they have incurred in their practices while they have been away. The Government has refused to reimburse them for the cost of their practices; so some of them are up for $30,000 apiece to pay their staff, their rents and the leases on their medical equipment while they were away. It is a disgrace that people of Australia have to cough up in an appeal to meet the costs of our medical specialists. That is not just a mean-minded debating point, because the refusal by the Government to pay the costs incurred by the senior medical specialists in the reserve forces may result in our inability to provide experienced surgical and anaesthetic care to our front-line troops in future conflicts. That would be an awful reduction in our defence capability; it would have a serious effect on our ability to deploy in war. </PARA>
<PARA> The permanent Air Force made a submission to the joint committee inquiring into the reserves and talked about these vital specialist skills, which were not resident in the permanent Air Force on a full time basis. It said it would not be cost-effective for those skills to be provided on a full time basis. The same applies for the Navy and the Air Force. Come war, those senior surgeons and anaesthetists are needed. They need to be senior because they need to be experienced and able to train others; they need to have had the opportunity to deal with the trauma of war. Junior surgeons will not have had the same experience. We must not forget that lesson. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, I must again mention the fact that this Government has abolished war service loans. Something will have to be done immediately to restore the eligibility of defence personnel for a war service loan if they are deployed to a war zone. It is incredible that we could have sent people away having removed that entitlement which Defence Force personnel have had in Australia since 1917. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister mentioned a number of organisations and government agencies which supported Australia's effort in the Gulf. I shall not go through all the ones that he mentioned, but I note that he did not mention the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. That seems to me to be a strange omission because so much of our capabilities originated from the work of that organisation. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation may be unhonoured and unsung, but some of us recall the important contribution it makes to our defence forces and their capabilities. The Prime Minister also did not mention the 700 personnel who work at Pine Gap and who made a vital contribution to the allied effort in the Gulf. The contribution and the importance of the people at Pine Gap should never be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion of the fighting in the Gulf comes as an enormous relief to us all-a number of speakers in the debate today have mentioned that-but it is especially so for the mothers, fathers, wives and friends of our service personnel. However, it cannot be allowed to signal the end of interest and debate on our ability to defend ourselves and to play our role for peace in the international community. The Opposition has already announced its own defence review. The Government has some serious reassessment to make for itself. The Government has had responsibility for Australia's defence for the past eight years. In many ways it has been lucky that it has not been required to make a greater contribution to our security during those years. Our contribution in the Gulf extended our Navy almost beyond capacity. An extended demand on both our Army and our Air Force would find our defences pretty threadbare and lacking in depth. </PARA>
<PARA> While the professionalism of our service men and women has done us proud and is not in question, the reduction in their numbers over the past eight years and the limits on their training resources should be realistically assessed now while the awful memory of war is fresh. While the Government has been lucky in the past, God forbid that we should bank on Australia staying a lucky country in the future. As Dr Hewson said in his response in Parliament today, it is time for a realistic reappraisal of our national defence strategy and the state of our defence resources. </PARA>

<PARA>That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Family Law Amendment Bill 1990 will introduce a small number of significant amendments to the Family Law Act, particularly in relation to child custody, guardianship and access proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>The most important of the amendments to be made by the Bill are aimed at improving the handling of custody and access disputes in which allegations of child abuse are made by one party against another. In preparing these amendments the Government has been guided by the findings and recommendations made by the Family Law Council in its 1988 Report on Child Sexual Abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Senators will be aware of increases in recent years in reported instances of child abuse. Child sexual abuse in particular has become a significant issue for the Family Court in a number of cases. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of the uncertainties raised by early Family Court decisions on child abuse were resolved by decisions of the High Court in 1988. However other difficulties with the handling of child abuse allegations in Family Court proceedings remain. The Family Court has responded to the problems in this area by establishing appropriate procedures within the Court's administration to process cases involving child abuse allegations. Procedures have also been introduced for better co-ordination with State and Territory child welfare authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to be made by this Bill are designed to complement the administrative steps already taken by the Family Court in the area of child abuse. The amendments will:</PARA>
<PARA> - provide for mandatory reporting of child abuse by Family Court staff to State and Territory child welfare authorities;</PARA>
<PARA> - provide legal protection for Family Court staff who report child abuse to child welfare authorities;</PARA>
<PARA> - provide for State and Territory child welfare authorities and other interested persons to intervene in cases involving alleged child abuse;</PARA>
<PARA> - limit the number of unnecessary medical and psychological examinations of children obtained by parents involved in custody and access disputes;</PARA>
<PARA> - insert an express statement in the Family Law Act requiring the Family Court to have regard to the need to protect children from abuse;</PARA>
<PARA> - provide protection for medical and other witnesses in child abuse cases from abusive or hectoring questioning. </PARA>
<PARA>One amendment to be made by the Bill will give statutory force to the Family Court's established practice of admitting hearsay evidence of statements made by children to adults about abuse they have suffered. The Family Court already admits evidence of this kind because of its long established policy that children should not be drawn into Family Court proceedings by being called as witnesses for either side in a custody or access dispute. The court will retain a discretion to decide whether to exclude the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Another area of family law in which the Bill will make changes is step-parent adoptions. For many years the formation of step-families usually resulted from the death of a parent. Today, however, many step-families are formed following the breakdown of previous marriages. In these cases both natural parents are still alive and usually maintain continuing relationships with their children.</PARA>
<PARA>It has long been an accepted principle in family law that continuing contact with both natural parents is usually desirable in the interests of the long term development of a child. If parents disagree about custody or access to a child following the breakdown of their marriage, the Family Court provides appropriate counselling and if necessary applies the relevant legal principles under the Family Law Act to resolve the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>However in recent years a small number of parents have tried to use adoption to establish a new family unit consisting of the children, one natural parent and a new spouse-the step-parent. One reason a parent may have for seeking to adopt in these cases is that adoption may put an end to any rights the other natural parent may have to custody, guardianship or access to the child. It also puts an end to the other natural parent's liability to pay child support for the child. </PARA>
<PARA>In its 1986 Report on step-families the Family Law Council commented on the inappropriateness of adoption as a method of establishing the legal status of a step-child in a step-family. The Council preferred the alternative of a determination by the Family Court of the parties' custody, guardianship and access rights under the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will amend the Family Law Act to make it clear that a step-parent adoption does not put an end to existing custody, guardianship or access rights under the Act unless the Family Court decides that the step-parent adoption is in the best interests of the child. The amendments will not affect adoptions other than step-parent adoptions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill includes other amendments recommended by the Family Law Council to protect the welfare of children. The Bill includes provisions which will stop parents transferring custody or guardianship of children to non-parents by means of Family Court consent orders or by registering child agreements with the Court. These provisions are aimed at ensuring that in future any arrangement that comes before the Family Court that involves conferral of custody or guardianship on non-parents will be scrutinised by the Court to determine whether those non-parents are suitable persons to have custody or guardianship of the child. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill makes a number of other technical amendments to the Family Law Act. I need mention only two of these amendments. In 1989 the Family Law Act was amended to allow the parents of an ex-nuptial child to register an agreement with the Family Court which determines their rights and duties in relation to the custody, guardianship, access and maintenance of the child. The Bill will amend the Family Law Act to provide that these child agreements are exempt from stamp duties. This will ensure child agreements relating to ex-nuptial children enjoy the same exemption as maintenance agreements for children of a marriage. </PARA>
<PARA>The other technical amendment I mention is an amendment to clarify the powers of police who are responsible for the enforcement of Family Court orders. The Bill will empower police, who are authorised under the Family Law Act to arrest a person, to enter and search premises for the wanted person. This amendment is necessary to ensure that the police are able to apprehend people who breach domestic violence and other orders issued by the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) which seeks to amend two other Acts-the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and the Grape Research Levy Act 1986-to correct minor drafting faults to the original Bills. In debate on a previous Bill, the frequency of research and development levy Bills was referred to. This is, of course, a most important matter. This omnibus type Bill, which picks up the drafting errors of the original legislation, certainly is not positive. The changes in this Bill to correct the drafting mistakes mean that research council selection committees will now be able to have their reports incorporated in the annual report of the Research and Development Corporation. Representative organisations are currently incorrectly associated with the research and development organisation rather than the industry, and this has changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the second Act, which this legislation seeks to amend, the grape legislation drafting error removed the right of the industry organisation which pays the levy to determine the level of the levy, and this is corrected. I understand that the grapes of wrath were brought to bear with regard to that industry in the way in which it was incorrectly excluded. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also some amendments to energy Acts to correct minor drafting errors, and they also have the support of the Opposition. The coalition parties support these amendments, but make the point that it would be nice if the Government got its drafting right the first time. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering legislation and amendments to primary industry points of view, it is important to concentrate on the issues that are raised in this legislation to correct mistakes of the Government relating to Bills and to legislation that are coming before this Parliament. I remind the Senate that in the whole field of primary industry and across this whole important agricultural and industry section and marketing there are many areas where the Government not only has got its drafting and its parliamentary considerations wrong, but also, very obviously, it has got the administration, the regulation and the economics of the industry wrong in the last few years. We have seen other legislation recently in the Senate relating to the wool industry. I have no doubt that in the coming days and over the coming months we will be considering the wheat legislation and many other important aspects of primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that throughout rural Australia the economy is having disastrous consequences and needs to be brought into focus at this particular time. The Government has failed the bush, the Government has failed to recognise the areas of very real concern and the impact on many families and their livelihood as well as the impact on their important industries. It is important that this legislation, which I believe is symptomatic of the malaise that the Government has got itself into, has speedy passage. In that regard we will support the legislation, but we certainly highlight the fact that the Government has not got it right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to what Senator Tambling has just said with considerable and genuine interest and a great deal of agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Tambling has described, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) that we are debating at the moment is a matter of getting the drafting right. I agree entirely with his sentiments. While it would be nice if the Government got its drafting right the first time, it would be much more preferable if many other matters were also right. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at this particular piece of legislation, I gained the distinct feeling that we are simply rearranging the deckchairs. We are fiddling about on the edges while the fundamental questions of agricultural policy are not being considered and certainly not being considered in the light of what is in the best interests of Australia's future rural productions. I do not know what the correct word is for the feeling I have when looking at these cosmetic changes while we preside over a situation whereby 35,000 letters were delivered to Parliament today in an attempt to get a message across. Today we are looking at this sort of consideration. I cannot find the right word to describe the feeling I have of that process taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will not object to this legislation. We hope that it can be expedited in the neatest possible manner and, as we are told in the Bills Digest, will lead to a situation which improves the administration of these particular pieces of legislation. With some irony, I noticed that while the Opposition raised a matter of public importance today, in presenting his case earlier a considerable part of Senator Lewis's speech was spent in arguing with Senator McMullan about which party said what about interest rates in January 1990 and the fundamental question of what action was to be taken. The question which was of interest to the 35,000 people who were trying to communicate with this Parliament has not been addressed. There was a petty argument between members of this Senate rather than an attempt to reach a fundamental reappraisal of what we are doing and why we are doing it. It is that sort of frustration which I cannot find words to express at the moment. I will certainly be looking at other legislation that this Government likes to tidy up with a view to its being improved. In improving it, I would like to see a little more notice taken of the people who are involved in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> We have a mechanism to make more efficient the administration of the industry. It seems that this Government is hell bent on removing from that efficient representation or operation of the industry sufficient representation by the growers, the people who are actually involved in primary industry. The grower boards, the representatives of the people who produce the commodities in our rural industries, are the people we should be spending more time listening to. It seems to me that the process this Government is undergoing at the moment is to remove that sort of representation. That covers everything from grape producers, which is of particular relevance to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today there was some discussion about the representation and the purpose of the trade delegation to the United States. I am reminded that Senator Macklin in this place some two years ago was conducting a campaign to defend, against the machinations of this Government, the Grains Council of Australia, the producers of wheat, against their removal according to the direction that had been taken by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin in his campaign to prevent that removal was making the point that we need the expertise, experience, continuity, devotion and commitment that has been given by growers to properly represent us in the marketing of the produce that they create. In that campaign, Senator Macklin was at pains to point out that the staff that had been established in the Washington Embassy had considerable experience and expertise and had some degree of success. At the very time when the United States was going forward with its farm Bills and its procedures that were leading to export subsidies and having a huge effect on Australian trade, the staff, who were most expert and had done such a wonderful job that far, were reorganised and there was a hiatus which certainly did not do our industry any good. These are the sorts of things that seem to slip through the attention of this Parliament with regard to what is important in the rural industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Almost 100 years ago to the very day, a meeting of historic importance in Australian history was convened in Sydney. This meeting was officially known as the National Australasian Convention. It produced a draft constitution which became the framework for the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The meeting was held between 2 March and 9 April 1891. In a well-known quotation Professor La Nauze summed up the work of the Sydney Convention:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The draft of 1891 is the Constitution of 1900, not its father or grandfather. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In the years 1897-1900 it was to undergo fairly extensive plastic surgery but it is still recognisable, beneath its scars, its built-up features and the wrinkles of age, as the infant and innocent Constitution which momentarily so delighted its parents. </PARA>
<PARA>Australians in the last 90 years have shown a remarkable disinclination to change their Constitution. Since Federation, governments have tried to change the Constitution over 40 times. In fact, only eight referenda have been passed. Whether politicians like it or not, the public have shown a strong disinclination to change the Constitution by referendum. </PARA>
<PARA> The main draftsman of the constitutional Bill of 1891 was Sir Samuel Griffith, the then Queensland Premier. He was assisted by Andrew Inglis Clark of Tasmania and Charles Cameron Kingston of South Australia. The principal issue at the Convention, sometimes referred to as the `lion in the path' of Federation, concerned the power of the Senate in relation to money Bills. The debate on this particular issue occupied more time than any other issue at the Sydney Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sydney Convention was, in my view, by any standard one of the most important events in Australian history. We can now, with hindsight, assess the achievement of the 45 delegates who attended that Convention. First, they established a framework which enabled the formation of the Australian nation some 10 years later, in 1901. Providing a basis for nationhood is a massive achievement in itself. Contrasting with the view so often promoted by the guilt industry, an industry which has been extremely active during the last decade or so, Australia is a remarkably cohesive and tolerant society by any standard. Opinion polls indicate a high degree of patriotism amongst our people. It is a society which attracts migrants from many different types of societies around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is appropriate to say that our constitutional founders produced one of the world's most successful democracies. In a period when there is a fervent wish among many peoples throughout the world to establish working democracies, the august assembly-as it was called in the press-of 1891 stands as a landmark in the history of democracy. Indeed, it is true to say that there are only five countries in the world today which have a longer democratic history than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegates of the Convention of 1891 were able to draw on the constitutional lessons of Britain and the United States of America. The provision, for example, that there can be no taxation without an Act of parliament, that all revenues must be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund from which moneys can only be appropriated by law, records the victory of Parliament over the Executive in the seventeenth century-a victory which, I might add, needs constant defence. </PARA>
<PARA> A related point is that the delegates also produced the foundation for one of the world's most successful federations-a form of government which has tended to produce more failures than successes. A study on federalism around the world argued:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia must be regarded as one of the world's most successful federations along with the United States, Canada and Switzerland. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the current difficulties that Canada is experiencing, the list of successful federations may well shorten in the years to come. It is interesting that in reviewing their constitutional problems some Canadians are wondering whether the composition of the Australian Senate, based on equality of representation between the States, would have helped maintain more effectively the Canadian federation than the current position of a nominated, unelected Senate chamber. One of Australia's eminent constitutional experts, Professor Rufus Davis, summarised Australia's constitutional achievement as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>By the common standards of democratic societies, our constitution has succeeded in any number of ways. It has succeeded in authorising and holding a nation together.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Davis went on to say, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA>It has succeeded in building and developing a will for law and order. It has succeeded in providing and proving the possibility for growth and development when there is initiative and consensus. It has succeeded in making and extending the virtues of choice by diffusing the centres of authority. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of some of the disasters that we are experiencing among State governments, I believe, speaking as a Victorian, that we can be very thankful that the experimentation of the Cain and Kirner governments was not able to be very effectively translated to Australia as a whole. That was the point that Professor Davis was making. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the intermittent demands for wholesale constitutional change, Professor Davis makes an important observation about the achievements of our Constitution. He says that the Constitution `has succeeded in holding out the wisdom of change by evolution'. He points out that inevitably a constitution always is and must be a system of limitations-that is, the submission of government to an agreed system of restraints. Professor Davis says:</PARA>
<PARA>This is a fragile tradition that is so vital to preserve for Australia. But we cannot foster this tradition by a belief that a constitution can be treated like a suit, or a piece of furniture, or a machine that can be made over or discarded whenever a contentious mood, fashion or vision of public welfare occupies and obsesses the changing occupant of a throne. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Davis concluded, and this is relevant to my conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA>If we cannot inculcate this understanding of our constitution, if we cannot foster the idea that constitutionalism and gradualism go hand in hand, we cannot build a confident basis for our future. Worse, we court caesarism if we believe that we can dramatise our passing prejudices every few years to rationalise the need for wholesale constitutional revision. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite our constitutional achievement, how many Australians know anything about the august assembly of 1891? I would suggest that a minuscule proportion of the Australian public would know anything about these individuals, who in many ways were the founders of the Commonwealth of Australia, and about their work. </PARA>
<PARA> A 1987 survey by the Constitutional Commission showed that some 46 per cent of Australians were not even aware that Australia had a Constitution. Ignorance of the Constitution is as high as 70 per cent in the 18 to 24 age group. A recent social studies survey by a leading public sector think-tank, the Institute of Public Affairs, revealed that only 20 per cent of year 10 students know that the Commonwealth of Australia was formed in 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recording that, despite the massive achievement of the 1891 Convention, not one Australian newspaper on 2 March, 3 March or even today saw fit to commemorate or even mention in any way the centenary of the National Australasian Convention. Parliamentarians must take much of the blame for this ignorance of our history. Perhaps even former lecturers in constitutional law at the universities may also have to take some of the blame. If we show so little regard for the founders of our federation, how can we criticise the public?</PARA>
<PARA> As I recorded in an adjournment speech last year, we have virtually ignored the founders of Australia in the portraits and permanent displays in this new Parliament House. We have found space throughout Parliament House for contemporary art to be displayed in prominent positions, yet it has not been possible to hang the portraits of Sir Samuel Walker Griffith, Charles Kingston, Richard Baker, George Reid and Alfred Deakin, some of the leaders of the federation movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I am happy to report that there are some signs that these problems are being addressed. I have received a very positive response from the President and the Speaker about my earlier concerns on the need to examine the historical displays in Parliament House. I hope that the noticeable gaps will be quickly filled. It is clear that the original instructions regarding displays in Parliament House were deficient and clearly lacked an appropriate historical perspective. I hope-indeed, I am confident-that the President and the Speaker will not allow a similar mistake to be continued. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also delighted that the President has encouraged the Department of the Senate to develop a temporary exhibition and hold a series of lectures to commemorate the centenary of the Convention of 1891. The Department of the Senate is now finalising a temporary display which will open in April. On Thursday this week, Sir Zelman Cowen will give the first lecture entitled, `Is it not time? The National Australasian Convention of 1891. A Milestone on the Road to Federation'. </PARA>
<PARA> Does it matter that Australians are so ignorant about their Constitution? As the Institute of Public Affairs points out:</PARA>
<PARA>The existence of widespread gaps in students' knowledge remains a problem of national significance, since it has damaging side-effects for both a liberal-democratic polity and an industrialised market economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, in a report into active citizenship, argued as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>High levels of political ignorance in a community are therefore a danger sign. They point to a situation in which accountability is weak and where power may be concentrating in the hands of a few. They are warning that the quality of democracy may be under threat. </PARA>
<PARA>In the lead-up to the forthcoming centenary of the founding of Australia in 1901 and, of course, the adoption of the Constitution, we have a unique opportunity to honour the founders of the Australian nation and redress the appalling ignorance of our Constitution. Indeed, planning for the celebrations will undoubtedly commence in the next year or so. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some important lessons to be learned from the 1988 bicentennial celebrations to mark white settlement in Australia. Equally, it may be of value to look at the way the United States of America celebrated the bicentennial of its Constitution. Some five years ago the United States Government established a commission to celebrate the bicentennial of the US Constitution. The commission on the bicentennial of the United States Constitution believed that it was important to encourage citizens to learn more about their constitution and how it secured the nation's liberties. It aimed to ensure that through work in schools, business clubs, churches and so on, every citizen could become involved in the bicentennial. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, the US commission did not make the same fundamental mistake as the Australian Bicentennial Authority in seeking to use a national celebration to promote political change. Honourable senators will recall that only action by the Government to change the direction and stop the excesses of the Australian Bicentennial Authority helped avoid widespread controversy and division. Honourable senators may recall that the Bicentennial Authority found its original slogan, `the Australian achievement' too embarrassing and decided instead to use the insipid and defensive slogan, `Living together'. </PARA>
<PARA> Political change and constitutional change will inevitably occur and should occur, but these should take place in the normal processes of continuing public debate and discussion. Therefore, the lesson we can draw from the 1988 experience is that the focal point of the celebrations in the year 2001 should be on our constitutional achievement, the nation it established and the liberties it secured. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, it should be a period of national pride, of commemoration of the achievements of our people in war and peace, our liberties, freedoms and thanksgiving to our founders. With this goal in mind we can encourage all our citizens to learn about our constitutional achievement, honour the founders of our nation and help secure the legacy of liberty, freedom and federation for another 100 years. </PARA>

These documents are referred to affectionately as the French letters because they have come into Australia in recent days from an address in Paris.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assure Senator Alston that I am not trying to do something surreptitiously. The documents, as I say, to the best of my knowledge are not before the courts. I commend to honourable senators an analysis of these documents which Anne Lampe of the Sydney Morning Herald presented in an article which appeared on 26 February. Honourable senators are probably aware of the fact that Anne Lampe was the journalist who first made public comment about the documents which were referred to as the Belgium letters. As a result of that she is subject to an injunction, but she has persevered very courageously, I believe, on this issue. On 26 February she gave quite a comprehensive analysis of these documents. I commend that analysis to honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that those who are interested in gaining access to the documents will acknowledge on reading them that they are important for several reasons. By their own admission, they highlight the fact that a number of transactions undertaken by Westpac in relation to foreign currency loans were unauthorised foreign currency trading, carried out on behalf of Partnership Pacific Limited (PPL) clients by Westpac staff. The lack of authority for those transactions is emphasised in these documents, and that is important. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not explained that these are internal confidential memos from their exchanges of opinions between the Queensland manager of the Westpac arm-that is Partnership Pacific Ltd-and the head of funding and liquidity in PPL. In other words, they are internal discussions about the significance of some of the things that occurred in managing foreign currency loans. The first observation is that they acknowledge that at least some of these transactions were unauthorised. But in many respects the most significant thing they acknowledged was that the transactions were operated from a pool of money. The importance of this cannot be overemphasised because the vast majority of people who transacted foreign currency loans with Westpac at that time believed that they were transacting individual loans in their names. </PARA>
<PARA> These documents acknowledge the fact-and this is acknowledged in the other documents, and I have addressed this in this place before-that what happened was that when somebody advanced money in order to transact the loan the money actually went into a pool or a slush fund. The money was used to speculate in foreign currencies, some speculations were profitable and some were not. Some were a disaster. But the outcomes were allocated after the event to the names of individuals who believed that they had entered into quite specific transactions. It is acknowledged elsewhere that the bank incurred no losses, that the losses were all placed upon clients and that the profits were allocated to clients according to the subjective judgment of Westpac-PPL staff. This is quite an extraordinary management of these loans which is acknowledged in the pool concept and the pooling process which is acknowledged within these documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware of the fact that previously I have tabled confidential memos of the Commonwealth Bank and outlined a procedure used by the Commonwealth Bank in relation to foreign currency loans which were referred to as simulated loans, pretend loans. I have incorporated in Hansard extracts from the handbook of the Commonwealth Bank as to how to set up simulated loans and how to manage them and project them to customers as having been real. Both of those processes are acknowledged in the internal confidential documents of both Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank. Frankly, the pooling process strikes me as being an extraordinary admission. I will return to the magnitude of this shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The third significant thing about these documents is that they, in fact, openly admit to the suppression of-and they advocate the suppression of-certain documents and that they not be kept in files because they would clearly expose in subsequent litigation certain officers of the bank and the bank at large. They actually suggest that these documents should not appear in files. But on the second page of the document, and these are handwritten, it says that now the memo is written `it may be too late to destroy every copy'- this is the memo which elaborates this difficulty-so that Davis is to ask Phil Deer to speak to all State managers and tell them `not to use the memo as official file'. In other words, it is too late to destroy them all so they have to be suppressed in a way that they are not accessible subsequently to clients. With this concept of suppression and destruction it is absolutely vital that it is noted and recorded. The Senate would be aware that success in subsequent litigation is dependent upon the legal process of discovery of documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who have been following this case closely will remember the Quade case, which was a case directed at Westpac. A borrower took Westpac to court and lost because he did not have sufficient documentary evidence to carry the case. There were affidavits tabled in the court that the documents available were a total disclosure. Bank officers actually swore on affidavits and swore before the court that there had been total discovery. Subsequently, Quade's appeal was upheld because there was subsequent discovery and that discovery revealed that the affidavits were in contempt of the court. The previous decision of the court was overturned because of more adequate discovery. If one is going to succeed in these cases there must be total discovery. Therese Rahme is a case in relation to which I have tabled information in this place before. I have documented her circumstances at length. She finds herself having to proceed to the High Court of Australia to try to do the same thing that Quade did successfully; in other words, to ensure total discovery of the documents. These documents are saying that Westpac consciously entered into a process of destruction of documents and consciously entered into a process of suppression of documents so that they would not be discovered. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go further and look at an interesting article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 February, two days after the previous article which I have referred to appeared. The article, by Tom Burton, refers to the leaked memo. On first reading it is a quite humorous article because it outlines the attempts by Westpac to suppress and to stop the process of leaking that is now occurring, but unfortunately its attempts were in turn leaked. What we had in front of us were extracts from a memo by the Chief General Manager of Westpac, Mr Bill McInnis, who put forward a 10-point action plan to plug up the leaks-damage control stuff. What Mr McInnis actually instructed officers of Westpac to do-and I quote from the article which quotes from the document-was this:</PARA>
<PARA> Westpac-related documents of any nature whatsoever shall be mechanically shredded at the end of their use and not disposed of in an ordinary wastepaper bin. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a directive to Westpac officers to turn on the shredders; that any Westpac-related documents whatsoever were to be mechanically shredded at the end of their use. There is no definition, to my understanding, within that document of what a document is by definition-in other words, what is to be included and what is to be excluded. There is no definition of the term `end of their use'. </PARA>
<PARA> I would suggest to you, Mr Deputy President, that the end of their use will probably be six years down line under the statute of limitations when they may or may not be admitted to the court. I would suggest to you that this is a directive of the Westpac Chief General Manager to initiate a process which may subsequently prove to be a conspiracy to subvert the course of justice. How do we know what documents are going to be relevant at some time in the future to litigation which may be undertaken by some future litigant? That is an extraordinary instruction-a recent instruction-which echoes right now, this month, the philosophy and the policy of these documents three years ago. The magnitude of this scam-it was a scam, a bonanza contrived and exploited at the expense of ordinary Australians-is mind blowing. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I received a confidential analysis of the Westpac foreign currency transactions between 1 July 1986 and 7 January 1987-a period slightly in excess of six months. It is an analysis which runs to 24 pages. I will not table the documents because they were given to me in confidence and I was asked not to table them. But I accept them as valid and I believe that, if necessary, they can be substantiated before the bank inquiry. The analysis is this: in that six-month period Westpac alone-Westpac was not the only bank into this bonanza, and I have tabled evidence to that effect over the last 2 1/2 years-traded $5.85 billion in foreign currency loans. The average trading volume per day was $43m from a pool traded speculatively, the outcome of which-profits and losses-was, by the admission of these letters, arbitrarily allocated to clients. </PARA>
<PARA> By the admission of other letters, losses were never allocated to banks; losses all fell on clients, and profits were allocated to some clients on an arbitrary basis. That is what was known as the deal switching referred to in the Westpac letters. So we have $5.85 billion traded in a period of six months, with average daily trading being $43m. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other letters a process of point taking is referred to, which is skimming off the top; taking a little bit of cream off the top. A conservative estimate of point taking in this period was referred to technically as 20 points, in other words, 0.0020 dollars point taking-0.2 of a cent in each dollar traded. At that conservative estimate, Westpac would have creamed $14m off the top by point taking. If that is a conservative estimate-and some estimates run up to 10 times that-this was a nice little earner that Westpac had going on the side and presumably the other major banks had going on the side as well. Westpac has admitted elsewhere that in doing this, the withholding tax which should have been paid by the bank was actually imposed upon the clients, and it has admitted also that it exceeded its statutory obligations to the Reserve Bank of Australia. The most significant thing was that this was done on a pool basis, on a subjective basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The final thing that is significant about these documents is that they clearly establish the bond between PPL and Westpac. Westpac recently began the tactic of distancing itself legally from PPL. The documents and the associated letters that are there for any senator to have access to clearly state that those who were working for PPL were also working for Westpac. I will read letters of clarification about this relationship that were directed to two employees. These letters listed the duties of the employees. Presumably they got a duty statement. The letters said that in performing tasks, they were acting solely as employees of PPL. That seems clear enough. They said they were subject, in the course of performing these duties, to the direction and supervision of PPL. That seems clear enough. Then the letters go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . during the course of your employment with PPL, you continue to be employed by Westpac Banking Corporation and continue to hold the office and perform the duties for Westpac as it may from time to time direct. Notwithstanding . . . your salary, annual leave, long-service leave, superannuation and other benefits (payable or accruing under the terms of your employment with Westpac) shall continue to be met by Westpac. </PARA>
<PARA>There seems to be an extraordinary contradiction within two paragraphs. On the one hand they are employed by PPL, and yet on the other hand they are employed by Westpac. The realities were that PPL was finally absorbed by Westpac and has now been totally absorbed by it. They are one and the same entity as far as this bonanza and scam are concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer briefly to the Australian tourism awards, the awards which will take place this year and, in particular, the fact that as a consequence of changes to the guidelines for entry, the Reid School of Tourism and Hospitality is not able to take part this year. I am very sorry indeed that this is the case. I am not certain why it has come about or why it is that those who set the guidelines for the awards would set about excluding just one such food school, that is, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To recap-the Australian tourism awards were established in 1984. The intention of, I think, the then Minister, Mr John Brown, was to promote excellence in the industry and encourage the pursuit of improved standards and further growth. The awards were funded through Commonwealth and the host State contributions and sponsorship from within the tourism industry. My clear recollection is that at the time the Minister hoped that they would be run by the private sector in the hospitality and tourism industry and that it would become primarily responsible. That in fact has been the case, although the Commonwealth still contributes about $20,000 each year towards the cost of the award night. </PARA>
<PARA> Under one of those categories, that is, training and education, there used to be two subparagraphs, one for private institutions and one for institutional or government. It is now at the national level that these two categories have been combined. As a consequence of that, the ACT school is no longer able to participate. It was apparently decided at a meeting last November that the two categories would be put into one. </PARA>
<PARA> The wording is specific. In 1990 the first category was industry, and in the second, under `institutions' it was stated that funding could come from any source, which included government. For 1991 it has been changed to one category and states, `where funding has predominantly come from the private sector'. Whether it was deliberately designed to exclude the ACT food and hospitality school I really do not know and am not able to say, but it is the only such food school in Australia which at this stage does not have its funding primarily from a private source. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is as a result of its now having a restaurant able to raise funds in a way that it was not able to before. I believe that until the new food school was opened it did not have the opportunity to pursue private sponsorship, as others have done. I believe that it does not have the same opportunity in Canberra to get sponsorship as is available in some of the States. As a consequence, the change which has been made really does discriminate against this very fine institution which is an important part of the tourism and hospitality industry in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that those responsible for making the decision either did not care or were not concerned about the discrimination against the ACT. If they wanted to change the guidelines to more diligently pursue private sector involvement, they could have at least given one year's notice so that the school could have had the opportunity to make changes to its management and not merely be excluded overnight. It is strange indeed that category one was worded in a particular way in 1990 while, in 1991, it refers to `privately or nationally owned', which would indicate that, in that category at least, government funding does not preclude a tourist attraction from being entered into the tourism awards. </PARA>
<PARA> I totally support the concept of the awards being to promote and to encourage the private sector in the tourism and hospitality industry. I just want to place on the record that I think it is very important that in one fell swoop at a meeting at which the ACT was not present, the Australian Tourism Industry Association should have taken a step which eliminated just one of the food schools in this country-that is, the ACT food school. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Australian Tourism Industry Association next year to so correct its guidelines as to see that this is not the case for the future. By all means it should encourage our school to develop private sector sponsorship to as great an extent as possible, but it should not adopt this sort of attitude.</PARA>
<PARA> I urge Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) to look closely at the funding that the Commonwealth gives to the awards, and hopefully it will still continue it. But I think it should be very careful to see that the situation does not arise where in one category alone Government funding is fatal whereas in another category it is still allowed and considered to be an appropriate part of the awards. </PARA>

<PARA> The contribution of Senator McLean was yet another instalment in an endless saga. I do not think that it is appropriate for me to comment about the substantive issues he raises. Obviously there are serious public interest questions, and it is entirely appropriate that they be debated in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply add to what Senator Alston said earlier on the subject of the tabling of the documents tonight-that is, had Senator McLean been prepared, as a matter of courtesy and familiar procedure, to make available earlier the documents in question, explaining their nature, there would have been no question of his being denied leave earlier in the day. It is unfortunate that he did not take advantage of that process. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the contribution of the Senate's resident young fogy, Senator Kemp, on the subject of nationalism, constitutionalism and anniversaries, let me say this: we can admire the work of the 1891 founders and we can deplore the lack of contemporary knowledge of their work without, however, having to commit ourselves to the glory of the changeless and timeless character of all that they produced.

As such, I could not be expected to share Senator Kemp's perception of the current glory of it all, particularly on matters such as Senate powers, some aspects of the distribution of federal powers as between the Commonwealth and the States, not to mention matters such as the absence of a Bill of Rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole concept of federalism is a wonderful way of building a nation out of disparate parts. My longstanding belief-shared by most observers of contemporary federal scenes around the world; not just of the Australian scene-is that it is a somewhat less than admirable and wholly wonderful way of actually carrying out the work of contemporary complex nations. It is a matter of paying attention not to the original glory of the foundations but to the need to constantly renovate the superstructure and to make it relevant to contemporary circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> In that respect I draw attention to the efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to regenerate a debate on the whole question of the contemporary application and operation of federalism, his attempt to get a dialogue going in something of the nature of a consensus about how we might move forward not only to make more workable the practical arrangements that are necessary in the Federal system but also ultimately to change some of the rules themselves. I simply express the hope that if a consensus should be reached as a result of this type of process, as in the past it has been reached, at least on a temporary basis in relation to other changes, that consensus for change will survive the process of carrying through to referendum. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the ironic and unhappy features of Australian constitutional referenda is just how many of them over the decades have been supported by one party or the other when it has been in government but, faced by the temptations of opposition and the temptation to score political points at the time that the referendum has gone to the judgment of the people, have resulted in some U-turn by the party in question. I will not recite now some of the more inglorious examples of that, but they have been many. Some of them my Party has shared, and more recently the honour of such can be described as largely being carried by the conservatives. It is most unfortunate that the way in which commitments to things such as extensions to terms of parliament and a number of other matters of that kind have not been able to command bipartisan support all the way to the line. I simply hope that that process will change in the future. With those few remarks I believe that it is time that we at last now adjourn. </PARA>
