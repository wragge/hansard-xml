The point is that we can improve; those opposite will only get worse because they are locked in, in terms of their leadership, to a set of policies which is going out of fashion as fast as it possibly can. Who does not know about it?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As a senator from Western Australia, Senator Crichton-Browne would probably be better able to tell us than some others. The point I was seeking to make about that is whether that improvement on historical performance is good enough compared with investment rates in other countries: for example, much higher rates of investment as a percentage of GDP in countries such as Japan and a number of the OECD countries, leaving aside Asian countries as Senator Kemp refers to them in generic form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I said on the Sunday program that I am not sure whether the tax system is wrong but that we should look at it to make sure that it is up to date, and that it is up to date not only in comparison with OECD countries but also taking into account that we live in the Asia-Pacific region and that the majority of our major trading partners are now in the Asia-Pacific region. That seems to me to be a factor which we might appropriately have to take into account.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is common knowledge that in terms of encouragement of investment in a number of Asian countries, there are all sorts of tax advantages offered, which I personally would regard as inappropriate in Australia, but which nonetheless affect the patterns of investment in those countries, albeit, I would suspect, only on a temporary basis. Those things are relevant in any consideration of the matter, I suspect.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Walters certainly hasn't. Mr President, the reality is that a great deal has changed. I was able when opening the Australian Airport Owners Conference this morning in Devonport, Tasmania--where I met a lot of nice people--to indicate that following the deregulation of interstate air services in October last year by the Government, the domestic aviation industry has achieved record levels of performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The domestic airlines carried 4.7 million passengers in the September quarter, exceeding the previous record of four million which was set in the September 1988 quarter, which was the Bicentenary-Expo year. This record enabled the airlines to set another new mark for the number of passengers carried. The airlines carried 15.4 million passengers in the year ending 30 September. This is 8.6 per cent above the previous record of 14.2 million passengers set in the year ending 30 September 1988 when bicentennial and Expo activities were very powerful attractions. These results are even more remarkable, given the current economic climate.</PARA>
<PARA>  Competition between the airlines has been vigorous to say the least, and demand for air travel and capacity offered by the airlines are at record levels, stimulated by deep fare discounting. The airlines have been offering a myriad of deep discounts and a range of special deals, the like of which were never seen before deregulation. A total of 5.1 billion revenue passenger kilometres were performed in the September 1991 quarter, an increase of 30 per cent on the previous record set in September 1988. A total of 6.4 billion available seat kilometres were flown in the September 1991 quarter, an increase of 34 per cent on the previous record set in the September 1988 quarter.</PARA>
<PARA>  Given such results, it is reasonable to conclude that at this stage the Government's initiative to deregulate the interstate airlines industry is clearly providing significant benefits to consumers, tourism and the economy as a whole.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Land Transport. I refer to a survey by Monash University in Melbourne which found that people aged 17 to 25 years account for a third of all road fatalities in Australia although they constitute only 14 per cent of the population. In asking this question, I understand that the Chairman of the Road Trauma Committee of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons, Professor Frank McDermott, has said that the number of deaths could be greatly reduced in Australia if a curfew were introduced on young drivers between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as apparently applies in parts of the United States. I therefore ask the Minister whether he agrees with the views of the professor and whether any steps are being taken to help reduce the number of road deaths among young people in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1878" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Land Transport, Mr Robert Brown, has provided me with the following response. The Government is aware of the serious overrepresentation of young drivers in road crashes. They represent 14 per cent of the population but account for 33 per cent of road deaths.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the Prime Minister's 1990 road safety package, the Government required all States and Territories to introduce graduated licensing arrangements for young drivers. The purpose was to extend the learning period and ensure an extended period of driving under controlled conditions to reduce the number of accidents. The graduated licensing system requires all learner and novice drivers for the first three years after they obtain their licences to drive at a zero blood alcohol limit; a minimum learner period of six months; no issue of learner permits before 16 years of age; and no issue of probationary licences before 17 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA>  South Australia, which had introduced its own graduated licensing scheme just prior to the national scheme being prescribed, will assess its success against the national scheme in 1993. As part of the Government's intensified road safety research and public education program for the three years from 1991, young drivers are to be the major focus group.</PARA>
<PARA>  A major research study is being undertaken at the Monash University Accident Research Centre. This research will initially focus on the reasons for the high crash rates for young drivers and will develop methods for evaluating the effectiveness of the graduated licensing system that has been introduced. Depending on the outcome of the current research, further studies looking at countermeasures will be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA>  The public education program of the Federal Office of Road Safety has also given considerable emphasis to young drivers. This includes major road safety programs for young males in the bush, which in 1990-91 focused on seat belt wearing and this year will focus on driver fatigue. A school-based young drivers program is currently being developed. Major campaigns on drink driving have been and will continue to be promoted, and these will impact on young drivers. A separate major public education campaign for young drivers will be developed during the current fiscal year.</PARA>
<PARA>  As part of the blackspot package, the Government attempted to introduce passenger restrictions for young drivers. This would have involved restrictions on young drivers carrying passengers from their own age group, thus minimising peer pressure. There was a great deal of opposition from the States and Territories to that measure and it was not proceeded with on the basis that its introduction would compromise the total package.</PARA>
<PARA>  The introduction of curfews would impose significantly more restrictions on young drivers. The Government would not introduce such a measure without carefully examining the issue. It is understood that curfews in the United States and New Zealand essentially apply to drivers who are younger than our youngest drivers. It is intended that a report will examine this issue in some detail. In the meantime, the Government believes that the measures being introduced by the Commonwealth and State governments will act to reduce the number of crashes amongst young drivers. Road fatalities for young drivers fell 18 per cent between 1989 and 1990 and overall fatalities have fallen another 9 per cent this year.</PARA>

The committee of the Institution of Engineers consists of representatives from the major companies in the space industry, CSIRO and several experienced academics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Recently the committee's primary focus has been on the level of public sector investment in the space industry and the direction of Australia's space policy. Its view is somewhat consistent with the report of the Madigan committee of inquiry conducted by the Academy of Technological Sciences in 1986, which recommended very substantial public sector expenditure on space related activities. To give an idea of the level of space related activities, in the 1991-92 Budget the allocation is in the order of $7m.</PARA>
<PARA>  The area of space policy and development is very complex, embracing things such as remote sensing right up to the rocketry associated with the proposed international spaceport. Therefore, what the Institution of Engineers is saying is slightly misleading in that its own work parallels the Government's work without acknowledging some of the Government's input into these questions. The content of the engineers' press release is in some ways without foundation in that sense. All government agencies are aware of what that committee is saying and are working on solutions to it.</PARA>
<PARA>  The spaceport in Queensland always obtains high public priority in relation to space related matters, but in fact the highest priority area is remote sensing. It is in those areas that the Government has been giving most attention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I suppose that it is fairly typical of Senator Crichton-Browne to put a quotation into a question without telling us when it occurred and where it is from. Let me say that if Senator Crichton-Browne is pretending that it was a recent statement by the former Treasurer, I think it is very much a pretence. I am sure the former Treasurer knows that investment levels and anticipations in Australia are very low at present. When the former Treasurer made that statement, he was referring to what had been an historic change in investment rates and intentions which took place in the last two or three years of the 1980s and the first years of this decade when investment was considerably above the historical average in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not saying that that is right;  I am saying that is an issue which should surely be looked at in the current environment. If some of Senator Crichton-Browne's colleagues opposite do not understand that--like poor old Senator Kemp who keeps nodding his head, and it is too early on a Monday to be nodding his head as he is--I hope that Senator Crichton-Brown will.</PARA>

<PARA>  The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is currently acting on these reports.

Last week a delegation from the port committee at Port Kembla came to see me here in Canberra, similarly complaining about the condition of foreign registered ships that have recently been visiting that port and which have had to be detained. Apart from the potential environmental hazard posed by these vessels, I have also expressed my deep concern about the very significant loss of life which is occurring at sea from these ships sinking. Since January 1990, 39 bulk carriers have been reported missing, have been lost or have suffered serious structural failure.

The other observation I should make is that, according to my reading of the Canberra Times, Senator Winston Crane attacked me and accused me of misleading the Senate the other day. I was not aware that Senator Crane was going to make that speech. I understood that protocol requires that, before one dumps on someone else, one notifies that person. Since Senator Crane is a new senator, I will overlook the lack of courtesy on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  With respect to the question, I do not think the Industrial Relations Commission has acted incorrectly. The question with Robe River has always been that it is, and is self-proclaimed as being, a militant, right wing employer, determined to put in place in this country its version of how industrial affairs should be arranged. Its version is hostile to existing practice in this country. That is well known. It is an evangelising employer.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am surprised that there should be any pretence that it is other than that and that its actions should somehow be now cloaked with an element of respectability. It is an aggressive appealer against decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission. It appeals all the way through the system and then finds other grounds for appealing. One cannot say that this is illegal. One can say it is vexatious and mischievous but it is not illegal.</PARA>
<PARA>  The base of my complaint is that, after having lost a series of appeals relating to the employment of seamen off the coast of Australia, the company that was a wholly owned subsidiary of this company, went into voluntary liquidation and set at nought the whole process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Can the Minister assure the Senate that the numerous mechanical failures which have beset the Aurora Australis since it departed on the first Antarctic voyage for the season have now been rectified? Further, can the Minister give an undertaking that the gathering of data in relation to the world ocean circulation experiment will now proceed as scheduled? What has been the total cost of delays so far in terms of wasted charter days, salaries and other expenses associated with the vessel being idle and why were no sea trials conducted to test the equipment during the five months in which the ship was berthed in Hobart at taxpayers' expense?  Finally, given that the vessel appears to have been made available to the Antarctic Division at the commencement of the season in an unserviceable condition, will the Government seek compensation from P&amp;?</PARA></TALK.START>

That was on the voyage which departed Hobart on 25 September to deploy personnel and supplies to Macquarie Island and then undertake a two-week marine science voyage. Following the completion of the Macquarie Island operations, the vessel returned to Hobart for repairs to the winch on Thursday, 3 October. The vessel then departed on 4 October for further adjustments and trials of the winch at sea. The winch was trialled successfully on Monday, 7 October and the vessel has now resumed the marine science voyage.</PARA></TALK.START>

Given that Telecom Australia's new contractual agreement with service providers of recorded telephone messages has been effective for two weeks from 1 October, would the Minister confirm that adult messages previously available under the dialling prefix 0055 have been moved to 0051 with limited access using a personal identification number? If the answer is yes, how many of these messages have been moved to 0051? If no, why the delay? Further, can the Minister confirm that under this new contractual agreement the decision to move adult messages to 0051 is to be made not by Telecom but by the service providers and also that Telecom will not monitor the content and advertising of any messages until a complaint is raised by a member of the public? Finally, what penalties, if any, will be enforced by Telecom upon service providers who breach the codes of practice?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. What will the Government schedule fee for general practitioner services be from 1 December? What will the refund be for patients who are either bulkbilled or direct billed when they attend either vocationally registered or non-vocationally registered general practitioners?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1887" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am sure that I can find that information. It will involve providing Senator Herron and the Senate with the full schedule of all the various fees for a multitude of services. That will be provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The situation from 1 December is that GPs who provide a service will receive a payment from the Health Insurance Commission of 85 per cent of the schedule fee--whatever it turns out to be--less $2.50 and can choose to charge patients, but not card holders and beneficiaries, a co-payment of $2.50. That is where the GP chooses to bulkbill. In the situation where there is a pay doctor cheque system, the patient is not charged directly but takes the bill to the Health Insurance Commission, which sends a cheque for 85 per cent of the schedule fee to the doctor via the patient.</PARA>
<PARA>  Under the Budget proposal, the GP would be refunded 85 per cent of the schedule fee less $3.50. From 1 November 1992, this would become 85 per cent of the schedule fee less $5.00, except for treatment of card holders and pensioners for whom the doctor would continue to receive 85 per cent of the schedule fee. There is a difference in the payment system for those doctors who bulkbill and those who are opposed to bulkbilling but who take 85 per cent of the schedule fee as full payment for their services. That accounts for the dollar efficiency payment that is involved in that payment to doctors who choose to bulkbill.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have an answer to a question from Senator Tambling with respect to the Administrator of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The honourable senator will recall that he was informed at a Senate Estimates committee hearing on 4 September 1991 that the rate of pay for the position of Administrator of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is set independently by the Remuneration Tribunal. The Tribunal increased the current rates within the Senior Executive Service band 2 classification in the Australian Public Service with effect from 1 July 1991. The district allowance, which is equivalent to APS grade D where a person is accompanied by one or more dependants, is also fixed independently by the Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In assessing the appropriate remuneration for the position the Tribunal took into account the diverse functions and responsibilities of the Administrator, including schools, the postal philatelic bureau, police, housing, environmental protection, electricity, the hospital and airfield operations. Local government functions on Commonwealth land in the Territory, such as the provision of water and sewerage, roads and waste disposal, are also part of the Administrator's responsibility. The Tribunal also took into account the considerable increase in the workload of the position of Administrator.</PARA>
<PARA>  In March this year the Prime Minister signed with the Cocos community leaders a memorandum of understanding designed to bring conditions and standards of living on Cocos up to mainland standards. The MOU will result in a comprehensive overhaul of almost every aspect of community life within a relatively short timeframe and the Administrator will be the on-islands instigator of and driving force behind the most substantial structural, social and economic changes in Cocos history.</PARA>
<PARA>  Implementation of these changes by 1 July 1992 is a task of some magnitude. In addition to ensuring the timely planning for and implementation of mainland standards, conditions and practices, the Administrator will also have an important role in ensuring that new and workable arrangements are put in place for future service provision and regulation.</PARA>
<PARA>  The remuneration received by the Cocos Administrator is commensurate with the task ahead and is now comparable to the remuneration received by the Administrator of Christmas Island. In relation to tax rates, all employees on Cocos, including the Administrator, currently pay 50 per cent of the mainland tax rate and under the phasing in process set out in the MOU, mainland taxation will apply from 1 July 1992.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>  The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that pensioners are being burdened with an increase in the cost of living and are receiving no compensation for it. Because the CPI is not specific to the spending patterns of pensioners, a decrease in the cost of living has been shown as 0.1% which therefore cuts out a rise for this September. CPI has shown a negative movement because within its basket of goods, are luxury items that have dramatically decreased in price and therefore cover the increase in basic consumer items that are relevant to the spending patterns of pensioners. Also the wage/tax deals that have occurred between the Federal Government and unions has meant that Australian workers have received an increase in their take home wage but we have seen no counterbalance occur for pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA>  Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to negotiate with the Federal Government to introduce a pension CPI measurement that takes into consideration the spending patterns of pensioners.

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1991 No. 148, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 15 August 1991. The regulations amend the administration of reasonable benefit limits.</PARA>
<PARA>New regulation 27.5 inserts nine separate Tables dealing with indexation rates using calculations based on age last birthday. Each of the Tables runs in blocks of years. All of the blocks duplicate ages included in other blocks. Thus, all blocks go 20 or less, 21 to 25, which appears correct, then 25 to 30, 30 to 35, 35 to 40, and so on, which appears incorrect as many ages appear twice. The last entries in each block are 75 to 80, 81 or more, which also appears to be correct. In the usual way of things, it would be expected that the blocks would be 26 to 30, 31 to 35, 36 to 40 and so on.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Ms Giles,</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for your letter of 16 August 1991 expressing concern at the apparent inconsistency in Regulation 27.5 of Statutory Rules No. 148 of 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>At the outset, I would explain that this regulation sets out pension valuation factors which are used to calculate the capital value of a pension which is payable for life for the purposes of the reasonable benefit limits.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree that there is an inconsistency in the new regulation in that the age ranges overlap, for example, 25 to 30, 30 to 36, 35 to 40 etc. I am advised that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the Attorney-General's Department have already discussed a possible amendment for my approval which would resolve this problem.</PARA>
<PARA>I would also point out that the pension valuation factors are used only by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to calculate the capital value of a pension. This is done by multiplying the factor by the dollar value of the pension received in the first year. That capital amount is then compared with the person's reasonable benefit limit.</PARA>
<PARA>The factors are, I am advised, used in such a way that where a person falls into two ranges, for example 30 to 35 and 35 to 40 because he or she is aged 35, the range which produces the most advantageous result for the recipient is used. In all cases this is the higher of the two ranges which provides a pension valuation factor which may be lower but cannot be higher. This is because the factors are based on life expectancy and the higher the age range, the shorter the period for which the pension is likely to be paid and hence the lower its capital value. Consequently, I can assure you that there is no financial disadvantage possible to individuals.</PARA>
<PARA>I trust that these comments and the intended amendment of this regulation allay your concerns.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Migration Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1991 No. 201, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 15 August 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>The regulations introduce what appears to be a new concept into Australian migration law. This is the "risk factor", which relates to the possibility that an applicant for a visitor's visa may overstay. The risk factor has two alternative components. The first, in r.9A(1)(a), relates to particular individuals in that it is based on whether the applicant has applied for a permanent residence visa in the last five years. However, the second alternative does not relate to the applicant himself or herself, but, as defined in new r.9A(1)(b), applies if an applicant has one or more characteristics in common with a class. These characteristics, set out in r.9A(2), include:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) nationality</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) marital status</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) age</PARA>
<PARA>  (d) sex</PARA>
<PARA>  (e) occupation</PARA>
<PARA>  (f) class of visa</PARA>
<PARA>  (g) place of application</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is concerned that broad categories such as nationality or sex are used as the basis for judging an individual. The criteria suggest that an applicant is not being judged on the basis of his or her own application, or on the basis of the applicant's personal conduct.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee asks whether this important and sensitive change in the law, effected by actions of the executive, is expressly contemplated by the parent Act. The Committee would appreciate your advice on other aspects. If there is no express justification for judging people on the grounds of nationality, marital status and sex, what is the statutory basis for this kind of regulation? Will the classes and the statistics (which the regulations require the Secretary to keep) be made public, preferably by tabling in the Parliament?  If not, the Committee would be grateful for the reasons.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee, among other things, scrutinises each instrument of delegated legislation to ensure that it does not contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment. The Committee considers that on the face of this instrument that it may breach the principles of the Committee on this ground.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would be grateful for your detailed advice.</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA>Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA  ACT</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 16 August 1991 concerning the Migration Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1991 No. 201, particularly in relation to Sub-Regulation 9A(1)(a) and (b).</PARA>
<PARA>The Government, as you will be aware, is conscious of the costs to the Australian taxpayer of the detection and enforced departure of overstayed visitors and these "risk factor" provisions of the Migration Regulations reflect that concern. Nevertheless, the provisions were inserted in the Regulations only after a great deal of careful and personal consideration by myself. In the course of this consideration numerous drafting changes were made to the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>A person or body exercising powers under the Migration Act and Regulations in relation to visit applications must be satisfied--to the degree that prudence and management constraints require--that an applicant intends to make a genuine visit to Australia. In making that determination, the decision maker must have regard to all relevant requirements of the Act and Regulations. The risk factor determined with Regulation 9A is one of the considerations to be taken into account in assessing the individual merits of an application. It is not, of itself, a determining factor.</PARA>
<PARA>The effect of the new provisions is that particular persons who share particular characteristics with a "risk" group will be subject to a more careful and detailed assessment. It is important to emphasise, however, that applicants coming within a risk profile group will not be automatically denied a visa. Visas may still be issued provided the applicant satisfies the decisionmaker that the expressed intention to only visit Australia is genuine and, where a Regulation 9A risk factor applies, that, having regard to the applicants circumstances in their country of usual residence, there is very little likelihood that they will overstay. Regulations 88, 89 and 91 to 93 are relevant in this regard. Moreover, as part of the risk factor package, fast track review processes are provided where a refused application may relate to a special family event.</PARA>
<PARA>The recent amendments should not be viewed in isolation from existing regulations. Persons applying in the Visitor classes are all required to meet the specific requirements of the class along with the applicable criteria specified in Schedule 1 of the Migration Regulations. Criteria common to each visitor visa are:</PARA>
<PARA>  assurance of support may be required;</PARA>
<PARA>  the applicant meets relevant public interest criteria;</PARA>
<PARA>  the applicant meets relevant health criteria;</PARA>
<PARA>  the applicant intends to make a genuine visit to Australia and has adequate funds for his or her support during the period of the visit, and</PARA>
<PARA>  the applicant seeks the visa in order to obtain temporary entry and does not intend to become a permanent resident of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The intention is that statistics on classes of persons who have overstayed in Australia, as specified in Regulation 9A, will be submitted to the Secretary of my Department for determination. The Secretary's determination will become a public document and will specify a group standard as a percentage against total arrivals. Statistics will be reviewed on a regular basis and, by issue of a new public determination by the Secretary, classes of overstayers may move between "high" and "low" risk categories and vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA>It is emphasised that I have not moved away from the concept of individual consideration of applications and that the risk factor is but one of the criteria to be addressed by decisionmakers. I am confident that these new provisions will provide adequate balance between the interests of individual visa applicants and the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>Should you or your committee have further queries, please contact me.</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Australian Maritime College for continuing to improve its worldwide reputation as a maritime college of outstanding quality. The college's report highlights its superb ability to provide outstanding study opportunities for those young Australians wishing to enter the industry. The best available education, training and applied research is anticipated and fulfilled as the college supplies the needs of young Australians and overseas students as its number one priority. Included as part of the report is a letter by Professor David H. Moreby, the recently retired Dean of Faculty of Maritime Studies at the Plymouth Polytechnic in the United Kingdom and currently the Visiting Fellow of the Asia Pacific Maritime Centre. This letter aptly summarises the changes occurring in the present and the possible needs of the college in the future. The Government powers that be would be wise to take note of his comments and ensure that any administrative and bureaucratic restrictions placed on the college as part of the new tertiary reform and amalgamations heed the Professor's brief comments. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I stated in my comments in previous years on college reports, there is a strong case for examining whether the services of the Australian Maritime College would be better supplied if it continued as an autonomous college. The Australian Maritime College enjoys a unique position within the educational institutions in Australia. The Australian Government should never forget this when examining the funding arrangements for our tertiary institutions. The AMC is the Australian Commonwealth Government's national centre for maritime education and training. </PARA>
<PARA>  As Professor Moreby notes, most of the well-known maritime schools throughout the world have been closed and those that have remained open find themselves with inadequate funds to re-equip or expand, especially those in the Eastern bloc. He further notes that the present shortage of officers worldwide is 50,000 and that by the year 2,000 there will be a global shortage of 200,000 officers and 60,000 ratings. A unique business opportunity exists here which the college should grasp. The Professor strongly encourages the college to take up the challenge. It is also encouraging to note the support from the ranks of the major shipping management companies, the biggest five of which may be managing 3,000 ships by the end of this century. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Maritime College is ideally situated to play a leading role in the future training of the world's seafarers, especially in terms of global shipping. The college may be geographically isolated from the rest of Australia but, according to Professor Moreby and already known to those who have an interest in the college, it is well sited globally. Modern shipping is now a global and highly competitive industry and the survival of a modern shipping industry will only occur if we think globally. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to add my voice of encouragement for the college to grasp this business opportunity of providing places of learning for the many officers and ratings who will be needed. I further urge this present Government to recognise the opportunities and encourage the college to pursue this aim. The advantages of the college are many. It is not only superbly situated but, according to Professor Moreby, it is superbly equipped with a highly professional staff, with the added advantage of working under an incorruptible examination system. A visit to the campus by any member of this chamber will verify these comments. </PARA>
<PARA>  Internally, the structure of the college's courses is also unique and reflects a necessary worldwide shipping change. All recruits--cadets and ratings--share a common first year at the college. Consequently, Australia is showing the world how to break away from the traditional, but now outdated, antisocial and costly division between officers and ratings aboard ship. </PARA>
<PARA>  More importantly, Professor Moreby has noted that the college recognises and upgrades the professionalism of all its students, a feature well worth imparting to the many future maritime students. Not only would the college itself benefit from tapping into the business opportunities but so also would the economic life of the environs of Launceston. Launceston, with the northern campus of the University of Tasmania situated within its city limits, has the capacity and capability of becoming possibly the leading centre for tertiary studies Australia-wide. By pursuing the possibility of attracting further overseas students, the AMC will add positively to this. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Professor Moreby's comments that `the Australian Maritime College has within its grasp the crown of being the premier maritime college of the world'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make a few comments on the 1990-91 annual report of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I take this opportunity to highlight what appears to me to be the uncontrolled use by the ABS of outside consultants. The report for 1989-90 detailed the use of 53 outside consultancies at a total cost of $679,241. The report that is presented today lists 67 consultancies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst that is a reasonably small increase of only 14 consultants over the consultancies used last year, it is more important to note that the monetary value of that increase for the year 1990-91 is $1,500,721. This represents a massive increase in just 12 months of $821,472 or 121 per cent. One really has to ask what the reasons and the rationale behind such an increase are. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suppose it could be said--as we as politicians are told from time to time--that the increased use of consultants is directly related to the desire to reduce existing staff. In this particular case, upon examination of the annual report it seems that in the last financial year the ABS had an average staff level of 3,356, whereas the number grew to 3,489 in 1990-91. In other words, whilst the ABS employed these extra consultants and increased its consultancy rate by 121 per cent, it also increased its staff level by 133. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another matter of concern arising out of this report as far as I can see is the high number of outside consultancies which have been appointed without any kind of public tendering process or advertising. Of the 67 consultancies appointed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics during 1990-91, only three were publicly advertised. Quite frankly, I believe that is totally unacceptable. It means that during the year the Bureau saw fit to engage consultants worth $1.186m in a completely closed shop situation, without any advertising or outside tendering. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under the circumstances in which these consultancies have been given, it is virtually impossible to guarantee that the Australian taxpayer has received the best deal possible. Anyone may be of the view that those consultancies let without public advertising may have been of a minor nature. I can assure the Senate that they were not and I would like to quote one or two examples to reinforce these claims. One particular outside consultancy of $169,460 went to the National Recording Studios Group Pty Ltd; another one of $219,953 was awarded to Rainbow Software Pty Ltd; another of $100,600 went to Reark Research Pty Ltd for market research on ABS products and service; and another of $48,722 went to the Communication Research Institute of Aust Inc. as consultants on work effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems ridiculous to me that, even though there has been an increase in staff of 133, there has been a 121 per cent increase in consultancies and, most importantly, apart from three, all these in-house consultancies have been let without any public tendering system or any way in which the Parliament could query those particular tenders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Australian Bureau of Statistics provides a very high quality, independent statistical service to the Australian community. I wish to comment on a few of the issues currently facing the Bureau. First, the completeness and accuracy of the statistics produced by the Bureau must be balanced by the burden of providing data to the Bureau.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This so-called respondent burden is sometimes very heavy on small business, and this was recognised by the Beddall Committee report on small business. The 1990-91 annual report of the Australian Bureau of Statistics talks about reducing this burden, although no details are provided as to the progress, if any, in this area. I would appreciate some statement on this matter, either by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) or the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), so that we can see what progress has been made and judge for ourselves what more may need to be done. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second area is the harmonisation of the presentation of State Budgets and financial information. The Premiers Conference, which was held in May, agreed to seek the harmonisation of State financial reporting and the uniform adoption of the methodology of the Australian Bureau of Statistics in the preparation of the various State Budget documents. It is a sad commentary on this country that such harmonisation has taken over 90 years. But the Australian Democrats support this initiative and commend the States for their cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third area I wish to comment on is that of environmental statistics. The Bureau has started to collect a variety of statistics by adding additional questions to the existing questionnaires which are distributed to business and other respondents. Examples include motor vehicle usage and the purpose of the purchase of the particular size of vehicle. Details on pollution abatement control costs in manufacturing and mining will also be collected this year, and some as yet undetermined questions concerning land care, land degradation and pesticide use will be included in the agricultural census. There is a huge amount of environmental data which is needed, but the Bureau does not have the resources to collect it. Urgent action is needed to provide the additional staff necessary to collect and analyse environmental data in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  One final matter is that of our national accounts. I noted with great interest last year that the OECD agreed that our national accounts must show the environmental effects of development and, further, that any system of national accounting must involve an analysis of the capital value of the environment and any costs involved in the exploitation of those environmental assets. On page 15 of the report, we are told that a major review of environment statistics is currently under way. I ask the Government to provide the Senate with a report on the progress being made on the production of those so-called natural accounts. </PARA>
<PARA>  Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate takes note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak on the National Health and Medical Research Council's report of its 111th session from Brisbane in June 1991. In particular, I highlight the third last dot point on page 6. Under a list of things done by the executive committee in its report to the annual general meeting this year, there is a reference to the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. It is the report of the Senate Select Committee which I chaired and which was presented to this place last December. Its principal recommendation was that further examination of quality health care in this country might properly be done by asking the National Health and Medical Research Council to conduct a debate with the community, a debate in public, about what we mean by quality care and how we order our priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are aware of the importance of the community being informed, not with emotional debates about any particular case as we see sometimes on television programs but with a thoughtful understanding of just what the costs involved are, particularly in the new high-tech medical areas; for example, some $75,000 to keep a premature baby alive in a humidicrib. Does the community want to spend that $75,000 on helping that one little baby or does it want, for example, to put that $75,000 towards the immunisation of all children?</PARA>
<PARA>  We should look at the costs, whether of liver and heart-lung transplants, new technology procedures for organ replacement or other procedures. I do not think anybody begrudges the cost of microsurgery on the little baby's hand over the weekend, which took plastic surgeons--I do not know how many--12 hours. The cost of that must have been huge. Everybody is delighted that there is even a prospect that that child--I think it was a little boy--will keep his hand. But the cost of that to the community has to be considered. I do not think anyone would begrudge it. We all say, `If it were my child I hope that we could meet the cost', but somewhere along the line the community needs to know the cost. It needs to be asked to make decisions. It needs to know whether that dollar outlay contributes to the quality of health care. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have recently seen a fairly significant return to the public agenda of Medicare. I was very disappointed to read in the Weekend Australian an article by a journalist--I think a Mr Lynch whose first name I cannot reliably remember--who seemed to suggest things about Medicare. I certainly want to dispute these with him, and I will do that this week. </PARA>
<PARA>  First, it was said that anybody who wants to go to a public hospital cannot; that they are being filled by private patients; and that there is a huge increase in waiting lists in the public sector and yet there are unused beds in the private sector. These comments simply betray a failure to know the facts and a failure to understand the real issues in health care. For the record, over about the last three years the waiting lists have dropped from 100,000 to 70,000. They are agreed figures. Rubbery and all as those figures are, one admits that there has been a significant drop in the waiting lists for admission to public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, the article suggests that many of those procedures cannot be done in the surplus beds in the private system, and that the private system is busy trying to remove some of those surplus beds. They are not just there waiting to be occupied. They are actually surplus to demand. The private hospital sector will tell people that it is also interested in selectively getting rid of some of them. Thirdly, the article suggests the private health insurance is in a state of total disarray, teetering on the edge of crisis and that it soon will no longer exist. That is also not the fact. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Acting Deputy President, I am pleased to have the opportunity, because of your having taken the chair, to say a few words today about the Medicare debate. I urge people to try to find the facts and not run with the preferred fictions in this complex area. It will not help the health of the Australian community, it will not help the quality of medical practice if we keep arguing from falsehoods. We must get those facts right. </PARA>

<PARA>The amounts sought in this Bill for each department are detailed in Schedule 3 and total $26,693.96 million:  of this total, the Bill seeks authority for the issue of $14,650.16 million, the balance of the $12,043.8 million having already been authorised by the Supply Act (No. 1) 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>An amount of $170 million is included under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, which is the same amount as was provided in the Supply Act (No. 1) 1991-92 which this Bill, when enacted, will subsume. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 5 of the Bill provides for the Appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to enable the Minister for Finance to issue amounts for the Payment of increases in salaries and payments in the nature of salary arising out of awards, orders or determinations made under, or in accordance with, a law.

<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 2) 1991-92</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill seeks appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1991-92 totalling $7,930.1 million. Of this amount, $3,401.4 million was authorised by the Supply Act (No. 2) 1991-92:  the balance of $4,528.7 million will be authorised by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, certain advances and loans, items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital, and expenditure on new policy initiatives for which legislation has not been approved previously. Provision is also made for grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>An amount of $140 million is included under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, which is the same amount as was provided in the Supply Act (No. 2) 1991-92. </PARA>

<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1991-92</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to appropriate monies of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the operating expenses and capital expenditures of the Parliamentary Departments for the year ending 30 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>The total amount sought is $119.954 million. Of this amount, $51.587 million was authorised by the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1991-92;  the balance of $68.367 million is being sought in this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to give an explanation. It is proposed that when Senate committee reports come before the Senate the time limit for debate will be 30 minutes and no senator shall be allowed to speak for more than five minutes. I understand that the reason for this is to enable us to move on to other business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If a report is of sufficient importance, it may very well be debated on another day. The first thing that leaps to mind is what one does with the very controversial reports that are sometimes tabled in the Senate. My mind goes back to the committees I was involved with which inquired into the conduct of a judge and television equalisation and the committee which looked at drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has been put to me privately that the Whips would enter into an arrangement to extend the time for debate on such a report. Honourable senators would be able only to touch upon such reports if five minutes were afforded to each speaker and a total of 30 minutes were allowed for debate. Because some matters are so controversial and of such public interest, views have to be expressed when a report is presented. The problem is that, if senators who serve on such committees are not given adequate time to speak in the Senate, they may have to conduct press conferences of some sort in order to express their views. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am a parliamentarian and I happen to believe in the Parliament and, in particular, the Senate. It is my view that the first responsibility of senators is to report to the Senate, not the Press Gallery. So it is my view that time for adequate debate ought to be given, especially in respect of those sorts of reports. One might say that in that event the Whips would agree to a longer debate. But, of course, a very subjective judgment has to be made in this respect. While senators who serve on the committee concerned may consider that a report warrants longer debate, others--the Whips and the party leaders--may think that it does not. So, while I understand the nature and purpose of the proposal, I have great difficulty in agreeing in the initial stages that we ought to go about it in the reverse way--in other words, that we ought to limit our debate to only 30 minutes all of the time, except when we make exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA>  My view is that honourable senators have in fact behaved very well in regard to committee reports. Very frequently, senators have limited debate to five minutes per senator who wishes to speak and to 30 or perhaps 45 minutes for the debate. I think that is the way to go rather than to apply limitations in the way proposed. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the recommendation had been more generous--perhaps limiting debate to 10, 12 or 15 minutes per person with no gross time limit of 30 minutes--I might have given it more serious consideration. But the proposal to squeeze the debating time to 30 minutes with not more than five minutes per speaker seems to me to be wrong and, therefore, I have to oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Senate has always been of the view that its committees are a vital part of its procedures. We are very proud of our committee work. It seems to me that we would be derogating from the value of that work if we were to limit the time for debate in such a way. Some of the reports which committees are currently considering will clearly be of major interest to all senators. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not only is the written report important but also the oral report which senators make to the Senate is of great importance. In particular, the oral report is of great value to those senators who have strictly obeyed the Standing Orders throughout a committee's inquiry. It has been my experience that when committees are inquiring into major controversial matters some senators, their staff or someone else who is involved in some way or another seem to communicate certain aspects of the inquiry to the media. </PARA>
<PARA>  We know that that is contrary to Standing Orders but it happens frequently. As a result, the media can develop a slanted view of the nature of a report. Those senators who adhere strictly to the Standing Orders can be put in a position where they feel frustrated because they want to say to the media, `You are wrong. That is not the way I see the evidence and it is not the way we see the evidence on our side'. But because they have obeyed the Standing Orders they do not get a chance to say this until the report comes down. Then, for the first time, they have the opportunity to say publicly what they want to say. That is why I say that this proposal is far too restrictive. </PARA>
<PARA>  The minority report of a report put down recently was not mentioned in the media in any way. This minority report was printed at the back of the report of the committee concerned. The journalists had read only the recommendations in the front, which did not include any reference to the minority report. So it was really of great importance, in that case, that there was proper debate within the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>  I say to the people who have recommended shortening the time for Senate debate on reports that they are going about it in the wrong way. It is far better to have the Whips limit the debate by arrangement rather than have them going about it the other way and extending the time for debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to make a contribution to the discussion on this matter, as I had something to do with it getting this far--a fact that might put Senator Lewis off the proposal altogether. The purpose of the proposal is to give greater prominence to committee reports. At the moment, committee reports are tabled after a whole lot of other procedures have been dealt with--after Question Time, after any matter of public importance or urgency motion, after 30 minutes of discussing Government documents and after any stoushes that may occur. Often, a committee which has spent weeks, months and maybe years compiling a major report ends up tabling its report at 6.30 or 7 o'clock in the evening. Its efforts to get any recognition at all are totally frustrated because of the hour and the pressures on the Chair to incorporate the tabling statement in Hansard. By then it is too late to organise any sort of press coverage. So all of those months and years of work can disappear with no notice being taken of the report at all. The basic proposal is that committee reports be able to be tabled in the morning on Wednesdays and Thursdays before government business takes over the rest of the period.</PARA></TALK.START>

For there to be a tabling of committee reports in the mornings so that a committee can confidently organise a press conference for the chair, the whole committee or whatever, and for there to be due recognition of the committee's work, there needs to be some acknowledgment that that process cannot always be open-ended; otherwise the whole morning might be taken up with committee reports without any opportunity for other business.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Not just the chair; anybody can speak to the media about it. As honourable senators know, we are limited in that until the report is tabled. This proposal actually came to life because of an unfortunate episode concerning the tabling of a committee report--it was expected that the report would be tabled late in the afternoon on a particular day--when remarks were made to the media by a member of the committee. As it turned out, because of some delay in the proceedings of the Senate, the tabling of the report was not reached on that day; it was not tabled until the next day or maybe some days after that and, therefore, an issue of privilege arose.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I will not adopt Senator Crichton-Browne's portrayal of the matter. Yes, the senator concerned should not have spoken to the media before the report was actually tabled, but it was legitimately expected that it was going to be tabled. Of course, when there are deadlines concerned, people can be tempted, as on that occasion, into making assumptions about a report being tabled. This is a proposal not to downgrade committee reports but to upgrade them so that there is an agreed right to have committee reports tabled in the mornings, which would then allow the rest of the day for any media coverage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On the issue of the limits of five minutes for each speaker and 30 minutes for the debate, those proposals are a necessary compromise. I agree that five minutes is a relatively short time but more often than not when a report is tabled, unless it is a really substantial report, the committee chair incorporates the tabling statement in Hansard, so no time is taken at all. This proposal for five minutes is to allow a basic statement to be made by each member of the committee--acknowledging the situation where minority positions are being taken--highlighting the contents of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable senators need to remember that we are not talking about debate on the report. That comes later because at that time nobody except the committee has seen the report. The substance of the report--whether the majority report or any minority report--is in the document and anybody who wants the whole argument ought to read the document. The time limit of five minutes was proposed to allow each member of the committee to state the basic outline of his or her position on the report, to highlight it and to attract interest in the report from other senators, the media and the public. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we do not adopt this, we will effectively go back to the situation of having the right to speak for 30 minutes, but maybe well into the evening, if all those other processes have taken place. This is an attempt not to downgrade committee reports and the work of committees but to provide an opportunity for the reports to be tabled early in the day, for basic outlines of the position to be given to the Senate, so that the Senate is the first to hear what is in the reports and then to have the matter debated on the following Wednesday in accordance with the procedures. I ask those opposite not to represent this proposal as something that is contrary to the interests of Senate committees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am very concerned about the time limit. I am not quite sure how the Procedure Committee could possibly adopt a limit of five minutes for each speech with a total of 30 minutes for the debate. A committee I am on has eight members. How do we resolve who speaks and who is excluded from that 30 minutes? We perhaps could have Senator Lees of the Australian Democrats completely excluded from putting her minority report view. The whole thing is too ridiculous for words.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Committees have sometimes spent a couple of years putting forward a report. I have been on a couple of those committees where the report has been very extensive, complicated and lengthy. It is no use Senator Coates saying that the first debate is not the full debate. Of course the first debate is the prominent one. Senator Coates has admitted that it is. Senator Coates is saying that the prominent debate is where the media can get the opportunity to have a full overview of the report. For Senator Coates to say that it is not the full debate and that we come to that stage later is a lot of rubbish. Firstly, we have to have more than five minutes and, secondly, the 30-minute total is just too ridiculous for words. As I have said, if there is one Democrat--as there is on one of the committees of which I am a member--he or she might be excluded altogether. The injustice of that would be extraordinary. To say that someone has five minutes to speak and to have a 30-minute full debate on a report that has taken two years to compile is ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Lewis has said very clearly that there has been general agreement that we have a short debate on a report, particularly if the committee reference has not been complicated and the committee has not gone into great detail.

<PARA>  As I came out of my room to attend this debate, I had time to bring with me a copy of one report to which I made a modest contribution. Indeed, Mr Acting Deputy President, you made a more significant contribution because you were the Deputy Chairman of that Committee and I was but a humble member. The report to which I refer and which I have in my hand runs to over 700 pages and covers about two years' work. I remember that on countless occasions I was required to spend seven hours on aeroplanes flying from Perth to Canberra to participate in those contemplations and deliberations. At the end of that endurance test, at the end of the day, senators having contributed to the report an enormous amount of energy, time, effort and intellectual stimulation, we are now told that it is proposed that each participant, if he or she is lucky, will have five minutes to speak on the deliberations, the content of the report and the determinations. </PARA>

We are told that the special hidden agenda is to allow the chairman of the committee to give a press conference, and, in view of the deadlines, the report would have to be tabled in the morning so that the chairman could salivate on his remarks next day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I would have thought that the primary responsibility of members of a committee was to report to the Parliament; otherwise why bother? Apart from the question of libel or defamation, why not publish it to the community as a whole? Why bother to report back to the Parliament? We are now told that it is simply a mechanism to get the thing out and get it to the media. I find that profoundly obnoxious. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my view it significantly downgrades and devalues the work and endeavours of these committees, which sometimes stretch over two years. The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, for instance, has an international reputation for bipartisan quality and endeavour. Those reports will be devalued by simply being dropped in the Senate. Any reader of Hansard with an interest in the circumstances which led to the deliberations and ultimately to the findings in the report, either the minority or the majority report, will find a barrenness throughout the Hansard. It seems to me, as best I can tell from listening to the inadequacy of the debate from the other side, that this is simply about getting the chairman into a press conference beforehand. No intellectual argument has been put forward to give substance to the proposal to reduce such debate to five minutes. </PARA>
<PARA>  With reports of this nature it would be quite impossible to say in five minutes anything of substance which could be sensibly interpreted later. I argue that the present process should prevail, that is, that each person be entitled to speak for 30 minutes. I have heard you, Mr Acting Deputy President, speak for 30 minutes on reports. When one has been living with a report for some time, it is important that the nuances, the circumstances and the matters that are not contained in the written word should be put into Hansard, not only to buttress but to supplement and add to the substance of the report. I find it absurd that again we are being asked to speak for only five minutes in an attempt to gag sensible and intelligent deliberation in this chamber. </PARA>

But the situation, as I was advised when we first dealt with this matter in the Procedure Committee and as has been confirmed subsequently, is not that we are here reducing to five minutes a right to a half-hour debate. We are introducing a right where no right exists. At present reports when tabled can be debated only by leave. Without leave they cannot be debated at all. Then the debate comes when it properly should come, which is when other senators have had a chance to look at the matter, and the Senate has a full debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  At the moment we have no right; we have an opportunity to exercise by agreement a more comprehensive debate. We have here a proposal that there is a basic right which can as easily be extended by leave as is the case in the existing situation, where there is no right. Those opposite are operating on a false premise. There was no agenda in the Procedure Committee for the Government to seek to limit debate. This was a unanimous decision of the Procedure Committee. The conclusion, arrived at after some consideration, was that what we were doing was enhancing the situation for senators, not in any way restricting it, and in particular protecting the rights of the dissentients. By introducing the total time limit and the individual time limit for each senator so that a minimum of six would have an opportunity to speak, those in the minority cannot be excluded from taking part of that time.</PARA>
<PARA>  The rationale for the two part recommendation is an overall time limit subdivided in such a way that any dissentient cannot be silenced by the ganging up of the majority, the Chair or somebody else to use up all the time. That is the rationale. The proposal is a conscious attempt to put in a right where no right exists and to ensure that that right cannot be abused by majorities to suppress the rights of minorities to make their initial opening remarks when they are tabling very comprehensive documents which, in the main, speak for themselves but about which people want to highlight the principal points and make some introductory remarks prior to their subsequent full speeches when the debates come before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, that is right and that is how they will get it in future. As I say, I do not want this to be the cause of any controversy because it was the unanimous intention of the Procedure Committee that this should enhance the rights of honourable senators and protect that minimum position. I want to make sure that we do not portray this debate as the Government somehow putting forward a proposal to stop the Opposition and others speaking. It was agreed on all sides because we all wanted to achieve the same objective. The recommendations put to us indicated that that was appropriate. I make it clear, as does the motion, that this was intended only as a trial for the remainder of this session--that is, it lasts until the end of 1991. The motion is explicit with regard to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If it is going to be a major cause of controversy, I will not have a division or anything like that over it because it is not worth that to me. It is simply an attempt to enhance the procedures of the Senate, not to limit them. I make this offer in advance: let us try it for the rest of this year with the assurance that if any major report needs greater debate it will be facilitated, as it would have been in the past. If, during the remainder of 1991, we find it is inadequate either because we do not need the motion at all or because the terms of the motion are inappropriate, by its very nature it will have to go back to the Procedure Committee because it expires at the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  I ask the Senate to accept that the unanimous decision of the Committee was taken to enhance the rights of honourable senators, not to limit them. There may be problems that none of us foresaw, although nothing I have heard until now persuades me that it will not work as intended. I accept the bona fides of the concerns of the people who raise it. They also want to protect the rights of honourable senators, and protect the status of their Committee reports and ensure that they can properly be debated. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most appropriate procedure, given that we have come forward with this unanimous report, is that we carry the motion, try it until the end of the year and, if it does not work, it will go back to the Procedure Committee for further consideration. I am happy to give those opposite a bit more time to consider this because I do not want to force it to a division. It is not my intention to be in any way disruptive about it. I would hope that we can get an agreement to try it until the end of this year, at which stage it will come back to the Senate--and I do not need to give an undertaking that it will because the resolution, by its very nature, will expire. I have no desire to railroad this through, even if I could. All I want to do is put the unanimous proposal of the Procedure Committee to the Senate in the spirit in which it was intended, ask honourable senators to give it the trial for which it was intended and let us examine the outcome at that stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--I understand the point that Senator McMullan is making. I say to members of the Procedure Committee that from time to time they go down the wrong path. I understand that they might even do it unanimously, but from time to time it does happen that a Senate committee has gone down the wrong path. I can give a very good example in relation to metrication. A committee unanimously recommended that this country metricate at an enormous cost to the economy--approximately $2,000 billion--for no reason at all, so that we now travel in kilometres instead of miles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want to ask Senator McMullan--if we are considering amending the motion--to consider the proposition that every speaker be granted a time rather than have a limited number of speakers for up to 30 minutes. If every member of the Committee were able to speak, debate would be limited to a maximum of 40 minutes on the five-minute proposal anyway. The first proposition was that every member of the Committee be entitled to speak. Time after time, senators have had the opportunity to find out how much or how little they can fit into five minutes because we do that with regard to reports. That time limit is so brief that I put it to Senator McMullan that there should not be less than eight minutes, even at that early stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The three allied Bills that we are debating, namely, the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1991-92, the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1991-92 and the Appropriation Bill No. 2 1991-92, constitute what is commonly known as the Budget Bills. These Bills are being brought down at a time when the Government is in the midst of the largest budgetary deterioration since at least the early 1950s, and arguably in our whole history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Over a period of two short years there has been a deterioration in the Budget outcome of almost $13 billion. It has gone from a surplus of $8 billion in 1989-90 to an expected deficit of $4.7 billion in the current year. In fact, after taking into account the important transactions that are commonly described as `below the line', and which therefore do not appear in the Budget but which all have the same impact on the economy, the effect of the public sector on economic activity is much worse than the headline `Budget deficit $4.7 billion' suggests. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we adjust for asset sales, the transfer of maturing debts to the States, net payments from government business enterprises, superannuation and profit transfers from the Reserve Bank and the Commonwealth Bank, the underlying Budget deficit in 1991-92 is about $10.7 billion, not the $4.7 billion shown in the Budget. Compared with an underlying Budget surplus, on a similar basis of calculation, in 1989-90 of $6.4 billion, on that measurement there has been an overall fiscal deterioration over the past two years alone of some $17 billion. As I said earlier, that is probably unprecedented in Australian history; if not, it is certainly unprecedented for many, many decades. </PARA>
<PARA>  At a time when Australia is crying out for national leadership and budgetary leadership through the Budget and in other ways, all that the Government members can do is fight amongst themselves over who should lead the tattered remains of the tattered Australian Labor Party. At a time when every effort should be put into establishing the right climate for investment and jobs on a sustainable basis, this Budget is reduced to an exercise in protecting one job and one job alone, that is, the job of the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA>  Given the long term damage to the lives of millions of average Australians which the Government has caused, it is difficult to comprehend how a Party which calls itself the Labor Party and which once had a reputation--now nothing more than a distant memory--for concern for the well-being of working people could become such an instrument of destruction. That is an irony which must be profoundly depressing to philosophers of the labour movement. That does not seem to concern members of this Government. For one reason, they are not philosophers. For another, their focus is on preserving political power and their own privileges, not on the well-being of average Australians. That is the only reason one could give as an explanation for why they have so callously thrown one million people out of work. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, this Budget has been brought down at a time when Australia is in the deepest recession that it has been in for 60 years. It is a Budget which should have been about growth and could have been about growth. It should have been and could have been about job creation and the alleviation of the misery and hardship incurred by the people of Australia over the last eight years of the Hawke-Keating Government. It should have been about jobs, jobs and more jobs. Instead, this Budget is about fewer jobs, more unemployment and more hardship for all Australians. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As my friend Senator Kemp said, and as I remarked earlier, this Budget is all about the preservation of one job; that is, the job of the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. The tragedy of this Budget is that it fails to do anything about the underlying causes of our problems. In fact, the Budget was dead in the water within hours of its release. The unravelling process has already started in just a few weeks since the Budget. A classic example and the most recent is the $70m deterioration in the Budget position--a further $70m that will be added to the Budget deficit this year as a result of the Government's failure to exert sufficient leadership to make the Medicare changes that were announced in the Budget stick. The Government has had to come to a very tacky compromise with its backbench on the Medicare proposal. As a result, the public purse will lose $70m this year--a year when the Budget deficit is, in any event, far too large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Budget forecasts an increase in unemployment from a figure of around 10 per cent to a figure that will peak--according to the Government--at 10.75 per cent and which, for a year as a whole, will average 10.5 per cent. There are a couple of points to be made about that. Everyone knows that those figures are underestimates of the real level of unemployment in this country because, taking all factors into consideration, the number of unemployed in Australia today is well in excess of one million people. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget forecasts include provision for an estimate of an average level of unemployment benefit recipients this year of 775,000 persons per month. The average level of recipients in the first three months of this year has been only 710,000. So the Budget is proposing--and the Budget forecasts contain--a further enormous increase to well over a peak of 775,000 in unemployment benefit recipients in the course of this year, in the months ahead. What is the situation? We have the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and other senior Ministers telling us that the employment outlook will improve in the second half of 1991-92. The Budget figures belie that. The Government's own Budget figures indicate a further substantial increase in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since the Budget, and for months preceding it, in terms of government in this country we have seen nothing but division, leadership squabbles and leadership tensions and battles. That has absolutely obliterated from the public's mind any approach to rational economic policy, or any other policy, or any concern at all for the needs and sufferings of so many millions of Australians, as we have today. We have a bitterly divided Government. It is bitterly divided on the question of the leadership. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this chamber alone, of the six most senior Government Ministers, three of them--Senator Gareth Evans, Senator Robert Ray and Senator Tate--supported the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in the leadership battle. Another three Ministers, including the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, along with the numbers man, Senator Richardson--who used to be Prime Minister Hawke's numbers man--and Senator Cook, are supporting Paul Keating. So members of the Ministry are deeply divided as to who they think should be their leader, and that is reflecting indecision and divisiveness right across the board of policy making. The same applies to the subject of interest rates: we never know where Senator Button is on this issue, but people such as Mr Dawkins are advocating cuts in interest rates whereas the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are saying they do not want cuts. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a division in terms of tax policy. Only in the past few days there was the extraordinary spectacle of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, who is also the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, implying that the business tax environment in this country is not competitive. Yet in Bangkok over the weekend the Treasurer said, `Yes, it is'.</PARA>
<PARA>  We have another deep division in the whole area of resources policy. In recent days the Medicare backflips, sideflips and every other sort of flip have shown that the Government is deeply divided on the health policy. As a whole, industry policy is in an awful mess. There are enormous gulfs between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, and other Ministers on environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have another extraordinary situation in the division in the Government ranks on media policy and the almost incomprehensible statement yesterday on television by Senator Button again that he abstained from voting in Cabinet last week on the question of the rules concerning media ownership because he did not believe that Ministers had been bound by a Cabinet decision. How on earth can the third most senior Minister in this country, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, say that he did not believe that Ministers were bound by a Cabinet decision? It is just another example of the tensions and the divisions that exist within the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The list goes on in policy areas. The whole approach to the jobs policy is also a dreadful shambles. Government Ministers are deeply divided on that. On one hand we have the interventionists and on the other we have those who subscribe to a more free market approach, and we have a great shifting mass in the middle. No-one inside or outside of government knows just where the Government is heading on that. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have deep divisions in the area of Commonwealth-State relations. The Prime Minister ostensibly wants to go down the route of a more rational division of Commonwealth, State and local government functions, with the Commonwealth Government getting out of some of its present areas of functioning and responsibility. Important senior Ministers such as Senator Richardson say, `No, we have to stick to the old centralist mode that we have had for so many years under this Government'.  So, again, in a key area of potential micro-economic reform--indeed, arguably the most important area of micro-economic reform facing us over the next decade--the Government is deeply divided. </PARA>
<PARA>  No wonder there is universal criticism within the business community of the policies of the Government. There is great confusion within the business community about the policy-making processes and decisions. There is great confusion because of the conflicting signals given by many Ministers--for example, by the Treasurer on interest rates.   We have senior Ministers--Senator Button is perhaps the classic example, but he is not the only one--shooting their mouths off on policy issues and adding to the confusion. Last but not least, the business community is bitterly critical of the Government for the Government's failure to comprehend the seriousness and the desperation of the present situation confronting both business and individuals and its abject failure to come up with any appropriate policy responses. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition will not, of course, be opposing the Budget Bills--the Appropriation Bills. However, for the reasons I have outlined, on behalf of the Opposition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA>  At end of motion, add ",but the Senate condemns the Government for:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a)  its economic mismanagement and fiscal irresponsibility revealed in the Budget;</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  engineering the worst economic recession for 60 years;</PARA>
<PARA>  (c)  knowingly putting over one million people out of work;</PARA>
<PARA>  (d)  failing to implement necessary infrastructure reforms;</PARA>
<PARA>  (e)  imposing major obstacles to resource development;</PARA>
<PARA>  (f)  failing to provide a climate for increased national savings, investment, growth and jobs; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (g)  its continual divisions and leadership struggles resulting in no leadership, no example, and no hope to the people of Australia". </PARA>
<PARA>There are many things that can be done to correct the present situation. It should not be a situation of despair. We have a problem in Australia which has been engineered, created, by bad policy making. Anything that is caused by bad policy making can be corrected by proper policy making. But we have to get on with the task of adopting that proper approach to policy making. We have to set ourselves goals and targets to achieve the restoration of growth and activity and, most particularly of all, the creation of jobs in our community. At the end of the day, jobs determine how people live; the opportunities that are available; the esteem and confidence that individuals feel; and the comfort that families, the basic unit in our society, have. A necessary precondition to all of this is the ability of a nation to provide work for its people. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are many things that we can and must do to make a start on getting back to that situation. It was not all that  long ago--only a couple of decades--that kids leaving school knew that there was every probability, every certainty, that they would be able to get a job, that they would be able to make their way in the world. Today young people leaving school are almost in a state of despair. They are asking, `Where are the jobs that we need?'. There is no reason for that. This is one of the great tragedies that have occurred in Australia in the past 10 years and more, and it has to be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the things we have to do--this is an essential starting point--is to make a genuine commitment to price stability. This Government has shillyshallied over the question of whether inflation is a priority problem. The Government has lacked the confidence; it has lacked leadership; it has created confusion over that fundamental question right through its period in office. That whole question is now on the boil again as a result of the destabilising actions of the former Treasurer, Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said before, we need to address the whole area of Commonwealth-State financial relations. We need to rebuild the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. We need to take important steps along the road of reducing the level of industry protection in Australia, but only in association with tackling the real problems that required protection in the first place, namely, the cost disadvantages under which industry has had to operate in this country for far too long. </PARA>
<PARA>  We must seriously tackle the whole question of labour market reform. We have to put unions and employees on the same legal footing as employers so that, if necessary, they can take action against each. We have to ensure voluntary unionism and we have to pave the way legally for enterprise-based unions. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have to reform and restructure the Australian tax system. We need to put in place a broad-based goods and services tax as part of an essential overall package which includes the abolition of the inequitable, discriminatory and very costly wholesale sales tax that now exists. We have to put it in place with significant reductions in personal income tax rates, particularly for those middle income earners who have been so bludgeoned by the tax system in recent times. And we have to do it in terms of many other wider parts of the package. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have to tackle seriously the question of infrastructure reform. Unless we reduce the cost disadvantages to those vital infrastructure industries--whether they be on the waterfront, in shipping, land transport, air transport, power generation, telecommunications or whatever--they will feed into the costs of tradeable goods, of marketable products, and therefore reduce our international competitiveness. As an overriding priority, we must aim to lower the costs in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to cut government spending--not just rationalise the distribution of it between the Commonwealth and the States but genuinely target spending to those who are most in need. Through all of that, we have to encourage more self-reliance as well as eliminating duplication between different levels of government. We have to take a full-blooded approach to privatisation of government business enterprises and not just the waffled and very small beer approach which the Government has taken. We have to put the privatisation of government business enterprises very high up in the order of priorities, thus increasing the competition to which those enterprises are subjected. The coalition has identified a program of nearly $100 billion worth of public sector enterprises which could be privatised. The commencement of that privatisation program will be a very important part of the incoming coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to streamline development applications. At the moment, major resource and other developmental projects are either stalled or massively delayed--with great cost impediments--by the improper processes of government regulation and stultification. Within the overall time span, we need to look at the question of wanting a larger population in Australia and welcoming a continuation of the positive immigration program over the years. At the moment, given the depth of the recession, there is a lower immigration intake because fewer people want to come here. We also have to recognise that, in the middle of the recession and with our massive debt problems, our capacity to absorb immigrants is at the moment constrained. That needs to be a matter for mature consideration by this Parliament and by the major parties. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, if we are to make ourselves more competitive in an increasingly internationally competitive world, we have to do more to improve our international relations. Without any exaggeration, foreign policy in this country is a mess because it is being run on the basis of emotion and grandstanding. There are numerous examples of that. That is not going to do our ability to compete more and to be seen more favourably in the international climate and economic environment any good at all. </PARA>
<PARA>  They are some of the things that need to be done. None of them have been addressed by this Government either in the Budget or in any of its surrounding and accompanying policy non-decisions. All we have had is a litany of mismanagement on the part of this Government which has cost Australia, and more particularly Australians, very dearly. I can do no better than to end with a quote from the Treasurer, who said in a speech to the Irish-Australian Chamber of Commerce just a few weeks ago:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the most effective anti-poverty policy ever implemented has been sustained economic growth. It has brought increased social justice to hundreds of millions of people on our planet. </PARA>
<PARA>The one thing that I cannot understand, that the coalition cannot understand and that no Australian can understand is why on earth this Government seems so bent on acting totally contrary to that very laudable objective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This afternoon we are debating Appropriation Bill (No. 1), Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1991-92 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill for the same year. Together, these constitute the Federal Government's Budget for the current financial year. The balance of payments current account in our overseas trading accounts has been and is the key focus of Government economic policy. Historically, the balance of payments has been the No. 1 constraint on economic growth in Australia. That is the historical lesson of Australia. The balance of payments has been the major limiter of our ability to create jobs in Australia in the medium and long term. To be able to create jobs, we have to be able to keep our balance of payments on the overseas transactions in some sort of check.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government's policy in recent years has been to attempt to stabilise the position in the balance of payments and also to stabilise Australia's external debt levels in relation to our gross domestic product or the size of our national economy. There have been some important policy relaxations in recent times by the Government as it has responded to changing economic circumstances in the nation. I refer to January last year when the official cash interest rates were 18 per cent and the Government proposed to reduce those cash rates by one percentage point. At that time we had the spectacle of Dr Hewson, on behalf of the Opposition, saying that any reduction in interest rates at the time would be short-lived and that it would not be sustainable for the Government to reduce those official cash interest rates. We had Dr Hewson saying that the lower rates would be short-lived but, more recently, on 22 August, Senator Hill, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, making his Budget reply in this place, exhorted the Government to reduce interest rates more quickly. One has only to look at the Hansard of 22 August to see that there was a massive contradiction between Dr Hewson saying in January last year that any reduction in interest rates would not be sustainable--he is on the record as saying that--and Senator Hill saying more recently that the Government should be going faster to reduce interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  Once again, we have caught out these people. Those opposite are not competent at running the economy; they are not competent economic managers. Here, in one very simple example, we have been able to document a total contradiction in policy. On the one hand, we have Dr Hewson saying that interest rates cannot be reduced because it is not sustainable and, on the other hand, we have Senator Hill in this place on 22 August saying that we should lower them faster. They cannot sort out their position on economic matters and economic policy. They are just not competent to run the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Hawke Government has relaxed its fiscal policy, its revenue policies, in the Budget, which includes income tax cuts. The Government also brought down the March industry statement to help restructure the Australian economy. Some very important policy relaxations have occurred. Last year, the Budget outcome for the financial year just ended was a surplus of $1,800m--the fourth surplus in a row. I remind the Senate that this Government has brought down four Budget surpluses in a row--a record which those on the other side can only dream about. </PARA>
<PARA>  Looking at the current Budget, I would like first to examine the economic indicators, the current context for the Budget being brought down. As I pointed out, the focus of policy was the current account deficit in the balance of payments. In 1989-90, the deficit was some $22,000m, but in the year just ended, at 30 June, that current account deficit was reduced to $15,000m--a big reduction. The total deficit was equivalent to 4 per cent of our gross domestic product or national income. That was down significantly, despite all the rhetoric of the other side in this place and despite all the rhetoric in the community from conservatives. The balance of payments deficit for the last financial year was 4 per cent of our gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the last year the Liberals were in power--that is, in 1981-82--the balance of payments current account deficit was almost 6 per cent of our gross domestic product. We are actually succeeding in closing the gap on the balance of payments. Last year there was a 13 per cent rise in the volume of exports, which is a massive increase in anybody's terms, whereas the volume of imports was down 3 per cent. So there was a closing of the gap on both sides. Economic policy is clearly working to close the balance of payments deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>  I point out that the volume of exports does not have any direct link to the state of the Australian economy. There is a 13 per cent rise in the volume of exports at the present time. I think the jewel in the crown has been the success of this Government in getting price rises down and cleansing inflation from the Australian system. I know, Madam Acting Deputy President, you have been actively interested in this subject through surveys and so forth of prices in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reality is that, in the 12 months to June this year, the consumer price index was 3.4 per cent in the Australian community. This is a tremendously low figure by the standards of those opposite who left government with 11 1/2 per cent inflation. Inflation is now at 3.4 per cent. Of course, a key contributor to that low rate has been falls in interest rates. We now have--and have had for a couple of years--interest rates as part of the base for measuring the consumer price index. Every time interest rates come down, that in turn helps to bring down the consumer price index. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-So we have envy and jealousy from those on the other side of the chamber who could never deliver such low inflation. Every time interest rates come down the CPI comes down. I remind them that, since the last consumer price index was released, there has been a one per cent reduction in interest rates. So let us have a look and see what happens when the next index is released at the end of this month. The important thing is that Australia is becoming more competitive. Our inflation rate is now very favourable compared with that of our trading partners. Recently, I saw that our trading partners had an average inflation rate of some 4.3 per cent, compared with our rate of 3.4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I refer to Dr Hewson again--the man who makes so many predictions which have proven so wrong so often. I refer to a press release issued by Dr Hewson in June last year when he actually attacked our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) by saying that the Prime Minister was wrong to say that inflation in Australia would reach 6 per cent by June this year. Dr Hewson said that. Of course, Dr Hewson was clearly wrong again. In the Melbourne Age on 22 December last year, Dr Hewson went public and said that inflation was clearly stuck between 7 and 8 per cent in Australia. He said that on the record in black and white in the Melbourne Age. But, of course, that was before we brought it down to 3.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the international scene, Germany is a country which historically has focused on low inflation. For decades the German Government has focused policy on getting low inflation outcomes. The reality is that Australia's price rises are now on a par with those of Germany. This is a great achievement which helps make Australian industry more competitive. Relatively low inflation effectively has a similar impact to a currency devaluation in helping exports by making them more cost effective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We have these inane comments from the other side of the chamber. Senator Panizza is somehow suggesting that our lower inflation rate has something to do with current economic conditions. I just pointed out to him a while ago that interest rates are now part of the base for the consumer price index. Every time interest rates come down, there is a mechanism built in for bringing down inflation further. These people on the other side of the chamber still do not understand it. They ignore the impact of deregulation in the aviation industry. In Question Time this afternoon, Senator Collins referred to the impact of deregulation on civil aviation. Air fares are part of the base for the consumer price index. Air fares have fallen. It has nothing to do with the state of the economy; it is to do with deregulation of the industry. Let us have none of this nonsense that, somehow because the Australian economy is in recession, we have inflation at 3.4 per cent. Look at the Opposition's record in 1982-83; there was double-digit unemployment and double-digit inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I referred to official cash interest rates which were 18 per cent at the beginning of last year. This Government has reduced official cash interest rates time and time again to a level, when the Budget was brought down, of 10 1/2 per cent. So there have clearly been significant reductions in interest rates which are helping to get the economic fundamentals right and helping position the economy for better medium term and longer term growth. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer to the outline of the Budget for this financial year, which we are debating this evening. The proposed deficit of $4,700m is basically not a structural deficit; it is a cyclical one reflecting the current position on the economic cycle which we are at. It is not a deficit that is built in for the longer term. It does not reflect permanent changes in policy on the expenditure side or the revenue side of the Budget which would lock the Government in for years and years with higher levels of spending. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget provides for total outlays this year to go up 2.6 per cent ahead of inflation; revenues to fall 4.1 per cent below inflation. So the net result is a deficit; the first Budget deficit in five years, as I pointed out. The four previous financial years saw Budget surpluses in Australia, which is something that the Liberals are totally envious about but could never deliver.</PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to look at a bit of the history of Budgets over the last decade to take up a claim made by Senator Short here a while ago in debating these Bills. It is very interesting that Senator Short, for example, called for cuts in government spending. He applied the tired old conservative formula: when in doubt, cut government spending. It is interesting to look at the share of government spending through the Budget as a proportion of gross domestic product over the course of the 1980s. In the last year in which the Liberals were in charge of the bringing down of a Budget, total Commonwealth government spending was, in fact, 28.8 per cent of our gross domestic product--of our national income. </PARA>
<PARA>  This year in the Budget, despite the rise in unemployment and in unemployment benefit payments, total government spending as a proportion of gross domestic product is estimated to be 25.7 per cent. That is a reduction of over three percentage points in the share of gross domestic product accounted for by government spending. Let us dispense with this nonsense that Senator Short comes in here and parrots off about--the tired old formula of cutting government spending. This Government has done it. We have got spending down from the Opposition's high levels in the early eighties to about a quarter of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would also like to refer to the revenue side of the Budget because that is very illuminating indeed. There is always rhetoric from conservative politicians that parties of the Centre and parties of the Left are somehow high tax parties. This accusation has been made against my Party time and time again. The reality is somewhat different. For example, in 1982-83 when Dr Hewson, I think, was advising the then conservative Government, taxes were 26 per cent of gross domestic product--over a quarter. In 1991-92, this financial year, total revenue in the Budget was 24 per cent. So there has been no increase. One certainly cannot sustain the claim that we, on this side, are somehow members of a high tax party when one looks at the historical record. </PARA>
<PARA>  Referring to specifics of the Budget, in nominal terms, average spending will grow by 5.7 per cent. The priority areas in terms of higher growth are law, order and public safety, with a 29 per cent increase in expenditure. General and scientific research are up 17.3 per cent--in fact, three times the average of 5.7 per cent--reflecting a government priority to inject funds into the scientific and general research area. This financial year will see stages 1 and 2 of the Government's proposal for cooperative research centres at our tertiary institutions. Some $19.5m was provided for those centres in this Budget. That is one of the first steps towards helping Australia become the clever country that it must become to help establish long term industrial viability in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Compared with the 5.7 per cent across the board growth in spending, there is a 10 per cent growth in education, showing that is also a priority area. Social security and welfare spending is up 12 per cent, partly reflecting the relaxation of income tests for the family allowance supplement and, of course, reflecting the increase in payments of unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>  I note also that in housing and community amenities there is to be a 9 per cent growth in spending. That includes the first outlays under the better cities project to help revitalise parts of our metropolitan cities, provide better urban infrastructure and renew metropolitan facilities. Certainly those areas will have above average expenditure growth in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am delighted to see in the Budget this financial year an item of $100,000, part of a $2.85m four-year program to establish an Australia-India Council. This recommendation was one of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade when it looked at our relationship with India several years ago. It recommended that a peak body, an across-the-board representative body, be established to help infuse new life into Australia's external relationship with India. I am delighted to see this money now provided in the Budget. I am sure that all members of my Committee would be delighted as well, and I would certainly like to congratulate Senator Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, for making those funds available. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget this year includes a number of important revenue measures. We have had the first round of the personal income tax cuts, which were made on 1 January. There have been two rounds of personal income tax cuts, with the lowest marginal tax rate being reduced to 20c in the dollar compared with the 30c in the dollar bottom tax rate that applied when the Liberals were in power. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget also includes significant falls in sales tax revenue. As proposed, there will be legislation to exempt more business inputs for production. More items such as raw materials and equipment used in production will be exempted from sales tax. The Government estimates that the revenue loss will be some $200m this financial year, rising to $375m next financial year. Those items to be exempted from sales tax include hand tools used in agriculture and fishing; goods used in the storage, handling and dispatch of products; goods used in pre-production; and goods used in research, development, engineering and technical design. </PARA>
<PARA>  Because this Budget will provide for a deficit, it will be taking less from the economy. There will be fewer funds going from the general economy into the Budget. Because revenue is down and expenditure will be up, as I pointed out, there will be a move from surplus to the cyclical Budget deficit that we are facing this year. A key part of that move is the impact of the so-called automatic stabilisers. They are indicators of how the Budget itself responds to changing economic activity in the economy generally. We can see that personal income tax collection will be down some $270m. Company tax collections will be down some $690m, reflecting lower private sector revenues, and there will be negative real growth in revenues. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the outlays side, I pointed out a 2.6 per cent real outlays growth in the Budget. Of that, 2.1 percentage points are accounted for by growth in outlays on unemployment benefit payments. Of course, unemployment is of great concern on this side of the chamber. We do understand the plight of those out of work and the concerns of their families. I simply point out that the increased payment in unemployment benefit will certainly help cushion the recession's impact on many Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think it is also relevant to ask what the Liberals would do at this particular point of time if they were in Government. They have talked about cutting out unemployment benefit to those who are still unemployed after nine months has elapsed. Would they in fact go ahead with this particular proposal? Would they create extra hardship for those out of work by terminating social security payments for unemployed persons after nine months? Would they cut out this important cushion against the impact of the economy?</PARA>
<PARA>  I point out that since the Budget was brought down a number of important economic indicators have been released. Despite all the doom and gloom being talked on the other side of the chamber and all the knocking of the economy by conservative politicians, a number of positive indicators have been officially released in recent times. I think it is very important to get these on the record. For example, in regard to the vitally important housing and construction sector of our economy, the most up-to-date figures just released for new housing commencements show a significant rise in the June quarter. They show that over 30,000 new dwellings were commenced in the June quarter, compared with some 29,000 in the March quarter. This is very heartening news. Certainly there has been a significant rise in bricks and mortar work in the housing sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also point to the turnover figures released last week for retail businesses. They show that for two months in a row there were strong rises in retail sales, in retail turnover. The reality is that in the 12 months to August this year there has been a 4 per cent growth in retail turnover. That compares with a consumer price index of 3.4 per cent. So, in fact, we are seeing real growth, growth ahead of inflation in retail sales now. For two months in a row, July and August, there were increased motor vehicle registrations. That is very welcome news indeed for the motor vehicle industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since the Budget was brought down, official cash interest rates have been cut yet again. I pointed out earlier that they started at 18 per cent last year; they have now been cut to 9 1/2 per cent. Those cuts in interest rates should flow on to other sectors of the economy, to other interest rates, and will help boost consumer confidence. Those cuts in interest rates have been enabled by, first, the improving balance of payments and, secondly, the dramatic improvement in Australia's inflation rate, which has been very good news indeed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I take the opportunity now of asking what the Opposition would do if it were in our shoes now? What would it do to help restore the health and vitality of the Australian economy? I notice that Mr Reith went on the record on 1 July calling for cuts in government spending. That is the type of call that was echoed here this afternoon by Senator Short. I would imagine that social security payments would be in the firing line in that particular area to give effect to these expenditure cuts. Certainly Dr Hewson is on record as talking about privatising the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA>  One thing this Government will not be bringing in is a consumption tax. We will not be bringing in a goods and services tax or a VAT, value added tax, as those opposite propose. We will not be proposing a tax on all food, all clothing and footwear, as the people opposite propose to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr McLachlan is on the record as saying that the Opposition wants zero import duty. If Mr McLachlan had his way, the Opposition--the limousine Liberals--would reduce through the tax system the price of limousines and then bring tariffs down to zero.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  At present, a motor vehicle retailing for over $45,462 is subject to a 30 per cent wholesale sales tax. Under the Liberals, under Dr Hewson, that motor vehicle would probably be taxed at a 15 per cent retail rate. Those opposite are basically proposing a Rolls Royce led recovery. They want to restore the health of the Australian economy by making luxury cars cheaper. They are the limousine Liberals. </PARA>
<PARA>  I ask in all seriousness: how on earth can making luxury cars cheaper help the Australian economy? Most luxury motor vehicles--most of the vehicles retailing for over $45,462--are imported. Those opposite are going to give a kick-start to imports of luxury motor vehicles by proposing this tax reduction from 30 per cent to 15 per cent--an incredible gesture. All we would see is a kick-start to luxury car imports. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then they go around the country parroting that somehow this new VAT they are going to bring in would get rid of paperwork. They are always rubbishing us and saying that we bring in red tape for business--they are the people who would create paperwork for small business in Australia. Senator Hill, for example, on 22 August said that a wholesale sales tax would be very complex to administer. The Liberal Party's own figures show that there would be 4,500 more tax inspectors for a VAT. Those opposite can correct me if I am wrong--I do not have access to their papers--but I understand from my sources that they admit there will be 4,500 more tax inspectors to police their new value added tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  Why replace a tax as efficiently collected as the wholesale sales tax? The reality is that the present wholesale sales tax is one of the most efficient taxes devised. It costs a mere 49 cents for every $100 collected because it is collected from a few wholesale points only. I have seen one study, by contrast, of the VAT under Mrs Thatcher and Mr Major in the UK which suggests that it costs $2 for every $100 collected in the UK. I ask Senator Baume to correct me if I am wrong, but it costs $2 for every $100 collected, yet the present wholesale sales tax costs 49 cents to collect every $100. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then we have these people trying to brainwash people in small business into believing that somehow this value added tax will be a panacea for the small business sector. Have they seen what the David Jones organisation has said? Admittedly, that is not a small business. It has already demanded that all of its accounting software changes and any required alterations to its cash register systems as a result of this crazy VAT proposal be met at government expense. David Jones knows what it means for business. </PARA>
<PARA>  What about those businesses that have to sell on credit? This value added tax means that they would pay tax on the inputs into their production, but they would not get any revenue to pay that tax until they sold the product. They would have to finance the tax until they got revenue from their customers. </PARA>
<PARA>  We will not embrace the New Zealand model. We will not rush over to New Zealand making a pilgrimage to sit at Mr Bolger's knee and find out how he did it--how he created the longest recession in OECD history. We will not do that. We certainly will not tax Australian books in the way the Liberals propose to do. All one has to do these days is look at the front cover of a magazine--the Bulletin or the Australian Women's Weekly. It is all in black and white as to how much the prices would go up. I simply refer to the back of paperbacks. Look at any paperback book published in the United Kingdom which has the Australian and New Zealand prices on the back. I have one in front of me--$9.95 in Australia, $19.99 in New Zealand `including GST' which, presumably, is the acronym for value added tax. That is the message these people want. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This afternoon I wish to raise an important matter that is crippling private enterprise in this country, and that is the mass of bureaucratic red tape and the inconsistencies that are strangling businesses in Australia. As I move around Victoria I continually come across examples of private businesses struggling to make a profit and receiving no assistance from the Hawke Government. I do not mean financial assistance--businesses are not looking for assistance in the monetary sense--but assistance in being able to compete with imports by not being tied down with masses of bureaucratic red tape.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One example I came across recently is the case of a therapeutic goods manufacturer. The company is a manufacturer of therapeutic goods for both domestic and overseas consumption. It is just what Australia needs--import replacement and exports. The only problem is that the company is being burdened by Government bureaucratic inefficiency and inconsistency. </PARA>
<PARA>  Firstly, there have been considerable delays with the company's export products by the Therapeutic Goods Administration evaluating products being added to the therapeutic goods register. A deadline has been set--which is tomorrow--whereby all therapeutic goods for export must be on the register. Given the lack of resources in the Therapeutic Goods Administration there is no way that this deadline will be met. The company is expecting that there will be considerable delays in the export area because of the new listing requirements. It was fairly obvious during my questioning in the Estimates committee hearing that the Department was not really aware of how far behind it was in these approvals. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, the manufacture of therapeutic goods for domestic and export purposes must also comply with Australian good manufacturing practice standards. As long as imports are subjected to the same testing processes the trade exchange would be fair. In January this year the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>Imported grandfathered products which have not been granted import permits within 15 months prior to the introduction of the Act will be assessed for GMP--</PARA>
<PARA>or good manufacturing practice--</PARA>
<PARA>standards within 6 months from the commencement of the Act (i.e. 15th August 1991). </PARA>
<PARA>By 15th February 1992, all imported products on the ARTG will have been checked that their GMP standard of manufacture is equivalent to that of Australian manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Minister said, but checks on the GMP standards of overseas manufacturers have, in general, not occurred. Why should Australian manufacturers have to comply with higher standards than importers have to? I know for a fact that this company is looking at the possibility of investing in plant in Australia and, because of the inconsistencies and the failure of the Government to comply with its own legislation in time, doubt has been cast on whether it is worth while making that investment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  That investment would mean jobs for Australians, jobs in Victoria--and, heaven knows, what we need in Victoria is jobs. The unemployment rate in Victoria is one of the highest in Australia, and here is a company willing, prepared and wanting to invest in Australia yet not able to have the confidence to believe that that investment will reap a benefit that is sufficient to warrant that investment. Here is an example of a company attempting to export and improve Australia's trade balance and it is having to compete with imports of goods not subject to the same rigid standards. The firm is not asking for any special type of industry assistance or for any handout. What it is asking for is to be able to compete fairly with imports. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another company that I came across recently is having a similar problem--struggling under the inconsistencies of this Government's industry policy. I have mentioned this company in the Senate before. Late last session I asked Senator Button about a firm manufacturing LPG gas cylinders in Victoria. This is not a small backyard operation. McMillans Pty Ltd is Australia's largest producer of LPG gas cylinders. In accordance with Australian standards, every portable liquid petroleum gas cylinder manufactured in Australia is subjected to rigorous individual and group inspection by means of pressure testing, radiography and random destructive testing, and materials and personnel used in fabrication must be certificated and qualified. Full type testing of all designs is also required. </PARA>
<PARA>  Cheap imports have flooded into Australia and McMillan Pty Ltd in rural Victoria has sacked 20 of its work force. Again, this is because imported goods are not required to be checked to the same level as the Australian-produced product. Imported LP gas cylinders are checked only randomly whereas all locally produced LPG cylinders are tested. This practice is jeopardising the operations of the company. The two companies in the examples I have outlined are not seeking a level playing field, to use that much abused term, in terms of income support; they are looking for a level playing field in terms of being able to compete with imports which are tested in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have given another example in the Senate of specialty cheese manufacturing in Victoria and in other States as well. These small cheese manufacturers are being obstructed in their pursuit of export markets. I will reiterate the story of one manufacturer, the manufacturer of Gippsland blue cheese. It started up in the Gippsland area. A local dairy farmer had the vision of starting up a specialty cheese factory, hoping that other people in the valley would do the same and produce other cheeses. He had the foresight to build a small area where people could have afternoon tea and, through a window, watch the cheese being made. He hoped that people would come in bus loads to visit the cheese area just as people visit the wine areas of Victoria. It was a great vision, and he started manufacturing cheeses with the help of a young local lad who had completed a cheese maker's course. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not think they ever anticipated the bureaucratic claptrap they would encounter. Every batch of cheese, if it is to be exported, has to be tested and those tests cost a significant amount of money. This may not be a factor when one is exporting large quantities of cheese but, if one is exporting small batches, the cost of the test makes the cost of a kilogram of cheese prohibitive in terms of exports. I am told by the cheese manufacturers that the testing for cheese to be sold on the Australian market is not as stringent as that required for export cheese. Here again is another example of a company, like the other two I have mentioned, involved in producing what could be import replacement products which also have the potential for export. But those companies are not exporting. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can tell the Senate about Timboon cheese, which comes from the other side of Victoria. I visited this area and found exactly the same problems as exist with Gippsland blue cheese. The manufacturers of Timboon cheese pride themselves on not using chemicals in any of its production. They grow the crops for the animals and I think the only time they use chemicals is in the sterilisation of the equipment used in the cheese making, which is a requirement by the health Department. It is an example of a cheese which would go well on the export market, especially given the sorts of problems that have been associated with some of the primary products in Europe which have been subjected to the fall-out from Chernobyl. Here we have a perfect example of Australia being able to produce a quality product which could compete internationally if it were allowed to. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not only are the regulations for testing the cheeses stricter, but also I discovered when one of my staff spoke to Gippsland Blue Cheese again today that, besides that problem, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy is charging $204 an hour to go out and check the premises to make sure they are up to export standard. I would love to see the costings for that. How can the Department justify charging $204 an hour?</PARA>
<PARA>  It has been estimated by Gippsland Blue that it would cost somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 for this checking to be undertaken. This is an enormous disincentive to becoming a licensed exporter. Why would anyone bother?  Why would anyone bother putting more money into the factory? Why would anyone bother fighting through the bureaucratic red tape? Why would anyone bother trying to create jobs for people in Gippsland and trying to add value to primary products, which is what we are being told is needed--value added primary products--if we are to compete?</PARA>
<PARA>  Things are made so difficult for these manufacturers. They have so many organisations to deal with and so many regulatory requirements, which never seem to cease. The cheese manufacturers also told me that they are now having to employ consultants to handle the administration of superannuation arrangements. That is another cost and another disincentive for these small businesses. They were not complaining about the superannuation; they were complaining about the administration costs. Senator Maguire talked about the cost of administering a goods and services tax. Maybe he needs to look in his own backyard at the cost of enforcing some of the regulations about which I have just been talking, and the charge of $204 an hour for the primary industry Department to go out and check the premises to make sure that they are up to export standard. It seems to me to be a rather high fee. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the Government does not undertake serious reform some of those industries will die. People will not be bothered. They can actually make more on their money by putting it into a bank account and collecting interest than by bothering to invest it in manufacturing. If honourable senators on the other side of the chamber were serious about creating jobs for the nearly one million unemployed they would do something about these problems, which are crippling businesses--crippling small businesses which are the largest employers in this country. Two of the businesses I referred to are located in rural areas and the other one is located in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, which we have dubbed the `unemployment capital of Australia', as it has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to look at the sorts of reforms that we are talking about, such as taxation reform. Senator Maguire failed to tell us about the invidious creep in the wholesale sales tax which has occurred since those opposite have been in government. Those opposite do not tell us about the things that are hidden. They have not told us how much the wholesale sales tax has increased in 8 1/2 years, because they can hide that. Those opposite do not tell us about the needed reforms in infrastructure: the improvements needed to our roads, in transport and on the waterfront. The situation is desperate for the cheese producers. They cannot have their cheese sitting on a wharf or at the airport. The therapeutic goods industry also needs reliable delivery and, even though it can produce its products competitively and could sell them competitively at the shopfront, their products are not competitive by the time they get there. As with the cheese companies, there is no incentive to become an exporter, given the red tape and the cost of getting a licence. </PARA>
<PARA>  How many jobs could be provided for out of work Australians if only a fraction of the investments in the area of therapeutic goods and the investments which could take place in the development of specialty cheeses were allowed to go ahead? The people in the Gippsland valley have been put off. They have said to Gippsland Blue, `Why would we bother having value added to our products when we have seen what has happened to you?'. If only a fraction of these investments were allowed to go ahead and businesses were not strangled and choked by red tape, how many more jobs would we have for those one million people who are currently unemployed in Australia?</PARA>

The people who are unemployed--the 10.2 per cent, the 29 per cent of young Australians under 20, who cannot find a job--do not want to hear this kind of sterile nonsense, this sort of tit-for-tat debating of, `When you were in government in 1982-83 this is what happened', and then the response, `But it is worse now because of these policy decisions' and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact is that people are unemployed. The fact is that there is dissension within the Government's ranks about what to do about it at the highest levels. We have a leaderless Government, a policyless Government and internal division making it absolutely impossible even for a decision to be made about how much people should contribute to their health care--let alone whether there should be a major policy change to increase employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>  All over the newspapers at the moment we have evidence of that major disagreement. We have headlines such as `Jobless hurting ALP: Kerin' and `Government split widens over jobless' in the Telegraph Mirror; and `Ministers urge job creation' and `Leadership lures Keating to the rocks of populism' in the Sydney Morning Herald. This Government is divided over the central issue which is worrying most Australians--that is, unemployment. The Government does not have a policy; it does not have a clear leadership position; and we now have the most senior Government Ministers disagreeing about it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suppose we should look at what has actually happened and whether the Government's policies are right. If it is clear that the Government's policies have created the present disaster, there is a very good case for changing those policies. There is no doubt that the Government's policies that have been at work for the last eight years have created this very crisis that we are in. The man who created the crisis, Mr Keating, is now saying that we should totally change those policies. The way he wants to change them will make the problem even worse. </PARA>
<PARA>  I draw the Senate's attention to today's Sydney Morning Herald where a very perceptive article by Max Walsh notes not only that the Government is in disarray over its policies but also that its present policies and the policies that Mr Keating wants to introduce will lead both to chaos and disaster. Mr Walsh states that Mr Keating:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . told the Labor Party dinner in Sydney on Friday that the Government needed to return to the priorities he had pursued for seven of the past 8 1/2 years--of creating jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are the policies which really did set Australia up for the recession it had to have--</PARA>
<PARA>The recession, of course, that Mr Keating engineered. Mr Walsh directs attention to these jobs that were created by Mr Keating, that Mr Keating takes the credit for and that the Government as a whole was party to. There is no doubt, as Mr Walsh says, that:</PARA>
<PARA>  From 1983, until the spectre of banana republicanism shocked him, Mr Keating ran an excessively loose fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then, having tightened fiscal policy just as the commodity cycle bounced, he began running a loose monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Through these two policy cycles foreign borrowing was encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA>  Jobs were created. . . but the quality of those jobs was something else. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is what Max Walsh said in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald. It is a very perceptive article. I looked at the statistics to see just what the quality of these jobs was that Mr Keating so proudly says was the centrepiece of the priority he pursued for seven of the last 8 1/2 years. Sure, he was creating jobs. I notice that in public administration, for example, there is a 24 per cent increase in jobs. We would expect that with Labor governments all around Australia, including Canberra. Is that the sort of job creation we want: a 24 per cent increase in public administration--67,800 extra jobs in public administration in Australia between 1982-83 and 1990-91, according to the latest statistics?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I then look at where the rest of the increases have been. There has been a 30 per cent increase in wholesale and retail trades. This, by the way, comes out of a total increase in jobs over that period of something like 1.5 million. We find 382,000 of those increased jobs coming from the wholesale and retail sector; that is about a 30 per cent rise. In the community services sector, we see an increase of 367,000 jobs;  in finance and property services, 325,000 increased jobs;  and construction--a very up and down indicator, I might say--hit a peak of over 163,000 in 1989-90 but, of course, the figure is falling in the latest year. </PARA>
<PARA>  We see recreation--in other words, tourism--as one of the very few areas of increased employment, which is up 181,000. It is one of the very few areas where there has been an increase in employment that will bring, if you like, any recovery, any improvement, in Australia's basic capacity to increase its export earnings--increase its contributions to the balance of payments, which Senator Maguire said is the key element. In his speech he stressed that the most important element of Government policy must be, and is, to fix up the balance of payments. Yet here we see almost a total ignoring of that area in this growth of jobs that Mr Keating said was central to his policy. By his own measure, it is a total failure;  Mr Keating is a total failure; the Government's policies of job creation are a total failure. The Government's policies have cost Australia this huge increase in foreign debt, from something like $25 billion net to something like $135 billion. We have, at that cost, simply created jobs and, as Mr Walsh says, `The quality of those jobs was something else'. He is quite right, as I have just shown. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at manufacturing. As a result of this Government's endeavours over eight years, there are now 81,500 fewer people at work in the manufacturing industry in Australia than there were in 1981-82--the last full year of the Fraser Government. We have very little difference in mining, which is the basic sector in terms of trying to find extra earnings in Australia. In transport, there has only been a little bit; in communication, there has been hardly any; and agriculture is up by something like 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  We see in this nation that the great achievement of Mr Keating has been to do nothing that is in the interests of the economy's long term health. Mr Walsh, I believe quite rightly, says:</PARA>
<PARA>The pattern of job growth was inimical to the economy's long term health. </PARA>
<PARA>He describes Mr Keating's let-it-rip approach as one that meant that:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia through the '80s built a milk-bar economy based on borrowed money. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Now that the symptom of that dangerous economic lifestyle--double-digit unemployment--is on display, we hear Labor's Greek chorus--Keating, Kelty, Ferguson, Richardson, Button, Kirner, Goss and Carr--intone that the Government has to "do something" about job creation. Just what they have to do is not spelt out. </PARA>
<PARA>  These demands are certain to become more strident as the labour market situation worsens. </PARA>
<PARA>He then says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this recession is very different from those of 1982-83 and 1974. </PARA>
<PARA>  This recession is a direct result of a credit boom which raged through the second half of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>That credit boom was deliberately generated by Mr Keating, as he proudly says, because he had a priority over those seven years of creating jobs--no matter what the cost, no matter what the long term consequences. We are now feeling those long term consequences. Mr Walsh says:</PARA>
<PARA>  So far we have not seen job shedding in these sectors at anywhere near the extent that one would expect given the way they bubbled during the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we shall see some continuing serious problems in unemployment, and one can see why. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1982-83 recession was created by Australia's worst drought for 50 years. When it rained there was a dramatic recovery in jobs, as the figures clearly show. They show that in Australia after a loss of 110,000 jobs in the worst recession year of 1982-83, in the following year after it rained there was an increase of 58,600 in the number of people at work. Maybe Government supporters will say that that was because Mr Hawke's particular skill at generating rain or teardrops or liquid of one sort or another led to the end of the drought. If we can thank Mr Hawke for the end of the drought, so be it, but the fact is that that recession could be corrected because it was simply the end of the drought. </PARA>
<PARA>  The consequence of the Government's policies in putting jobs first created a serious disaster long term for Australia, as the Reserve Bank's annual report points out. This recently produced report makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA>  The main task for monetary policy in 1991/92 is to peg the progress which has been made on inflation over the past year, preparatory to winding it back further. </PARA>
<PARA>Labor, of course, has cut inflation at the cost of huge job losses. The annual report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Cyclical falls in inflation--where prices slow in response to weak activity--have occurred in the past, most recently in the early 1980s recession when inflation dropped from around 12 per cent in 1982 to a little over 5 per cent in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the recession brought a severe cut in inflation to only 5 per cent. There was then immense pain, but there was a benefit in that inflation was cut. But what happened?  The Reserve Bank then tells us:</PARA>
<PARA>On that occasion much of the gain was lost within a couple of years, an outcome which policy-makers are determined to avoid on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Keating mucked it up. He was in charge of economic policy and, as the Reserve Bank says, policy makers are determined not to make the mistake that Mr Keating made when he lost that enormous advantage that we had in 1985. He bought temporary job rises at a cost to the Australian economy. Labor under Mr Keating and Mr Hawke destroyed our chances of a lasting recovery then, and we are feeling the consequences of that right now. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is Mr Keating now proposing?  He is proposing to make exactly the same mistake that he made in 1984 when he wiped out all the advances that we had. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I hear Senator Sherry's interjection that he is not now the Treasurer. Many people would say amen to that, but I would be overjoyed to hear Senator Sherry's assurance that Mr Keating will not be in a position of power, such as that of Prime Minister, to repeat the disasters that he generated in our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  When we watch the Keating supporters, the wimps on the Labor Party side in economic policy terms who are pressing for curious policy changes, we note, as Mr Walsh does:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the very industries that the Victorian Premier, Joan Kirner. . . wants to encourage through protection, clothing and textiles, are those from which the successful East Asian economies are escaping. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in the article, Mr Walsh says:</PARA>
<PARA>  While the East Asians are abandoning low-tech manufacturing and Japan is preparing to ease out of mid-tech manufacturing, we have a growing demand from Labor politicians under threat of election loss for Australia to head off in the opposite direction--to head backwards to our future. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the big debate is all about at the moment. That is what the Labor Party leaders, the dissenters, are on about. They are destroying, as they destroyed in 1984--according to the Reserve Bank--any chance we have of a lasting economic recovery. They are destroying the chance of having interest rate falls or job growth that can be sustained. Only if we follow the policy prescriptions suggested by the Opposition, and suggested with great strength, can we see any hope of getting out of our economic disaster right now. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is the Government doing? The Government is in disarray and in basic disagreement. We see Mr Dawkins's warning that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . unemployment will stay high and living standards decline unless there is a change of focus in economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA>One has Resources Minister Alan Griffiths calling for `more Government initiatives to fight unemployment', and saying that `more could be done'. He added:</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has got to have the flexibility to respond to what in my electorate (in Melbourne) is nothing short of a human disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>We have also seen Senator Button calling for a wider range of economic policy to help to create more jobs. One has at the highest level a failure of the Government to agree on what its economic policies should be to get us out of this disaster. The coalition does have those economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before I conclude with that policy prescription, I wish to seek approval of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard the figures showing what has happened in the labour market in individual industries from 1982-83 to now. This will demonstrate where the Government, Mr Keating and Mr Hawke--because in those days Mr Hawke was supporting Mr Keating, regarding him as the greatest Treasurer Australia has had and as the world's greatest Treasurer--have gone. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard statistics which have been prepared for me on employment in these industry groups. I showed them to the previous Minister on duty, and he saw no problem with these figures being incorporated.</PARA>

<PARA>The present Budget that we are dealing with in these Appropriation Bills has the highest level of mistakes. It is the most inaccurate Budget in Australia's history and goes nowhere near achieving the outcomes that it sets out to achieve. It is a disaster, just as Mr Keating's period as Treasurer was a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is now clearly evident that Mr Keating stepped down from being the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister of this nation not because he had a chance of becoming leader in May but because it was desperate for his future hopes that he not be associated with a Budget that involved over a 10 per cent unemployment rate and was clearly a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Keating had no chance. He did not have the numbers in May and he knew it. It was a stunt and, as usual, the Press Gallery fell for it. Mr Keating had to distance himself from disaster. That is what this is all about. That is why he resigned as Treasurer. As I said, he did not have the numbers. We on this side of chamber were told what the numbers were long before the vote was taken. There was never any prospect in May of Mr Keating winning. But he had to distance himself from this disaster that he had created with the help of the total Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sooner or later, by promising a whole range of policies, particularly creating jobs at any price, Mr Keating hopes to attract support from the dissidents in the Labor Party who are growing in number daily, particularly the left wing in Victoria, which has so far stuck with Mr Hawke but will no doubt eventually move to Mr Keating if the meat workers union supporters have anything to say about it. Knowing their method of persuasion, I would expect them to get some support within the trade union movement in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact is that we are now at probably the most serious risk of further economic downturn and disaster while this leaderless, divided and split government remains in control. The problem is that, as the Reserve Bank says, the Government has been totally wrong in the past. It has no coherent policy prescriptions for the future and this Budget is a disaster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My comments on the Budget cover two areas--namely, education and training, and superannuation and retirement income. Before I go into those areas in some detail, I would like to pick up a number of points that were made by Senator Baume.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Firstly, I will make an admission to Senator Baume:  this Government is not perfect and some mistakes have been made-- unlike all previous Liberal-National Party governments since World War II, with their mantle of perfect policy. We know how perfect those governments were in ensuring that this country was made uncompetitive by erecting enormous tariff barriers and by not tackling some of the fundamental restructuring issues such as our transport difficulties or our education infrastructure problems. We know how perfect those opposite are. They did very little during their time in government to correct some of the basic problems that this country has been experiencing since World War II. In a typically conservative way, they were happy to govern safely and leave things as they were. I will say one thing for those opposite: they have now adopted a different approach. Some of the policy initiatives that they are proposing would shake the country to pieces. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some of the alleged facts that Senator Baume laid before us were fairly contradictory. For example, he alleged that the major recession of 1982-83 was brought about by a drought. It was a coincidence in timing that a drought occurred in 1982-83. For anyone to maintain that the drought caused the recession in this country in 1982-83 is utter nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Baume then implied that there was enormous job growth after 1982-83, when a Labor Government came to power, because it rained. That is again utter nonsense. It is a highly shallow examination of what occurred at the time. Senator Baume is condemned by his own figures. He gave us figures relating to job growth in such areas as the services sector and the hospitality and retail industries. The fact that it rained in 1982-83 and the drought broke did not contribute very much to job growth in, for example, the tourism industry. The fact that we had enormous job growth in the tourism industry had more to do with the success of this Government's selling Australia overseas. The enormous growth in the numbers of visitors who came to this country and the enormous growth in tourism were significant contributing factors in the enormous job increases in the hospitality industry that occurred at that time and have continued right up to this day. </PARA>
<PARA>  Like every other country in the Western world, this economy is going through a fundamental shift in the employment structure. There is an enormous shift away from jobs in manufacturing and mining. There is no growth in the jobs in those areas and there will not be because of technology and improved productivity. There will continue to be an increase in manufacturing output and exports but there will not be the job growth. There is nothing unusual about that. But there has been significant job growth in the services sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our economy is undergoing a fundamental economic shift similar to that which began in most Western countries 30 or 40 years ago. One basic problem we face is that we did not go down the road to a shift in employment as we should have done 30 or 40 years ago because those opposite cocooned this country from the international economy behind high tariff walls. They did not adopt the sorts of policies that this Government has initiated over the last eight years to try to correct that problem. For example, almost overnight we were faced with removing tariff walls. Almost overnight we have to shift this economy from a manufacturing, agricultural, rural base to a services sector base in terms of employment. There has been very little positive contribution from those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA>  I now turn to the two very important aspects of the Budget that I wish to concentrate on this evening: education and training, and superannuation and retirement income. It has been a continuing theme of this Hawke Labor Government to be an active reformist government in a whole range of policy areas, but these two areas highlight more than any other this Government's active reformism and the way in which it has appropriately intervened in the economy when it has been necessary. We have integrated economic policy with education and training and with superannuation and retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>  To put education and training into its historical perspective, I referred earlier to the decades of lack of progress in tackling the basic problems in this country under Liberal-National Party governments. The structure of the education system in this country remained basically unchanged until the election of the Hawke Labor Government. For example, there was no national accreditation of education and training; there was no articulation between courses from universities to TAFEs; there was no articulation in training amongst the States in this country; and there were poor levels of retention in education--we had one of the poorest education retention levels of any advanced Western country. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we are to expand our economy and maintain our standard of living by comparison with other advanced Western economies, we have to uplift our commitment to education and training. Every country in the world which has an advanced economic system or which has been progressing very rapidly over the past couple of decades has had a highly motivated, trained and educated work force. This is another area that had been neglected prior to the election of the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  We had low levels of industry training. The fundamental structures of the deliverers of education and training in this country had not been looked at, in some cases, since the Middle Ages. The structure of universities had not been examined--and we have adopted an English tradition--since the founding of universities in England in the 1400s and the 1500s. We still have, although we are now tackling it, the apprenticeship system--a 1,000-year-old feudal system of training with a master-servant system of indenture. Those are the sorts of problems that this country faced and they are the problems this Government set out to tackle and has continued to tackle through the Budget. In order to maintain our competitive position we have adopted the very important theme--often derided by some opposite--of becoming the clever country. The link between training, career paths and wages and salaries is a very important link that this country has not developed in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will mention some of the policies that have been adopted by this Government over the last eight years and continued in the Budget. We have established the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and subsidiary councils to advise the Government on a whole range of policy initiatives that are being implemented. We have expanded university places and funding. In 1983 there were 250,000 persons at university; today there are 350,000--a massive increase. There is no comparable increase in student numbers at universities over a similar time period in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have reformed the structure of academic institutions. It has been a painful process. In many cases the universities and the TAFEs have been resistant to the amalgamation procedures and the structural changes we have made. We have established a national training board and a minimum Training Guarantee Act because, unfortunately, the private sector was not meeting its commitments to training. We have established Australian educational centres overseas so that we can turn our highly skilled education industry into a valuable export industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this year's Budget we have continued to pick up the challenges and the pace of change. I will draw the attention of the Senate to a number of important initiatives in this year's Budget. The Budget contains significant increases in funding. Overall, the funding allocation for the activities of the Department of Employment, Education and Training --and this does not include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander funding--will rise from $8,605m in 1990-91 to $9,808m in 1991-92. That represents an increase of $1,200m in one year, an increase in real terms of 10.8 per cent. That shows our commitment to the re-training and re-education of this country to keep us on a new path. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget has identified higher education as a priority area. We are continuing the push in higher education with an additional $150m in the next financial year--$150m in one year alone. As to Aboriginal programs, we are ensuring that those less privileged in our society continue to receive assistance; we are providing an additional $6m in this area. There will be an additional package of student assistance over the next year of approximately $12m. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will be going into the Australian language and literacy policy in some detail because I have a criticism of it. Again, I contrast the criticisms of those opposite. We are not a perfect government and there are some areas that I will openly and honestly criticise. We know what the problems of the country are and we are tackling them, unlike those opposite. The Budget has introduced a $12m package for labour market programs over the next year and a program of a quarter of a million dollars over the next triennium. Finally, there is a package of youth items amounting to $5m. </PARA>
<PARA>  When looking at these programs in greater detail, one sees that there is to be a 10 per cent increase in funding to schools and a 10 per cent increase in funding in the higher education area. These are real increases. Again, there is a 10 per cent increase in the skills formation area. In the area of industry training, which is very important if we are to encourage our export industry, funding for entry level training will increase by $182m in the next financial year. In the past we have done very little in the area of recognition of overseas skills, but there will be an increase in expenditure from $.9m to $1.3m. That is a relatively small program, but a very important one. If this country is to become part of the international economy and become competitive, we have to be prepared to recognise the skills of those coming from overseas and vice versa. We have done very little in this area in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>  Labour market assistance is so important given the high levels of unemployment. Of course, our program stands in stark contrast to the program of those opposite, whose basic attitude is, `After nine months, forget them. Drop them off the dole and forget them'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Panizza can protest, but even his rural supporters are urging a change of course with that policy. Not only is it an inhumane policy--that is the worst aspect of it--but also it is an appalling waste of human resources in this country to say to people after nine months, `That is the end of you. Go and fend for yourselves'. In terms of the labour market adjustment packages, we are increasing the funding allocation to employment access from $200m to $281m. The funding for community based strategies is being increased from $102m to $190m. These are specific and positive programs to try to overcome the fundamental difficulties that many people face in regaining entry to the labour market. Labour adjustment assistance has been increased from $6m to $31m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I mentioned earlier the higher education funding over the next triennium. Looking at the breakdown of the packages and the funding provided, one sees that we have ensured the implementation of an appropriate career structure in the higher education field at a very significant cost, which we are funding--$126m in 1991-92 rising to $201m in 1994-95. We are providing for additional enrolment growth over and above that which has already occurred. We are also providing for advanced engineering centres--again, a fairly small Budget item in the overall context of education and training, but a very important measure. </PARA>
<PARA>  By way of comment on these measures, the additional funds are providing for the supplementation of the higher education program to meet the costs of the salary increases that were recently awarded to academics. They are also providing for enrolment growth over and above the levels that were previously committed for 1992--some 13,000 additional new places. A pilot scheme has been established to encourage further industry involvement in higher education, with up to 600 places in 1992 and up to 700 places in both 1993 and 1994. The funding will also go towards the establishment of three advanced education centres to which I referred earlier. They are joint ventures between the Commonwealth, host institutions and industry, and are good examples of cooperation between the Government and private industry. These centres will focus on advanced undergraduate and postgraduate education and training. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unlike those opposite, who in one breath talk about cutting expenditure and in the next talk about increasing expenditure in areas without coming up with the funding for them, this Government did bite the bullet in terms of the higher education contribution scheme. In this Budget we are increasing the funding by $144m to partly fund our education initiatives. Unlike those opposite, we are not full of rhetoric. We show where we will fund our initiatives, and those opposite ought to take up the challenge. It is a responsible approach, not the wishful thinking that we get from those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will now turn to Australian language and literacy policy, which has been funded in this Budget and details of which were announced following the Budget. This is one area where I will make a criticism of one small aspect of the policy that has been adopted. We are the first Government to turn attention to the problem of illiteracy in this country. It is a monumental disgrace that between 7 per cent and 10 per cent of our work force are illiterate and up to 28 per cent are functionally illiterate. </PARA>
<PARA>  I preface my remarks by saying that it is not because of the failure of the school system. If we are to ensure that our economy grows and that everyone has relatively equal access to the opportunities that we should be offering, we have to overcome the problems of illiteracy. I am pleased that in the Budget, programs have been announced to fund the sorts of initiatives needed to do that and the language and literacy policy that has been handed down. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is to be increased funding--some $90m--over the next three years for a language policy. If we are to be relevant in terms of the international economy, we have to be able to communicate with the outside world. I have to say that it is an area in which this country has been a dismal failure. Our enrolments in foreign language courses rate very badly. If we are to maximise our trade and our competitiveness, particularly with Asia, we have to reorient the focus of our culture, at least in part, in terms of the languages that we teach. It is here that I make a criticism of the policy that has been adopted. We have adopted five core languages:  French, German, Japanese, Chinese and Bahasa  Indonesian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-They are the five languages that have been adopted, if Senator Panizza would care to read the policy.  Of the five languages that have been adopted, it is interesting to note that in this country the No. 1 at year 12 and at higher education is still French. Of those studying foreign languages, 25 per cent are studying French. The next highest is Japanese with 12 per cent at year 12, and in higher education it is about 20 per cent. Then follow German, at 14 per cent, and Indonesian-Malay, at about 6 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I find that quite appalling. We are proposing to perpetuate the orientation of our language policy around French, in particular, by continuing to fund French language courses. I find it appalling for three reasons. Let us look at the criteria that were used to come to the policy for the adoption of the five languages. The first is the migrant criterion. The French do not rate in migration to this country. They are not even in the top 10. In terms of the criterion based on migration, French should not rate. In terms of trade, six of the 10 major countries to which we export are in Asia. Where does France rate?</PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was referring to the criteria on which we have developed the national language and literacy policy. I had made comment on the countries to which we export. In 1971-72, France rated No. 7 and received some 2.7 per cent of our exports. When that figure is compared to the 1989-90 year, France did not rate at all; it had dropped off the list and did not even fall into the top 12 receivers of our exports. In fact, one could argue that France is an economic enemy of Australia, but I will not develop that argument this evening. On the criteria of export performance, France does not rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the area of tourism, it is also interesting that in the last year there was some 22,000 visitors from France to Australia. Comparatively, France was No. 26 on the list of countries which sends tourists to this country. Clearly, France was overtaken by Japan a long time ago. However, countries such as Korea and Thailand were for the first time exceeding France as a source of tourists. </PARA>
<PARA>  On those criteria, I find it very difficult to understand why we have a policy that allocates one-quarter of our total foreign language expenditure to French. We should certainly be teaching French, but we should not be giving it the priority that we have outlined in the language policy or giving it the expenditure that is allocated in the Budget. At the Federal level, we are spending some $90m over three years. However, at the State level it will be some hundreds of millions of dollars. It would be more appropriate to spend our scarce language education dollars in the developing Asian markets such as Thailand and Korea, which are and will be of much more importance in the coming decades. I am sure the only reason French is given such importance is that--because of our English traditions--French, German and Latin were essentially the only languages taught in this country up until 15 or 20 years ago, and French is still a traditional hangover from that period. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other issue I wish to comment on tonight is our superannuation and retirement policy. I will be fairly brief in this area because it is an issue about which I have spoken on other occasions. I am pleased to see the continuing development in this Budget of a comprehensive, secure and equitable retirement package. Up until the election of the Labor Government, there was a minority of people--who tended to be the much better off in terms of income--who received superannuation. At present, two out off every five persons are retired and the other three out of every five persons are required to support our retired population, and by the year 2020 three out of every five persons will be retired. With an increasing aged population, there will proportionally be a significant increase in the number of persons requiring superannuation and/or a government pension and, therefore, it is necessary to quickly develop a comprehensive retirement policy. That the Government has done. </PARA>
<PARA>  This policy will end the tax rorts which benefited only the wealthy. That tax discount, where superannuation was taxed at 5 per cent, went only to those who had superannuation. Up until a few years ago, those persons who received superannuation were the better off in our society. The tax concession did little to encourage the spread of superannuation to the middle income and lower income areas, and particularly to disadvantaged groups such as women who did not receive any superannuation at all. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us looks at superannuation from its historical perspective. In 1986 there was the awarding of the 3 per cent productivity superannuation, as it became known, through the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This has been developed but, unfortunately, it has not been adhered to legally as it should have been and there are still significant levels of non-compliance with that 3 per cent. However, with the very important policy announcements in the Budget which will fundamentally affect everyone who retires in this country over decades, there is a phasing-in of a contribution level equivalent to 9 per cent of earnings by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a recognition of the problems facing small business, that phasing in will not affect employers with a payroll of less than $500,000 for another two years and will be phased in progressively up to the year 2000. Also taken into account are those employers who have been contributing over--in some cases significantly over--the 3 per cent level that currently applies. This new superannuation guarantee levy will underpin the Government's retirement incomes policy. Superannuation, which has been extended to the vast majority of the work force, will now be extended to all Australians for the first time in a significant and meaningful way because this 9 per cent figure will provide realistic superannuation entitlements. That is one of the most significant measures in the Budget on which I wish to comment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although those opposite have been quick to criticise superannuation as being allegedly a tax on employment--which I would refute--that money will be used for investment purposes. So it does have a productive and positive outcome. Those opposite have been quick to criticise but, like their tax policy, we are still waiting for their retirement and superannuation policy. Where is it? Whilst in government we have been conscious of developing a total range of policies in a whole range of areas. All those opposite can do is snipe and complain, yet on one of the most fundamental issues--retirement income policy--it has still not delivered a policy after eight years in opposition. One would think that those opposite would have learnt something in opposition, but they have learnt nothing. Those opposite will continue to sit where they are now. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government is a government of vision; it is a government of leadership; and it is a government of policies that will lead this country into the next century. Those opposite certainly have some vision--a vision of a new tax which will allegedly solve all our problems and a vision of an inequitable society which will create a larger pool of have-nots. Those opposite have an industrial relations policy that will put us back to the conditions of Victorian England. That is the sort of vision the Opposition has for this country. Its vision is not based on any positive or any socially just or equitable approach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We are tonight discussing the Appropriation Bills. The foremost item of concern to thousands of ordinary Australians is the amount of direct personal tax that they pay under this Labor Government. It has been a source of absolute fascination, to say the least, to listen to Senator Sherry's contribution to this debate because, quite clearly, he does not understand the pressures Australians--not only as individuals rapidly losing their jobs but also as business operators trying to keep their heads above water to retain the jobs of individuals which are at grave risk--are under at the moment. To say the least, incentive is not helped when Australians on 60 per cent of average earnings--which is only $20,700--pay nearly 40c in the dollar in tax, the marginal rate on average earnings being 30 per cent when this Government came to office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This is a government that claims to be the friend of the worker; yet it is this Government that has decided to increase that tax level to dramatic levels. Perhaps the likes of Senator Sherry might care to explain to the Senate why Australians need to earn no more than 1.7 times average weekly earnings before they pay the top marginal rate in tax. But Senator Sherry is not keen to hear this--he is now leaving the chamber. It does bear comparison that in 1951, the top marginal rate of tax was payable only on incomes which were 18 times average weekly earnings. Here we are in 1991 and that figure is now 1.7 times average weekly earnings. That is how much this tax junkie Government has put up personal levels of income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a fact that Australians who earn more than $20,000 and less than $50,000 to $60,000 are, in fact, worse off under the Hawke Labor Government. We are talking, of course, about the great mass of middle Australians and the same great mass that the Hawke Labor Government purports to support. Equally, it is a fact--and Labor may get sick of hearing this--that indirect taxes have substantially increased since 1983. They are up 50 per cent per head without one cent of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a debate last week, I was referring to exactly these figures as well. But I thought it was worth driving the point home because this Government refuses to answer the question as to why it has sought to increase the levels of sales tax as dramatically as it has. Then again, as we on this side could not help but interject when Senator Sherry made the comment that he is waiting for our retirement incomes policy, at least we have had such a policy at every election in this decade, which is more than the Labor Party has had in terms of tax policies, development policies, resource policies and environment policies. Therefore, I think it is rather cute that he should stand up in the Senate and ask where our tax policy is. </PARA>
<PARA>  I might well ask the Labor Government where its tax policies were for the elections of 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1990. We have not yet seen one of them, so I suppose we may--with any degree of luck, but I would not hold my breath--see a taxation policy prior to the next election. It is rather fascinating that Government members should stand up in this chamber--and, of course, in the other chamber--and parade all around Australia saying that they want to see our tax policy. It is no wonder. If the Government does not have one of its own, then it looks at somebody else's. It is also no wonder that a government presiding over such an erosion of spending power should resort to the misrepresentation of the coalition's policies. Quite frankly, it is obviously far safer to do that than to depend upon its own record. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unlike the Hawke Labor Government's policies, the Hewson coalition taxation policy has a very positive message of reform. It will be a tax on spending in preference to earnings and will bring some logic and equity into direct taxation. Of course, that will also enable people to be masters of their own destiny. They will have more money that they can decide how they want to spend. If there is one factor that we hear all the time wherever we go, it is that people are sick of being taxed as heavily as they are. They constantly tell us and they must be telling the Labor Party as well that it is not worth their time to work overtime because they lose it all in taxation. It is not worth their time to work longer and harder because all the extra money goes in taxation--personal levels of income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a nation, we must make sure that the incentive is returned for people to be able to earn more money and to be able to take home more of the money that they earn. They will then have a lower level of taxation and that taxation will be on spending. That is a fairer means of taxing. Consumers will pay less for some goods and probably the same for the majority of goods now covered by 20 per cent sales tax. As I say, at the level of 30 per cent, they will certainly be paying more. Admittedly--and we do not try to deny it at all--there will be an increase in prices of some goods. But the difference with our policy, as opposed to that of the Labor Government, will be that the taxpayers will obtain relief from the stifling current rates of income tax and any increase in the cost of some items will be offset by the huge reductions in personal levels of income tax, increases in welfare benefits and packages for those who are on superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Small business operators will discover that the refunding of inputs will give them a cash flow advantage, while under Labor, small business people unlucky enough to be caught in the sales tax net must wrestle with the pitfalls of self-assessment. But, of course, one of the great problems with the Labor Government is that most of its members have been trade union people who have never had to run a business of their own. They have never had to find the money to pay the wages at the end of the week. They have never had to find the money to pay for the rent, the telephone, the cost of their products, the payroll tax and all the other taxes that they face. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is quite correct, Senator Panizza. As the honourable senator quite rightly says, some do get a government-paid driver and they are not even producing other forms of income. We are not too sure as to how that happens but, of course, we are bound to find out. The problem is that if this Government continues along its line of just endorsing trade union hacks, then the understanding of how the imposts that this Government places on business and the flow-on effect that that has on the employment market will never be changed. Government members have never had to experience the problems that are associated with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Small business operators really have a problem with all of these tax measures and, as Senator Sherry commented a little while ago, we do believe that the superannuation imposts on the business community generally is just another form of tax because it is no more and no less. In the same way, the training guarantee levy is just another form of tax--a tax on employment. In fact, the training guarantee levy has worked in a counterproductive way with a number of organisations. They are now finding that they, in fact, have to spend less on their training costs than they had to in the past. Senator Sherry shakes his head. He would not have a clue because he has never got out there in the business community. He does not know what the business community has spent in the past on training because it is people like him who just believe that training happens at the click of the fingers. It is, in fact, a very well-planned operation by many organisations right throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  I take a further example of how a goods and services tax would be of benefit to a group in the business area such as the vegetable growers and processors in Western Australia who are trying to compete with New Zealand products. They will have a greater chance of level competition if Australia also has a goods and services tax that exempts both business inputs and exports--neither of which are exempt from sales tax at present. Therefore, these people are finding their lives pretty uncompetitive when compared with those of our New Zealand partners. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not only do we need to query the stifling level of Labor taxes, but we also need to query how those taxes are spent. Of the revenue collected from PAYE taxpayers, 68 cents in each dollar was spent on the welfare sector in 1982. In 1991, the welfare sector is consuming 34 per cent of the Federal Budget and 86 cents of each PAYE dollar; it has increased from 68 cents back in 1982. I raise this not to blame the recipients of this money, so many of whom would want to work and be independent or, if retired, to have provided it for themselves but, like John Hewson, to point out that the best form of welfare that any person can get is to have a job. If the Government does not understand that, then the situation is even more tragic than any of us realised. I blame this Government that relies on the welfare net to sweep up the victims of its job destroying policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  When 100,000 jobs disappear and inflation rises at least 2 per cent as a result of Labor's 5 per cent superannuation impost on employers, welfare spending, however disguised, rises further. What the Opposition is still saying is: do not just look at continuing to raise the levels of welfare. Look at creating employment policies that will create jobs to reduce the need for welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Sherry also said prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner that our dole policy is absolutely inhumane. How inhumane, I might ask, is an unemployment level of 10 per cent plus? I would think that is more inhumane than anything, because what we are talking about is creating jobs. Ultimately, the most humane and practical solution to the problem of relative poverty and dependency is to create a climate in which greater national wealth is generated and more Australians have jobs; in John Hewson's words, a steady job is the best form of welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not inhumane after nine months to tell people who have not tried to get jobs or who will not accept work or retraining that they will no longer receive unemployment relief as income support. People do not starve in the streets in other Western nations where this discipline applies. We are not saying to those who do try hard to get a job, who can prove that they have tried hard to get a job and are prepared to take any job that is offered to them that they will be left on the scrap heap. The Government well and truly knows that, but it seeks to continue to misrepresent the policy and the position that we have taken. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are not going to force taxpayers, who are struggling to make ends meet thanks to this Government's high taxation policies, to fork out more for those who simply do not want to work and who do not try to get work. It is not necessarily humane to emphasise the right to welfare rather than the right and duty to work, as the ultimate disaster for young Australians is to head towards middle life without experiencing paid employment in the open job market. It is positively inhumane to resist introducing the deregulated wage levels which the coalition seeks and which would give these people work experience. </PARA>
<PARA>  I repeat the challenge of Dr Hewson: before well-intentioned Australians decry the coalition proposal for a genuine work test, are they prepared to endorse the justice of a system that allows able-bodied people to live indefinitely at the expense of PAYE taxpayers without making an effort on their own behalf? I think the overwhelming cry of all Australians would be that they are not prepared to keep paying higher and higher taxes to subsidise those who will not find work. They are quite happy to pay for those who are genuinely out of work, genuinely trying to find work and, as I said before, are prepared to take any job that is offered to them. </PARA>
<PARA>  By its actions, or lack of them, the Hawke Labor Government has long made it clear that it is not going to take the necessary steps to tackle the silent menace of our accumulated $165 billion foreign debt, the social evil of lost job opportunities, and the imperative to increase national productivity. A government that was truly committed to productivity would not be giving its moral support to the union opponents of Robe River Iron in its continued drive for the elimination of those work practices that are absolutely counterproductive to productivity and to Australia's international reputation. Here we have a company that has increased real productivity by 320 per cent. In anyone's terms that is outstanding. It has done that in only four years, with production up from 10,000 tonnes to 32,000 tonnes per employee. To achieve this, 284 restrictive work practices had to be eliminated and 300 job classifications existing in 1987 were reduced to 10 employee and three management classifications. That is how you get productivity up; that is how you start making dollars for Australia; and that is how you start creating employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nothing better illustrates the sectional, negative ethos of Labor than its denigration of this company, with the State Labor conference in Western Australia actually calling for the withdrawal of this company's export licence. It actually called for the withdrawal of an export licence of a company that has in four short years increased its production from 10,000 tonnes to 32,000 tonnes. It wants to pull out the rug from underneath it. It is a disgrace. To Labor, protection of union privilege, as we know, is a lot more important than earning export dollars for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Where the Hawke Labor Government has failed Australia disastrously is in its continued defence of a centralised, regulated industrial relations system, when it has properly brought in financial deregulation and moved towards freer trade. </PARA>
<PARA>  Waterfront reform is a saga of too little, too late because this Labor Government will always squib a confrontation with the Waterside Workers Federation and the ACTU. We know that to be fact. It is not some pipedream of mine or anybody else; that is just fact. It is a national disgrace that while Australia remains 50 per cent as productive as European ports and 40 per cent as productive as those of Asia, New Zealand, under its Labour Government, bit the bullet, raised waterfront productivity by over 100 per cent and lowered costs to a level 60 per cent below our own. A New Zealand Labour Government was able to do that. Why cannot this Labor Government take a leaf out of its book? It does not have the courage or the ability to take on the Waterside Workers Federation or the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Labor Government thinks it is good enough that national exports and imports pay what is an industrial relations tax of up to $1 billion annually while 5,000 waterside workers earn $40,000 to $50,000 annually for 25 productive hours per week. Are there not an awful lot of Australians who would like to earn $40,000 to $50,000 annually for working 40 hours, even 80 hours, a week? But no! Waterside workers are getting that for working just 25 hours per week. This Labor Government sits back while double-manned cranes with the capacity to load 30 containers per hour load only 17 compared to 26 in Singapore and while only some 450 of 3,000 necessary redundancies have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia will never begin to solve its economic problems as long as we have a Labor Government that buys votes at the expense of wealth-creating industry, exemplified by the disgraceful decision against mining at Coronation Hill. A Government determined to buy Green preferences at all costs and stay in government at all costs seized upon the alleged sensibilities of one section of an Aboriginal community to deny a wealth-creating, job-creating project. Because the scientific grounds for prohibiting mining were not there, what did we find? Bula was suddenly and conveniently conjured up. Whether the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) actually believed his emotional claptrap about Bula--and it is the only way one can describe it--really matters little. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister sent the mining industry and the outside world a message about where his Government's priorities lie. He also succeeded in giving massive encouragement to extremists within the Aboriginal community to exercise obstruction and blackmail through the invention of sacred sites not recognised by genuine custodians. Of course, the Prime Minister's young son has probably given him a lot of information about that because, quite frankly, he is one of the white do-gooders in the Aboriginal community in the north of Western Australia who seek to undermine the efforts of the decent Aboriginal communities up there and also, of course, seek to undermine further development that can provide income for both black and white communities in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  The attempts to thwart the Yakabindie project in Western Australia are an inevitable result of signals from a Federal Labor Government that anti-mining views expressed by Aboriginals are somehow more genuine than support for the mining that will give them a chance of breaking the cycle of poverty and dependence. Poverty and dependence indeed will be the fate of tens of thousands of Australians unless a coalition government is elected to implement radical reform, not only of taxation, but also of industrial relations so that the focus is clearly placed squarely on the enterprise and choice exists to opt out of the arbitration system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Business, of course, will be unable to survive and create jobs if the Hawke-Labor Government allies itself with the fourth faction, the Australian Democrats, and enshrines the right to strike and takes away the vital protection afforded to small business by section 45D of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is of concern to see the even greater left turn on which Senator Coulter is now taking the Democrats. They will keep turning left that hard that they will eventually come back to meet themselves. They do not understand what they stand for. They do not understand even whether they like each other, let alone what their policies are. But for a group of politicians whose foundation was `keeping the bastards honest', they are now proclaiming, ahead of an election, that they are going to try to stop us from being honest and stop us as a coalition from implementing the policies on which we will go to the electorate. So where do they stand on anything? Heaven only knows. </PARA>
<PARA>  So long as this Labor Government condemns Australia to a union dominated industrial relations system, productivity in regard to motor vehicles will remain at two-thirds the rate in the United States. An employee in the United States will produce 5,000 tonnes of cement, while his Australian counterpart produces 2,000. Of course, I have conveniently ignored comparisons with Japan, quite frankly because they are far too embarrassing. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no humanity, only weakness and cowardice in the refusal of the Hawke Labor Government to implement the reforms that Australian enterprise and individual Australians need so badly. They want jobs, less tax and lesser burdens around their necks. It is about time a coalition government gave that to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Tonight we are debating the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1991-92 and the amendment moved by Senator Short. One should have thought that this would be the Budget brought down by the Government to try to turn things around in the next 12 months, a Budget to get us out of the worst recession or depression. We should have stopped using the term `recession' a long time ago and used `depression' instead. It is the worst spot we have been in since the 1930s. One should have thought that we would have a Budget to get us moving. What do we have instead? We have a Budget that will increase rather than decrease unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If you do not believe this is the case, Mr Deputy President, then look at the unemployment figures in the last two months since the Budget was announced on approximately 20 August and see how those figures have taken off upwards. I cannot see those figures turning around for a mighty long time yet. </PARA>
<PARA>  Tonight I will direct my remarks mainly towards Senator Short's amendment, paragraph (e) of which reads, `imposing major obstacles to resource development;' for which the Government stands condemned. It was the subject of debate last Thursday evening. Let me again remind the chamber that the only industry that will get Australia moving quickly is the resource development industry. We must increase the pace of the resource development we already have and start developing new resource industries. But what is the Government doing? It is only putting impediments in the road. If it is not putting impediments in the road of resource development, it is certainly not doing anything about removing those impediments that are already there. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will start with land access and the approval process, which are two very fundamental aspects of getting a resource project going. They can briefly be broken down into three aspects: environment, Aboriginal heritage and the mode of processing applications. There are a lot of others but I will go into these in some detail first. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, environmental considerations are used to veto projects and usually influence the final decision. Nothing is done concurrently in project approval systems. There are probably 14 or 15 processes that must be gone through to get the simplest developments going. But it seems that the steps are done one by one and time is lost in this way. If the other stages are completed, the environmental authorities, aided by their lobby, bring everything to a halt and put it on hold forever, as happened at Coronation Hill. Then there are sovereign risks associated with the terms and conditions of exploration and mining leases. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have export controls especially on the sand mining industry, where there is a requirement for annual approvals. How can any company that proposes a development be asked to spend upwards of $300m or $400m and then go back for an approval every 12 months? It is utterly impossible. One would not invest in one year $300m or $400m for an approval to get a project going and then, before even finishing the development budget, go back for another approval. </PARA>
<PARA>  The way lobby groups--Green, Left and environmental lobby groups--work these days, a company would get caught between approvals or could spend the entire project money and then not be given the right to go ahead. There are a few projects like that, especially in Western Australia, that have been set up and mothballed straightaway. A further example is export taxes, reducing further development opportunities in coal. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Foreign Investment Review Board does not have the right guidelines by which to work. These guidelines seem to change with the current mood of the Government. They should be brought into line with general guidelines. The current arrangements discourage foreign mining companies and so should be brought into line with the general thrust to get resource projects going rather than destroy them. </PARA>
<PARA>  My colleague Senator Knowles ably pointed out that waterfront and shipping reform is needed in competitive market structures. Excess rail freights and cross-subsidisation issues are preventing project resources from proceeding in a profitable mode or are even preventing the development of new ones. </PARA>
<PARA>  Electricity generation and distribution need to be open to private sector involvement. At Collie in Western Australia, the Western Australian Government has just signed an agreement for Australia's first private generation plant, yet the union power of Western Australia, and indeed of all of Australia, is trying to wreck it immediately. What gives any trade union movement the right to think that it will keep power generation in the public domain forever and a day, the result being that this country will not be internationally competitive because of the high cost of electricity to industry, especially in Western Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>  What about fuel excise? Senator Sherry asked where the coalition's tax policy was. Here he was trying to defend the Government's Budget, yet he has probably never in his life risked a dollar of his own in business. If he has, I wish he would tell me because I would be very happy to be proved wrong on this matter. I doubt whether there is anyone on the Government benches who has risked a dollar in his or her life, except one who now sits on the back bench, the former Minister for Finance, Senator Peter Walsh. He is the only one who I know for sure has risked his own dollar. I do not hear any cries from anyone on the Government benches that I am on the wrong path, yet time and time again Government members come in here and ask where our tax policy is and tell us what we should be doing. </PARA>
<PARA>  At least there are many Opposition members who have risked their own money in business ventures. In fact, Senator Knowles risked her own private dollars in a small business before she came into parliament. It is a lot better preparation for parliament to use one's pocket to make one's way through the world than to be on the payroll of a government enterprise or, worse, the trade union movement. But I have digressed. So, if we want to be internationally competitive, the cost of electricity generation in Australia has to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have mentioned fuel excise. Under our tax policy--under the goods and services tax--certain fuel excise will be removed. If the Government cannot see that that is the way to go, it could at least expand the fuel excise rebate system to accommodate this, as is done in the farming industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  The three-mine uranium policy has been a platform of the Labor Party ever since I can remember. Senator McMullan has talked about this more than once. Once again, there has been a hold-up in the area of project development. We have to produce because the rural industry, mainly led by wheat and wool, is not in a position this time to get us out of this trough. There seems to have been a cycle over the years: every 10 or 15 years, each industry has a turn at bailing Australia out. In the 1930s it was the mining industry, in the 1950s it was primary industry and in the 1960s it was mining again. But now that the rural industry is not in a position to assist, we have to look to the mining industry--the resource sector--to do that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I now turn to taxation issues, such as the depreciation regime not being related to the economic cost of capital and indirect taxes on business inputs. We on this side of the chamber have said time and time again that the March statement should have included something about accelerated depreciation, but it did not. Legislation on this matter has not been brought before this place. The other night I pointed out that quite a few measures--very small measures--which were contained in the March statement have not seen the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have probably touched on the issue of excessive uncertainty caused by future environmental policy. This Government does not know where its environmental policy is going. The Government's environmental agenda is set according to whether its legislation is supported by the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine. That is who sets the Government's agenda on the environment, and nobody else. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said before, when a mining resource project is being evaluated everyone should work together so that we can reach the position where we can give it the go-ahead. Senator Button and Mr Griffiths, from the other House, have been saying for the last two or three weeks that we need fast tracking. Where is that fast tracking? Even if the hold-ups caused by the environmental lobby and the Aboriginal heritage claims were to disappear tomorrow, it would still take a long time to get any project going because the authorities do not work together. That has to be looked at. I have said before that the veto should not lie in the hands of any of those authorities. If a project is confirmed or destroyed, it should be done quickly and in unison so that the company which has money to invest in Australia can look at other places, generally, overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>  I saw figures the other day to the effect that one of our largest mining companies is now conducting 75 per cent of its exploration overseas. At the present moment, its production in Australia is probably higher than it is overseas but its exploration dollar has gone overseas and this Government has to be blamed totally for that. I am sure no-one on the other side can go back eight years to blame the Fraser Government for that happening. As I said, we were helped out of the 1930s Depression by the mining industry, and that industry will get us out of this one. Last Thursday evening the Government was condemned in this very chamber for holding up development and for not fast tracking resources in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sir Charles Court in Western Australia led the mining revival in the 1960s. Senator McMullan smiles at that, but can he tell me of any other person who got the iron ore industry of Australia going?</PARA>

As Senator Knowles has pointed out, per worker the men and women of Robe River produce the highest amount of iron ore in the world. They are also the most highly paid iron ore workers. The honourable senator cannot say that that is not correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There are other areas in which Australia is not being competitive in meeting world standards. Let me turn to the area of land transport. Alongside everything else, an industry resource has to have an efficient transport system--whether it be by sea, land or air; but in our case, it is mostly land transport. There has been hardly any progress in the last 12 months in land transport reform, although there may have been some marginal reforms. The National Rail Corporation agreement was signed at least six months late. The Corporation was supposed to start hauling freight on 1 July; it has not started yet, although we have a promise. It is now rumoured that it will start in February 1992--seven months after it was supposed to start. Maybe it will get going then, but I am not holding my breath. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been a tacit, if shaky, agreement on national operating systems for road transport. But even that is looking uncertain. The benefits are outweighed by the negatives; and, even when there has been any progress, there have been as many or more negatives. This has created uncertainty in the industry. It has created confusion, delay, lack of direction and ridicule of opponents. That is all the National Rail Corporation has been doing. Of course, its opponent happens to be the road transport industry. There is one way to fix it if one is in government: tax it out of existence and impose unacceptable and possibly dangerous regulations--such as some of the Australian design rules, which I will not go into fully this evening. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget saw road funding fall by over 2 per cent in real terms. We are supposed to be getting Australian roads up to top standard and into a condition where they can handle an improved transport network. But the Government is letting the condition of the roads go backwards. Funding for major roads fell by 4.4 per cent in real terms. Funding for arterials--the arterials that this Government was going to make sure were in place so that when the major highways reached the cities transport would be able to get to the ports quite easily--has fallen by 18 per cent in real terms. Yet no provision was made to allow the States to raise their own revenue to cover this fall--and we hear about that only by way of comment in this place. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since 1983-84, road funding has fallen by 20 per cent in real terms under this Government. Revenue from fuel tax has increased by over 120 per cent in the same period. Expenditure on roads as a percentage of excise has gone down from 63.2 per cent to 23.3 per cent--assuming all councils spent all of the Federal money on roads. The road freight industry has been thrown into chaos because of this Government's handling of road reform in the transport area. </PARA>
<PARA>  Anyone who gets around Australia as much as I do by road transport would note that there is confusion in the road industry among shire councils and industries that rely on road transport. In fact, we got a good serving of that last weekend at the conference in Broome. Broome is one of the areas that have no other modes of transport. Inland remote areas have no sea transport, of course, and no rail transport, so they are at the mercy of anyone who wants to have a go at them. Truck sales are the lowest in 30 years, with truck values literally having been halved. What is this Government doing about that?</PARA>
<PARA>  There are a lot of other aspects I would like to address in this Budget, but my time is running out. What has this Government done?  I turn to the rural industries to see what this Government has done for them. As I said earlier, we are at the lowest ebb since the 1930s, and we have a drought on our hands in the eastern States. This Government time and time again has blamed the 1981-82 recession fairly and squarely on the shoulders of Malcolm Fraser and his Government. That Government got into that position because of one almighty eastern States drought and a drought in Western Australia the year after. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is now a drought in the northern part of the eastern States. What has the Government done?  It has not even recognised it, made any noise about it or made preparations for the eventual result of that drought. We know it is there but we will not really feel it until the wheat payments and other grains payments do not come in next February. We have heard nothing from the Government even though we thought that there might have been further measures for the funding of RAFCOR, but, no, we have not heard that. </PARA>
<PARA>  At least in Western Australia the Premier, Carmen Lawrence, undertook to have a GMP--a guaranteed minimum price--for wheat. She went it alone. I am a continual critic of the Premier of Western Australia, but not in this instance. The Government will not have to pay out because the price of wheat has improved. In Western Australia it gave the farmers confidence to plant a crop, and there is a good season. It gave the banks confidence to lend money to plant that crop. This Government, in one fell swoop, took away the GMP in 1988 and loaded on a wheat industry fund of 2 per cent, which is sitting there gathering minimal interest and doing nothing for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  The GMP that had worked so well in various forms since 1947 went out the door and nothing has been done to replace it with a system for wheat marketing that will give farmers confidence to plant a reasonable crop every year. It is probably just as well--although I do not believe it is just as well to have a drought at any time--that there is a drought in the eastern States now. It has probably saved people from going further into debt if they have not planted a crop, but the better areas of this country are missing out on export income that we could do with. </PARA>

<PARA>  My time to speak is coming towards an end. The Government stands condemned for bringing down a Budget which is doing nothing to get resource projects off the ground in Australia. It is doing nothing to get those one million people who are unemployed back onto the payroll in Australia. It is doing nothing like that. There was a March statement this year, the year before it was an April statement and the year before that it was in May, so next year there will probably be a February statement to try to turn around the mismanagement that there will be in this place because of the Budget that has been brought down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Debates in this chamber, indeed in the Parliament, centre very much on economic issues. In fact, the economy is the main topic for debate in this Parliament. We take the approach that the cure for the country's ills depends solely on the correct application of economic measures. We have just heard Senator Panizza and many of his colleagues before him address this chamber on the basis that, if somehow we can work the right economic levers, happiness will come out. I am not sure that that is correct or that economic rationalism--which is the policy the Opposition adopts--will deliver this country into happiness, contentment and fairness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The sorts of terms that we have grown used to using in this chamber include `Budget deficit', `balance of payments', `monetary policy', `fiscal measures', `gross domestic product', `inflation' and `current account'. It is thought that if we debate in those terms we will pull Australia away from the problems that it presently faces. The difficulty with that approach is that it sometimes--indeed, all too often--tends to leave out the sorts of things that are important for a happy and cohesive society. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not think that by juggling economic concepts we will get a cure for our present ills, yet that seems to be the approach that is taken on the other side. It leads to all sorts of problems, of course. For example, the attitude taken to unions becomes a very unhappy one if we approach things on the basis of economic rationalism. Clearly, unions restrict the full effect of economic theory that is based on the concept that people are just another cog in the machine, that the only thing that is of worth in any particular person is the commodity he or she supplies--namely, his or her labour. That is a most difficult problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we pursue that line too far we get to the situation that New Zealand now has where industrial legislation is such as to become a moral issue. I do not say that lightly. I am supported in that proposition by the New Zealand Catholic Bishops Conference, which on 19 April made a pastoral statement dealing with the legislation that has been passed in that country in respect of labour relations. The people who passed that are on a personal basis very decent people, but they have been led down the path that they have taken by adopting the theory of economists who have left out the human perspective of people and relied purely on economic rationalism. The legislation that has been passed in New Zealand has brought forth the condemnation of the Bishops Conference. I will quote from paragraph 6 of the conference's statement. It says that this legislative change in New Zealand in respect of the works contract there `is not simply a technical issue'. The passage continues:</PARA>
<PARA>It involves ethics and morality. The question must be asked what the new legislation does to people and society, to human dignity and the common good. As Bishops of New Zealand, we must speak against this proposed legislation as its underlying ideology is contrary to the social doctrines of the Church. Pope Paul VI teaches that, "All social action involves a doctrine. The Christian cannot admit that which is based upon a materialistic and atheistic philosophy". The underlying ideology of the new industrial legislation is unacceptable for two reasons:  firstly, because it emphasises free choice without balancing this concept with concern for the common, that is the public, good; and secondly because it emphasises the rights of the individual without their accompanying duty to act in solidarity and without giving any corresponding rights to the group. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation assumes that the free pursuit of his or her interest by the private individual automatically leads to the public or common good of society. As Bishops, guiding our people in faith and morals, it is our duty to reject this assumption for two reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>The bishops go on to give the two reasons. I will not read those because it would make the quotation too long. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting that the bishops condemn the actions based on the free choice of individuals without balancing this concept with the concern for the common matters of public good, and condemn legislation where it emphasises the rights of individuals, without their accompanying duty to act in solidarity and without giving any corresponding rights to the groups. </PARA>
<PARA>  Madam Acting Deputy President, you sit in the chamber day after day and hear speeches to the effect that individuals should be given encouragement, with which I agree; and if that is to the detriment of other people, a concept with which I do not agree, I am sure you would agree that those concepts being put forward are a matter for concern. One illustration of that is the way in which unions, simply because they are unions, are condemned time and again in this chamber. If the unions go beyond what is reasonable they, like any other group, deserve to be criticised. But, where they are simply upholding the rights of the group as against the individual, they are worthy of praise rather than condemnation because they are acting in light of the concepts put forward by the bishops. </PARA>
<PARA>  I notice that Senator Crane is in the chamber. Perhaps I may use as an illustration what is meant by a particular group, union or persons being condemned. If one looks at the reality of the situation, one sees that the union in question has been criticised not because in this particular case it has frustrated individual rights or ambitions but simply because there has been a wrong assessment of what has happened. The situation at the Camperdown meatworks has been much condemned. The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, particularly the Victorian branch, has been condemned for not allowing the works to open. Today it is pointed out on page 6 of the Herald-Sun, in the right hand corner within a very small compass, that the reason the Camperdown meatworks has not opened is that it has failed to pass an Australian Quarantine Service inspection. According to that article, a list of safety and hygiene issues has to be settled before the meatworks can start work. It will be interesting to see whether the people who condemn the union still persist with the fact that the meatworks should open despite the fact that it has failed to pass the Australian Quarantine Service inspection. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we approach economic activity on the basis that an individual should be able to do what he or she wants to do and the rest of us can go he, are we saying that the works should be open, and what does it matter if it does not meet the health requirements?  In other words, are we saying that, if the individual's rights or wants are the only consideration, what happens to other people who may buy or eat that meat is irrelevant?</PARA>
<PARA>  What I am trying to draw from all this is that, when we go around talking of individuals and of the rights of particular groups rather than looking at the community as a whole, we get ourselves into all sorts of difficulties. That concept has been realised more and more by people who observe these things. For example, I noticed in the Bulletin of 8 October this year, on page 86, an article by Evan Jones, a senior lecturer in the Department of Economics at the University of Sydney, where he has taught for 18 years. Mr Jones has written an article headed `Down with Economists'. He says in that article:</PARA>
<PARA>  There is something about proximity to the engine room of government that has eliminated the academic uncertainties. In the process, a bizarre transformation has occurred. The purveyors of an utterly unreal vision have become major agents of the political process. Economists have parlayed intellectual nonsense into real processes through fusing with a social practice at odds with the vision they espouse so religiously. For all their worldly naivete, economists can unerringly develop an attachment to opinions which attract an elevated status and income. </PARA>
<PARA>  The end result is far from savoury. Economists have become a plague as dangerous as rabbits, prickly pear or cane toads. Economists have become the cultural cane toads of Canberra, oozing over the landscape and endangering myriad indigenous species. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not only the economy but also mental health would be greatly improved if we could lift the fog of obfuscation on things economic. The first step is to take economists from their pedestal and to see them as the curiosities they are. </PARA>

I was getting a little concerned that these economists might hear me and come and deal with me as if I were a cane toad. I was saying that Mr Jones was making the point that as a first step one should take economists from their pedestal and see them as the curiosities they are. He concludes by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The first step to reducing their power is to reduce their legitimacy. </PARA>
<PARA>That sort of thing has been reiterated, in milder terms perhaps, in quite surprising places. For example, in the Weekend Australian of 12 to 13 October 1991, at page 30, John Hyde, who is known very much for his dry politics, has pointed out that economists who simply apply dry theory have become a problem. He has spoken of the need for morality to enter the game and for people to think in larger concepts than simply the economic terms of which they presently talk. </PARA>
<PARA>  The order of the day is that none of us stay too long on our feet. I notice that Senator Crane is about to speak. I hope that in his speech he gives proper weight to the need for the group to act properly; for the unions to defend their workers against the reduction in conditions; for people to think in terms other than the simple dry economics that we have spoken about so far; and for him to realise that we as politicians have to give up simply repeating what economists say and start thinking for ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA>  Economists are like all other experts: we are very suspicious of what they come forward with. There is nobody quite so confident in giving an opinion as an expert, and often there is nobody quite so wrong. What I would like to hear in the rest of this debate is the expression of the true views of people. We should certainly look to economists for help because economists are absolutely essential to the proper development of policy, but they are not the only ones we should be looking to. There are all sorts of other people we can refer to, including bishops. I suppose that I could have quoted statements from other great churchmen to support that proposition, but they are the sorts of people we should certainly be looking to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to speak tonight on the Appropriation Bills and the amendment moved by Senator Short. I have certainly listened with interest to what Senator Cooney had to say. I do not have a problem with people defending their position as long as they defend that position through the due processes of the law and do not start making the laws to suit themselves or abuse the laws when decisions do not go their way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Senator Cooney particularly mentioned the Camperdown meatworks. When that issue was raised with me last week and I was informed of the reasons for the AQIS inspection, I said to the people who raised it with me that they would have to fix up that problem. The answer to Senator Cooney's problem is not to go screaming to the press or trying to create some sort of a fictitious situation. I will stand by that. I will also stand by the belief that those people in our society who belong to a union or an employer association, or do not belong to either, do not have the right to take the law into their own hands or abuse it. This has consistently happened in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before I get to my main points--and I hope that I have something constructive to say tonight--I want to comment on a couple of matters which were raised by previous speakers. Senator Sherry made an incredible statement about the Opposition being in government for eight years and having no retirement incomes policy. Of course, as Senator Knowles pointed out, that is totally incorrect, so I will not spend a lot of time on that point. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to talk briefly about what has happened in the past eight years, because that is the relevant point. When a party is in government, it is in a position to do things to improve the economy and try to solve some of the problems that Senator Cooney raised. However, when a party is in opposition, it can only fiddle away at the edges of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at what I term the human tragedy that we have suffered as a result of the policies of the last eight years. First, I want to address unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, and quote a few figures to illustrate what has occurred over the last eight years as a result of this Government's policies. In Western Australia in the past 12 months there has been a 52 per cent increase in youth unemployment, from 18.1 per cent to 27.6 per cent; in New South Wales, a 69 per cent increase in unemployment from 15.7 per cent to 26.6 per cent; in Victoria, a 48.85 per cent increase; in Queensland, a 15 per cent increase; in South Australia, a 16 per cent increase; and, in Tasmania, a 26 per cent increase. Those figures demonstrate quite clearly what has happened as a result of the Government losing control of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we go a little further and look at bankruptcies in the last 12 months, we find a very similar story--another human tragedy. In Victoria there has been a 71 per cent increase in bankruptcies; in Western Australia, 70 per cent; in New South Wales, 52 per cent; in Queensland, 52 per cent; and, in South Australia, 26 per cent. Another measure of the human tragedy, again as a result of this Government's policies, is the changes for those who have been forced onto unemployment benefit in this country in the past 12 months. I quote some figures from my home State of Western Australia. In Albany there has been a 78 per cent increase in unemployment; in Cannington, 64 per cent; in Innaloo, 72 per cent; and, in Midland, a 64 per cent increase. I could go on quoting figures, but I do not see much point in it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Sherry comes into this chamber and says that we in opposition have no policies. He would do himself a service if he had a look at the result of policies of the Government that he has been part of or that he has supported. When we look at the total situation in Western Australia, we find that the increase in the number of people going onto unemployment benefit is 56 per cent. Of course, the way to overcome that problem is to have economic policies. They are important--we should not downgrade them--if we are to give people in this country some light. These figures are the results of the policies of Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Maguire talked about revenue outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product. I did not quite catch the figures he mentioned, but the message he was trying to give this chamber was that they had been lowered from the last year of the Fraser Government to this year of the Hawke Government. That is true, but it is very selective quoting of figures. When one does that, one runs the risk of destroying one's own argument. I have sought the leave of the Minister at the table to incorporate into Hansard figures from item 6 in Budget Paper No. 1, so that I do not have to read them. I seek leave to have those figures incorporated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the Senate. All the figures for the 10-year period are in the Budget Papers, but I will quote a few. In 1980-81, Commonwealth outlays were 26.7 per cent of GDP and in 1990-91, 27.3 per cent; but in 1984-85 they rose to 31.3 per cent. When we talk about outlays, we cannot just talk about Commonwealth outlays because there have been changing roles in terms of the responsibilities of Commonwealth, State and local governments. In 1985-86 the total outlays of all governments was 42.5 per cent of GDP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  When we look at the revenue figures we find a similar story. When we look at net Public Service borrowings, once again, there is a similar story. It is irresponsible to select figures from these trends and quote them to suit one's own ends because the total picture shows that there are fluctuations from year to year and in different periods of time. In their speeches on this matter, Senator Sherry and Senator Maguire were endeavouring to defend the indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wish now to comment on the farm sector, particularly with regard to wool and wheat. I support the comments of my colleague Senator Panizza. Both of these industries--which are very important for us as a nation in terms of being able to balance our budget--are in total collapse. Even though interest rates have been lowered, they are still a problem. Real interest rates are having an impact on our dollar. In Australia our real interest rate is 7 per cent, in the United States, against which our dollar is primarily aligned, the interest rate is 2 per cent. Until such time as we have policies in place which reduce our real interest rate to the same level as that of the United States, we will not see our dollar in a competitive position with the United States dollar. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is very important that this aspect be addressed. From the information I can collect from economists and people who study these things, it is generally believed that our exports are best able to compete--whether it be wool and wheat, our mining industry or our export manufacturing industry--with the dollar somewhere between 70c and 72c. It is worth noting that each 1 per cent fall in the dollar is worth $150m to agriculture; a similar amount for mining; and approximately $75m for the export manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we had 2 per cent real interest rates--the same as the US--we could expect our dollar to be somewhere in the order of 70c to 72c, and that would mean $3 billion a year additional income to Australia. It would have a very big impact on our ability to address our current account problems, which were highlighted earlier in this debate. It would have a very big impact on our ability as a nation to overcome a lot of our unemployment problems and our bankruptcy problems. It would make an enormous difference to the infrastructure of rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, we would see many more projects becoming internationally competitive. Senator Panizza mentioned resource development earlier tonight. We have debated Marandoo and Yakabindie in this place. I, and other speakers, have raised Robe River and its competitiveness. Robe River was able to achieve that competitiveness by doing two major things. Firstly, it re-organised its management and got rid of weak management; and, secondly, it got rid of an enormous number of crazy work practices. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will give one example of the craziness that existed at Robe River prior to 1987. A car belonging to a member of the management would not start. Another member of management started his car with jumper leads. The electrical union found out the next day and demanded that management dismiss these two people, or the union would go on strike. As a result, three days work was lost because it went on strike. That is an example of the work practices which existed at Robe River that made it non-competitive. We now find that this company has stability in employment, has increased productivity by approximately 320 per cent and is operating at world best practice. It should be the target of all of us to get operations in this country to world best practice, then we will be competitive and can truly address the problems we have with unemployment and the other matters I have raised. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another matter that I want to raise in this debate on the Appropriation Bills is that there have been allocations during the year to the Rural Adjustment Authority. I believe it is time that some lateral thinking was applied to the situation which exists with the Rural Adjustment Authority. It has got itself into a vicious circle. As each downturn comes, those who were efficient operators in industry are financed into taking those supposedly non-efficient people out of the industry. When the next downturn comes around we find that, because of the additional debt loading, suddenly they are at risk and considered to be inefficient producers and forced out of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  Two things could be addressed in terms of assistance to ride out the current situation. The first one is a hard look at part B, which is the area which handles carry-on finance. This is funded 50-50 by the States and the Commonwealth. In my view it is not working, not because the Commonwealth has not put up the money, but because the States, by and large, have not been prepared to match dollar for dollar. Consequently, part B has virtually had its door shut. As I said in Estimates committee hearings the other day, I believe it is essential to look again at part B. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another matter I wish to raise with regard to debt loading is whether there is a role for the Rural Adjustment Authority to be involved in mortgage insurance so that long term stability can be offered during these periodical downturns in agriculture. This is a very important issue and it needs to be extended to include small business that is directly related in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  I shall now comment on the wool industry. Tragically, we have seen wool prices drop markedly over the past month. I believe much of this has been brought about by the fact that there has been an eagerness to sell wool out of the stockpile. Going back to the debate we had about the wool industry--I will certainly not go over it tonight other than to quote one figure--honourable senators will recall that we said there was provision to sell approximately $76m worth in the first year, but there should be no sales from the stockpile before Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA>  That figure was exceeded in the first six weeks of this financial year. It has given the trade a belief that there would be a rush of wool onto the market from the stockpile. While I note that the Wool Realisation Commission has said that in the immediate short term, as from last Friday, it will not put any more wool onto the market, I believe that the horse has bolted and a decision needs to be made by the Commission that it has sold close to $1m out of the stockpile and that no more wool will be released from the stockpile until the market stabilises and the trade gets a feel for the market price of wool. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have covered some detail in my comments tonight. However, some absolutely essential points need to be made alongside some of my previous comments. One concerns the reform of the taxation system to bring back incentive. It is essential that we get rid of the wholesale sales tax and substantially lower income tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to raise another anomaly that has come into the wholesale sales tax arena. That has come from the most recent ruling, No. 3005. It really is a crazy example. In relation to four-wheel drive vehicles for use by agriculturalists--the term has been extended from agriculture to agriculturalists and I assume that it includes shearers and service industries, but that has not yet been determined--a double-cabin utility with a tray qualifies, while a station wagon does not. We find that a truck with a tandem drive axle does, but one which has a lazy axle does not. It certainly appears from that ruling that a prime mover which pulls a trailer does not. I would be pleased to hear from anybody who can tell me the logic behind that decision and how to sort that little lot out, because I do not know what the logic is or and how it could be sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I say that the Budget lacks vision. There is no lateral thinking. It is more of the same, the same policies that have failed. Those failures must be laid fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the ex-Treasurer, Paul Keating, and Prime Minister Hawke. I support the amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I intend to start my speech tonight by being non-controversial and bipartisan.  Initially I want to comment upon the issue of the corruption of our overseas markets through the subsidisation practices that are carried out by other countries. It has saddened me a bit to find that the general public assumes that politicians never agree upon anything, that the disagreement, disharmony and argument portrayed in the media are what happens all the time. On this particular issue, that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I was recently in Coonabarabran and was able to point out to a small group of people whom I met there who were from all political parties that their lower House member--their member in the other place--Senator Brownhill from the other side of this House and I had, on a number of occasions when we have had United States-Australia friendship meetings with members of the US Government or the US Embassy, very emphatically put the point of view for a change from the existing export enhancement program to a free market and to less subsidisation. This pleased these people, who have an interest in primary production and who live in a country town. For once, they were able to learn that politicians do not spend all their time criticising one another, carping and being argumentative. I would not want to attribute blame as to who is responsible for this particular perspective being portrayed, but the media should probably look very much at what they have contributed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The massive subsidisation of farm products from those areas of the European Community and the United States of America is a major concern to all primary producers in Australia and to all Australians. This year the Parliament has seen two bipartisan groups go to both the USA and the EC to bring our concerns to the attention of the members of parliament and the administrations of all those countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  These groups have also been accompanied by representatives of the farmer organisations so that it does not appear that just politicians are speaking; so that it is actually giving farmers a voice and an opportunity to have their point heard. I know that other politicians and some of my colleagues who have visited those counties have used every opportunity to raise that particular issue. I know that I did when I was in England in May this year, much to the squirming and discomfort, I think I would have to say, of some of the politicians there. </PARA>
<PARA>  This support of Australia's membership of the Cairns Group is valuable and must continue. A positive outcome of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is imperative. It is necessary that President Bush recognise the problems that the USA export enhancement scheme is having on Australian farmers. I know that the farmers' leaders will put their case well. I hope their message is heeded. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have recently obtained a copy of a booklet entitled Are you paying too much? which has been produced for the Australian Government for distribution in Australian embassies in our European posts. It asks a number of very pertinent questions which have to be addressed by the Europeans. The first is whether, as consumers, they are paying too much for their food. The price of steak in various countries is listed. In Germany it costs #7.39 a kilo;  in France, #8.49; in the United Kingdom, #11.63;  in Italy, #8.35; and, in Spain, #8.52. In Australia a kilo of steak costs #4.73, proving that we are able to produce the product without the gross subsidisation that those countries go in for at half the price of the product in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also have to look at the impact of this subsidisation on the food prices and the food bills of people in those countries. At least 19 per cent can be added to the food bill of the average household income in France. The common agricultural policy has impacted by adding 32 per cent to the food bill of the average household income in the United Kingdom. The impact on the low income households is magnified much more. In a Spanish low income household, the common agricultural policy has an impact of increasing the food bill by 52 per cent. I ask:  what number of farmers in the EC is the common agricultural policy assisting?  Of all farmers in the EC, 20 per cent are collecting 80 per cent of the subsidies. It is not true for the EC to say that it is providing income support and assistance across the board. Quite patently, it is not happening. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know that visiting members of parliament from any of the participating countries in the CAP and the EC can expect to be questioned at length by Australian politicians about their policies and the reasons why their countries do not see any need to modify their practices. Surely their budgets will run out shortly. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will move on to Budget issues that are a bit more contentious. We have heard today and tonight about the things that we have done wrong as a Government and the things that we have done incorrectly in the Budget. I wait with eager anticipation for the Opposition to put forward precisely what it would do, precisely what its differing tax regime would be and what the impact of that would be upon all people in Australia. We have heard about expenditure being cut. We have heard that the unemployment benefit will be available for only nine months. If that happens people will be cold, hungry and poverty stricken with no income. This, of course, is not a compassionate idea. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wonder what would happen under a coalition government to our national occupational health and safety program and the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. What would happen to farm safety?  There are a number of projects in this area. A number of questions have been asked in this place. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, has advised us of the work which has been carried out to produce a farm safety kit. This has been greeted with a very positive response in many of the farming areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  But it needs to be remembered that one-third of farmers are women and women are often more cautious and more sensible when it comes to the handling of farm implements and farm safety in general. In a number of countries--Canada in particular--it is through women that safety on farms and education programs along those lines have actually been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Women will have a major involvement or interest in two new projects that have been funded this year. The farm safety through women on farms project will develop occupational health and safety management systems for farm work. I might add that farming is the third most dangerous occupation behind mining and, I think, timber milling or something along those lines. The second project will provide information on pesticide use on farms. Several years ago when I did some research and follow-up work on the report Life has never been easy--a rural women's project--I found that a great deal of concern was expressed by the women about the use of pesticides. They were the ones whose husbands, sons and children were becoming ill. This is a most important project; it is one that must not be cut. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another project which started last year and which is going to be continued this year--this has a bit of personal interest for me because, as a former nurse, I come to this place with my bad back--is a major study to evaluate the range of factors, both personal and work-related, thought to be associated with occupational lower back pain. A group of 450 first year nursing students, most of whom are female because nursing is a traditional female job, will be monitored over four years to determine the contribution of a range of factors to the development and progress of occupational lower back pain. As one who suffers from lower back pain, I can testify that I am sure nursing is a major contributing factor to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also wonder what the Opposition would do to the rural access program, a wonderful program which provides finance and places an emphasis on a local approach to solving the problems faced by rural people. This program assists them to gain access to education and training, employment opportunities, health and other services and seeks to stimulate innovation and delivery of services. </PARA>
<PARA>  A number of people contacted my office when they learnt that the rural access program is continuing and has in fact expanded. A third of this funding--$500,000--has been set aside for women's access programs. These have been very popular. Each individual project may not have taken up a lot of money but it has provided a service to particular communities which they themselves have wanted, which they have chosen and which they are going to be able to implement. It has been a very good program for them. </PARA>
<PARA>  The rural counselling program has received an increase in funding. I know of a number of community areas that are looking to make application to commence a rural counselling program. That has to be commended. What would the Opposition do with the Countrylink program? It would want to save money, cut costs and so on. The Countrylink program is very simple:  it is about providing information for rural people; that is, people who live outside the capital cities. This program has in fact been used very well. Rural people have made something like an average of 80 calls a day on the 008 telephone number to find out information about what Commonwealth services are available, where those services are and what their entitlements are. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Rural Book is part of the Countrylink program. This might not mean much to people who live in Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane, but this publication provides information to rural people and reduces their isolation. They now have a 200 page book which lists all of the government departments and includes a brief precis on what they are about. I am sure that, like me, Senator Collins, the Minister at the table, can speak of the great interest that his rural constituents have in the Rural Book and in the Countrylink program. Members of the Opposition do not appear to be too concerned about it.</PARA>

<PARA>  We have had criticism in the Senate of our health policy. I might add that I do not see a health policy from this Federal Liberal Government. The health policy of the State Liberal Government is in such tatters that tomorrow we will see a strike by nurses in New South Wales. I have nursed since 1965 in New South Wales and whilst I recall participating in rallies, I never did so when I was on duty. I might have put a uniform on when I was off duty, but I never participated in rallies when I was on duty. In the history of nursing in that State, I do not recall that there has ever been a strike by nurses. Yet the nurses are so concerned, so fed-up and so frustrated with the policies of that State Liberal Government that they are actually going on strike tomorrow. We are seeing the prospect of small to medium size country towns losing 15 to 20 of their nursing staff from their hospitals. This is what a Liberal Government is. Do not tell me that it is anything other than hypocritical. It has no compassion. It cares less for everybody. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have a delightful amendment to the second reading motion that has been moved by the Opposition. The final part talks about leadership. Is that not wonderful? Opposition senators should come to New South Wales again because there we have Terry Metherell. I am sure Opposition senators would love to talk to Terry Metherell because he has just left the New South Wales Liberal Party. We have the prospect here in the ACT of a new conservative party being formed by breakaway Liberals. We also have the prospect in Western Australia of a new conservative party being formed by breakaway Liberals. </PARA>

He should have a chat to his father because obviously he also has some major disagreements as to what Liberal policy should be. He should not come in here talking about our leadership when his own leadership is bereft. Opposition members cannot agree among themselves and they do not have the decency and the courage to put forward an alternative Budget. They are going to wait until the Prime Minister is overseas; they do not have the courage to do it while the leader is here. They wait until people are called away or are overseas actually doing business, caring for this nation and representing the Commonwealth and the States.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Appropriation Bills before the Senate tonight deal with the expenditure for the forthcoming financial year. I wish to restrict my comments tonight to the Department of Defence and I will deal with one or two topics in that area. I have transferred what I can from the committee stage into the second reading debate in order to save time at the committee stage. I feel quite strongly that the purpose of the Estimates committees is to allow the exploration by the Senate of the Estimates in a dedicated setting and not to re-run the debate in the committee stage in the chamber wherever that can be avoided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The first topic I want to talk about is one that we have already discussed in some detail in the Estimates committees, that is, the way the Government is proceeding to buy roughly 100 light armoured vehicles--the LAVs. A light armoured vehicle is a vehicle which has minimal armoured protection for the crew and the soldiers within it. It has some offensive and defensive fire power capability. It is generally used for reconnaissance, observation and transport--either troops or stores. Of course, once one has one vehicle in that role, it is usual to develop a series of other vehicles for more specialised roles using the same basic design for ambulances, stores transports, recovery vehicles, command post vehicles and things such as that. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the arguments that is quite strong in armoured circles is whether one equips these vehicles with wheels or tracks. The arguments on that are endless. Track vehicles, with a caterpillar track like a tractor, handle most rough terrain--not all--much better than any wheeled vehicle. When one is in closely timbered country, again, a track vehicle is much more handy because its turning circle is really quite tight. One can lock a track and the vehicle will turn, whereas most wheeled armoured fighting vehicles have a very prodigious radius and one needs something like an airfield to turn them around. That is a bit of exaggeration, but the important point from a tactical point of view is that concealment is better with a track vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA>  Track vehicles do much better in wet conditions. They are usually better armoured. They are usually a bit more robust mechanically. The difficulty is that they are always slow. Track vehicles are limited to the low speed regime and the solution to that is to mount them on trucks and transporters and one can move them over quite large distances rapidly that way. </PARA>
<PARA>  Conversely, wheeled vehicles are very fast on roads. Speeds in excess of 100 or 110 kilometres for modern generation wheeled armoured fighting vehicles are not uncommon. That is not much use on the battlefield, but from a reconnaissance point of view it does enable one to cover very great distances quite rapidly. A unit such as 2 Cavalry, which is deployed in barracks in the eastern part of Darwin, can deploy quite rapidly to somewhere like Kununurra and, of course, the vehicles can operate alone in that role. They provide a more comfortable ride for their crews. The disadvantage is that they all bog in the wet; they are really quite useless in wet conditions. They tend to be more vulnerable mechanically and not as robust as track vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>  My preference is for track vehicles because I think that if one is serious about using vehicles on the battlefield in all that debris and with all the variations in terrain, tracks are the only way to go. I do not deny that there is a place for wheeled fighting vehicles within the Australian Army. </PARA>
<PARA>  Talking to members of the ADF and the Department of Defence at the Estimates hearings, I found it rather sad that there seems to be no institutional history in the Australian defence forces at the present time. They remember names like Gallipoli, Vietnam and the great battles of the past. But when one is talking to the present members of the Department, whether they are in uniform or in civilian garb, there seems to be no recognition that Australia has had some considerable experience over the past 40 or 50 years with wheeled fighting vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the end of World War II we had Staghounds and in the 1950s and 1960s we had a range of British armoured fighting vehicles. The experience of those was all unsatisfactory. It was unsatisfactory because of tyre damage experienced once the vehicles got off roads and because of suspension and transmission problems. It is no coincidence that those same problems are plaguing, and are the dominant feature of, the trials that have been done on the current light armoured fighting vehicle that is under consideration at present. </PARA>
<PARA>  How did we come to get these vehicles? They were foreshadowed in the Defence of Australia White Paper of 1987. Somehow or other that got translated into fact. There is now a requirement for the defence forces to have them. My own part in this is that in the Estimates Committee hearing of 10 October 1989 I noticed an appropriation of $25m for the purchase of 15 LAV25 vehicles. Having had a long experience with the Department of Defence and having followed its estimates for many years, I knew that there had been no prior appropriation. The one characteristic of the Defence Department is that it is extraordinarily ponderous in coming to a decision. There might be anywhere between 15 and 20 committees and a 10-year work-up time before a project gets approved. Yet the Department got approval for $25m with no prior warning at all in the previous Estimates hearings. </PARA>
<PARA>  The truth of the matter was that the Minister of the day, Mr Beazley, had been in America, where he was given a ride in one of these vehicles and a very strong sales spiel about them. So we bought them, just like that. As I said at the time, my fear was not that $25m had been spent; my fear was that the purchase of these 15 vehicles would lead to the purchase of some hundreds. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sadly, that has now come to pass because the current order is for around 100 vehicles at a project figure of $260m plus. It is worth looking at that because $260m-odd is a considerable sum of money and I think that by the time we finish with these vehicles it will be doubled or trebled. Furthermore, what we are buying here is something that the Australian defence forces are going to use for the next 25 years. More important than that, somebody might have to fight in them. That is why we buy defence equipment. So there is a good reason to think about what we are doing. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the Estimates hearings, I asked a number of questions about the performance of these vehicles in the trials. The Minister was good enough to supply me with a full final report of the evaluation team. I am grateful for that. I do not propose tonight to introduce any material from that report, which is confidential. What I am saying tonight is material that I derived from inquiry at the hearings and it is all on the public record. I just want to emphasise some matters. </PARA>
<PARA>  I summarise by saying about the armoured fighting vehicle that, first, the trials have shown that it is absolutely useless in wet weather. It bogs in the area in which it is going to be used, the northern Australian, Northern Territory area. It bogs because it has a very high wheel pressure on the ground. It is not good enough to say, as the Army does, that any enemies we might have operating in that area will also bog with wheeled vehicles. People with tracks will get by in a number of cases where no wheeled vehicle will move at all. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second great disability with the vehicle is that it has very limited off-road capability. It is worth pointing out that driving around big cattle stations and sheep stations in the rural environment in passenger cars and in light four-wheel drive vehicles is quite a different matter from military operations. It is different for this reason: on a property one is nearly always driving on some set of tracks. It is a prepared road that might have been prepared with a grader 20, 30 or even 50 years ago, but there is always some sort of surface. The track will not be bituminised, curbed and channelled and all the rest of it, but at least it bears some semblance to a roadway. </PARA>
<PARA>  When military wheeled vehicles are operated on rocky or broken ground, over areas that have been subject to bushfires or that have stakes and sticks and things like that, their tyres are enormously vulnerable to damage. Evidence was given to the Committee that 139 tyres were damaged in the trials. The interesting thing is that, while the gross mileage was quite high, the off-road mileage in which the tyres were damaged was really quite small. One is looking at a cost of about $600 per tyre. These vehicles have eight tyres each, so 140 tyres are enormously expensive. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third significant feature of the vehicle is its habitability. Senator Collins would take a great interest in this, in being locked up in a little steel box in the Northern Territory. Evidence was given that ambient temperature within the vehicles was 55 degrees centigrade. I would not want to sit too long in a vehicle at 55 degrees, let alone all day and then have to get out and fight at the end of it. Not only are human beings in there at 55 degrees; all their food, all their ammunition, all their water and all their fuel is also at 55 degrees because the whole structure is heated up. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the characteristics of this vehicle was that it was built for NATO operations on the huge number of paved roads in the European theatre. Of course, it has heaters in it, not air-conditioners. The habitability of the vehicle in the circumstances we face with recorded temperatures of 55 degrees centigrade--which is about 130 degrees fahrenheit on the old scale--is beyond consistent human endurance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fourth and very significant feature of these vehicles is that, when they are fitted out the way the Army wants them, they exceed the designed all-up weight of the vehicle. On another important area, their armour protection is really quite minor, and one of the anecdotal stories about the trials is that a 7.62 round, which is the standard round of the SLR rifle, which is now going out of use in the Australian Army, pierced the upper deck of one of these trial vehicles. A witness at the Committee hearing confirmed that a round had gone through, although he could not confirm how it got through or what damage it did. The armour protection is quite minimal. </PARA>
<PARA>  The good points are that the LAV is fast on roads. It will do 100 to 110 kilometres per hour. When the high temperatures are excluded, it is much kinder to ride in than the M113 that it replaces. The LAV25, which is the offensive LAV, has a very good weapon on it. The 25-millimetre gun was originally a Hughes Bushmaster gun; it is now a McDonnell Douglas gun. It is an excellent support weapon, but one does not have to buy the chassis that goes underneath it to buy the gun. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problems with the vehicle do need solving. Habitability demands the installation of an air-conditioner, which would increase the weight by about 200 kilograms, as it would have to be a pretty sizeable conditioner. The wet weather problem will never be solved with a wheel design. The tyre problem, I believe, can be fixed. The problem with the tyres is that stakes go through the sidewalls. I do not think it would be beyond Australian industry capability, if no other tyres exist in the world, to design a tyre with adequate sidewall protection for that. </PARA>
<PARA>  The matter of armoured protection cannot be dealt with simply, because again we get back to the all-up weight of the vehicle. The APC, the troop-carrying version of the LAV, does not have any protection for the machine gun. This is a vehicle that is not in a primary offensive role, but it does have to have some defensive capability and needs a turret, even if only to mount a 50 calibre machine gun. Putting on any kind of turret could increase the weight by 600 kilograms or more. </PARA>
<PARA>  The gross vehicle operating weight is only 12,800 kilograms. More importantly, with its eight-wheel design, it has a maximum design load of 3,400 kilograms per axle. If that is increased, the possibility of structural failure is quite high. The increased all-up weight of the vehicle resulting from the provision of better armoured protection and things like the air-conditioning system that it needs would require a major redesign of the vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is why the Estimates committee hearings are important. We are required to ensure that the Commonwealth gets value for money. The critical thing that came out of the examination of the Department of Defence on the LAVs was that the vehicle needs extensive modifications. My estimate is that between 60 and 70 modifications are required for that vehicle to make it fit for Australian service. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second factor that arose from the inquiry was that there was no hurry. It turns out that just as Mr Beazley was an impulsive buyer of the vehicle when we bought the first 15, he also drove through the requirement to buy the next 100, to equip 2 Cavalry before it went to Darwin. It would be nice for 2 Cavalry to go to Darwin with the LAV, but it is in no sense essential. It could do the task in the present circumstance quite well with its M113s and with Unimogs. We could well afford to spend a year or two doing the modification program that will have to be done in any case. </PARA>
<PARA>  The final question I put to the witnesses at the hearings was on Australian manufacture. I found the answers very interesting and they need to be tested. I am sure the answers were given to the Committee in good faith; I am not implying otherwise. However, the dismissal of the possibility of building these vehicles in Australia is misinformed. One of the decent things this Government has done has been to build what defence equipment it can within Australia. All services have a great desire to buy overseas and unload the gear off the ship and then put it into uniform under the Australian flag. It is much better for us to build what we can within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Perhaps the present Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is a bit too trusting of the advice he gets from the Department on this vehicle. One of the great tragedies for Australian industry and one of the great mistakes of this Government, while it has been prepared to buy overseas, is the cancellation of Project Waler, which was to build an armoured fighting vehicle within Australia. It started under the Fraser Government, and millions of dollars were spent on it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have no doubt in my mind that if Waler had gone ahead, the first two, three or four versions of the Australian-built armoured fighting vehicle would have been failures. But I am sure that by the time we got to the fourth or fifth, we would have had a good vehicle, which would have been very useful in the Australian circumstance and, most importantly, would have created an armoured engineering capability within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  An armoured engineering capability is not too common amongst the world's nations; only a handful of nations have it. If we are to operate armoured vehicles, which are necessary on the battlefield, it helps to have the capacity within the country to support them through their life. The cancellation of Waler was one of the great mistakes of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other certainty is that while we are to buy roughly 100 LAVs in the first instance, the order could well expand to 200 or more over the years. I remember that when the M113s came in the initial buy was really quite small, and then it was extended over the years in dribs and drabs until, ultimately, we ended up with somewhere in excess of 860 M113s in the Australian inventory.</PARA>
<PARA>  Evidence was given to the Committee that there was serious consideration given to the building of these vehicles within Australia. I can find no evidence at all that there was any consideration or consultation with Australian manufacturing industry about building them. It never went to advertisement. There was never a request for tender or a calling for expressions of interest. I do not believe the evidence that Australian industry was consulted on this. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most damning evidence, though, was that there was a cost penalty of $45m on what was roughly a $250m contract for building them within Australia. The evidence was that there was a $10m licence fee, $20m to $25m for tooling and setting up and $15m for the prototype. I do not know about a licence fee, but I do not think General Motors, the manufacturer in Canada, is in much of a condition to bargain with us on licence fees. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have already paid $25m for 15 vehicles--they are in the country. At the end of the day, the vehicle we are going to use will be similar to look at but totally different mechanically from those which we have been sold. We have a very strong hand in negotiating with General Motors, in that if it does not come to a reasonable agreement on licensing, we can go ahead and build the vehicle here ourselves. I do not see there is any problem with that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not know how the figure of $20m to $25m for tooling up was arrived at. It is very high. However, we will have to buy a considerable amount of tooling to support this vehicle through 25 years of its service life. So that expenditure is inevitable. The final cost of $10m to build six prototypes is absolutely wrong. There is no need for us to build prototypes for this vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would most strongly advise the Government to look at the possibility of building the LAVs in Australia. I believe that the technology involved is not beyond us. If we can weld submarine hulls, we can weld the hulls for armoured fighting vehicles. We have to do an expensive and extensive modification on them to fit them for Australian service. We might as well do that on the assembly line rather than try to do it later. If we build them in Australia, not only do we keep the money within the country but we also create an armoured engineering capability. We have to modify our M113s, which are a first generation APC, at a later date and the requirement is always with us to have armoured fighting vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>  The next topic I want to deal with is the Nomad aircraft. Recently, an RAAF Nomad on approach to Tindal became virtually uncontrollable and suffered severe structural damage. The Nomad fleets in the Army and the Air Force have been grounded ever since. The Nomad is an Australian-designed aircraft--designed nearly 20 years ago. Conceptually, it is quite a primitive design. It was not a success commercially when attempts were made to sell the civil version. Furthermore, the Australian Government had to make a substantial out of court payment to its North American agents as a consequence of contractual failures with respect to North American sales. </PARA>
<PARA>  Briefly, it appears that this aeroplane has a significant aerodynamic problem. That is manifested by longitudinal instability whenever the airflow is interrupted over the main wing. In the particular incident at Tindal, it is said that either an engine cowl was cracked and partially lifted or the cowling was partially secured--I do not know. When the Nomad aircraft was in the landing configuration on the approach to Tindal, it developed its well known characteristic of longitudinal instability. It was pitching at a high frequency, allegedly to such a degree that the pilots could not read the instruments. It was virtually out of control. The pilots managed to regain control of the aircraft and landed it. The aeroplane suffered considerable structural damage. </PARA>
<PARA>  The significance of this is that, from the date of the inception of Nomad, this aerodynamic problem, the longitudinal instability, has been known. There has been no fix aerodynamically for these shortcomings in the flight envelope. A modification program has been designed to beef up the structure so that when the high frequency pitching occurs the tailplane does not fail structurally. But that does not cure the aerodynamic problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is high time that the Government evaluated the Nomad. It is time that the initial tests for the Aeronautical Research Laboratory of DSTO were made public. In the first place, we need to know whether there is a problem and, secondly, whether there is a fix. If there is no fix, let us withdraw the aircraft from service. It is grossly unfair that the Australian Army, which is the big user of the Nomad--it has 15 or 16 and is getting another 10--should be required to operate an aeroplane which has unsafe characteristics in parts of its flight envelope. </PARA>
<PARA>  I emphasise that this aeroplane is not essential to us from a military point of view. It fulfils a basic, limited transport role which a number of other aircraft could fill quite well. While I am on the subject of other aircraft playing those sorts of roles, I am astonished that the Army is going to get rid of the Porter aircraft and keep the Nomads. The Porter is an extremely useful aircraft for the Army. It has a very robust airframe and an excellent engine. It is purpose-built for Army cooperation work. However, the evidence given to the Committee by the Deputy Chief of the General Staff with regard to the Porter was far from convincing. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not believe it is correct that lives should be put at risk by using non-essential equipment like that. In all the years I have been in the Parliament, I have believed that the equipment bought for the Services should not always be the most expensive, but people must have a chance of surviving with it if it is used in combat. I do not think lives ought to be put at risk in any way at all when alternatives which are far safer are available. From all of the evidence that has been put before the Parliament, there are far better aircraft around than the Nomad. As a matter of urgency, the Government should consider whether that aircraft ought to be retained within the Australian inventory. </PARA>
<PARA>  The final point I want to deal with is a matter of policy. Over the last few years, the Government has been talking about closer links with New Zealand in the defence field. At the RUSI conference which was held in Canberra last month, the Chief of the Defence Force made a very worrying speech forecasting closer integration with the New Zealand defence forces. I am the first person to support defence cooperation in the form of regional alliances. I have said many times in the Senate that the security of Australia depends on the security of the region, not primarily on the strength of our own defence forces. Everything should be done, both diplomatically and through defence cooperation programs, to ensure the regional support, alliances and interoperability of our defence forces with those of our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA>  But there is a world of difference between cooperation and integration. I am quite sure that the CDF was motivated and pushed into this by Government policy. What the CDF is saying when he says that the Australian defence forces will integrate with those of New Zealand is that the Government policy outlined in DOA 1987--the White Paper entitled Defence of Australia which is the guiding light for this Government--is now a total failure. It is a clear statement that the Government is now unable to fund Australian defence as defined in DOA 1987. We have run up the white flag on funding for the Australian Defence Force as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is really a very stupid decision. New Zealand is not Australia. It is a different country; it is different ethnically, culturally and industrially. It has an outlook on the world and a place in the world that is totally different from that of Australia. It has an extremely insular view. New Zealand broke its defence alliance with Australia, in the form of the ANZUS treaty, some years ago and it has not made any attempt to re-establish it. I think it is absolutely nonsensical, as well as being highly dangerous, for Australia to integrate our Defence Force with that of New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA>  By all means let us cooperate and have interoperability; let us have an understanding of how we would both work in an emergency. But let us not transfer the security of Australia to a second country, even if it is one of our close neighbours like New Zealand. New Zealand does not value its own defence. It spends far less on it, as a percentage of its GDP, than we do. The proposition advanced by this Government--that somehow we can make one Defence Force out of two defence forces by incorrectly and inadequately funding the separate defence forces in each country--is nonsense and it ought to be condemned out of hand. </PARA>

<PARA>  Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA>  The question read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>  Assuming the Government had the information when it made the Budget Medicare decisions, will the Minister table in the Senate before it rises tonight, firstly, the percentage per capita growth for each quarter compared with the previous quarter, from March 1980 to June 1991, in general practice services for cardholders and non-cardholders separately; and, secondly, will he supply the absolute number for each quarter on the same basis? If, on the other hand, Cabinet made its decision ignorant of those critical facts will he table them before the Senate rises next? Finally, will he table the same figures for the September quarter 1991, which Cabinet obviously did not have when the decision was made?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In answer to a question asked by Senator Walsh, I provide the following answer from the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). I will read the answer, but there are attachments in the form of quite complex tables which, for obvious reasons, I will not be able to read.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Data covering services for the population as a whole are not available for the pre-Medicare period referred to in the question; not all Australian residents were eligible for Commonwealth benefits in the pre-Medicare period. A table showing the number of general practitioner attendances, the number of general practitioner attendances per capita and the percentage change in the number of general practitioner attendances per capita, by quarter, from the September quarter 1984 to the September quarter 1991, is attached. The source is the quarter of processing data files maintained by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services.</PARA>
<PARA>  Data is not available on the utilisation of services by cardholders as distinct from non-cardholders. However, estimates were made as part of the decision making process. Care should be exercised in interpreting quarter on quarter movements in data in the attached table due to the impact of seasonality--utilisation reaches a peak each year in the September quarter.</PARA>
<PARA>  The attached table shows that, between 1989-90 and 1990-91, general practitioner attendances declined by 0.3 per cent--1.7 per cent on a per capita basis. This followed increases of 6 per cent, 5.7 per cent and 6.3 per cent in the years 1987-88 to 1989-90. Between 1989-90 and 1990-91, short general practitioner consultations declined by 20 per cent, standard consultations declined by one per cent, long consultations increased by 21</PARA>
<PARA>per cent and prolonged consultations increased by 15 per cent. Preliminary data for 1991-92 indicates a growth of 4.3 per cent in general practitioner attendances in the September quarter 1991 compared with the September quarter 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>  The reasons for the trend in 1991 are difficult to determine precisely since the description of attendance items in the Medicare benefits schedule do not make it readily apparent as to why people attend medical practitioners. The impact of PBS pensioner co-payments may have had an impact. In 1990-91, there were nine million fewer scripts than estimated. The co-payment could have accounted for two to three million fewer general consultations in that year.</PARA>
<PARA>  In 1989-90, press reports indicated a very significant impact of influenza on the community. This, and the associated influenza immunisation campaign, may have meant that the number of services in 1989-90 was significantly higher than it might have otherwise been. The trend in 1990-91 may have reflected a return to a more normal situation. A further possible reason for the situation in 1989-90 could reflect the one-off hepatitis B immunisation campaign by Smith, Kline and French which ceased in 1990-91 following criticism by peer companies.</PARA>
<PARA>  The impact of influenza on the utilisation of medical services in 1989-90 meant that the rate of utilisation of services in that year was not typical. There is no reason to believe that the longer term trend in the rate of utilisation of services would not have continued--services are already up 4.3 per cent this year on the same period last year--had it not been for the recently announced Budget decisions. I seek leave to incorporate the accompanying attached tables of statistics in Hansard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise in the adjournment debate tonight to enlarge on a couple of matters which I raised in the matters of public interest debate last Thursday with respect to Robe River. I want to set the background to some of the information that I gave in the debate on Thursday, because I did not include a lot of detail. In doing that--and in leading up to the dates that were given in this chamber by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in terms of hearings and dismissed hearings and in answer to questions asked both by Senator Crowley and I--I reiterate that the reason I am doing this is purely and simply that I made a very serious charge against the Minister last Thursday in that I claimed that the Minister had misled the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There were two major factors in the lead-up to the dispute: first, weak management and, secondly, what I would term the abuse of union power. I shall give an example of what led to some of the problems at Robe River. I will not mention names because I do not want to denigrate or bring individuals back into the matter, but it is important that accuracy in what is said be maintained in this place. </PARA>
<PARA>  A matter which led to the blow-up was a power house superintendent, who was a staff man and not a member of the union, finding an electrical fault caused by an alternator trip. It resulted in the loss of power to the community. It was assumed that it occurred as a result of a lightning strike. Mr Knapp simply pressed a switch which reset the circuit breaker and restored power to the community. Under one of the restrictive work practices that then existed, only ETU tradesmen were entitled to reset a circuit breaker. However, on this day the ETU was taking part in a 24-hour strike as part of a national ACTU protest day for a 2.5 per cent wage increase and 3 per cent superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a result, considerable delay would have been experienced in restoring power to the community. All that Mr Knapp did was in fact press the switch and set the power back into the town. There was a demand that Mr Knapp be disciplined with a five-day suspension for performing wages work. The company conceded to the ETU's demand and suspended Mr Knapp for two days. The ETU went on strike for six days, claiming that the suspension was inadequate. In raising this matter, I am highlighting the point that there was a very serious situation at Robe River then. I guess it was like land on a very hot day when everything is tinder dry and someone drops a match. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other point I want to make is that there is more to the matter than just an appeal being lodged or a day being nominated. I emphasise quite clearly that the answers to the questions are, among other things, a misuse, an overuse or a vexatious use of the appeals process or the processes which then existed through the Industrial Relations Commission. It is worth noting that in most of the cases, in the call for hearings, the applications, the stay of proceedings or the appeals, the unions and the company just about ran a line ball. There has not, in my view, been an overuse of the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission by either party towards the disputes that existed. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is worth noting that the appeal, resulting from a hearing on 5 May 1989, was lodged on 13 June 1989. That was the first case that the Minister mentioned. The hearing was brought by the AIMPE and was a claim for reinstatement of a particular employee. There was a further hearing in the matter, once again brought on by the AIMPE, for the reinstatement of this gentleman on 15 May. On 13 June the appeal was lodged by CLS. The appeal--the one that the Minister claimed was dismissed--was heard finally on 26 September 1989. At that time the appeal was withdrawn. It is worth noting that the appeal was withdrawn at that time with the consent of the union. It was not dismissed, as the Minister claimed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other matter that I wish to raise tonight concerns the appeal which related to the particular case that the Minister chose not to mention. That case began as a result of an award made by Commissioner Fogarty with regard to the same employee in the employ of CLS. The decision brought down reinstated that gentleman. The case was heard on 21 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>  We then move to 28 July 1989, to the appeal that was lodged by CLS against the decision of Commissioner Fogarty. A stay was granted on the award brought down on 21 July, which enabled a later date to be set down for the hearing. We finally get to 26 September--the appeal was heard on the same day as the previous case I mentioned--when the decision, by leave of the Commission and, with the consent of the unions, the award was set aside and therefore there was no point in continuing the case. </PARA>
<PARA>  In outlining these cases and the position which existed at Robe River, although it was a tinder box situation--there had been some stupidity, some weak management--it is most important to point out, having regard to the charge that I raised against the Minister last week, that the 13 June 1989 date was withdrawn, and the case which the Minister chose to ignore, by leave of the Commission, and with the consent of the unions, the reinstatement award against the appeal was lodged, was set aside. </PARA>

<PARA>my colleague Senator Crane and the question that another of my colleagues, Senator Panizza, asked in Question Time today. I do so to highlight the sorts of tactics and hypocrisy that the Government relies upon. On 5 September, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) quite deliberately set up a question from Senator Crowley with the direct objective of maligning Robe River Mining. It is a company which has improved its productivity by some 400 per cent and a company which has become more productive at a time when the Government, in its rhetoric, says that we need improved productivity but which requires, by its actions, the unions and its mates to be protected at all times. </PARA>
<PARA>  I note in reading the Hansard of 5 September that, after Senator Crowley got up and read out her poor turgent question as a pawn of Senator Cook, he got up to speak wearing his trade union hat. I read that I stood on a point of order and asked Mr President whether he would ask the Minister to inform the Senate whether he was speaking as a Minister of the Crown or as a paid up union employee. Quite clearly, his whole attitude to the question of Robe River has been to try to malign the company and to purport to say that there has been a conspiracy when there has not. </PARA>
<PARA>  Anyone who understands where Senator Cook comes from understands that this is a backgrounding exercise to attempt to bring about an alteration to change again the industrial relations situation away from the real reforms that were initiated during the Fraser period, when we got rid of secondary boycotts. Fortunately, the Australian Democrats have had sufficient sense to date to show that they had some spine in rejecting the Labor Government's attempts to try to shore up its union mates. It was important that sense prevailed and that those two important reforms that were brought in during the Fraser years remained on the statute books. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was interesting that, in asking questions, Senator Crane gave Senator Cook the opportunity to correct his record. Senator Crane spoke in the Thursday lunchtime debate and outlined where Senator Cook had misled the Senate. </PARA>

The logical extension of that ruling if it were meant in the way that I think the Minister expects you to rule--as distinct from the way that, perhaps, if you see it differently you would choose to rule--is that the most blatant misleading of the Senate would be that nobody could say that somebody had misled the Senate when clearly he had. I am putting it to you, Mr Deputy President, that I shall deal with the facts. I shall deal with the assertions made by Senator Cook and I shall deal with the facts as they are on the record. You will see that I am substantiating a statement that I have made that is not unparliamentary--the language is not improper. I am saying that the actions of the Minister in attempting to malign a particular company have, indeed, misled the Senate.

I shall deal with how Senator Cook said that on 6 September 1990 an appeal which was lodged, not by Robe River, as Senator Cook said, but by a subsidiary of Robe River, was dismissed. The facts of the matter are that the appeal was not dismissed. It was in fact decided in favour of the subsidiary of Robe River. It was a finding in favour of the subsidiary of Robe River and not the union. On 13 June 1989 Senator Cook said that an appeal was dismissed. It was not in fact dismissed; it was withdrawn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On 5 and 8 October Senator Cook said that three appeals were dismissed. There were in fact only two appeals, not three. Bear in mind that Senator Cook chose to set up this question to put this information on the record, and it is wrong. It was not a question in answer to which he had to try to remember the facts off the top of his head; it was material that he had deliberately prepared, brought into this chamber and set up a question about so that he might malign a company. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The point is that the Minister chose to create a phoney opportunity to place false information on the record with the aim of maligning a company, with the aim of trying to make an avenue for himself to attempt to again change the industrial relations laws to make people the captive of the unions, of which he was a paid up employee and a paid trade union official. It is significant when we look at the record, the rhetoric and the humbug that the Minister indulges in that we are not well served; that the industrial relations of this nation are in poor hands. Until such time as we see a change of government and we see some decent policies in place, the sort of productivity that this country needs to get out of its trouble will not be seen at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  My colleague Senator Crane has given an opportunity to the Minister to apologise to the Senate and to the company. Senator Panizza again today gave Senator Cook the opportunity to make an apology. It will be interesting to see whether he has the decency to do so. We will wait with interest in the course of this week to see whether he chooses to set the record right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to speak in this debate not on a matter of mean-spiritedness as did the previous speaker, but to pay tribute to Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the Burmese opposition party who today was awarded the Nobel peace prize for her efforts in trying to achieve democracy through peaceful means in her country of Burma.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I do not think that there is a more fitting person in the world today to receive the Nobel peace prize than Aung San Suu Kyi. I had the opportunity to meet her briefly when I visited Burma in early 1989. I may well be the only member of the Australian Parliament to have met her since she returned to Burma in 1988. It was only a brief meeting, but she certainly impressed me as a person of extraordinary moral courage, great political ability and considerable charisma. Obviously she is the outstanding leader in her country.</PARA>
<PARA>  Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of the founder of modern Burma, General Aung San, who was tragically assassinated in 1947 just as Burma was about to become independent. She lived much of her life outside Burma as a result of the military coup in the early 1960s and only returned to Burma in 1988 as her mother was dying from cancer. It was during that period that the massive demonstrations took place in Burma in which the Burmese people demanded democracy. For several months it looked as though they would succeed in their demands for the establishment of democratic rule, but the Burmese Army conducted a coup and, in a wave of oppression in which several thousand people were murdered during the middle of 1988, the democracy movement was crushed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Aung San Suu Kyi continued the campaign for democracy, despite the military coup. On some occasions she addressed rallies in Rangoon, which estimates indicate that more than a million people attended. She quickly became the recognised leader of the National League for Democracy, the main opposition party. During the several months she was allowed freedom in early 1989, she campaigned all over Burma and received mass support from the Burmese people. </PARA>
<PARA>  Aung San Suu Kyi made serious and quite correct criticisms of the military junta that ran the country which led in July 1989 to her being placed under house arrest in her own home in Rangoon and cut off from contact with members of her own party, family friends, and international diplomats. The military junta thought that, with her imprisonment, the National League for Democracy would wither away and that the promised free elections would mean that the party it supported would sweep in at the elections. </PARA>
<PARA>  The elections were held in May 1990 and, to the astonishment of the military junta, the people overwhelmingly in a landslide result elected the National League for Democracy with something like 400 of the 470-odd seats in the National Assembly. Because the result was so overwhelming, the junta has since refused to accept the legitimacy of the result and has kept not only Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest but has arrested most of the remaining leaders of the National League for Democracy and anybody else who dares criticise its rule. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is now estimated by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations that many thousands of people are held as political prisoners on trumped up charges, or sometimes even without charges. There are reports of the appalling use of torture and of the general mistreatment of prisoners. Throughout all this period--now over two years--while under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi has refused to give in to the military junta. She has consistently made it clear to the junta that she will not leave the country. Members of the junta have made offers to her that they would let her leave the country quietly, but she said she would not unless all political prisoners were released and she had an opportunity to make a major statement to the Burmese people. </PARA>
<PARA>  Aung San Suu Kyi has also suggested quite cleverly that if she is to leave the country, she wants the right to walk from her house to the Rangoon airport before she departs. Members of the junta know as well as she does that during that walk most of the people in Rangoon would turn out in support of her. That may be the catalyst for the overthrow of the military junta by the people. It is interesting that one person who nominated Aung San Suu Kyi for the Nobel Peace Prize is one of the other great democrats in the world today, the Czechoslovakian President, Vaclav Havel, a person who fought for many years for the restoration of democracy in Czechoslovakia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that this Parliament should pay tribute to Aung San Suu Kyi. I do note that previously in this chamber the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has consistently raised the issue of human rights abuses in Burma and made it very clear that the Australian Government does not support the present junta; has raised the issue in the United Nations of human rights abuses; and has raised the issue with ASEAN and other countries to put pressure on the Burmese regime to recognise the legitimately elected government, that is, the National League for Democracy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I must also mention that this is a bipartisan approach. The Opposition in this Parliament has also made its views known very clearly in support of Aung San Suu Kyi and the restoration of democracy. Senator Hill and I share the distinction that both of us have been refused a visa to visit Burma in the past 12 months because both of us have made statements in this place in favour of democracy and human rights. I hope that tomorrow or in the next few days the Senate could carry a unanimous resolution of congratulation to Aung San Suu Kyi on winning the Nobel Peace Prize today. She joins an illustrious company of great human beings in the last half century who have won the Nobel Peace Prize, such as Desmond Tutu and Martin Luther King--all of them dedicated to the issue of democracy, human rights and freedom. </PARA>
<PARA>  Aung San Suu Kyi, who may not be very well known in this country, is one of the great champions of democracy in Asia. Her success today in winning the Nobel Peace Prize will be an enormous morale boost to the people of Burma when they hear the news. Though I suspect that the military regime will make every effort to hide from the Burmese people the news that she has won the prize, the word will spread through international short wave radio, such as Radio Australia, Voice of America, the BBC Overseas Service, and Radio India. The fact that she has won the prize will be an enormous blow to the prestige of the Burmese Government for, as low as that prestige may be, it is a very significant step for the Burmese people on their long struggle for democracy. I hope that in the near future members of this Parliament will be able to recognise Aung San Suu Kyi openly as the democratically elected Prime Minister of her country with the full support of her people. It is a great night for democracy in the world that Aung San Suu Kyi has won the Nobel Peace Prize. </PARA>

I have searched through the literally hundreds of precedents contained in Odgers and I can find no previous instance when such a claim in the course of debate was ruled out of order.

Mr Deputy President, when you are addressing the request that has been made of you by the Leader of the Opposition, I ask you to take into account standing order 193(3), rules of debate, which makes it very clear that the ruling that you made some 20 minutes ago is very much within the anticipation of that standing order.

<PARA>I draw your attention to the very carefully worded points of debate that were raised by Senator Bishop.

Senator Bishop very carefully put forward a number of well established points and facts that contributed to the debate. Any motives of the Minister were clearly outlined in accord with the facts and the information that was available in the Hansard and on the occasion of the previous debate. Therefore, I certainly join with Senator Hill in asking you to outline clearly the basis on which you considered that Senator Bishop's comments may in any way have been contrary to the Standing Orders. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Reform of land transport is a continuing process rather than a finite project or plan.  It covers a range of issues including vehicle and road user regulation, road use charging, road and rail infrastructure funding, rail organisation and management and the relationships between Federal, State and local government.</PARA>
<PARA>  Managing change in land transport is a major component of the Land Transport Program in the portfolio.  There has been significant activity in this area over recent years including:</PARA>
<PARA>    passage and implementation of the Interstate Road Transport Acts</PARA>
<PARA>    passage and implementation of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act</PARA>
<PARA>    refinement of road funding arrangements under the Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Act 1985 and the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA>    recent Premiers' Conference agreements to establish the National Rail Corporation and the National Road Transport Commission and a new national road transport regulatory and charging framework.</PARA>
<PARA>  The objective of the Land Transport sub-program is to provide a policy, regulatory and operational framework for the achievement of a safe, efficient and innovative land transport sector.  The majority of its resources are used in the continuing reform process.  In the 1991/92 Budget the sub-program has been allocated $4,491,000 and 82.6 staff years for running costs.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) There have been numerous committees established since 1983 at both Commonwealth/State and inter-departmental levels to deal with various aspects of change in land transport.  These have varied from very significant undertakings such as the National Road Freight Industry Inquiry, the Railway Industry Council, the National Rail Freight Initiative Task Force and the Overarching Group on Land Transport Reform, which supports the Special Premiers' Conference, to relatively short-term ad hoc groups to deal with specific issues.</PARA>
<PARA>  A detailed enumeration of these committees and their costs would not be worth the resources involved in undertaking the task.  The outcome of the major ones, including those mentioned above, is a matter of public record. The costs involved on such processes are undoubtedly significant but the potential long term gains from land transport reform have been estimated by the Industry Commission at over $6 billion a year in increased GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>  Funds were provided from land transport trust funds to support research for the Railway Industry Council ($183,000), and the National Rail Freight Initiative Committee ($193,000).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The Prime Minister announced on 5 December 1989, a two-pronged initiative aimed at reducing the national road toll. Over three years, $110 million would be allocated to eliminate accident `Black Spots' around the nation; an additional $10 million would be used for research and public education aimed at changing drivers' attitudes towards drink driving, speed and aggressive driving.</PARA>
<PARA>  The initiative includes the adoption by all States and Territories of a package of national reforms, including a 0.05 blood alcohol limit, national licensing of heavy truck and bus drivers, speed limiters for heavy vehicles, uniform national speed limits, a graduated licence system for young drivers, and greater enforcement of blood alcohol and seat belt requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>  Both the $110 million Black Spot Program and the associated `Ten Point Road Safety Package' will yield substantial benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>  Legislation enabling the Black Spot Program was passed by  the Parliament in December 1990. The $110 million allocation is to be divided over the three years as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>1990-91--$50 million</PARA>
<PARA>1991-92--$35 million</PARA>
<PARA>1992-93--$25 million</PARA>
<PARA>  The first State Program, that for Tasmania, was approved on 5 February 1991. The Northern Territory was the last jurisdiction to agree to participate in the Program, and its Program was approved by the Minister for Land Transport on 21 June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the six months following passage of the enabling legislation, a total of 884 projects were approved.</PARA>
<PARA>  Advice on the status of all projects as at 1 July 1991 has been sought from each of the States and Territories and is currently being collated.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Guideline notes governing the administration of the Program have been issued to each of the States and Territories. The Notes On Administration provide that each authority should be in a position to provide an evaluation of the effectiveness of treatments and, in addition, provision is also made for a final evaluation of the Program as a whole at the end of the three years.</PARA>
<PARA>  Crash histories, of varying integrity according to State/Territory data collection and reporting systems, are available for the bulk of Black Spot sites prior to treatment. With the co-operation of State authorities, `post treatment' data is currently being collected for significant sites. It is not anticipated that any meaningful data will be available for at least six months.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister will provide details of project completion and evaluation as soon as it becomes available.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Small Business and Customs has supplied the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (a) The introduction of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) rollover provisions for small firms raises complex questions about the consistency of the Government's approach to taxing different forms of income and the possible extended deferral of taxation liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government as a matter of principle believes that no group has any stronger claim to exemption from CGT than the rest of the asset-owning community, since all groups benefit from capital gains they accure.  Further research is required into how rollover provisions might be implemented without providing increased opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion and potentially creating inefficiencies through the accumulation of CGT liability, stemming from the tax deferral.</PARA>
<PARA>  These issues are under consideration by the Small Business Council Tax Group.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) Considerable progress has been made since the release of the Parliamentary Committee Report on reducing tax compliance costs. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is currently undertaking a comprehensive market research project to more clearly identify small business information, education and service needs and examine more closely where compliance costs may be reduced. The ATO has also produced an information kit which features a series on simplified reporting and compliance requirements, general tax information and cash management tools.  It has created specialist small business advisory units in Branch Offices in Adelaide and Penrith.</PARA>
<PARA>  For example, in the 1990 Budget the Government announced that it would undertake a broad review of the wholesale sales tax system with the aim of further improving the efficiency of the system by reducing compliance costs for the community and the ATO.  The review is currently underway and is expected to be completed in the latter half of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>  Further progress in reducing the cost and complexity of tax compliance (both direct and indirect) will also be made as result of a joint ATO and Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce study into the cost to small business of complying with tax legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>  The study will provide assistance in the ATO's efforts to streamline the administration of the tax laws, improve client service and foster a climate conducive to voluntary compliance.</PARA>
<PARA>  The first stages of the study (concentrating on small business) will be undertaken by the University of Newcastle under the direction of Mr Ian Wallschutzky, Associate Professor in Taxation.  The study has the full support of the thirty industry associations represented on the Small Business Forum.</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) The major recommendation in the Beddall Report regarding the timing of tax payments related to the payment of Wholesale Sales Tax (WST).</PARA>
<PARA>  In the 1990 Federal Budget the Government announced that the WST would be altered on 1 August 1991 to allow businesses whose WST liability is $50,000 or less to pay WST quarterly, rather than monthly.  The amendment has benefited approximately 80 per cent of WST taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA>  The reduction in the frequency of payments of sales tax meets, in part, the intent of the Beddall Report recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>  To protect the threshold from erosion by price increases and to ensure that the new system continues to benefit small WST taxpayers, the threshold will be adjusted annually in line with the CPI.</PARA>
<PARA>  (d) On 1 April 1991, the threshold for exemption from quarterly payments for fringe benefits tax payers was increased from $1,000 to $3,000.  Over 70,000 small businesses will benefit by being able to make annual payments.  Since 1 July 1990, group employers with annual PAYE tax remittances of less than $10,000 have been able to remit PAYE tax on a quarterly rather than monthly basis.  This change was of assistance to approximately 200,000 existing group employers and up to 190,000 tax stamp employers during the last financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>  Employers are subject to the Training Guarantee if their annual national payroll exceeds the threshold amount.  The Training Guarantee threshold for 1991/92 has been increased from $200,000 to $214,000. The threshold is indexed annually to Average Weekly Earnings.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Payments of Family Allowance Supplement (FAS) in 1991 are initially calculated on the combined parental taxable income in the 1989/90 financial year (the base year).</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Sometimes there are significant changes in a family's financial situation, such that the expected combined taxable income in a full current financial year is at least 25 percent below the income in the base year or below the income free area applicable to the family.  In this situation, the Social Security Act 1991 allows FAS entitlements to be calculated on the expected taxable income for the current financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>  This may provide an entitlement where none previously existed or may provide an increased entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) If the expected taxable income for a current financial year does not meet the reduction rules set out in (2), entitlement in 1991 continues to be based on 1989/90 taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) The legislation sets out the eligibility rules.  Those families whose income does not meet the income test requirements are not eligible.</PARA>
<PARA>  The FAS income test is designed to assist families experiencing a major longer-term reduction in income or those whose incomes fall below the threshold (currently $18,000 for a one child family).</PARA>
<PARA>  Families who have a fall in weekly income have a regular opportunity to request a fresh assessment in July and January each year when new financial years begin or base years change.  Most affected cases succeed in having FAS entitlement adjusted on this basis.</PARA>
<PARA>  The same provisions apply also to increases in income so that increases in income of less than 25 percent of the base year income do not affect entitlement until they are incorporated in a new base year assessment.  This protects low income families against immediate loss of FAS from increases in income occasioned by, for example, earnings from periodic overtime or small amounts of part-time earnings of a secondary earner in a family.</PARA>
<PARA>  Alternative income test arrangements based on current income alone would improve the responsiveness of FAS rate adjustments for a small minority of families whose incomes increase by amounts of less than 25 percent but at the expense of reducing entitlements for many more whose incomes increase by small amounts from time to time.  Such arrangements also would add significantly to the costs of administering FAS and to the notification requirements for FAS families.  Arrangements similar to the alternative were in force under the original FAS income test arrangements and the precursor to FAS, the Family Income Supplement Scheme, and were found to be highly unsatisfactory in terms of the difficulties outlined.  It was for this reason that the Government decided to revise the FAS income test to operate as it does currently.  The Government believes that the existing income test arrangements are preferable, assisting as they do some 200,000 low income families currently compared with a peak of about 150,000 families assisted under earlier arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) - (7) The Special Premiers' Conference in October 1990 established a number of functional reviews with the aim of achieving greater efficiencies and flexibility in service delivery. The functional review of SAAP, which was recently completed, was established as part of this process. The SAAP functional review report was considered by a meeting of Commonwealth, State and Territory Health and Welfare Ministers on 6 September 1991. Ministers agreed to recommend to the Special Premiers' Conference in November that, in recognition of the joint national interest in homelessness and domestic violence, involvement of both the Commonwealth and the States is required to address the complex causes of homelessness and domestic violence and provide adequate opportunities for movement towards independence.</PARA>
<PARA>  At this stage, no decisions have been made regarding future SAAP arrangements. The functional review report will be considered by the November Special Premiers' Conference. It should be noted that, at their October 1990 meeting, Heads of Government agreed that the fundamental objective underlying any change to SAAP or other programs would be to improve the existing system delivery of programs and services in the interests of Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth has a strong commitment to the advancement of the needs of SAAP clients, as expressed in its social justice activities. The Government will wish to see this commitment continue within any new arrangements that may result from this review process.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) The Australian Council of Social Service held national consultations on the overall review of commonwealth/state relations involving from all States representatives from service-provider and consumer groups. These groups included special interest groups and local, state-wide and national organisations. Two rounds of consultations were held with these groups. The last round of meetings was on 5-6 August in Sydney and 2 September in Melbourne. These meetings covered issues relating to the SAAP Functional Review.</PARA>
<PARA>  Between the two rounds of meetings, participants consulted with their constituencies on the main issues arising out of the first meeting. State based discussions and consultations were also sponsored by each of the State Councils of Social Services.</PARA>
<PARA>  In considering the SAAP review report, the meeting of Commonwealth, State and Territory Health and Welfare Ministers agreed to its public release. Community groups can obtain copies of the report from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. The report canvasses a number of possible options together with a critique of each option by the functional review group. Copies of the report have already been provided to members of the SAAP Ministerial Advisory Committees (MACs) in each State for consideration. These Committees may choose to undertake further consultations. In the case of the South Australian MAC, this could involve the sector groups representing South Australian SAAP service providers.</PARA>
<PARA>  A process of further consultations would, of course, occur prior to the implementation of any change, but in the absence of the outcomes of the November Special Premiers' Conference it is not possible to speculate on what this may involve and what the timing might be.</PARA>
