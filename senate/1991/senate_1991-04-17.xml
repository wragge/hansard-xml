<TITLE>Tobacco Advertising</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio. That our Parliament immediately end this association between healthy sports and the deaths of 18,300 people in Australia each year from tobacco-related diseases.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth their deep concern that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:</PARA>
<PARA>1. (a) makes inadequate provision for a subjective judgement by parents as to what is in the best interests of their children,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) makes inadequate provision for parents to use their discretionary powers to act on such judgements.</PARA>
<PARA>2. creates the potential for conflict between parent and child (rather than the atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding mentioned as valuable in the preamble).</PARA>
<PARA>3. will produce closer monitoring by Government agencies of relationships between parents and children.</PARA>
<PARA>Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in the Parliament assembled, should:</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Private Senator's Bill seeks to amend the guidelines made pursuant to the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990. The purpose of the Bill is to remove the arbitrary size limits of the prescribed categories under which an organisation can apply to become a Registered Industry Training Agent (RITA) and to replace them with a `general statement' criteria. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill replaces the numerical test with a general statement that an industry association, professional or trade association is ``a body that is generally recognised within the relevant industry, profession or trade as representing its interests''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment falls within the stated intention of the Government that the guidelines be reviewed after a period of operation to determine legitimate modifications. </PARA>
<PARA>The Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 and the Training Guarantee Act 1990 were passed in May 1990. These Bills initiated the Training Guarantee Scheme which requires that employers with an annual payroll of $200,000 or more (indexed to AWE) spend, either directly or by the imposition of a levy, at least a minimum amount on eligible workforce training every year. The minimum training rate is one per cent in the years 1990-91 and 1991-92 and 1.5 per cent from July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 10 and Section 43 of the Act make provision for the establishment of industry training agents. These Registered Industry Training Agents can issue a training advisory certificate to an employer stating that certain training activities and types of expenditure are ``eligible''. </PARA>
<PARA>These certificates are binding on the Commissioner for Taxation who administers the scheme. Without a certificate issued by a RITA, businesses will not be able to ascertain whether their training programs are ``eligible'' before they incur expenditure. Instead, they will need to rely on self assessment which will be monitored by random audits carried out by the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA>The criteria for registration of an Industry Training Agent, the conditions which they must meet and provisions for cancellation of registration are set out in the Industry Training Agents' Guidelines 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The Guidelines (Clause 5) state that a person may only be registered as an agent if the person (a) is included in one of the categories specified in clause 6 and (b) meets the criteria specified in clause 7. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem is that the arbitrary numerical test used in Clause 6 as the sole test for selection as a Registered Industry Training Agent (or RITA) renders many recognised professional and industry organisations ineligible to become Registered Industry Training Agents. This is a particular problem in the smaller States. </PARA>
<PARA>If an industry association wishes to register as the RITA but does not propose to carry out functions of an agent in every State and Territory, it is required (under Category B: Industry Association) to represent at least (i) 200 employers in the relevant industry in each State or Territory in which the body proposes to carry out the functions of an agent; or (ii) employers who employ at least 10,000 employees in each State or territory in which the body proposes to carry out the functions of an agent. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, for a professional or trade association to be eligible to register as a RITA, but does not propose to carry out functions of an agent in every State and Territory, it is required (under Category D: Professional or trade association) to represent at least 200 employers in the relevant profession or trade in each State or Territory in which the person proposes to carry out the functions of an agent. </PARA>
<PARA>The arbitrary numerical limits of this category mean that to be eligible to be a RITA in a State, a professional organisation must have at least 200 members. In the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and even Tasmania, organisations such as Real Estate Institutes, Law Societies, professional associations of doctors, dentists, medical specialists, accountants and many other associations that are widely recognised as representing their profession or industry, but may represent fewer than 200 employers, may find that they are not eligible to qualify as a RITA. </PARA>
<PARA>For example under Category D, which outlines eligibility for professional and trade groups, such organisations as the ACT and Northern Territory Law Societies, are effectively precluded from applying because they do not represent 200 employers in the legal profession in their respective states. These bodies, in spite of the fact that they are respected and recognised professional associations and regardless of their quality, speciality and convenience to employers, are left to apply under the coverall Category E, but only where no other body has already successfully been registered as a RITA for that profession. In this particular case, the national body (The Law Council of Australia) has already applied and been registered as a RITA so the small-state law societies are also ineligible to apply under Category E of the present guidelines. Therefore they cannot become RITAs. </PARA>
<PARA>It would appear that the Legislation was not intended to render these organisations ineligible. A letter to the Shadow Minister's Office from the office of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training dated 11 January 1991, states that ``the Government is well aware that organisations such as Law Societies in the smaller States and Territories will not meet the size criteria under category D. In these situations, it would be quite extraordinary if organisations such as these organisations were not eligible under Category E. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no question that organisations such as the Law Societies of the ACT, NT and Tasmania, the Real Estate Institutes of the smaller states etc fulfil all of the qualifications for registration as an industry training agent specified in Clause 7 of the Guidelines:</PARA>
<PARA>They</PARA>
<PARA> (a) have the qualifications or expertise in training; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) have a knowledge of the industry to which the application relates, including its training needs and its infrastructure; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) have a knowledge of, and a commitment to, the Act and its objects; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) have an involvement in, and a commitment to, the improvement of training in the industry to which the applicant relates; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) have financial resources, facilities and premises of a standard that will enable the person to carry out the functions of an agent efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet because of an arbitrary number inserted in the guidelines, they are ineligible to register as an Industry Training Agent. Hence this Bill replaces the numerical test with a general statement that an industry association, professional or trade association is ``a body that is generally recognised within the relevant industry, profession or trade as representing its interests''. </PARA>
<PARA>This ``general statement'' used to replace the numerical test in this Bill is of the same kind as the provision for a ``general representative'' already incorporated in the 1990 Guidelines. Category E: Subclause 6.6 (e) allows for A ``general representative''-a person or a body . . . who is capable of carrying out the duties of an agent for an industry or a group of employers. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems reasonable that if an organisation is already an acknowledged registered industry association and fulfils the qualifications for registration as an industry training agent under Clause 7 of the Guidelines, then there should be no need for an arbitrary numerical ``test'' for selection as a Registered Industry Training Agent. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that the option of using a national body is available to many organisations in this position but this creates difficulties for those State bodies in, for example, the Northern Territory or Tasmania, that are physically remote from their national bodies. In addition, a national organisation may have a good understanding of general issues but not be fully aware of local conditions and differences. For example, in real estate, the ACT has a unique leasehold system for land. It is axiomatic that the industry organisation at the local level is in a better position to respond to local needs and to be better able to certify relevant training for that state, region or city. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an also an unjustified implication that industry organisations below a certain size are somehow unworthy to become RITAs and cannot be trusted to be seriously or professionally perform the duties required of a RITA. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the guidelines should be amended to remove these anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Robert Ray) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>HEALTH INSURANCE (PATHOLOGY SERVICES) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 in order to validate certain recommendations made by the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee relating to the payment of Medicare Benefits that were not given legal effect through failure to make necessary Ministerial determinations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Act provides for the establishment of the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee to advise the Minister about the contents of the table in the Schedule to the Act. This table is known as the Medical Benefits Schedule and is used as the basis for determining the amount of benefits payable under Medicare. A determination made by the Minister on the basis of the Committee's recommendation to vary the Schedule requires formal steps to be take to give legal effect to it. For a period of time these steps were in fact not taken, although Medicare Benefits Assessment Advices were issued, which reflected the advice of the Committee during that period. Such advices were acted upon by the Health Insurance Commission, the public and most pathologists. There is no reason to doubt that the relevant Ministers would have taken steps to legally formalise the determinations had the matters been placed before them. </PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that there was a legislative intent in the Act that the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee would be the source of expert advice and would make a recommendation on any amendment to the Medical Benefits Schedule, including the list of pathology services in the Schedule. </PARA>
<PARA>The development in the late 1970s of an assay method known as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, as a means of detecting and estimating antigens and antibodies, combined with automation techniques, resulted in considerable savings in the time and cost of doing such estimations. For example it is possible to estimate antibodies in 96 samples in about 1 to 2 minutes using the ELISA test compared with 1 to 2 hours using another comparable technique known as radioimmunoassay. In addition the reagents for ELISA are inexpensive and have a long shelf life. </PARA>
<PARA>These properties of ELISA made it an extremely attractive method to pathologists as a means of determining a range of antigens and antibodies. The absence of an item for ELISA in the pathology tables of the Schedule and its increasing use by pathologists was the impetus for recommendations by the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee to add the test to items 2294 and 2295 in the Medical Benefits Schedule. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1984, acting on the recommendation of the Committee, the Department issued a Medicare Benefits Assessment Advice which specified items 2294 and 2295 for the assay method ELISA. Subsequent advices arising from other recommendations of the Committee were issued from time to time for these items, generally in order to increase the benefits payable for the service. </PARA>
<PARA>The defective amending of items 2294 and 2295 by the use of Medicare Benefits Assessment Advices was thought to have been overcome in 1987 when the Pathology Services Advisory Committee made recommendations to the then Minister, Dr Blewett. These recommendations lead to the Minister making determinations under section 4A of the Act to amend the then Pathology Services Table. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of a Federal Court decision in late 1988, the Pathology Services Advisory Committee recommendations were set aside for procedural deficiencies and the Medicare Benefit Assessment Advices defects again became an issue. </PARA>
<PARA>A judgement of the Federal Court in 1990 held that ELISA tests for Rubella antibodies fell within item 1345, which is a pathology service attracting a far higher benefit than items 2294 and 2295. </PARA>
<PARA>The wording of pathology items in the Schedule reflects the highly technical nature of a large number of the methods used in pathology. The fact that a test procedure, especially a new procedure, may be interpreted to fit the description of a particular item does not necessarily mean that it is the appropriate item for that test. In fact the vast majority of pathologists did not use item 1345 for ELISA testing because they acknowledge that it was not the correct item. </PARA>
<PARA>Further litigation has raised the prospect that pathologists may be able to claim the difference between the fee paid for a test, the level of which was determined by an advice, and the level of fee payable under item 1345. The possible consequences of this situation are that every person who has been paid for ELISA testing under items other than item 1345 over the past six years will be entitled to recover the difference from the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Since amounts paid for ELISA testing represent reasonable remuneration, as determined by an expert advisory committee, the amendments in this Bill are sought in order to give effect to what was thought to be the position at the time, and that was accepted and acted upon by both the vast majority of pathologists, the Health Insurance Commission and the public as being the actual right to payment in respect of these tests. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of not making the Medicare Benefits Assessment Advices legally effective will be to create a major danger to revenue by giving pathologists a possible substantial windfall gain of about 100 million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA>I must emphasize that the purpose of this Bill is to validate the Medicare Benefits Assessment Advices dealing with the ELISA test so that claims and payments made in accordance with them will become valid and proper and to bring the legislation into line with the general practice in fact adopted at that time; all other rights to benefits under the Schedule will be preserved and unaffected by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I now come to the amendments. The proposed amendments to items 1345 and 1346 are consequential, and designed to reduce the risk of argument that, notwithstanding the validation of the advices of Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee, there is still an obligation to pay under item 1345. The effect of the amendment would be to exclude from item 1345 the quantification of those antigens and antibodies which would be covered by the new items 2294(3), 2294(4), 2295(3) and 2295(4) when performed by the ELISA method. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also proposed to provide for two rules about the application of the Schedule. These provide a means of dealing with the proposition that because of the general wording of some of the items in the Schedule, the potential exists for a particular test to fall within the literal definition covered by more than one item. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments are proposed in order to validate the various Medicare Benefits Assessment Advices with respect to ELISA for the Schedules in existence at various times between 1 March 1984 and 1 August 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposed transitional provisions are included in the Bill to preserve the rights to additional payment to persons who, because of the validation of the advices would be underpaid, and to exclude liability for any additional windfall benefits to pathologists in excess of the amounts specified in the advices. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the debate on the Bounty (Citric Acid) Bill 1991 last being adjourned, I put before the Senate the example of the case of Kodak, which bears an obvious parallel to the initiative under consideration before the Senate. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) implied that that was the case which proved the rule, and I said that it would now seem to be the case that broke the rule. I was going on to allude to the allegation that the Minister, on being asked, `How did Kodak obtain the grant?', replied, `Well, God said it would.' When further pressed, he said, `Of course, it's in God's electorate as well'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The parallel to Kodak has already been seized upon by the media. The Australian Financial Review of 21 March 1991 reported that the bounty proposed by this Bill caused allegations `of another Kodak style bail out', as it will assist the only Australian manufacturer of citric acid-Sirius Biotechnology Ltd-and protect the million dollar investment made in the development of the product by its major shareholders and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. What kind of signals, after Kodak and the like, is the Government sending to foreign-owned businesses in Australia through making further payments of this type? Are we soon to see queues of multinationals outside ministerial offices seeking access to Government benefits in return for retaining their production bases in Australia? The list of economic concerns associated with this Bill is long indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition believes that there is insufficient evidence that the competitive position of Sirius could not have been sufficiently enhanced to the extent of the bounty payments by other reductions in the domestic cost structure affecting its performance. I am talking about areas such as micro-economic reform, cost factors, productivity factors and efficiency factors within the Australian work force. Then the question arises as to why the company could not source manufacturing support or financial support from domestic investment sources if its commercial potential is so obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response that it is simply offsetting domestic and international price distortions disguises the fact that the operation of the local market is so profoundly distorted in its own right that it is incapable of supporting strategically located industries within a medium to long term profit outlook. Despite the Government's stance, the bounty is then, in effect, a traditional protection measure. Put simply, the company is not coming off a tariff onto a bounty. Therefore, the application of the bounty is a clear retreat from the Government's stated theoretical policy direction in respect of lowering protection. Regardless of the arguments concerning the strategic importance of the technology embodied in the company's production process, the imposition of the bounty represents an increase in the aggregate amount of protection in the economy. I referred previously to the $7.27m of taxpayers' funds that will be invested in this bounty over the next few years to a multinational company. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is worth noting that the bounty will be applied to the production of citric acid for sale in both the export and domestic markets. I understand that Bunge Industrial Ltd, the recipient of the $7.27m of taxpayers' funds, will attempt to access the Japanese market. While the bounty does not discriminate between local and export prices and is therefore not in clear breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, its application compromises the firm free trading stance the Government has adopted in international trade negotiations. It is an aberration. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in conclusion that the Sirius bounty is a symptom of the failure of the Government's economic policies, its failure to make Australia an attractive place to invest and do business. It is a one-off solution to a multifaceted problem. Bunge is prepared to invest some millions of dollars in Sirius, but is clearly not prepared to bear the whole risk. If the prospects of return are so slim that even a massive company such as Bunge, a multinational company, is not prepared to commit itself entirely, why should Australian taxpayers and other firms be expected to pay? Why should we single out one company such as this for support at taxpayers' expense?</PARA>
<PARA> Handouts here and there to firms which manage to get the Government's ear are not the solution. Indeed they will eventually become part of the problem. The Government must send the right signals to the business sector, both local and foreign-owned. That means a consistent message, consistent policy direction-predictability in policy direction-not attempting to pick winners here and there to the disadvantage of some other manufacturers or industry within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The signal must be that the Government is committed to building the economic environment and reforming the economy to the point where it makes good sense for businesses to invest locally and maintain their production facilities here in Australia. That means balancing the equation, looking at areas of micro-economic reform, looking at reform in the labour market and the like-areas with which the Government to date has only tinkered at the edges; areas that are essential and important for the long term economic development of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We need a Government which is committed to carrying out reforms which will allow all industries to derive benefit, rather than being selective and benefit being given only to some industries. On all those counts, this Bill fails. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Bounty (Citric Acid) Bill 1991. In so doing, I agree with certain features of the remarks which Senator Olsen has just made but I disagree very strongly with the conclusions that he draws from some of his statements. It is certainly no secret that Australia is an incredibly ingenious country when it comes to scientific research. When we look at the number of scientific papers published per head of population in this country, we find that we are among the world leaders. Where we have often failed in the past-and I think everybody recognises this-is in the translation of those very good ideas into industries which can stand in the marketplace and continue indefinitely into the future and be profitable, effective and address important matters of production, social issues and various other things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In attempting to support a piece of industrial development where Australia has developed new technology in terms of selecting an organism which is best able to ferment material to citric acid-work for which I understand Nancy Millis of the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee has been substantially responsible in collaboration with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)-and in supporting the development of the actual fermentation technology and helping to bridge the gap between what happens in the laboratory and what happens at the pilot stage, and the gap between that and the large scale application of that in a profitable way, I think everybody recognises that we have often failed in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> As I see it, this Bill, which seeks to provide a bounty for citric acid production by this process, addresses that particular problem fairly and squarely. To that extent, the Australian Democrats have no difficulty whatsoever with the proposal. It is absolutely appropriate for government to attempt to help those new developments in Australia bridge that gap which everybody recognises we have had difficulty with in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I will pick up on several points which Senator Olsen has raised, but I will draw some different conclusions. It is interesting to note, for instance, that the initial bounty of $700 per tonne, which relates to the production of citric acid, if applied to fermentation for the production of alcohol, would amount to some 88c per litre. That amount is considerably more than the current cost of petrol at the bowser-which I think in Canberra is running at 64.7c or thereabouts at the present time. From all my readings, that would make alcohol a far more than competitive fuel compared with petrol.</PARA>
<PARA> It raises the interesting question of whether some support for fermentation technology with a view to producing alternative fuels might not be an area also worth investigating. Certainly, other countries have gone down that road. In view of the difficulty we have in getting rid of our wheat at the present time because of the depressed world market, one could imagine a decentralised industry in rural centres in which farmers would be able to ferment part of their wheat crop and produce local fuel, thus creating local employment and making them independent of the importation of fuel from outside their areas. Of course, in the process it would also make Australia increasingly less dependent upon fuel imports from other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> One can agree, to some extent, with Senator Olsen's remarks in relation to selecting particular industries. One can imagine other industries which may also benefit from like bounties to the advantage of the whole economy. This raises the general proposition that I now want to develop. The defect that I find with this legislation is not that the Government is, to use Senator Olsen's term, picking winners but that it is doing that in a rather ragged and arbitrary manner. It seems to me that the Government has developed no coherent view of where Australia is likely to be 20 or 40 years into the future. In attempting to pick winners, as it does with this type of legislation, the Government is merely saying, `This is new technology. This looks good. We will support this technology and hope like hell that some time in the future it will become profitable and it will become beneficial, in a purely economic sense, to Australia'. But the Government has no clear idea of where the production of citric acid or, indeed, any other organic starting materials might slot into a future overall economy and an overall social structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Olsen asked the rhetorical question: why does the Government not support other industries? Why does it not support ceramics? One thinks of the solid oxide fuel cell which is being developed by CSIRO, and, indeed, I reflect Senator Olsen's concern: why does the Government not support that leading edge technology? In terms of where we would need to position Australia, it seems to me that one could make a better case for supporting the solid oxide fuel cell than one could for supporting the fermentation of materials to citric acid because it addresses fairly and squarely the very substantial improvements in the efficiency of energy production and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions which, it seems to me, quite clearly need to be taken into account in where we position Australia 20, 30 or 40 years down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> I have pointed out on several previous occasions that one can approach the future in a number of ways. One can approach the future in a utopian way. One can have some kind of idealistic view of what the future might hold that is not founded on any substantial information database and without any concept of the reality of one's present circumstance. We have seen a number of occasions in world history where that has been attempted: the utopian ideal often finishes in bloody revolution because one attempts to impose, very often by force of military intervention, one's utopian view of the world on society. One can also use a totally utilitarian and pragmatic approach. One sees many of the entrepreneurial people in Australia adopting precisely that approach in order to exploit whatever seems to be at hand to their immediate benefit without any thought whatsoever for what that does to the social fabric and to society being led in various directions. </PARA>
<PARA> One can use a laissez faire, gradualist approach to the future, and it seems to me that this is the approach upon which the present Bill is based. In other words, one has a general belief that this sort of technology may well improve the economy, but precisely where it fits in, precisely how it is going to operate, and precisely what sort of society it helps to bring into existence is unknown. So one allows it to operate in a random fashion and then attempts, with all goodwill, to try to sort out the social discontinuities and so on that that process produces. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth approach-and the approach that I think we should be using-is the comprehensive approach, which attempts to take into account all the factors which are evident at the present time, all the factors which indicate the possible options which are open before us for the future and which will help us to build a better world. Taking all those factors into account, one then attempts to direct the sorts of technology, the sorts of social institutions, the sorts of political institutions, the economic models and so on towards that goal; and that is not by any means a function exclusively of government. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the disappointments-and I have expressed this before-I had with the creation of the organisation, Commission for the Future, was that it did not follow the Swedish model and that it did not operate in a way which would open up very widely for the community the long term options facing Australia. This would have helped the Australian community to decide which option it was seeking to pursue. This could then have been related back to government; we could say, `Well, if this is where we need Australia to be positioned 25 or 40 years on, these are the sorts of things we need to put in place at the present time'. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Australian Commission, with a few rare exceptions, has not operated that way. It has been strongly predicated on a particular view of the future and a process by which the Australian society can be coerced into what government seems to see as that inevitable and desirable future. </PARA>
<PARA> So, while this may appear discursive, I am saying that, while we support this particular piece of legislation because it does address an immediate and very evident problem-the problem being that Australia very often has failed to bridge that important gap between research development and the full economically viable industrial development of the results of that research in the past; and it is desirable that government intrude, address that problem and provide bounties or whatever other assistance it can to help that situation-nonetheless, the Government should not be doing this in a somewhat arbitrary way. I believe that this Bill is to some extent arbitrary in that it is not based on a clear idea of where that necessarily leads Australian industrial development and how it will slot in some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I enjoin the Government to take a much wider view of this approach to Australia's industrial development; to open up much more generously to public scrutiny the options which lie before us for the future, the constraints which are so clearly evident in terms of the environment and other matters and the constraints which the political process itself places on these developments; to open up to public scrutiny the consequences of pursuing certain patterns of industrial development so that people have a clearer idea of the sort of world in which their children are likely to live if certain developments go forward; and then, from that democratic ferment, to attempt to derive a clearer view of precisely which industries should attract this sort of help. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no problem whatsoever with government intruding to provide the necessary help. We are just somewhat concerned that at the present time that help is being provided in a somewhat arbitrary fashion. To that extent, I repeat, I agree with Senator Olsen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable senators for their contribution to this debate. As Minister, I am sort of jammed between two versions of purity: one from Senator Olsen, which was invented by Australian economists in the 1960s; and the other from Senator Coulter, which has not quite been refined yet but is nonetheless an alternative example of a new period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make a few comments about the contents of this Bill and why we have it. Essentially, the contents perhaps raise some somewhat new issues, but, first of all, at the risk of saying that the Government is sending good money after bad, let me say that there has been a substantial government research commitment in respect of this industry, in biotechnology, and in particular in this process which is manifesting itself at Sirius Biotechnology Ltd. I think the amount involved is in excess of $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sirius operation is important to a lot of biotechnologists, not just because of the investment which has taken place already in research done at University of Melbourne in this area through the grants for industrial research and development scheme, but also for a variety of reasons which I want to come to in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Olsen raised a number of issues about Bunge Industrial Ltd and its involvement in this process. Bunge has been involved with Sirius since 1984, with substantial capital injections being made to that company in excess of $7m, and the current takeover by Bunge of this company will cost Bunge an additional $4m. To benefit from the bounty, Bunge will have to invest an additional $7m to $10m in plant expansion to reach optimum output levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative for Bunge is worth considering. It could have essentially bought this technology and commercialised it overseas. The easy way to get a short term return would have been to acquire the Sirius operation, close it down and license the technology overseas, where it would be able to take advantage of cheaper input costs and tariff protection on outputs than those which exist in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The two essential problems of Sirius are, firstly, high domestic costs for its key inputs and their alternatives and, secondly, the degree of subsidy attracted by its competitors internationally. Senator Olsen gave us a lecture about purity. I think he should give it overseas on one of his parliamentary trips because the fact is that the subsidies which are available on input costs to this industry in Europe and elsewhere are huge. We have the alternative problem of high domestic costs for key inputs, particularly for sugar and wheat. The problem exists with sugar largely because Senator Olsen's political allies in this chamber, members of the National Party of Australia, would not allow this Government to reduce the levels of assistance for sugar. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Olsen is chastising us for being slow over five years; I am chastising his governments for being slower over 30 years. I do not know who wins that argument, but perhaps he should exert some counter pressure on his National Party colleagues in respect of the current Industry Commission inquiry into the levels of assistance provided for the sugar industry and any result which emerges from that. It is true that CSR Ltd was prepared to supply Sirius with sugar at prices less than those offered to many other Australian sugar users. That would have been an example of industry picking the winners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The price that was offered was still above the price of sugar on international markets, so Sirius switched to a wheatbased substrate glucose. This input cost is substantially less than that for sugar-approximately $450 a tonne, but still some $150 a tonne above the subsidised price available to competitors internationally for this technology. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a few other points. I have referred to Bunge's investment history in connection with this company, the alternatives that it could have adopted, and the fact that there was substantial public sector investment in the research. Putting these three things together, the Government's desire to retain the technology and production in Australia led shamelessly to this bounty Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are always a few risks in this business, as the senator ought to know. The other important point that Senator Coulter might have touched on but did not because he was diverted is that there is a distinct possibility of this company developing other technologies in the biotechnology area. We believe that the high level of investment by Bunge will drive Sirius to commercialise other applications of fermentation technology. Currently under development at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and Melbourne University, for example, is the food gums project, which is a very high value added processed food additive. This has all been explained to me, but I do not have sufficient recollection or skill to explain it again in technical terms. However, there is no doubt that it is a very high value added process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of other product applications, including other organic acids, amino acids and enzymes used industrially. None of these products which are in the fermentation family, as it were, will attract bounty. They all have higher and more stable income streams than does citric acid. What it is hoped is being established in Sirius is a small research related production facility, dependent on fermentation technology, which has definite linkages with the research community and which, if it is productive in the way in which the bounty is couched, will attract the bounty. </PARA>
<PARA> The charge against us made by Senator Olsen and others is one of inconsistency-that what we should be doing is concentrating on micro-economic reform to help Sirius. I am reminded that when the Kodak bounty was provided, one of Senator Olsen's colleagues went to Kodak and gave the people there a lecture. He said, `What you want is reform on the waterfront. That will make Kodak a successful export company in Australia'. They listened somewhat aghast, I was told, and said, `We have never had anything imported across the waterfront or exported across the waterfront. All our business internationally in this respect-and we are a very big exporter-is done by air.' So they listened to this lecture about these things with some degree of amusement. </PARA>

I am just making the point that all these things are important but not necessarily relevant to all businesses, particularly those such as by Sirius. What is relevant and important to that company is the cost of the inputs, which are very high by world standards for a variety of reasons. First there is no subsidy because of the positions adopted by this Government and by previous governments. Secondly, there are high input costs owing to tariffs and other assistance measures for those industries. We are enjoined not to be selective. There are particular circumstances in which selectivity is appropriate in this particular legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter rightly identified the problems of innovation and marketplace weakness that we have in Australia. He mentioned the ceramics industry. There are all sorts of government measures of general application which did not apply to Sirius, such as the tax incentive for research and development and so on. They did not apply to Sirius but they have applied to things such as ceramics. Ztec, as it is called, was produced in funded laboratories of the Commonwealth essentially and then later in conjunction with ICI Australia Ltd. A pilot plot was built with the assistance of the research and development tax incentives. There are a number of measures of general application which were applicable to, for instance, the ceramics industry and would be again applicable where there is a significant company involved, but which are not applicable to a company such as Sirius. The sort of consistent assistance which is available to those smaller companies in respect of research and development is very much through a grants system of which the Sirius technology has been a beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that there are difficulties in respect of this legislation which can be pointed at, but there is a strong case for the legislation based on the history of this business in Australia, the research involvement which has taken place and the alternatives. The alternatives are to wait for a number of years until the input costs of an industry such as this decrease and become the same as those in the rest of the world; or alternatively to wait until some government subsidises such industries to the extent that the Europeans and others do. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this morning to speak on the Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1991. This Bill has been introduced in a rather hurried fashion so that the Government is able to avoid further liability due to its inefficiency in making changes to the medical benefits schedule in relation to pathology services. The Bill will replace four pathology service item numbers with new item numbers carrying lower rebates, backdated to the date of the Government's announcement of its intention in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is worth while to provide the Senate with an historical overview of the events that have led to the necessity for this Bill. There has been one blunder after another and a lot of inaction on the Government's part. Hopefully, this time the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) will get it right. Between the years 1984 and 1989, the Department of Community Services and Health issued medical benefits assessment advices based on advice from the Medical Benefits Advisory Committee (MBAC) and the Pathology Services Advisory Committee (PSAC), which purported to make amendments to schedule 1 or schedule 1a of the Health Insurance Act 1978. The PSAC provided advice and made representations to the Minister on pathology services in the medical benefits schedule and the appropriate fee structure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government introduced a reduction in the fees payable by the Health Insurance Commission to pathologists performing certain tests. Specifically, the Government intended to reduce the benefits payable for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) services which provide a cheaper and quicker way of conducting certain pathology tests. The determination was an attempt to reduce the scheduled fee for a test that had become simpler due to scientific and technological advances. The determination was based on advice from MBAC and PSAC. The difficulty arose due to ineffective advice supplied to the Minister, which had the effect of rendering the determinations invalid. However, the determinations were acted upon for some time by the Department, medical practitioners and the general public. Payments were made in accordance with the advices. </PARA>
<PARA> An attempt was made in 1987 by the Government to rectify the mistakes by issuing a new determination. The procedures involved here were challenged in the Federal Court of Australia and were found to be defective. Again, the pathology schedule was in a mess. Justice Gummow of the Federal Court found that there was a serious omission of information supplied by the Pathology Services Advisory Committee, which was used to determine the new schedule. The judge found that the Committee had no supporting evidence which enabled it to justify the reduction in benefits. He said that the Committee's reason for the reduction fell short of provision to the Minister of all relevant financial and other information relating to the recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believed that the situation was rectified when amendments passed in 1989 meant a new table had force due to the Minister's regulation making power. However, the new table did not validate the changes made from 1984; it simply had effect from 1 August 1989. Again, the Minister had failed to resolve the problem. Another problem appeared when it was realised that, as well as being subject to a specific item in the table, ELISA services could also be charged under another, more general item in the table. The benefits available under the general item were higher than those available under the more general item. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1990 Federal Court case Peverill v. Health Insurance Commission upheld the right for pathology service providers to use either item where a service could fall within either. Dr Peverill was awarded $1.7m in back payments and it is likely that he will receive a further $7m. This case dramatically increased the likelihood that litigation would be used by other pathology service providers to have services performed, while there were two items covering the service available, recompensed at the higher rate even though most were originally charged under the lower rate. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that the total cost to the taxpayer nationwide could have been in the vicinity of $100m. I understand it is for this reason, and an imminent court decision, that the Government has at last decided to bring into this place a piece of legislation and list it immediately for debate. One does wonder what on earth the Government has been doing up until putting amendments to the Act in 1989 and why it has not acted on this issue earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this Bill is to validate the advices and correct the defects in the schedules of the principal Act-that is, the Health Insurance Act 1973-so that claims and payments made in accordance with them become valid and proper. The Bill also provides appropriation for that excess to rectify what was otherwise a breach of section 83 of the Constitution. Payments had been made without parliamentary appropriation as Parliament had only appropriated money for amounts properly payable under the Act as it was then. The Bill provides new item numbers and rebates and the Opposition will not be opposing this. It is about time that the Government closed this loophole. </PARA>
<PARA> The pathology profession, represented by the Australian Association of Pathology Practices and the Royal Australian College of Pathologists, also supports this piece of legislation. The profession has no difficulty with the legislation, as it merely legitimises what virtually everyone was doing. The area of pathology is obviously one that causes the Government a great deal of problems. An article in the Australian on 22 February this year captured the problem in its heading: `Pathology Overuse a Threat to Medicare'. The article was in response to the release of the Deeble report entitled Medical Services through Medicare, the second background paper in the Macklin inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The most alarming figure was that the use of pathology services per person had grown by 42.6 per cent in five years. Recorded pathology services totalled $32.08m in 1988-89. In 1989-90 the recorded figure was $24.15m, a reduction of some 25 per cent. Looking at this figure on its own, one would perhaps be encouraged by the declining usage in pathology services if it meant an increase and improvement in public health. However, pathology benefits increased in 1989-90 by 7.5 per cent. This highlighted a disturbing trend of declining usage yet increasing cost. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1989-90 annual report of the Department of Community Services and Health indicated a reduction of 14.5 per cent in the number of pathology services, with a 9.9 per cent increase in the value of pathology services processed. There would appear to be some problem with the figures recorded for pathology services being understated due to a number of factors. An adjustment of these figures shows that the problem may not be as serious, although adjustments to figures on the basis of what did not happen must be treated with a degree of scepticism. </PARA>
<PARA> Rates of growth have differed substantially between health services. For all services the trend rate of growth was 4.2 per cent per person per annum, but for medical services other than pathology it was only 3.2 per cent. Pathology use per person increased at more than twice that rate at 4.7 per cent. Many figures could be quoted to support those which I have already mentioned, including figures that show the increasing pattern of growth in diagnostic services. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no denial by the Government that it has a major problem with pathology. A major problem with the system is that of bulkbilling. There has been a 65 per cent increase in the number of services bulkbilled. As we have seen in the area of medical services, the presence of bulkbilling results in overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA> Lately I have heard some stories from a couple of people who, because of their businesses, frequent doctors' surgeries. They have been told stories of people who happened to be waiting at a bus-stop near a particular doctor's surgery when they decided to pop in to have a chat and fill in the time. This is not a one-off case, but just one example. This is not a free chat, it is a chat which has a service provision and is charged. These people do this because it does not cost them anything. The absence of any price signal is a great way to ensure that services are overused. I do not think we would find the same overuse of dentists' services or people visiting the local vet who happened to be on the corner because we know how much it costs to use those services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian public has been hoodwinked by this Government into believing that the 1.25 per cent of its income that goes towards Medicare covers the cost of health. It does not, and that should be reiterated so that every member of the Australian public realises that as a taxpayer, he or she pays for this overuse and that it is not covered by the 1.25 per cent. Until people use medical services appropriately and not abuse them, they will be paying an undue price for public health in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies to pathology services. The presence of bulkbilling inevitably leads to the overuse of the service. If the Government were consistent and introduced some price signal, like it did with the concessional pharmaceutical payment, the level of service usage might look quite different. Even if the full fee were abatable, the existence of a price signal would have the effect of reducing the current tendency to overuse the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has missed out on a golden opportunity to address the general problems in the pathology area. But we have become used to the lack of action on the part of this Government, particularly in this area. It has lost a valuable opportunity to crack down on rorts in the system and examine those elements of the system where cost containment needs to be more effectively policed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition will be supporting the Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1991. But it is again another attempt by this incompetent Government to fix what it has attempted to remedy before but with little success and at quite considerable cost to the taxpayer if, in fact, the court rules for an additional $7m for this doctor who is currently involved in obtaining some sort of recompense through the loophole. I again add that we are amazed at the Government and the Minister's lack of action in not correcting this loophole earlier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1991 without amendment. Indeed, we hope that it will pass speedily through this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill corrects a major error which has been made by the Government in relation to payments for pathology services under Medicare. The Health Insurance Act 1973 set up the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee which advises the Minister for Social Security about the contents of the medical benefits schedule in the Act. This schedule is used as the basis for assessing the benefits payable under Medicare. The Act envisages that the committee will make recommendations about varying the schedule to the Minister, who will then make a determination about the amount payable. Medicare benefits assessment advices will then be issued by the Department of Social Security and payments will be made in accordance with these advices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's determination requires certain formal steps to be taken before it has legal effect. Unfortunately, for some time these steps were not taken, with the result that ministerial determinations made during the period are technically legally invalid. Despite this, Medicare benefits assessment advices were issued by the Department and were relied upon by the Health Insurance Commission, the general public and the vast majority of pathologists. </PARA>
<PARA> The major problem is the oversight that occurred in relation to a testing method called enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). While the majority of pathologists have been claiming for ELISA using the categories listed in the advices, one particular pathologist has successfully taken action in the Federal Court of Australia in order to use a different category which attracts a far higher benefit. The Federal Court has held that ELISA tests for a specific type of antibody-rubella-fall within this latter category, thus raising the prospect that the pathologist may now be able to claim the difference between the fee paid for the test-that is, under the legally invalid advices-and the higher fee payable under the category determined by the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Patterson has said, this Bill is to bring legislation into line with the general practice adopted by most pathologists. The Government has argued that if it does not make the advices legally valid, pathologists would potentially be able to claim an amount up to $100m from the Government. Indeed, as has already been said, this view is supported by the Australian Association of Pathology Practices, which represents pathologists in private practice. The association accepts the need to rectify what it sees as a technical oversight and believes that the aspects of retrospectivity are justified in these circumstances. The association believes that the vast majority of pathologists throughout Australia are unperturbed by the Bill and that the fight against it is being led by a very small number of pathologists who are determined to make significant financial gain from what is really a technical error. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Australian Democrats are generally opposed to retrospective legislation, this Bill should not necessarily be seen as containing a retrospective element. It was clear that Parliament's intention was that provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973 would be properly observed and that pathologists would claim under the categories listed in the advices from time to time. Basically this legislation should be viewed, therefore, as correcting a technical error rather than retrospectively introducing any new conditions or subsequently altering a particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As members of Parliament we also have some obligation to consider the financial implications for the Government and for taxpayers. Although it is unlikely that the full $100m could be claimed, it seems quite likely that a potential exists for an enormous claim to be made-and this must not be ignored. It should also be noted that pathology services are the most significant factor in escalating health care and Medicare costs and that it would simply not make sense to force the Government to pay out millions of dollars to pathologists at the expense of other health services, particularly at a time when government is in fact seeking ways to curtail the costs of pathology services to the public purse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Medicare statistics show that pathology utilisation is increasing at a faster rate than other medical services. Paradoxically, rebates have fallen by 40 per cent in real terms over the last five years. This means that pathology services have become more efficient in providing services at lower unit costs, but the demand is rising at a rate which is putting unacceptable pressures on the health care budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ageing population and medical and social reasons account for some of the increase, but the basic cause is bulkbilling, which puts no restraint either on the patient who requests the test or on the doctor who has no financial constraint in ordering the tests. In the case of the entrepreneurial clinics there is actually a financial incentive to increase the number of tests performed. The cost of pathology has been increasing at 12 per cent per annum, although the number of patients being tested has been increasing at only 3 per cent per annum. It is interesting that 88 per cent of that increase has occurred in bulkbilling clinics. Those are facts that cannot be escaped; they are on record. These figures demonstrate once again the basic flaw in Medicare, which is bulkbilling. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Government actually claims that one of the measures of success of Medicare is the increasing number of doctors who are bulkbilling their services and an increasing number of patients who are demanding bulkbilling. It surely must be obvious to the bureaucracy at least, if not the Government, that some constraint has to be put on both the patients and the providers of pathology services. In fact, the Government has actually done this in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) is present because he has done that with the introduction of copayment in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, even introducing it to pensioners where they have to put up the $2.50 in copayment for pharmaceuticals. Yet the Government turns a blind eye to the fact that this is occurring in relation to medical services and does not introduce copayment in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> This Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill is necessary to close retrospectively a loophole that was exploited by only one pathologist in the country who was smarter than both the Government and the bureaucracy because he saw the loophole. Considering our convict background, there could those amongst us who would say, `Well, good on him; one individual has outsmarted the Government and the bureaucracy'. I suppose there is hope for us all if we are up against that sort of monolith. </PARA>
<PARA> That pathologist has benefited to the extent of $1.7m. The rest of the pathologists in Australia, who are perfectly ethical in this regard, recognise that they could have exploited the loophole. If they did, it would cost all of us, as taxpayers, up to $100m. The pathology profession is not prepared to do that. The loophole needs to be closed. The root cause of this loophole and the exploitation it has made available is bulkbilling. Until bulkbilling is eliminated and patient copayments introduced, entrepreneurs will continue to exploit the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is also necessary because the Government was sloppy in its management of changes to the Medicare schedule. There is a delay in decision making in relation to new items and there is a failure to understand the technical aspects of these changes. Although a minor symptom, it is a sign of the failure of the socialist inspired bureaucratic juggernaut-Medicare-that is now out of control. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we are speaking on health legislation. There seems to be a never ending array of legislation having to come through this Parliament to close loopholes. I shall speak very briefly because this piece of legislation does just that. However, I do ask when the Government will get its act together to be able to abide by the legislation it gets through the Parliament. The situation has been put very clearly by my colleagues, Senator Patterson, Senator Lees and Senator Herron, who have already spoken on this issue. They pointed out very clearly that the legislation and the determination by the then Minister for Health, Dr Blewett, did not see eye to eye and that, in taking advice from the Medical Benefits Advisory Committee, the Minister made his determination without taking the appropriate steps that were needed to abide by the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1986 the Government determined that the Medicare schedule fee for some pathology services should be reduced because, with new technology, some of the tests that were done when the Medicare schedule was first set up had become automated and therefore, it was very much cheaper for the pathologists to perform them. The pathologists agreed with the Government and they suggested that the Minister should alter the schedule.</PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the Government made an awful hash of it. Three years later in 1989, in trying to rectify the position, it again made an awful hash of it and the loophole was not closed. As Senator Herron said, only one pathologist in Australia took advantage of the loophole that he discovered and was awarded $1.7m in back payments and is attempting to claim an additional $7m. Both the Royal Australian College of Pathologists and the Australian Association of Pathology Practices have said, `This loophole must be closed'. Indeed, one of the senior pathologists in the College said to me, `Well, if it is not closed and I was unethical enough, I would get an additional $3m. Why isn't the Government acting?'. As has already been stated, if all pathologists decided to abide by the law they would be entitled to in the vicinity of $100m of taxpayers' money. Because it is an ethical profession, it has approached the Minister and said, `For heaven's sake, get it through the Parliament and get it through quickly'. The Government has mucked around and fudged for years. At last it is coming up with legislation to close that loophole. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Opposition will be supporting retrospective legislation. It should not be necessary. This side of the chamber does not like passing retrospective legislation. However, this legislation has to be made retrospective to 14 March 1986. That is the only method of closing that loophole, so shielding the taxpayer from otherwise legally collected fees. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Herron has pointed out, and pointed out very rightly, the Government, for philosophical reasons only, will not acknowledge that the main problem with Medicare and the reason for the blow-out in the cost of Medicare is the `overservicing' of doctors by patients. Senator Patterson gave a very good example of people going to the doctor just to have a chat. This is the result of bulkbilling. They go to have a chat because it does not cost them a cent. Many elderly patients consider that it is the social outing of the week to visit the doctor and to have a chat about their general health. Of course, they are not charged one cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We must keep emphasising-I am very sure people do not realise this-that the Medicare levy covers just one-third of people's health costs. Most people think that they pay their levy, therefore they have paid for their health costs and they do not need to pay another cent. That is not right; that is totally wrong. It is a myth that the Government keeps putting forward. Indeed, at the last election Labor supporters held up placards saying, `You already pay for your health through the levy; do not let there be any alteration.' When I asked them where they got their information I was told from their local member. It is not true. The levy pays for a very small section of that health care. The majority of it comes straight from Consolidated Revenue, from the normal taxes paid by Australian citizens. The levy is a furphy. The levy that goes to Medicare is a very small area of tax. We must emphasise that and tell people that this is so, otherwise this myth will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Patterson has already said, even though we do not like passing retrospective legislation, the Opposition will be supporting this Bill and supporting it for one reason only, that is, the sheer incompetence of the Government in not getting its legislation right over the past five years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on the Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1991. I find it extraordinary that Senator Walters should berate the Government for not getting it right over the past five years, when the Opposition quite clearly has no idea of the proper construction of a health policy to enable all Australians to secure proper health services at a reasonable cost to them and to the rest of the community. That was the debacle in the presentation of the health policies of the Opposition in the last two elections which, I think, almost ensured that Labor would be re-elected. I find it extraordinary that Senator Walters should be ranting against Medicare when it has received the strong endorsement of the Australian people election after election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did not expect to be involved in a partisan exchange of views across this chamber. In fact, I acknowledge the common heritage that Senator Herron and I have as descendants of Irish forebears. It may be that our convict past as Australians does give us some grudging admiration for those who beat the system. But in this instance there is clearly a need to protect the revenue from claims which could be made by pathologists resulting from a very unfortunate series of events which, I agree, should not have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill protects the revenue from claims for increased benefits for pathology services which have already been remunerated on the basis of a rate for those services determined by an expert committee. Indeed, if the Senate were not prepared to pass this legislation, the great bulk of Australians, being taxpayers, would face a payment of some $100m into the pockets of pathologists. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay a tribute to pathologists around Australia who, through their various colleges, associations and professional bodies have indicated-this is admirable and commendable-that they think it would be most unprofessional for them to insist on taking advantage of a loophole which has emerged in the administration of this very complex area of determining the remuneration schedules in relation to the provision of pathology services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that there were technical defects in the way the relevant determinations were made and, therefore, they were invalid. But they were made in good faith and I do not think anyone has questioned that. They were acted on by the Health Insurance Commission and, as I say, by Australian pathologists in the conduct of their professional obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> But it has been open to certain pathologists to claim, through the courts, substantial amounts of money as remuneration for the services concerned and in that way they have distinguished themselves from their colleagues who do not think that is either fair or appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There you are-Senator Walters assures me that only one has seen fit to stand against the Royal Australian College of Pathologists and the Australian Association of Pathology Practices which have indicated that they think this ought not to be taken advantage of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tests referred to in the Bill have been rebated under Medicare since 1984. It became apparent in 1988 that invalid determinations had been made in that period. It was thought, with the introduction of the new pathology table in 1988, that the matter had been remedied. However, the advice of the Pathology Services Advisory Committee, a necessary precondition for making the regulation governing rebates for this test, was found invalid by the Federal Court on definitional grounds in late 1988. The effect of this decision was for the rebate for this test to be determined again under the 1986 table. In early 1989 the industry and the Department in consultation developed a new table which went through Parliament and came into effect on 1 August 1989. This is the table which is in force now, is valid and has been valid since it came into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will make sure that pathologists cannot go back and claim the difference between one invalid superseded item on the pathology schedule and a higher paying superseded item. I believe that the retrospective element in this Bill has obviously, with some reluctance, given the way in which the Senate generally responds to retrospectivity in Bills, been seen to be necessary. I believe that the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, using its usual criteria, would find it to be necessary. Other rights to claim for services provided under Medicare will, of course, be protected. I believe that the chamber and the whole Parliament are acting very responsibly in deliberating on this problem. I commend the Bill for speedy passage. </PARA>

The Department of Community Services and Health has provided certain figures to me relating to Medicare payments for related services to those provided under item 6469 of the medical benefits schedule. These are official figures. I was given the actual detail of services performed on the same day as services provided under item 6469, which is a Medicare abortion item. I think it is important for the Committee to know that in addition to payments under the abortion items, an extra 34 per cent in Medicare payments were made to the top five abortionists in New South Wales for related services performed on the same day as the abortions were performed; an extra 7.6 per cent in Victoria; and an incredible 44 per cent and 49.7 per cent respectively in Queensland and Western Australia. Those figures seem to be quite incredible-an extra 34 per cent in New South Wales, an extra 7.6 per cent in Victoria, an extra 44 per cent in Queensland and an extra 49.7 per cent in Western Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1991. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the principal Act, thus increasing duty on uranium concentrate exported from the Alligator Rivers area. It provides the approximate cost recovery for the Office of the Supervising Scientist, a body established by the previous coalition government to undertake environmental monitoring and research activities in the Northern Territory. The increased rate of duty reflects the Commonwealth's position that the costs associated with protecting the environment from the potential adverse effects of uranium mining should be borne, as far as practicable, by the industry carrying out that mining activity and not by the taxpayer. The Office of the Supervising Scientist carries out the Commonwealth's responsibilities in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The original rate of 11c a kilogram for the period 1980-81 to 1985-86 was set on the assumption that other mines would operate in the area. These have been held up by the quite hypocritical and stupid three-mines policy of the present Labor Government. Under the terms of this Bill the duty on uranium concentrate exported from the Alligator Rivers region will be increased, effective from 21 February 1990, from the current $1.15 a kilogram to $1.30 a kilogram. The duty is raised only on operating mines in the area and is certainly a discriminatory tax because it is applied only to one company, Energy Resources of Australia Ltd, which operates the Ranger mine, as the Nabarlek stockpile is effectively exhausted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Office of the Supervising Scientist provides support to other organisations, and is of potential benefit to mines which will begin operation in the future. It is a classic case of the Government's user pays policy being implemented for overkill. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that it is the policy of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia to transfer the functions of the Office of the Supervising Scientist to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and the university college or appropriate agencies in the Northern Territory. We have, in fact, accepted the recommendations of Professor Geoff Taylor's review, but on the Government's part, to date, there has been absolutely no action. </PARA>
<PARA> Energy Resources of Australia has requested the disbandment of the Office of the Supervising Scientist on the grounds that its research is inappropriate and irrelevant to the company's needs. That company is being forced, as well as paying for the Office of the Supervising Scientist, to fund a research organisation which has failed in its intended task. On occasions, it has had to use outside agencies such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and ANSTO to perform necessary research that the Office of the Supervising Scientist has failed to perform properly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is yet again agonising over its uranium policy. If it was not so serious, it would be hilarious. For the good of the nation let us hope that after this agonising there will be some sense coming out of the Labor Party. We cannot accept the cynical logic that went on with the decision on Coronation Hill. We cannot continue with the troglodyte attitudes of those in the Labor movement who will not face the reality that Australia must export to survive, export to recoup our debt and export to maintain any semblance of the standards to which we have become accustomed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The three-mine uranium policy is one of the most archaic, stupid and defenceless policies with which this Government still persists. I can see the Minister on duty, Senator Richardson, coming into the chamber and I am sure he agrees with that. The only reason it remains is because of the factional fighting within a divided Labor Party. It is a quite illegitimate product of consensus politics. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fascinating to trace the history of the Labor Party on uranium. As long ago as 1957 its foreign policy platform noted:</PARA>
<PARA>We urge . . . that nuclear research to hasten the application of atomic power for industrial purposes be encouraged in the development of Australia. Further, we demand the protection and safeguarding of Australia by the retention here of basic raw materials and the necessary manufacturing and industrial processing rights, so as to ensure this country's selfsufficiency in a time of emergency . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, that was put in because people had no inkling at that stage of the total reserves that we have, not only of uranium but also other energy products. Honourable senators will recall that back in the 1950s there was a ban on the export of iron ore because the great Pilbara region had not been explored. Over the following years uranium was discovered in sufficient quantities overseas for Australia's reserves to decline in importance to the nuclear arms race of the 1950s and 1960s, and future exports would have to serve the developing nuclear power industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1973 the Minister for Minerals and Energy, Rex Connor, put an embargo on uranium. It was considered to be vindicated on commercial grounds by the significant increase in uranium prices worldwide since the start of that year. Labor then approved a strong pro-nuclear policy similar to that of 1971. In October 1974, with world prices skyrocketing, it became obvious that the price was only one of the reasons for the embargo. The ambition then was for a 100 per cent government-owned uranium enrichment plant, a central government-owned uranium mill in the Northern Territory and a government partnership with mining companies. </PARA>
<PARA> In part, Mr Connor-who was affectionately known around Australia as the strangler-was right and in part he was wrong. He was right with his vision that what we needed to do with a great resource, where we had 30 per cent of the world's resources of uranium, was to go to the value added stage-not only just to sell the product overseas as uranium, but also to enrich it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a commonly held view that if we had got into that, the increase in our export income today would be of the order $1 billion a year. Where Mr Connor was wrong-and it seems that this Government has not learnt from this-is that he was promoting its ownership and operation by the Government. Of course, it never got off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> Following 1974, we saw a broad change in the ALP's uranium policies which reflected increasing interest in environmental matters. In November 1976, despite strong rank and file opposition to uranium exports, a five point resolution of the now Treasurer, Mr Keating, and Senator Button was passed in Caucus. It was opposed by Mr Uren, Dr Cass, Dr Cairns and former Senators Mulvihill and Gietzelt, and it read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) That existing contracts for uranium mining should be honoured, provided that no new mining developments are permitted to take place. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite apparently at that time, the loony Left were in control of the Labor Party. The resolution went on:</PARA>
<PARA>(2) That the Labor Party should continually press for stricter international safeguards and controls over the handling of nuclear materials. </PARA>
<PARA>(3) That it be made clear that the next Labor Government will not be bound to honour any future contracts entered into by the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Talk about sabotage of an industry. What a marvellous thing for a Labor opposition that at any future election could come into government to say! What a wonderful thing to say to future customers: `If you order now the uranium you require for your power station, we will not guarantee to honour it in the future'! That is the quickest way I know to frighten customers into going to other overseas suppliers. The resolution continued:</PARA>
<PARA>(4) That if, in government, the Labor Party is satisfied that the hazards associated with nuclear power have been eliminated and satisfactory methods of waste disposal developed the question of uranium mining be reconsidered in the context of full public debate. </PARA>
<PARA>(5) The ALP condemns the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>the coalition Government of the day-</PARA>
<PARA> for their haste in announcing decisions on the mining of uranium, without giving the Australian community time in which to debate this highly important subject, thereby disregarding the commission of inquiry's final recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating's proposal to the July 1977 ALP National Conference that this resolution should stand together with a two-year moratorium was rejected, and a much tougher policy was presented by Mr Dunstan and Mr Holding. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> A Labor Government would:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) declare a moratorium on uranium mining and treatment in Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, stop it altogether-</PARA>
<PARA> (b) repudiate any commitment of a non-Labor government to the mining, processing or export of Australia's uranium; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Not permit the mining, processing or export of uranium pursuant to agreement entered into contrary to Labor's policy. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems that the Labor Party has moved a step forward from that, and I notice that the Australian Democrats are still in that time warp. Given that attitude, it is no small wonder that the uranium industry has cause for concern. It would appear that Mr Hayden, speaking on an amendment to the Atomic Energy Act in 1978, reinforced the industry's cause for concern when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor in Government will not be constrained by this Government's-</PARA>
<PARA>the coalition Government's-</PARA>
<PARA>permissive uranium policy. We give fair warning to the companies, their financiers and potential customers that Labor will treat uranium responsibly. We will implement our policy of preventing the exploitation of Australian uranium while it poses unsolved threats to the environment, human health and welfare and to international security.</PARA>
<PARA>On attaining office in March 1983, the Federal Labor Government revoked all negotiating licences of uranium companies and by July 1984, at the ALP National Conference, the so called three-mine policy was firmly framed. Nabarlek, Ranger and Roxby Downs would continue and any new mines would be prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA> Pressure is now on the Government to review its uranium policies. The National Secretary of the ALP, Bob Hogg, admitted in September last year that the policy is contradictory and in need of revision. I can recall Senator Cook saying in this place two or three years ago that a committee had been formed and the matter was being reviewed and that we could expect some news on it fairly shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has canvassed the possibility of increasing uranium mining. As I said before, the pity is that factions in a disintegrating Labor Party are still calling the shots. We have had the fascinating example in recent days of two Ministers breaking ranks with Cabinet solidarity and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) calling them to order and saying to them, `You can debate this, but only within the forum of the Labor Party'. It is quite apparent that people such as Mr Hand have ignored that rebuke from the Prime Minister. That is not surprising because the Prime Minister himself is currently on the ropes and, I presume, it is only a matter of time before he will depart for greener pastures. </PARA>
<PARA> The three-mine policy has led to a situation where Australia, with the world's largest assured low-cost uranium source, has only 10 per cent of the world market; yet we have 30 per cent of the world's reserves. On the other hand, Canada has 30 per cent of the market and only 10 per cent of the world's reserves. It seems to me that the Canadians have beaten us to the punch over a long period in this area. They have the advantage of being able to offer, through their Candu project, the power station and the source of uranium to go with it. This is an opportunity which we may have missed in Australia. I hope we have not; I hope it is not too late for us to move into the enrichment area. Had we taken the opportunity to develop our own technology some 10 or 15 years ago, or perhaps even earlier, we would now be in a similar position to the Canadians. The Canadians are laughing all the way to the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good saying, as I am sure Senator Coulter will when he rises to speak, that we should not continue to supply uranium for nuclear power stations. We have to recognise the real world out there. France generates 60 to 70 per cent of its electricity from uranium. I notice that Japan has 41 operating nuclear power stations and is building another 10. A little country such as Switzerland has five, the United States (US) has 112 and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has 47. Those countries represent the real world out there, and there is a reason for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Countries decide to purchase uranium and build nuclear power stations because it is economic to do so and because they are bereft of sources of energy. I can recall many years ago being told by the anti-uranium lobby that I should take note that the countries who were buying uranium were interested only in making bombs. That is just not true; it is absolutely incorrect. The countries that buy uranium do not have an indigenous source of energy and therefore they look to countries such as Australia, Canada and other places to purchase that energy, whether it be coal, uranium or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> Korea provides an interesting example. It has no source of indigenous energy and it buys coal from Australia. It generates about 40 per cent of its power from nuclear energy. According to the figures, 3,000 tonnes of uranium is equivalent to 30 million tonnes of coal. It is all right for us to sit here in armchairs and pontificate about these things, but the countries that need to generate power for their people will look to the most efficient way to do it. Those countries have a balance-a percentage of their energy sources from coal and a percentage from uranium. One advantage of uranium is that it is a clean way of producing electricity. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia must protect itself to capture the proper market share when demand increases, as it inevitably will. We export our uranium under stringent international safeguards which allow the use of uranium only for peaceful purposes. We must do away with the present quite jaundiced policy which erodes our reputation as a fair trading nation and stymies once again enhancement of badly needed export income. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a great tragedy that the Federal Labor Government has procrastinated for so long and is not prepared to stand up to its responsibilities in this area. It is no oversight that the much vaunted recent industry statement by the Prime Minister, so ludicrously entitled Building a Better Australia, made no mention whatsoever of the three-mines policy or any envisaged changes to it. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 1970s-and most of us in this place had children growing up in that period of time-there was a great move to threaten our young people. Teachers and irresponsible people in the community seeking short term brownie points espoused the dangers of uranium. I know that there were some genuine people about, too, but I think that they were caught up in the general momentum. Young people were told by teachers that they would not make 21 years of age because they would be blown up by some nuclear bomb before then. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone knows that one of the great emotions in this world is fear-particularly, fear of the unknown. Radiation cannot be seen and, hence, there is a fear of the unknown. I know that kids were going around who had lost hope and who thought, `We are going to blow ourselves up; we will not make 21'. Of course, it did not happen. So the same group of people are now moving to a different arena and scaring people about the greenhouse effect, the ozone layer and so on. Time will tell whether they are correct. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly it was a great tragedy that the splitting of the atom-a great discovery-was treated in the way that it was, because it can be a wonderful servant of humanity, provided it is properly controlled and provided that safety measures are taken. It is like anything else; I do not know of anything in society which does not have some danger associated with it. I suppose if we took the view of these people about danger we would stop driving motor cars. My understanding is that more people are killed per year in motor accidents in Australia than there were Australians killed during the whole of the Vietnam war. I think we have to get some sort of balance in all of this. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most extraordinary claims made by those in the Labor Party who oppose the mining of uranium is that there is no market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolute rubbish, as Senator Tambling says. Will these people never learn? I have heard it all before. That was the argument used by the Whitlam Government when it prevented coal mines being developed by the use of export controls. That was the very same argument. We have this feeling of deja vu. When the Whitlam Government was thrown out and the curtain was lifted, a number of large mines were developed which increased our exports by some $20m or $30m per year. Without them, this country would be bankrupt today. The arguments are identical, just the product is different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even one of the proponents of uranium mining in the other place, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), remarked that while he supported uranium mining there was no urgency as there was no market until 1995. With that attitude, there will never be a market. Anyone with an inkling of an understanding of a major project, such as a power station, would know that not one spade of soil would be turned until a source of supply for the material to fuel the power station was secured. People are not that irresponsible; they are not going to commit millions of dollars to build something unless there is a source of supply. Apparently this Government has no understanding of the real world. When we hear remarks such as that from people, we realise just how out of touch they are with what happens on the international scene. Is it any wonder that we are staggering under a burden of an ongoing current account deficit and an absolute mountain of foreign debt which we cannot ignore?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will not oppose this legislation, but we will seek to amend it. I invite those people from the Labor Party who have given their consideration to the issue of uranium, including members of the Right, to take the opportunity to vote the way their Prime Minister has spoken and vote for this amendment. Government members will be moving swiftly towards their conference debate. They will be enhancing their changes in their conference debate towards a proper and timely decision-namely, the abolition of Labor's three-mine policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I move the amendment, I would like to refer to the accidents that have occurred in nuclear power stations, to which I am sure Senator Coulter will refer. In recent days we have seen the tragedy of those young people from Chernobyl who are visiting Australia. No-one would deny that it is a great tragedy. But I think the point has to be made that it is from these sorts of tragedies that we will learn how to correct the building of these power stations in order to prevent these sorts of accidents from occurring in the future. Tragedies have occurred over the years-we have had plagues, pestilence and a whole range of things-and this was one such tragedy. All experts in the field have commented that the Chernobyl power station reactor was of a design that would not have been built or licensed in the West. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express very considerable disgust at what I have just heard, but certainly no surprise. It seems that, even more than the Government, the Opposition is driven by greed-by dollar signs-and whatever will turn a profit is acceptable, no matter what the risks. The nuclear industry is a filthy industry. Its record of deceit, damage and extreme adverse impact on human health is an absolute disaster and one which I will review in the time which I have in front of me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is only one point upon which I agree with Senator Parer-I think it is a point of logic rather than a point of fact-and that is, that the Government's three mines-policy is inconsistent. But the solution to that is not to open more mines; the solution to that inconsistency is to phase out those mines which we already have. I believe that one could make a very substantial case on good, sound economic grounds as to why that would be to the long term economic benefit of this country, as well as addressing those very serious problems of human health and safety and environmental damage. </PARA>
<PARA> I come from a background of research science from the late 1950s through to the 1980s when I was elected to the Senate. I admit that through the 1940s, most of the 1950s and into the late 1960s I held precisely the same views as Senator Parer has just espoused. </PARA>
<PARA> It seemed that indeed one could utilise this marvellous form of energy and, as was enunciated in President Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program-in 1953, I think-that nuclear power would be so cheap that it could be provided to consumers unmetered. The concerns over safety and so on and the difficulty of managing this inherently very complex technology had not yet been perceived. </PARA>
<PARA> But by the late 1960s, working in a research laboratory in areas which related to the dangers of chemicals for human health and seeing the parallels between that and radiation, I began to collect a dossier on nuclear energy and on the emerging concerns over the safety of that industry. By 1972 I had formulated the view that the nuclear industry was one industry which simply should not be developed and should not be relied upon for the development of power; that there were indeed too many inherent, inevitable, inescapable, adverse consequences associated with this industry that made it totally unacceptable in a civilised world that had concern for the long term survival of human kind. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1972 I formulated a policy document which was adopted by the Conservation Council of South Australia; in 1972 it was adopted by the Town and Country Planning Association of South Australia, of which I was then the Secretary; and in 1973, when I was elected to the Council of the Australian Conservation Foundation, it was the very first policy that I put before that body. That policy was adopted and remains today the policy not only of the Australian Conservation Foundation, but also of most conservation bodies throughout this country that have considered the question of the safety and the ethics of mining and exporting uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to that history and looking at this industry over that very long period, all I can say is that nothing that I have seen-absolutely nothing-since adopting that policy very deliberately and after great consideration in 1972 has caused me to shift from that position; everything I have seen has confirmed that those fears which were then becoming evident were justified and that this was an industry that was indeed totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill we are considering seeks to increase the tariff on uranium exports from the Kakadu region, the Northern Territory region, with a view to supporting the Office of the Supervising Scientist. I have no difficulty with that except that, if I saw the opportunity, I would seek to amend this tariff to make it far more substantial, as I have on previous occasions. Indeed, the tariff nowhere near picks up the total costs of this industry, either to the Australian community or to the world community. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning specifically to the economics of this industry, I think it is important to develop arguments which are based on the way in which, since the turn of the century when radiation was first identified and used for a range of purposes, the allowable levels of exposure of the human population have been progressively reduced. In other words, as more information has come to light, so we have discovered that radiation is a great deal more damaging to human health than we hitherto thought. </PARA>
<PARA> As I recall the situation-while I have lectured on this, I do not have my lecture notes in front of me-between the early years of this century and 1926 when the International Commission of Radiological Protection (ICRP) was first formed, there were no standards. It was believed that radiation was a fairly benign physical phenomenon. One had people, particularly patients with cancers and a range of skin diseases and other things, being exposed to very high levels of radiation. Indeed, many of the people who worked with radiation in those earlier years died as a consequence of that radiation exposure simply because the hazards were not recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I am right in saying that the ICRP came into existence in 1926. I recall that the first standard that was struck was 15 rads-that is the old unit-of exposure per week. Putting that into the units which are used these days, that corresponds with 7,500 millisieverts of radiation per year. The present recommendation of the ICRP is 20 millisieverts per year. That gives the Senate some indication as to how, as more information comes to light, the allowable level of radiation which is regarded as acceptable-it is not necessarily safe; every international body accepts that there is no safe level of exposure to radiation; the size of the risk simply relates to the size of the exposure-has progressively reduced. The acceptable level is now 20 millisieverts whereas, in those early years, it was 7,500 millisieverts. For a very long time, through the 1950s until quite recently, the acceptable level was 5 rads-rems is the more correct term-per year; that, of course, is 50 millisieverts. As I have said, the ICRP is now recommending a reduction to 2 millisieverts. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several things that one needs to observe about this. Apart from the fact that as more information comes to light it tends to confirm that radiation is a great deal more damaging to human health than we formerly thought, the processes by which the allowable levels are reduced are very long and tedious. By the late 1970s, many reputable scientists had observed that due to the numbers of cancers occurring in certain areas-women who had been treated by way of mammographic investigation; people who had been exposed to radiation for a range of other medical conditions; patients with tuberculosis who had had a large number of chest X-rays and so on-the standards which then applied, namely, 50 millisieverts per year, were simply too high. The impact of that amount of radiation on human health was quite unacceptable. Yet it has taken until now for the ICRP to recommend that reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> Even before that reduction has come into effect, we have evidence-published last year in the British Medical Journal-that with respect to the exposure of male workers to radiation and the impact of that exposure on the offspring of those male workers, in terms of the incidence of leukaemia, it is indicative that even the level of 20 millisieverts needs to be very substantially reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention what this study showed. It began as a study of the children of workers at Sellafield in the United Kingdom where built next-door was not only the first civil nuclear power station-initially built for the production of plutonium for UK test weapons that were actually tested in Australia, but it later became a nuclear power station-but also a reprocessing works. Even the nuclear industry recognises that reprocessing is, to use its own words, `The dirty end of the nuclear business'. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the incidence of leukaemia among the children of these workers, the study found that with levels above 100 millisieverts total exposure-I point out that if the present ICRP recommendation of 20 millisieverts per year is accepted, one would have only to work in that environment for five years to get that total exposure-there was between a sixfold and eightfold increase in the incidence of leukaemia among the offspring. </PARA>
<PARA> That led to a study of a number of other nuclear establishments in the United Kingdom where the cumulative exposure to radiation was much less than at Sellafield. As I say, Sellafield has the reprocessing plant which is a very dirty-and accepted as such-industry. The study looked at the children of workers at Dounreay and Aldermaston. I stress that the cumulative exposure at Aldermaston for the workers was only 7.8 millisieverts. In other words, that would be about four months of work at the maximum allowable level; it is about a third of the year of exposure. At 7.8 millisieverts total exposure, the increased incidence of leukaemia in those children was 40 per cent above background. In other words, the level which has yet to come in under the ICRP recommendation is already being recognised as being probably far too excessive and will produce a great deal of ill health. </PARA>
<PARA> If we turn to Australia and look at the exposure of workers, say, at Roxby Downs, we find that some of the miners at Roxby Downs are currently being exposed to levels above 20 millisieverts per year. At the Sellafield end of the scale, some five or six years of exposure in that mine could potentially increase the incidence of leukaemia in their children by a factor of six to eight. </PARA>
<PARA> This evidence is totally ignored by Senator Parer. It is the evidence which, I believe, will lead progressively to a shutdown of the nuclear industry around the world. Either governments and communities around the world must ignore this evidence and expose their nuclear workers to these unacceptably high levels and suffer the consequences because they are greedy and do not accept that there are alternatives-and there are-or, by accepting these levels, these risks, these dangers, they will reduce the allowable levels of exposure. The nuclear industry will find it quite incapable of operating under these far more stringent standards and will face a progressive shutdown. Where does that leave all of the lovely loot that Senator Parer spoke of which is to come from opening up these new mines? It would be an economic disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the points that I made in an earlier speech today. We need to look further down the track to see what is likely to happen and to make our decisions on the facts, to use Senator Parer's words, `on the real world', not on airy-fairy ideas that we can open up these mines and, miraculously, the money will simply flow in. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer mentioned the Chernobyl disaster. Let me remind the Senate that some time before the fire at Chernobyl, Dr B. Semenov, who was the Director of Nuclear Safety at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, published a long scientific article in the IAEA Journal pointing out the inherent safety of the RBMK 1,000 reactor-the Chernobyl type reactor-saying that it was absolutely impossible for the Chernobyl type accident to happen. That is the organisation on which people like Senator Parer rely for assertions that this industry can be made safe-when the Director of Nuclear Safety can make a demonstrably false assertion such as that. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been in recent days, particularly with the visit here by the children from Chernobyl, speculation regarding the total impact of that disaster. I would reiterate, as I have previously, that when the Russians went to the IAEA meeting in August of the year in which that nuclear reactor caught fire, their own assessment to the IAEA of the expected number of cancers which would arise as a consequence of that disaster, in western Russia alone, was 40,000. John Gofman, the person who has written one of the best textbooks on the question of radiation exposure and human health, has estimated that the total number of cancers arising throughout western Europe as a consequence of the Chernobyl disaster would be of the order of one million cancers. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is absolutely true that even a million cancers arising in a population of that size would be quite undetectable, because there is nothing about the cancers, be they leukaemias or anything else, which arise from radiation exposure which are unique. In every respect they are identical to any other cancer, and no cancer bears a tag on it saying, `caused by radiation'. Given the background incidence of cancer, that some 25 per cent of all populations in Western countries get cancer at some time in their lives and some 20 per cent of all populations-and this is typical of Australia-will die of cancer, that increase of a million cancers spread over perhaps 40 years throughout western Europe would remain completely undetectable. Nonetheless, one can predict, on the known relationship between radiation exposure and the incidence of cancer, that those cancers will be caused, and it is another area in which the nuclear industry has been incredibly deceptive in saying that there is no evidence of harm. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence of harm, very often, because, firstly, people have not looked-they have not kept the proper epidemiological data on which one might base a study; and secondly, even if one looks, very often one can hide behind the claim that there is no evidence of harm because the background incidence is so high, because there is a very long latency-it takes anything from 5 to 40 years before the cancers will show themselves-and because there is no identification and there is nothing unique about cancers caused by radiation. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to those matters, one needs also to consider the relationship between the so-called civil nuclear industry-the `peaceful' use of nuclear power-and the military uses of nuclear energy. Again, I find it absolutely remarkable that Senator Parer should talk about the safety which is placed upon the nuclear industry by such things as the Non-Proliferation Treaty and, in the case of those nations which are non-signatories, such as France, the bilateral agreements which are drawn up between Australia and those countries. Those agreements are bits of paper. They have no force whatsoever when the processed uranium, in whatever form, is already in the foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA> We have recently seen the massive bombardment of Iraq which was substantially supported by the argument that if Iraq was not quickly subdued it may develop a nuclear weapon. From where did Iraq get its nuclear capability? The French were building a nuclear power station in Baghdad. The Israelis, years ago, recognised the link between the civil use of that nuclear power and the potential which it gave Saddam Hussein to develop nuclear weapons. They went in before that nuclear power station had any fuel in it and exercised a pre-emptive strike. Firstly, the Israelis knew that had they struck the nuclear power station once the fuel was in it, the spread of radiation would have been a disaster-possibly including for themselves if the wind was in the right direction. Secondly, if they had not struck then, there was a clear possibility that, by using a civil nuclear power station and simply taking the fuel out a bit earlier when there was, more or less, the right isotope mix of plutonium, Saddam Hussein could have developed nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Who supplies France with uranium? Unfortunately, Australia supplies France with uranium. It is quite conceivable that, had that nuclear program which Saddam Hussein was attempting to run progressed further, Australian uranium could have been in bombs which Saddam Hussein manufactured and used in the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> Before that we saw the Iraq-Iran war. Before that war broke out, the Germans were not only building six nuclear power stations in Iran, but also actually providing the reprocessing facilities which would have allowed the Iranians to extract the plutonium and make weapons. It is fortunate for us-and I point out the arbitrariness of the sequence of events-that that war broke out and the Germans stopped providing that material for the Iranians. To attempt to argue that there are not demonstrably significant links between the civil use of nuclear facilities and the military uses is to fly in the face of very recent and very obvious evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make two final points. Again in recent days one has seen assertions that nuclear energy is a way of addressing the greenhouse problem. There has been a great deal of work done on this and the appropriate way of looking at this is precisely the way that economists look at benefits from alternative investments. If one is going to invest a given number of dollars in various ways to address the problem of the greenhouse effect, one should be looking at how best to derive the maximum amount of benefit, in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions, that one derives for the expenditure of those dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> It is abundantly clear from all the studies that to spend a dollar on a nuclear power station, instead of spending a dollar on the energy efficiency improvements which can be made and for which we already have the technology-the technology being safe-is, in fact, to increase the level of greenhouse gas emissions, simply because one can derive a greater benefit from spending that money on efficiency improvements. Those efficiency improvements are not only to be had in the developed world, where we have a profligate use of energy, but they are as much to be made in developing and Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, China uses approximately four times as much energy as Japan to derive the same dollar increase in its gross domestic product. It does it in a very environmentally damaging way. But without any further development of generating capacity, China could very substantially improve its position by improving the efficiency with which it uses the energy that is already available to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the figures work out something like this: in terms of greenhouse emission reductions it is seven times more economically efficient to spend money on energy efficiency than it is to spend money on nuclear power stations. Those who ignore this fact and pretend that somehow or other one is going to make a substantial improvement in regard to the greenhouse effect by going down the nuclear road, if that line is accepted, are simply ensuring that one will have a very small nuclear program and still a very large greenhouse gas emission problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point that I would make is that, in considering the question of uranium mining in Australia, which is the subject of this Bill, Senator Parer has raised the question of whether more mines should be opened. One should be looking at alternative ways in which the investment which would be necessary to open those mines might make a better profit. It is not simply sufficient to point out that if one exports X thousand tonnes of yellowcake, one will get Y million dollars in benefit. What one needs to do is to consider, if one spends Z amount of dollars, which one has to do to make that investment, what will be the benefit if one invested those Z dollars somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is quite clear that there are many opportunities. Again, this goes to the substance of an earlier speech which I made today. There are many opportunities in Australia to spend our dollars a great deal more wisely in terms of where we need to go and where we must go to produce a great deal more environmental benefit and, indeed, a great deal more longer term profit than simply by opening more mines. That seems to me to be quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I return to this point: given the very substantial reductions which have already occurred in allowable radiation exposure of workers and the very probable further and very substantial reductions, I believe the nuclear industry is indeed on its way out and we should not proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1991 proposes to amend the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980 to incorporate into that Act a proposal to increase the duty on exported uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers Region in the Northern Territory from $1.15 to $1.30 as from 21 February 1990, as incorporated in clause 3 of the Bill. The levy, which applies only to exports of uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory, is imposed partially to offset the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities undertaken by the Commonwealth to protect the Alligator Rivers Region. The increase required has arisen in part because only one mine is now operating in that area. When the rate was originally set it was envisaged that several uranium mines would be operating by now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Between 1980 and 1987 it was the intention of the Government in setting the levy to recover about 50 per cent of the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities by the Office of the Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region associated with uranium mining operations in the region. In 1988 the Government announced that the then levy of $1.02 per kilogram, which came into effect during 1987, would be extended to recover about 75 per cent of those costs. The explanatory memorandum to the 1989 amendment to increase the levy to $1.30 contains the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The increase in the level of the levy reflects the . . . costs associated with protecting the environment from potential adverse effects of uranium mining should be borne as far as is practicable by the industry carrying out those operations, and not the ordinary taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> By and large the levy falls on the shoulders of one company, Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA), the operators of the Ranger uranium mine. Energy Resources of Australia submitted to the inquiry into mining and minerals processing in Australia, undertaken by the Industry Commission, that the levy might appear to be an example of the user-pays principle. However, none of the buyer-seller relationship applies. I should add that the duty is raised only on operating mines in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Office of the Supervising Scientist provides services to other organisations. Therefore, the funding structure for the Office of the Supervising Scientist should comprise appropriate payments from all users. ERA has also stated that, because the Office of the Supervising Scientist has failed to produce any practices and procedures of value to the environmental management of the Ranger mine, Energy Resources of Australia has had to bear the additional costs of having to develop those standards, practices and procedures relevant to environmental management and rehabilitation of the region. This has been at enormous cost to Ranger uranium mine, which has contributed largely to environmental protection in the area, often at costs that far exceed those of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. The current annual expenditure by Ranger uranium mine on preserving the environment around the mine site is approximately $5m. Over the past 11 years, the operation of Ranger uranium has spent over $50m on environmental preservation of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted with interest an editorial in the Northern Territory News dated Saturday, 10 November 1990, which referred to this important fact relating to the Office of the Supervising Scientist. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> To be sure, they make big holes in the ground and they use substances and chemicals which are pollutants. </PARA>
<PARA> But, at least nowadays, their environmental standards are very high and they take extreme precautions to ensure that their operations are within the bounds of tolerance. </PARA>
<PARA> When they finish, they invariably rehabilitate the land, often leaving it better than it was before they started. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond those simple facts is another. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that without mining we could not maintain our living standards, much less improve them. </PARA>
<PARA> It therefore comes down to whether we are prepared to see our standards plummet so that no unsightly big holes are made by mechanical bilbies. </PARA>
<PARA> Most reasonable people would say that mining is an industry upon whose health depends our wealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission report that has been looking at this matter recommended that the responsibilities of the Office of the Supervising Scientist be transferred to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Northern Territory University, or appropriate agencies in the Northern Territory. This is a view which I have held for some time and a number of my colleagues have certainly ensured that it is the policy of the Liberal and National parties. It has certainly been an area that we have promoted actively in this Parliament and in our parties. </PARA>
<PARA> On a number of occasions, the former Minister, Senator Richardson, has sought to discredit Ranger uranium mine in order to influence the Australian Labor Party committee which is currently looking at uranium policy of the Government. His motive, of course, is to secure the green vote at the cost of Australia's economic prospects in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the serious question: why is neither Senator Richardson nor any other member of the Australian Labor Party participating in this debate today? There is only the Minister listed at the end of the debate in order to provide the cursory summary. I acknowledge that Senator Coulter and I have extremely different views on this matter, but I acknowledge his courage in coming in here and putting his differing view.

Not one member of the Labor Party has got the courage to come in here and put his or her view, yet this issue is fundamental to this year's National Conference of the Labor Party and to where the Government is taking this country. There are thousands of jobs for Australians at stake in this industry. There are important environmental impacts, as Senator Coulter has recognised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These questions are directed to me, if I might say so, and, in that context, they are scurrilous. The last question I regard as particularly outrageous, and let me answer it full on and up front. The implication of this question is that some unions may have donated to a fighting fund, and if they did the only fighting fund that I am aware of is a fighting fund of which I was a trustee or supporter-I am not quite sure what my capacity was, to be precise-when I was a member of the Australian Labor Party administrative committee in Western Australia in 1982 and 1983. That was a fighting fund of the Labor Party to remove from office the Fraser Government. I am proud of my association with fund raising in the union movement for that purpose, but the implication of this question is that unions that may have donated to that somehow now have received favours in the form of payments by this Government. That is an implication which is foul indeed and it is not an implication which is in any way true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not remember which unions may have donated to the trade union fighting fund or which factory gate meetings of workers in 1982 and 1983 may have donated to that fund. It was back in 1982 and 1983 and, although I have a good memory, I do not have a memory that is that perfect. Certainly there were no strings on the donations. The donations were made specifically for the political purposes of removing the Liberals from office in Western Australia and federally. As I have said, the innuendo is disgraceful. Some unions have received funds from this Government. I do not happen to know which donated to the fund and I do not happen to know whether they are the same organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of government programs under which unions may qualify for grants. Two of them that come to mind are the union rationalisation program and the workplace reform program. Both programs, and indeed all programs of this Government involving unions, have been announced either in Budgets or formal statements by this Government. The funds allocated to them are set out in statements by the Government and are subject to scrutiny of Estimates committees in terms of the management and direction of those funds.</PARA>
<PARA> While it may be true that some honourable senators opposite have tried to pretend that this Government directs funds to unions-I have in memory a statement by, I think, Senator Short-in a way which is not meant for the purpose, no-one opposite has ever bothered to ask or make a public statement about how much money this Government gives to employer organisations for the same purposes, and I might say - -</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was asked whether any money was allocated to this fighting fund from non-union sources. That was a question from Senator Hill. That is certainly not the case to my knowledge and it would certainly be against and absolutely the reverse of the custom and practice of that. Any allegations of that nature, one of which was made by the journalist Max Walsh in a column this week and last, is a falsity, and I declared that yesterday. I have asked the Sydney Morning Herald to retract that statement or allegation. I am taking legal advice on that point in the event that the newspaper does not retract it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When did it cease? I am not sure whether the ALP's trade union fighting fund has been wound up or whether it continues. I must say that I hope it continues. I would like to be actively supporting it and asking and encouraging unions to donate to it because I think there is a real reason to prevent Senator Hill's lot from ever getting into power.</PARA>
<PARA> What did Michael Beahan say to the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters? I am glad that Senator Hill has obviously read, at last, the transcript of what Senator Beahan said, which was not the position when he made the allegations in his question yesterday. But I have here a letter that Senator Beahan sent to the editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, which I shall seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard, and from which I wish to quote, about the article that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald and its author, Maximilian Walsh. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he claims that, in evidence to the WA Royal Commission, I indicated that I was excluded from the administration of two accounts, the Leaders Fighting Fund and the Union Fighting Fund. In fact, I said precisely the opposite. The transcript reads `As I remember the two accounts that I was associated with or had knowledge of at the time were the Union Fighting Fund and the Leaders Fighting Fund . . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Beahan goes on to make a series of points:</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, and as indicated, the Union Fighting Fund in WA was known to me. It was run as part of the Party's normal internal accounts and was, as such, subject to the scrutiny of various Party bodies and was officially audited.</PARA>
<PARA>The allegation yesterday by Senator Hill was that this was a secret fund. This is a statement which scotches that completely. I do not expect an apology but I point that out. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, no employer money was ever deposited in the Union Fighting Fund. It was a fund established to attract exclusively Union donations towards the 1983 State election.</PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, all funds raised for the 1983 election campaign were spent on that campaign. None was used for the purposes alleged in the article. This was why the account was set up and run under union supervision.</PARA>
<PARA>Fourthly, records of the Union Fighting Fund have been submitted to the Royal Commission as requested by them.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, whatever allegations are made against the Leaders Fund, regarding lack of Party control (and some fairly wild and unsubstantiated ones have been made), no such allegations can be directed either at the Union Fighting Fund or at Senator Cook.</PARA>
<PARA>I conclude this extended quote:</PARA>
<PARA>This is just another example of innuendo being reported as fact in the hysteria surrounding the Royal Commission. I have come to expect it from inexperienced juniors, it is disappointing that a person of Mr Walsh's standing should be gullibly caught up in it.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that answers all of the questions put to me by Senator Hill. I seek leave to have the letter incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Editor</PARA>
<PARA>Sydney Morning Herald</PARA>
<PARA>GPO Box 506</PARA>
<PARA>SYDNEY NSW 2000</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir</PARA>
<PARA>As a long-standing reader of the Max Walsh column and admirer of his journalistic professionalism and objectivity, I was disappointed at the sloppiness and inaccuracy of two recent articles in which Mr Walsh appears to be trying to fit a number of discrete, unrelated and obviously unchecked facts into a pre-determined view on the role and power of unions.</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to articles in the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday 8 and Monday 15 April. In the April 8 article he claims that, in evidence to the WA Royal Commission, I indicated that I was excluded from the administration of two accounts, the Leaders Fighting Fund and the Union Fighting Fund. In fact, I said precisely the opposite. The transcript reads ` `As I remember it the two accounts that I was associated with or had knowledge of at the time were the Union Fighting Fund and the Leaders Fighting Fund . . . .''</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to assert, through some obscure and convoluted logic that the significance of the union fighting fund is that it somehow leads to union control, both state and federally over the Labor Party, and that this is by implication unacceptable. In the process he off-handedly implicates the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Peter Cook.</PARA>
<PARA>In the April 15 article he links the Union Fighting Fund with the alleged channelling of employer money into union campaigns in and outside WA.</PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the oversimplification of the whole question of the relationship between the union movement and the Labor Party, Mr Walsh's arguments bear no relation to the facts surrounding the existence of the union fighting fund-facts which Mr Walsh should have checked before making such serious allegations.</PARA>
<PARA>* Firstly, and as indicated, the Union Fighting Fund in WA was known to me. It was run as part of the Party's normal internal accounts and was, as such, subject to the scrutiny of various Party bodies and was officially audited.</PARA>
<PARA>* Secondly, no employer money was ever deposited in the Union Fighting Fund. It was a fund established to attract exclusively Union donations towards the 1983 State election.</PARA>
<PARA>* Thirdly, all funds raised for the 1983 election campaign were spent on that campaign. None was used for the purposes alleged in the article. This was why the account was set up and run under union supervision.</PARA>
<PARA>* Fourthly, records of the Union Fighting Fund Account have been submitted to the Royal Commission as requested by them.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition senators, as I was saying, have attempted to cloud the need for full disclosure legislation with a smokescreen of fairness and equity, as they call it. Their attitude to disclosure is essentially disclosure at the least possible inconvenience to their party machine. That is not the way disclosure operates and not the way it should operate. The reality is that if there is conflict between the interests of the party machine and the public, then the public interest should prevail. That was a principle that was expressed by Commissioner Roden in the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption report on the investigation into north coast development. He had this to say on the proposition of what should be the primary interest:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If there is a conflict between the public interest and the convenience of the major political parties, the public interest must be allowed to prevail.</PARA>
<PARA>So the principle behind this statement is that convenience should be subjugated to the interests of the public.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, if one looks at the statement only, it shows that Opposition senators obviously have their eyes closed to other comments coming from Liberal Party spokespeople. On the same day as Dr Hewson announced his so-called commitment to disclosure, the Federal President of the Liberal Party, Mr Ashley Goldsworthy, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The party organisation still remains to be convinced that it is possible to draft legislation to meet the fairness and equity test.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very basic precondition. The Liberal Party remains to be convinced that it is possible to meet the test that it lays, a test which is totally irrelevant to governments framing disclosure legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Not only that, when one looks at the statement itself one finds so many qualifications in it that it is made worthless. The coalition's commitment in this area relates solely to disclosure of political donations. It neither relates to disclosure of political expenditure nor to income statements from political parties or third party organisations. Where does the Liberal Party stand on this basic issue? Without that sort of disclosure there cannot be effective disclosure legislation or transparency in the way the corporate sector interrelates with political parties. It is necessary for this sort of full disclosure of income and expenditure statements to enable expenditure cross-checks, particularly when third party organisations and front organisations are involved.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also not one reference in the Liberal Party's statement to the spot auditing power of the Australian Electoral Commission. That is not surprising, but there cannot be effective disclosure legislation unless there are effective spot auditing provisions. In terms of the Liberal Party's record, we have to remember that it was in 1984, when the Australian Electoral Commission sought to conduct the spot audit on electoral parties' accounts, that the Liberal Party refused to accede to the request. It refused and confronted the Electoral Commission with legal advice. As a consequence, it rendered the spot audit provisions of the Act as they now exist inoperative. There is no commitment to spot auditing in Dr Hewson's statement.</PARA>
<PARA> What we have is a Liberal Party position that does not recognise that disclosure is not designed to be at the convenience of political parties, but that it is designed for the convenience of the public.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since Senator Parer has raised that point, I will go back to spot auditing and what his members on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters had to say about what is probably the most effective instrument in ensuring full disclosure. It is an amazing quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The purposes of such spot audits, as expressed by the Commissioner, would be to enable the Australian Electoral Commission to say with a clearer conscience and more confidence that everything appears to be satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA>What does the Liberal Party say about that? I will continue:</PARA>
<PARA>This is not sufficient reason to trifle with free democratic processes.</PARA>
<PARA>This is very much the conflict between those on this side of the Parliament and those on the other side. If one does not think that the interests of ensuring that the Electoral Commission can say with a clearer conscience and more confidence that everything appears to be satisfactory in the electoral process, then we can see very much where the Liberal Party is coming from. That is a quotation from Senator Short and Messrs Wooldridge and Cobb.</PARA>
<PARA> The statement also contains other qualifications which confirm our scepticism on this side. The Liberal Party talks about preventing discrimination against donors to governments or political parties and discrimination against donors by governments or third parties. This perpetuates the myth which has been perpetrated by the Liberal Party of some sort of safety valve. In putting this concept forward, the Liberal Party has not been able to produce one example of such discrimination or an instance of one other country in the world whose disclosure laws include such a provision.</PARA>
<PARA> We go on to the further qualification-and the statement is riddled with them-that we need to have a level playing field between the parties regarding taxation. That has been seen for what it is-an irrelevant furphy. All donations from whatever source will need to be equally disclosed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The immediate effect is contracts worth $455m for those two companies to build major components for Boeing aircraft. However, I must say that the important thing about these contracts is that they were gained against tough international competition and, in the words of Boeing, in a manner that demonstrates that Australian industry in this area can compete in the competitive world of aerospace. The contracts are worth $455m and are in addition to a $1 billion workload from Boeing currently flowing to those industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Contracts involve a number of things. Australian engineers are in Seattle right now working on these projects. I should add that the contracts are also the result of a long term memorandum of understanding that I signed yesterday with Boeing. Under the memorandum, Boeing has agreed that Australian companies will be allowed to compete for contracts on a free and fair basis and, clearly, they can win work on that basis. Boeing has also placed, or agreed to place, work with a number of other companies in the aerospace and high technology fields. Boeing, of course, has also been freed of its obligations under the civil offsets program.</PARA>
<PARA> On the employment side, the two contracts for the sole supply of tail control surfaces for Boeing's new 777 aircraft will lead to significant employment opportunities in Australia's aerospace industries. When output is at its peak, AeroSpace Technologies of Australia expects to have an extra 200 staff employed at its Avalon facility near Geelong and Hawker De Havilland has said that it will employ an extra 160 staff at its Bankstown facility when delivery of the shipsets peaks in the mid-1990s. Hawker De Havilland will also build a $10m plant to manufacture the elevator sections.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources. Last week Minister Griffiths made a statement in the House in which he objected to my claim that he had received strong representations from the Japanese Embassy in regard to the withholding of several shipments of Japanese seaweed which contained up to 108 times the allowable level of arsenic and up to 40 times the allowable level of cadmium. These shipments were released onto the Australian market on the order of the Minister and no identification was attached to this food so that Australian consumers could identify and avoid the contaminated material. Is it a fact that the seaweed was impounded on the basis of its excessive arsenic and cadmium content? Were representations made from Mr Kazutoshi Ito, Councillor, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, of the Japanese Embassy, to Mr G. M. James, Assistant Secretary, Environment Health Branch, Department of Community Services and Health? Did those representations make a case for releasing the contaminated seaweed onto the Australian market? At the request of the Australia Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), did the food science and technology subcommittee review the allowable levels of arsenic and cadmium in seaweed and decide and recommend that no change in the Australian standards be made? Finally, was Minister Griffiths advised of these processes, negotiations and decisions; and if not, why not?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might say that from my knowledge of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, it is not able to be directed, in the way in which this question implies that it has been, by a Minister. It is a service which is accountable under its charter to its officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Griffiths has given me an answer in the event that a question of this nature is asked. I can now answer Senator Coulter's cognate question. The fact is that until recently there were no specific standards for permissible levels of arsenic and cadmium in seaweed and kelp in the food standards code of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). In the absence of specific requirements, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service commenced testing imported seaweed and kelp in mid-January, using the arsenic and cadmium standards which apply to food stuffs generally. The interception and testing of these products by AQIS identified a number of samples in which arsenic and cadmium levels exceed the limits. Considerable scientific debate ensued as to whether the general standards were appropriate or, alternatively, whether a standard focusing on the more toxic inorganic component of arsenic should be established.</PARA>
<PARA> An urgent review of both standards was undertaken by the National Health and Medical Research Council within its framework. Pending completion of the review, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service followed advice from the Department of Community Services and Health on the appropriate disposition of individual shipments where laboratory tests indicated a possible risk to consumers. Most consignments were permitted to enter the country, based on this scientific assessment, without influence from any overseas government.</PARA>
<PARA> The NHMRC has now recommended on scientific grounds that the permissible levels of arsenic and cadmium should be amended to bring them into line with those provided for fish and fish products in the food standards code. In the course of these events the Japanese Embassy in Canberra did maintain contact with both AQIS and the National Health and Medical Research Council to obtain information on the basis of Australia's concerns about the safety of these products.</PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to Senator Coulter's offensive inference, I am advised that at no time did officials of the Japanese Embassy make contact with either Mr Griffiths or his office, nor did they influence the outcome.</PARA>

I am surprised to hear the Minister say that the NHMRC has recommended a different level from that which, he correctly says, was a general level and not specific to seaweed. However, is it not a fact-and this goes to the fourth part of my question-that the food, science and technology subcommittee did, in January, review the allowable levels of arsenic and cadmium specifically with relation to those levels in seaweed, and decided and recommended that no change be made in the Australian standards? Therefore, the question is: on what basis did the NHMRC make that different decision?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a matter for the Council, but I can direct this question to it and find out, if it is prepared to tell me, what its reasons were.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Can the Minister give the Senate any further details of President Bush's announcement about relief operations for the Kurds inside Iraq? What is the Australian Government's attitude towards this development?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2575" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, President Bush announced that following consultations with the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General and the leaders of Britain, Turkey, France and Germany, he had directed the United States of America military to establish what he described as five or six `encampments' in northern Iraq from which relief supplies could be distributed to Kurds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From my understanding of what President Bush said, two very good reasons for taking this approach were emphasised. First, it will establish an on-site presence in Iraq through which supplies can be delivered and medical treatment given to those most in need. Secondly, it will require the Kurds to come down from the mountain terrain-which, in itself, is hampering the provision of relief-and set up camp in the lower more sheltered areas inside Iraq closer to their homes.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to appreciate that what President Bush is proposing is by no stretch of the imagination a military offensive against the Iraqi army. It is purely a humanitarian exercise which is to be facilitated inside Iraq by the only organisation in a position to do that job without delay, that is to say, the United States (US) military.</PARA>
<PARA> The military, as I understand it, will establish the camps and provide security for both the Kurds who visit them and the international relief agencies which will work from them. The encampments will thus serve as a bridge for the return of Kurds to their traditional homelands, which is both the objective of the international community and the desire of the majority of the displaced Kurds.</PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, President Bush has characterised the scheme as an interim measure and not as a permanent stationing of US ground forces in Iraq. The Iraqi Government has to date heeded the US warning not to fly aircraft north of the thirty-sixth parallel and will, hopefully-we do not yet know-raise no substantive objection to the current relief effort. Iraq, after all, has a standing amnesty on Kurds returning to their homes. The UN humanitarian relief delegation currently in Iraq, led by Eric Suy, has yet to make its report but will no doubt be liaising with the Iraqi authorities on the implementation of this plan.</PARA>
<PARA> Authority for the action in question derives from Security Council resolution 688, which requests the Secretary-General to `use all resources at his disposal' to urgently address the needs of the refugees and further `demands that Iraq cooperate with the Secretary-General to these ends'. In fulfilling this requirement, the US initiative builds on the idea initially expressed by Turkey and picked up by Britain of establishing an area in which relief could be got to the Kurdish people without them or the relief agencies being attacked by Iraqi forces.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia very much welcomes this development as a positive and timely step in the right direction in that it better directs the emergency relief effort in the short term and encourages a return to Iraq by the refugees in the longer term.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I advised the Senate last month, Australia dispatched two oil pollution experts to be a part of the international coordination committee on cleaning up the spill in the Gulf. One was from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the other was from the Australian Institute of Petroleum. Both of those experts have now returned to Australia and have been replaced by others from the Queensland Department of Transport and, again, the Australian Institute of Petroleum. They made a very positive contribution to assisting with the clean-up of the spill. It has been reported to me that we have benefited greatly from this knowledge, in that we now have the capacity to provide assistance, if it were necessary-and hopefully it will not be-with any major problem such as an oil spill in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia also sent to the Gulf last month two oil skimmers on board a Royal Australian Air Force courier flight. The Australian equipment was put into immediate use in the Gulf at Abu 'Ali Island and has contributed significantly to the recovery of oil from Gulf waters. Each one of these skimmers is capable of recovering about 45 tonnes of oil per hour. The skimmers were drawn from the reserve of oil spill control equipment which forms part of Australia's national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil. However, the removal of these two pieces of equipment from the Australian inventory will not affect in any way our capacity to cope with an emergency should it happen here, because the Australian Government-and I am very pleased with the cooperation I have received from the Minister for Finance-committed itself to replacing immediately the quarter of a million dollars worth of equipment which has been sent to the Gulf.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I ask this question against the background of the determinations made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission yesterday and some of the interpretations placed upon these decisions. What is the impact of the Bench's decision upon the prices and incomes accord between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions? Does the national wage case decision mean that the accord, as claimed, is dead?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was Mark Twain who said, `Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated'. If that were the case, those words are applicable to the accord. Those pundits who have forecast in some of the articles that I have seen today that the accord may be over, or the accord is dead, are greatly exaggerating the situation. The accord is in good shape, although it is true-and this is a relevant part of the question from Senator Loosely-that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has not endorsed key elements of it in terms of wage fixation, superannuation and enterprise bargaining; and that is regrettable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can say that the accord has served Australia well. Its basic premise is to maintain living standards and break away from the paper chase after money wages that the unions once engaged in -money wages which were frequently eroded because they pushed up prices and pushed those wage categories into higher tax brackets.</PARA>
<PARA> To replace that old system with a system in which we negotiate living standards by levels of wages, by reductions in taxes and by provisions of service through the social wage as a way of managing wage outcomes, has meant that the economy has, in each Budget since we have been in power, undershot the aggregate wage outcome forecast for that Budget; and it has meant that wages have played a very positive role in bringing down levels of inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, the accord has reduced non-farm unit labour costs since 1983 significantly. It has restored the profit share that applied in the Fraser period from the low in 1982 of 12.4 per cent back to a more reasonable level. It has generated funds for further investment, and employment growth has meant that now 1.4 million extra jobs have been created. Medicare, of course, is also part of the social wage that the accord has brought to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA> I can understand that there is some frustration on the union side because the increase awarded by the Commission yesterday discriminates against those people who are on lower incomes. It is not the $12 flat that was sought. It is a percentage, which means that those people who have borne the weight of the wage restraint in this community but who are at the lower end of the income scale suffer most. In our view, that is not a fair outcome and is certainly not the outcome we sought.</PARA>
<PARA> It also means that there will be greater pressure on the Government to do more on the tax cut front in exchange for wages. We believe that is an unwelcome pressure, given that the Commission should have enabled company level negotiations to proceed in a way in which both partners in the company-the workers and the management-could identify, preferably through a strategic plan for that company, how they could increase productivity and how the benefits of that increased productivity could be fairly shared between the workers who helped generate it and the managers and owners who invested in the operations of that company. I think that is an unfortunate outcome as well.</PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the Australian Council of Trade Unions is calling for talks with the Federal Government. We will be looking forward to those talks. I think it is vital that accord mark 7, when we reach it, guarantees that we can replicate the record that we had in 1984-85-86-87, during which time the economy grew and recovered from the depression of the Fraser years.</PARA>
<PARA> The accord has enabled moderate wage outcomes to be achieved and has channelled more money into profits and thus into investment. I hope that this time in the coming recovery the money that goes into profits is not used for a binge of speculative takeovers with the high fliers of the corporate sector taking over one another and investing in shares, but instead goes into genuine investment and wealth creation and positions Australian industry to grow and expand in a more competitive international environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to the Government's plan to remove the local content component for sales tax purposes on fruit juice products. In view of the desperate plight of Australia's citrus growers, compounded by the announcement on 12 March of an eventual 10 per cent reduction in the tariff on imported juice resulting in no tariff for Brazilian imports, will the Minister agree that it is now imperative that the Government back Mr Kerin's commitment and rescind the sales tax decision due on 1 July?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has been aware of problems in the citrus industry for a long time, and I am sure that Senator Boswell knows that. Basically, these problems are caused by two things: first, the great variability in the world price of frozen concentrated orange juice, much of it being from Brazil; and, secondly, the slow rate at which the industry as a whole has been able to do anything necessary to reduce its dependence on fruit for juicing and improve its performance in the fresh fruit market, both domestically and overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, took a submission on the citrus industry to the Cabinet just before Christmas last year. As a result, the Government agreed to support and speed up the industry's application of an anti-dumping finding. The Government also provided an additional $2m for the promotion of fresh oranges and juice, to be made available through the Australian Horticultural Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> Curiously enough, representatives of the citrus industry are this very week meeting to decide whether they will withdraw from the Australian Horticultural Corporation. If they do they will, of course, not have access to that additional $2m, and for this and other reasons the Government is very hopeful that the industry representatives will agree to stay in the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> Following Cabinet's consideration, Minister Kerin also established a special Commonwealth-State citrus advisory group. This has already met three times, and one of the important elements of its report to the Minister will be a statement of the impact of the withdrawal of local content provision, mentioned by Senator Boswell in his question. In the meantime the Government has agreed to postpone the decision which was due to take effect on 1 July this year. What happens to the local content provision after that will depend in part on the recommendations of the citrus advisory group.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Government is sympathetic to the industry's problems, I should point out to honourable senators that the world prices for both orange juice and fresh fruit have already risen since before Christmas. Once again, some of the immediate pressures for change may have been removed but the Government hopes that the industry will continue to accept the need for change and do what needs to be done to improve our performance in exporting fresh citrus.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it will be recalled that part of the Prime Minister's industry statement was about speeding up the rate of tariff reductions. These further reductions will affect the citrus industry and provide a further stimulus to cooperatively restructure that industry and focus on fresh fruit exports and on promotion.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Government is aware of the concerns about Australians having access to better and cheaper justice, particularly in the Federal Court system. That is why we are taking steps to introduce new legislation to give groups with a common legal cause better and cheaper access to that court. The legislation will not confer any new legal rights but it will certainly allow people to assert existing rights collectively, effectively and more cheaply. If such a measure had been in operation, the present actions by haemophiliacs and others, who have medically contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome, for example, could have proceeded with one action representing the general group of AIDS sufferers. Similarly, those individual investors affected by the recent corporate collapses might well have been able to pursue their claims more cheaply and efficiently as a group using this type of procedure. For example, the reforms could benefit shareholders who had suffered loss as a result of a misleading prospectus or stock market manipulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This will be a reform of great benefit to many individual Australians who, as individuals, do not have great financial resources but who can be adversely affected by the actions of one company or organisation. On the other hand, for the companies and organisations concerned, it could be a more efficient way to deal with legal disputes than the present alternative of facing a succession of individual cases. There is a proper concern in Australia about the cost of justice and I am delighted that the Senate has established a reference to a committee on that particular matter. People who have been denied access to justice in the past because of the high costs involved will now have that barrier removed by acting in concert with numerous fellow claimants. The measures that the Government will introduce into the Senate shortly make an important contribution to the Government's determination to ensure that the courts are not the sole province of the rich, the Government and large corporations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell asked me on 15 April about making public the reports made by the receivers of Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd, former operators of the Ravenshoe sawmill. The receivers' duty under section 324c of the Companies Code, now section 422 of the corporations law, is: if they believe that company officers may have committed an offence, to report and provide information to the Supreme Court and the Australian Securities Commission-not to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, nor her Department. The receivers have informed the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories that a report under section 324c has been made to the Securities Commission but, as it is a confidential document, the receivers have declined to provide a copy or describe the contents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will no doubt be aware that the Securities Commission, while within the portfolio of the Attorney-General, has statutory independence and is obliged to conduct its inquiries with strict confidentiality. Reports made under section 324c of the Companies Code fall within a class of documents to which individuals are not entitled to have access. Mrs Kelly's Department therefore does not have access to the receivers' report. Even if the Department had a copy of such a report, nothing in it could be released publicly without prejudicing possible legal action; not only by the Commonwealth to protect its interests as creditor but also by the regulatory authorities to enforce the companies law.</PARA>
<PARA> Senators Boswell and O'Chee were reported in the media over the last few days as claiming that there are secret reports from the receivers which Mrs Kelly's Department has but will not make public. If they mean statutory reports under the Companies Code, as I have said, the responsible Department learnt of the existence of such a report only in the last week and does not have a copy. But if it did, it would not and could not release it.</PARA>
<PARA> There are no reports from the receivers relating to the operation of Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd in the Department's possession other than two letters from the receivers to the Minister. For the same reasons that I have just given, to publicise them would prejudice the investigations that are under way. I do not think it is appropriate that that should happen. I am sure that all honourable senators will understand that there is nothing more I can or should say about this matter.</PARA>

<PARA>Has the Minister for Industrial Relations initiated a review of the 1988 Commonwealth employees' compensation scheme? If so, what are the terms of reference of the review? Who has been consulted about the operation of the scheme in the past two years and when will the review report?</PARA>
<PARA>In my reply, I indicated that I have initiated a Review of Comcare, the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees, and I promised to provide more information. I now provide the following response:</PARA>
<PARA>I did initiate a review of the Comcare program in December last year. When the Government approved the reform of the Commonwealth Workers' Compensation system in 1987, it decided that so wide-ranging a reform needed to be re-examined after about two years of operation, to see if all its components were working as had been expected. That was the purpose of this review.</PARA>
<PARA>I have the terms of reference of the Review here, and would like to table them.</PARA>
<PARA>A number of client agencies of Comcare, Unions, individual compensation claimants, service providers, special interest groups and others with an interest in the scheme's operation have made written submissions to the Review.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, consultation with people or organisations with an interest in the program was undertaken by way of a stakeholder survey conducted by Pappas, Carter, Evans and Koop, a management consulting firm. This consisted of interviews with selected clients and a wider survey of client attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA>There were meetings with Comcare's employer consultative group (attended by about 50 employer representatives), and with union representatives (unions representing more than 75 per cent of workers covered by Comcare attended this meeting). There was also a seminar for senior government decision makers involved with Comcare. I expect to receive the final report of the Review by the end of next week.</PARA>

This motion also concerns the substance of the questions themselves, which raises the serious point of why the Government is failing to reply to questions that have been on the Notice Paper for such a long time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall accept that interjection. I wonder what has prompted the Government to refuse to reply to that simple direct question for 63 days. There are some clear implications, too, for the advantage that the Government is giving some of those Government members. Another part of Senator Short's question asks:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(4) Has the Minister for Administrative Services made available any computer, fax or photocopy equipment in his electorate or ministerial office for the purposes of price watch activities; if so, please provide details. </PARA>
<PARA>(5) Has any computer, fax or photocopy equipment been made available to MPs for the purpose of the National Prices Network since the March 1990 Federal election; if so, please provide the name of the MP, the date on which the computer, fax or photocopy equipment was provided, and what the equipment comprised. </PARA>
<PARA>These are matters of some substance and expense. What has the Government got to hide in not answering the questions? No doubt Senator Patterson can explain the importance of the questions to which she has not had a reply from the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe). There is a whole range of questions. Senator Short asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) the following question:</PARA>
<PARA>With reference to the Minister's second reading speech of 8 November 1990 . . . in which he stated that without adjustments to the haulage tariff, the Government would withdraw the pipeline system from sale, has the pipeline been withdrawn from sale; if not, what is the current status of the Government's proposal for sale, and does the Government have a timetable for conclusion of the sale. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a matter of major substance. Why have we not had an answer? It seems to me that, in the absence of the Ministers involved who knew, who were aware-at least in one instance-that this matter was to be raised now, in their failure to attend and to explain, the Opposition has every reason to query the Government's bona fides on this matter. Why will the Government not answer these questions? They are direct questions which the Opposition is entitled to ask.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to speak to the same motion. Only a few weeks ago, the President of the Senate asked Ministers to remain until the end of Question Time, particularly when an honourable senator has given notice to one of those Ministers that he intends, under the Standing Orders, under the procedures of the Senate, to ask about a question on notice left unanswered for longer than a month. It is a discourtesy not only to that honourable senator but to the whole chamber that that Minister has not responded. He has not even left a message with the duty Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that Ministers need to be reminded that the Government, the Executive of this country, is responsible to the elected representatives of the people in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. If we do not treat this complaint seriously, we will find that Ministers will fail in their accountability to this Parliament. Mr Deputy President, I would expect that, in light of the motion that may be adopted in a matter of minutes, you will bring to the attention of the Minister, Senator Button, who is the Leader of the Government in the Senate, that he is required to give an answer during Question Time or at the end of Question Time tomorrow. One would hope that he would include in the answer the reason he was distracted from being here on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I further ask that Ministers remain in the Senate after Question Time until the next item of business is brought on. I make this point because on any sitting day any senator has the ability to draw to the attention of a Minister that a question on notice has not been answered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak mainly because I am concerned about the fact that our questions have not been answered. Many of us have tried in a polite, appropriate and courteous way to seek answers from Ministers. In fact, last week I sent a note to Senator Tate telling him that I was going to raise an issue. Senator Short did the same thing today. Senator Tate responded in the Senate on 9 April by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Senator Patterson has sent me a note indicating that she is concerned that she has not received an answer to Question on Notice number 443. </PARA>
<PARA>This question pertains to an area which is of particular interest to me. It is about the holding of personal information by the Health Insurance Commission. As honourable senators know, the Health Insurance Commission now holds all of our Medicare records plus all of our pharmaceutical records. It also holds in some 20 or so other forms private information about individuals. There was little or no concern on the part of the Department of Community Services and Health, until I started questioning it, about whether that information should be depersonalised or not.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a question which is of great concern. I have not been asking some mindless question. I have been asking systematically a series of questions to try to get a very clear understanding of the sort of personal data that is held about individuals which can identify, as the Department has said during Estimates committee hearings, a family's fibro cystic disease or phenyl ketonuria. The community ought to be debating whether information like that should be held and be identified as relating to individuals and families. </PARA>
<PARA> I was told by Senator Tate that the question I had asked was made up of 21 parts. Well, I have asked a 21-part question in respect of every one of the classes of records being held by the Department. So they are not new to the Department. Senator Tate said that he understood from Mr Howe that the answer was in the course of being prepared for the Minister's consideration in the next day or so. That was what the Minister said on 9 April. I have been waiting for over a month for the answer to that question. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a particular reason for wanting the answer. I would have liked to have had it before the Estimates Committee meets tomorrow. I think it would have been appropriate if the Minister had delivered the answer to that question. Ministers should have been in the chamber, particularly when they were given notice that Senator Short was going to ask them questions. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the treatment of these questions appalling.

<PARA> . . . members for Pearce, O'Connor and Tangney and Senators Crichton-Browne and Panizza . . . should be brought before the . . . Royal Commission to find out what their relationship with this long-established industry really has been; including, lately, Alan Bond and, for that matter, Mr Connell. </PARA>
<PARA>I categorically deny that I have ever met or contacted Mr Bond or Mr Connell. My interest in the goldmining industry is purely a matter of representing an industry of major importance which includes medium sized operations as well as prospectors. My views on gold tax have never changed. I was totally opposed to gold tax at the time and still am now, and would do and say the same things if the debate arose again. Time will prove me right. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also the only senator or member from Western Australia who actually lives in the goldfields, except for Mr Campbell, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, so it is understandable that I represent that industry alongside the wheat industry, the wool industry, the transport industry and the fishing industry. I note that Mr Keating did not slam Mr Campbell who has exactly the same views on gold tax as I have. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point on which Mr Keating misrepresented me is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I . . . claim that these decisions by the honourable members for Pearce, O'Connor and Tangney and Senators Crichton-Browne and Panizza to change the policy of the Opposition at the cost of the Opposition Leader and to replace him is one of the most corrupt operations of machine politics in the interests of an industry that we have ever seen in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>I categorically deny that I took any part whatsoever in any moves to replace Mr Howard. In fact, if Mr Keating were to check the Daily News of 9 May 1989, he would see that he is mighty wrong.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Boswell on 15 April 1991, relating to the receivers' reports on the Ravenshoe sawmill. </PARA>
<PARA>In his answer, Senator Richardson told the Senate that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, did not know of the existence of reports made by the receivers of the Ravenshoe sawmill pursuant to section 324c of the Companies Code until last week. What Senator Richardson did not tell the Senate was how Mrs Kelly's attention was drawn to the existence of the reports, and the explanation is very simple. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I asked Senator Richardson a question in relation to these matters. I drew his attention, outside the chamber, to the existence of the reports and he told me that he did not know about them. That is perfectly all right because Senator Richardson is only the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, but that Mrs Kelly did not know about these reports is simply astounding. She is, after all, the Minister who is responsible for the environment-the Minister who is responsible for the Department that has destroyed a township of 2,200 people. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument could be put that there is a distinction between the Australian Securities Commission and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and that may well stand up to scrutiny. But what does not stand up to scrutiny is that the Australian Securities Commission reports to the Attorney-General. Last week, in answer to my question about whether there were prosecutions, Senator Richardson told us that the matter was being reported on by the Attorney-General's Department and that there are ongoing investigations that began six months ago. These include various reports and opinions from senior counsel and other investigations, which I understand include investigations by the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Attorney-General's Department were really doing its job properly, or if it had any regard at all for Mrs Kelly, the so-called Minister for the environment, it is very clear that the existence of those reports would have been raised by the Attorney-General's Department in the course of the discussions with Mrs Kelly. As Senator Patterson said, maybe the Department did raise it but Mrs Kelly was too busy having her photograph taken at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> These are very serious issues. It is of great concern to me that a so-called investigation, which has so far lasted six months, an investigation into the disappearance of $7.6m of taxpayers' money and hundreds of thousands of dollars from ordinary businessmen and women in Ravenshoe, has been so contemptuously treated that the Minister responsible does not know of the reports by the receivers. I believe that this displays the Government's lack of concern for this matter, the Government's lack of concern for taxpayers' money and the Government's lack of concern for the people of Ravenshoe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating a matter of public importance submitted by me on behalf of the Liberal and the National parties in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need to ensure that all Australians continue to enjoy the right to freedom of expression that they currently enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter is not just of importance to the Australians of today, but of the greatest and most vital importance for Australians into the future-our children and our grandchildren-whose rights we must protect. When I last spoke on this matter I commenced the debate by saying that I never expected that one day I would be standing in the Senate in the Parliament of Australia pleading for freedom of speech. What prompted that and what prompted this matter of public importance today was the announcement by the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, that he had reached agreement with the Australian Democrats that he would introduce legislation which would ban all political advertising at all times on radio and television. Furthermore, it would apply at all levels of government-Federal, State and local. </PARA>
<PARA> The public's impression was that the ban was to apply only at election times, but the idea was to apply it across the board, 365 days of the year-a total ban, a blackout on radio and television. This outrageous assault on freedom of speech was attacked by every media group in Australia and a whole lot of other interest groups as well. </PARA>
<PARA> At the last count, I noted that there were 36 groups and individuals-and what a divergence of groups there was-from the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Burdekin; the Law Council of Australia; the Article 19 Group; Don Chipp; Janine Haines; Peter Garrett; and so on. One of the things I noted was the groups or individuals who supported the Minister. Who were they? Surprise, surprise: Bob Hogg; Martin Ferguson, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions; and Phillip Adams, that Australian Labor Party hack and former ALP advertising executive-a captive audience. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my colleagues-you, Mr Acting Deputy President-received a letter from one of the radio station leaders; in fact, the President of the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters. In his letter he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I'd also like to share with you some thoughts I conveyed in a recent interview with an ABC journalist. I said amongst other things . . . who do they think they're dealing with-a peasantry-do they seriously think they can keep the Australian people in an information background-what are they trying to do? Stage an Atlantic style election?</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I know that even the newspapers are worried. They see this subterfuge, this hypocrisy, this unmitigated evil, as being the thin end of the wedge. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister attempted to hold this ban together by linking this blatant censorship with public disclosure. In the debate on the urgency motion in the Senate last week we argued that the ban was a stand-alone issue-one either agreed with the ban on freedom of speech or one did not. It was a black and white issue. We argued that disclosure of political donations and truth in advertising were important matters-Senator Powell will remember that-which should be debated, but not as some sort of sleazy backroom trade-off to limit freedom of speech. That is what this Minister attempted to do. The Opposition is pleased to note that the Democrats last weekend came to the same conclusion as the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also argued that it was doing us all a favour and that the reason for the ban was to save money for political parties in election campaigns. Mr Acting Deputy President, can you imagine this Minister-this Government-being big-hearted and thinking about the Opposition, the Liberal and National parties, on a matter such as this? By his own actions the Minister showed this to be a lie because, in what could only be termed the height of hypocrisy, the Government proposed that government funding-taxpayer funding-to political parties would be increased by some $5m. How did he intend to do that? He intended to double the payment that is normally given to political parties from the Senate vote from 45.6c per vote to 91.2c per vote. The fact that the Minister and the Government thought anyone would swallow that just shows the extent of disarray and panic in which this Government finds itself and how hopelessly out of touch it is with the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the Government was saying that it was free to advertise itself through its departments by direct mail, magazines, radio and television but that dissent through advertisements on radio and television would be illegal. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will repeat what I said: under the Minister's proposal, political dissent through advertisements on radio and television would be illegal. That is what he said. No individual, group, special interest group or political party would be allowed to express a different point of view on radio and television by way of advertisements. What is so pernicious about this scheme is that the Government envisages that its own taxpayer-funded political party advertisements will be unaffected by the ban. Apparently, outside election campaigns there will be no restrictions on the Government's monopoly of the airwaves. So much for level playing fields!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Taxpayers are already footing the bill for the Hawke Government's propaganda machine, and already more than $232m has been spent promoting the incumbent administration. Probably with the ban in mind, earlier this year the Federal Government established a special ministerial committee called the Government Advertising Service, GAS, which is no doubt gearing up for massive information campaigns once all voices have been gagged. </PARA>
<PARA> From these signs, it is clear that the ban will not affect the amount of political advertising on television and radio-just the type. Whereas now there are advertisements produced and funded by political parties and other interest groups, in the future they will only be the propaganda of governments paid for by the long-suffering taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Minister's scheme, for all but one month of the three-year term of government, governments could spend our money on television and radio block- buster campaigns telling us what a great job they were doing. No other views or options could be presented in this way, and the only time the Government's advertising would be partly restricted was during the actual period of the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> During the election campaign proper, the Minister says that the Government will still be able to continue with government advertising necessary to cope with national emergencies, advertising by electoral authorities and commercial advertising by government business enterprises. Given this Government's track record, what is to stop it from abusing these provisions in the same way it misused taxpayers' money for self-promotion and partisan campaigning?</PARA>
<PARA> A couple of instances come to mind. For example, what if government business enterprises in question are those intended for privatisation by a coalition government and the Government's commercial advertising consists of subtle or not so subtle messages implying that they should remain in state ownership. There are also precedents where this Government has sought unfair advantage from electoral information. I instance the 1988 referendum campaign. It took a High Court judgment to stop the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Government from broadcasting misleading and biased advertisements. Who can trust this lot?</PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the Minister's press release, specifically confirming that charities would not be exempt from the ban. Therefore, it is obvious that there will be unprecedented and draconian results from the Government's proposal. However, these cannot be excused as unintended consequences because the Government has been told exactly where the ban will lead. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the all-party Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommended against a complete ban on political advertising because it `would have a direct effect on freedom of speech by reducing opportunities for discussion during election periods when voters are determining the candidate or party they wish to support'. The Committee reported:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . most witnesses disagreed with a complete ban on political advertising, claiming that it would have an adverse effect on freedom of speech and in particular would disadvantage citizens and groups who wish to bring issues before the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>In his usual dishonest way, the Minister continues to refer to the Joint Standing Committee report, claiming that it supports the Government's draconian policy; and yet every member of the Committee-Labor, Liberal, Democrat and Independent-recommended against a complete ban, including Senator Schacht. Last week in the urgency motion in this place, he said, `Yes, I signed the report, but do you know why? I was interested in consensus politics'. How about that! Consensus politics. What a dishonest statement to make. That is what consensus is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Committee was received by the Government in 1989, and at that time the Government displayed no sense of urgency about dealing with the matter. Now suddenly it argues that it wants the ban introduced urgently because of corruption. Eight years since it came to power, in the aftermath of the Federal election where the ALP spent considerably more than its opponents on television advertising, we are told that it is imperative that there be a complete ban on the broadcasting of political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is on notice that its proposal would further enhance the ability of incumbent governments to exploit the spoils of office and cling to power-that is what it is all about-prevent individuals and interest groups from taking their message directly to the people; prevent charities from appealing for funds if they are deemed to be political; deny Australians in rural and provincial areas, where people rely on radio and television rather than newspapers, the opportunity to hear alternative points of view; and limit the freedom of some 110,000 blind or sight impaired Australians and one million plus classified as illiterate to receive political information in the most direct and meaningful way. </PARA>
<PARA>Further the Minister has noted:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . journalists will be more powerful shapers of public opinion after the ban on political advertising comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the ban would allow reporters more power to get political assessments across. </PARA>
<PARA>This reflects the fact that the ban will deprive all Australians who are dissatisfied with the coverage they receive in the media, or who think it biased, the right to present their views to the public direct and uncensored. If the only way to put political arguments to the public is through the newspapers and through the news and current affairs programs of the broadcast media, enormous power is placed in the hands of those who control such programs. As with every other change to the political process introduced by this Government, it is necessary to look at its hidden agenda. As the Daily Mirror stated on 5 April last year:</PARA>
<PARA>This plan to limit the appearance of the politicians on our television screens is not really an attempt to magnanimity on the part of the government. It is a part of a desperate effort to save the party machine from going bankrupt. Labor's money problems . . . are partly the result of its poor performance with primary votes in the last election . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Civil Liberties Union contends that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the argument that such a ban is necessary to combat corruption is spurious, in view of the absence of evidence of corruption at the federal level . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It said that the proposed ban, aimed at helping the ALP overcome its election funding problems, would not be necessary if there was an increase in membership and if it avoided wasting money on election campaign gimmicks, as it has in the past. It is the height of hypocrisy for the Labor Party to say that the ever increasing costs of campaigning justifies this restriction on our freedom because, in the same breath, it proposes to add a further $5m to the taxpayers' subsidy given to political parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reason given was the potential for corruption and was thus linked to public disclosure. Until now-and I emphasise until now-federal politics has had an enviable reputation of being free of any corruption. It is fascinating that the image has been dirtied by the Labor Party. Day after day we see in the other place Mr Hawke, the Prime Minister of our country suffering from selective amnesia. He did not remember whether he mentioned gold tax over a luncheon with Laurie Connell and others who had a vested interest in gold. But after the luncheon, $950,000 was donated to the Labor Party by Laurie Connell and others. Anyone who believes that the Prime Minister did not give a watertight guarantee at that meeting in order to get this enormous donation would, to use a favourite expression of Senator Peter Walsh, still believe in fairies at the bottom of the garden. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me address disclosure. The Liberal and National parties took the view that we would support disclosure provided it was equitable. No-one can ask for more than that. What that means is that we want to be assured that any person or corporation who made a donation was not singled out for intimidation by a government of another political persuasion or a third party. Is Senator Bolkus objecting to that?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there must be a level playing field, let us have one. There is not one at present. The major benefactor is the Australian Labor Party because of its trade union connections. Trade union membership dues are tax deductible. Affiliation fees of those unions with the Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions come from tax deductible moneys. Whether they like it or not-and many do not, but have no say in it-membership fees of individual trade unions are used to affiliate with the ALP. There is no say on the part of the individual union member. All income from investments by trade unions is free of income tax and capital gains tax. Donations from unions to the Labor Party are therefore paid from tax-free moneys. On the other hand, all donations to the Liberal and National parties and the Australian Democrats by individuals or companies are after-tax moneys. This is not a level playing field. If the Labor Party is serious about disclosure with equity, then those serious inequities must be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Trade unions today are big business. I was fascinated to read recently the Cooke report in Queensland on the Federated Clerks Union of Australia. The union decided to reaffiliate with the ALP in Queensland at a cost of $30,000 a year. It had a meeting with none other than the Premier of Queensland, Mr Wayne Goss, and the ALP President, Mr Ian McLean. It sounds somewhat like a Connell luncheon, does it not? The reason that the leaders of the clerks union gave for paying $30,000 was:</PARA>
<PARA>The obvious benefits for the union are an opportunity to influence government policy and decision making; ensuring that clerks through their union have a say in the various forums and improved access to Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came in here this afternoon hoping-hoping in vain, I suppose-that we might get some positive contribution to what is very much a serious problem. I have listened very closely to Senator Parer. He made six points in his contribution and each was based on an untruth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make the point at the start that our link from the Australian Labor Party (ALP) side with the trade union movement is historical; it has gone on for a century and it is one we are proud of and stand up for. Our involvement with our organisation is such that we produce people of the quality of Senator Faulkner, Senator Beahan, Senator Schacht and others. They make an important contribution and we are proud of that. We will not have their names being smeared by Senator Parer in the way that he has. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer's speech was littered with untruths. We made it very clear from the start that government advertising would be handled in the same way as other advertising. The Government's ministerial committee was set up. It was not a new committee; it was the continuation of an old one, and he knows that.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of community groups and their appeals for funds-it has been made very clear that such matters as appeals for funds are not to be seen as political matters. Senator Parer went on to say that federal politics have been sullied by the Labor Party in recent days. It was Mr Eggleton a month ago who made it very clear in a stark comment to Michelle Grattan of the Melbourne Age as to the interrelationship between his side of politics and the corporate dollar. I quote Mr Eggleton:</PARA>
<PARA>If a company asks me for access (to Fraser), I would not intimate how big a donor they were but I might say that a friend of the party wanted to see him. It might get them in the door marginally more quickly. Malcolm never asked how much they donated. </PARA>
<PARA>It is precisely the sort of thing that Senator Parer now mentions, but it has been going on on his side of politics longer than I have been alive. But we do not expect anything better from the Opposition. We do not expect in this debate anything better because we can see the record of those opposite. We can see their history. We can see how they have performed on human rights issues and on disclosure issues. </PARA>
<PARA> We know, for instance, that when Senator Parer was involved with Utah Mines he was very keen to ensure its contribution to the conservative side of politics at a time when it was ripping off the Australian taxpayer by shifting profits offshore by the bucketload. He was very keen to ensure that that was not disclosed to the public. He was also very keen to ensure that no money came to the Labor side of politics, and he was overridden in that respect. We can see why those opposite do not want to see these sorts of things disclosed. We can also see their history on human rights. It was only a few years ago when people such as the National Party leader in this place, Senator Boswell, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chipp said that it would take the National Party to approve of the bill of rights. The National Party would not approve of it in one million years. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the attitude of the National Party to human rights. But it is not just the National Party. Senator Durack, who as a former Attorney-General might be thought to have some sort of understanding, sensitivity and respect for human rights, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We will not join in an international covenant to bring human rights to everybody.</PARA>
<PARA>Opposition senators would not join in such a covenant to introduce human rights for anybody. That is their position on human rights. That statement was topped off by Senator Harradine, who is not here. I must quote for the record Senator Harradine's contribution:</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed human rights Bill will not create one additional job. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how that fitted into the debate but it is on the record. What are Opposition senators doing about human rights? They raise a point that I made about the role of the media. In making that point all they are asserting is that they do not trust the media in the press gallery or throughout the country to report the news and current affairs in a fair and honest way. If that is not an attack on the freedom of the press, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA> They come in here as born again democrats-not Australian Democrats-but their record on human rights issues stands very clearly and starkly for the Australian public to see. They vehemently opposed our Government's attempts to entrench the international covenant on human rights in law through a Bill of rights. They filibustered in this Senate, they gasbagged and they stopped it. Of course, who from the start opposed the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission? Who wants to abolish it now? It is they who are now calling on the Commission to act as an umpire. Those on the other side reek of hypocrisy. They have shown time and time again that when it suits the Opposition they howl about human rights but when it comes to the crunch they do absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a coalition that opposed, for example, constitutional reform-constitutional amendments to enshrine things as basic as the right to vote; the right to one vote one value; the right to freedom of religion; the right to trial by jury; the right to a fair compensation and acquisition of property. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitutional Commission, which included a former State Premier and leader of the Liberal Party, Sir Rupert Hamer, campaigned for these rights to be enshrined in the Constitution. But what did those opposite do? They opposed it for short term political gain. They have a short memory when it comes to human rights and it is one that they are trying to invoke now. While Senator Parer was speaking I could not help thinking of John Stuart Mill, a great liberal. He made the following point, which is quite pertinent when one listens to debates in the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>Conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives. </PARA>
<PARA>In terms of the contribution we are getting on this issue from the conservative side of politics, John Stuart Mill was right. We are talking about a notice of motion which addresses freedom of speech. The most fundamental aim of the Government's proposal is not only to protect freedom of speech but also to enhance it. That is why we on this side of the Parliament have no trouble in supporting the expression that the Senate has been asked to treat as a matter of urgency today. </PARA>
<PARA> The most fundamental principle, the most fundamental premise in our democracy, which I can understand Opposition senators may not understand because they have not recognised it, is one person one vote, one vote one value. Our proposals enhance and protect this right. Anatole France, for instance, said in the late nineteenth century:</PARA>
<PARA>The law, in its majestic equality, permits the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread. </PARA>
<PARA>Judge Skelly Wright, of the United States appellate court, commented in recent years:</PARA>
<PARA>A latter day Anatole France might well write after observing American election campaigns, `The law in its majestic equality, allows the poor as well as the rich to form political action committees, to purchase the most sophisticated polling, media and direct mail techniques, and to drown out each other's voices by overwhelming expenditures in political campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA>The same judge concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA>Financial inequities pose a pervasive and growing threat to the principle of one person, one vote, and undermine the political proposition to which this nation is dedicated-that we are all created equal. </PARA>
<PARA>We have recognised that as the most basic premise of our constitutional system. In addressing the issues that face this country at the moment, we have acted to improve the access to freedom of speech and to enhance the democratic process in the meantime. We cannot look at a concept without seeing how it is applied, and in its application there is one thing that can be said about advertising: it is an inherently undemocratic medium. It is not free speech but - -</PARA>

<PARA> We are talking about an inherently undemocratic medium. It is not free speech; it is expensively bought speech. With advertising costing as much as $13,000 a minute it is out of the reach of the great majority of people and organisations in this community. A person's vote, a person's participation in our democratic system, should not depend upon the size of his or her bank account. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not radicals from the Left of politics who have made these points. But there is a very basic point that needs to be addressed in this debate and it is about who sets the agenda. Senator Barry Goldwater, who is no conservative, made this point in the United States Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not . . . the people . . . but moneyed interests who are setting the nation's political agenda and who are influencing the position of candidates on the important issues of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>Our proposal is aimed at ensuring not only a level playing field between organisations and people in our community but also that we rid our system of a great potential for corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people say that disclosure is sufficient. However, we start from the point that what we need is a clean and democratic process. We need less reliance on funds. The cost of campaigning in this country has exploded over the last three election campaigns; it has increased three times over that time. Disclosure is not enough because we have to address the whole question of how costs are contained. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not the only one who says that disclosure is not enough. Recently Mr John Howard made it very clear in his column in, I think, the Sunday Telegraph when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The United States has had elaborate disclosure laws for years. These did not stop a former Vice President, Spiro Agnew, receiving corrupt payments while occupying the second highest political position in his country. There is a time honoured maxim that, where there is no instinct for honour, it cannot be legislated. </PARA>
<PARA>The basic point is that disclosure is not enough. This Parliament has a responsibility to ensure that the costs of campaigning are reduced to such an extent that we can reduce that undue influence on the whole political process. I can understand Opposition senators being disinterested. However, we are concerned about a situation such as the one that occurred in Western Australia a number of years ago when the mining industry ran millions of dollars worth of campaigning in a very racist, unfair campaign against Aboriginal land rights. It was effective. It was a negative campaign, but that starkly showed the Australian community the inequity of advertising as a medium. The mining industry set the agenda. It excluded from the agenda legitimate consideration of Aboriginal land rights and, in doing so, used the power of its resources to stifle and censor free speech. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is not only the mining industry that uses those tactics. When one looks at the last election campaign one sees more examples of it. Let us look at the last election campaign. Let us look at the assertion by the Opposition that we are stifling free speech. In the 1990 election campaign $1.75m was spent by third party groups. All three political groups spent only $1.75m. That covers the corporate sector, the loggers, St Vincent de Paul and the greenies. Of that money, only $63,000 was spent by community based organisations; the rest was spent by the corporate sector. Looking at the specific issue of logging of native forests and logging generally, the loggers spent $1.15m and the greenies, the Australian Conservation Foundation, spent something like $28,000. That is stark evidence of how advertising is an undemocratic medium. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two good reasons to tackle the issue in the way that we have done: firstly, to reduce the costs of advertising and, secondly, to provide a more democratic structure through which organisations in this country can work. Let me quote, for instance, what the National President of the Society of St Vincent de Paul said in a letter he wrote to me recently:</PARA>
<PARA>1. The Society has no position, for or against, the Cabinet decision to ban political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA>2. We are a non-political organisation and we do not run advertising supporting or opposing any political party. Therefore, any ads we do run-for appeals and the like-will not be affected by Cabinet decision.</PARA>
<PARA>Phillip Toyne said:</PARA>
<PARA>On political balance, we see the ban as levelling up the playing field. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what we are on about. At the moment we have a situation which, firstly, leads to undue influence and potential corruption and, secondly, is inherently undemocratic. The best way is to tackle it head on; one cannot tackle it with one arm of the response. Even if we were to accept the proposition of the other side that what we are doing here is breaching article 19 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Opposition ignores article 19 (3). Article 19 (3) expresses very clearly and starkly an exemption for the protection of public order. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is a more serious threat to our society posed by the increasing cost of political campaigns and the consequent reliance of political parties on corporate dollars, I do not know what it is. It is not just me who holds this view. Commissioner Roden in the Independent Commission Against Corruption report on north coast development in New South Wales also recognised this threat to public order. </PARA>

We are talking about political advertising; we are not talking about free speech. People will still be able to be reported.

It is just that one will not have to have a full bank account to get one's voice heard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are talking about getting rid of political advertising; we are not jeopardising free speech. Let us look at the product that we are talking about. Phillip Adams said this recently about political advertising:</PARA>
<PARA> The most effective election ads don't pretend to make a positive contribution to the debate. Nor are they used to put forward policies. At the best they'll attempt to reduce a complex slogan to an idiot-simple slogan, or try to seduce the voter with some surging excuse for an anthem. But their real job is to hit and run.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that political advertisements are:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . about as worth defending as graffiti slogans sprayed on the walls of public buildings, or the obscenities scrawled in loos.</PARA>
<PARA>But it is not just Phillip Adams. The Opposition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters had this to say about the value of political advertising:</PARA>
<PARA>We reject as absurd the assertion that political advertising is a social good.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from the mouths of Opposition members. They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We have seen no convincing evidence of any co-relation between election results and either the quality or quantity of political advertising on electronic media. </PARA>
<PARA>In another comment, they say:</PARA>
<PARA>It seems likely that it is the news and current affairs programs, and not the party advertisements, that provide the information which makes television a significant influence on individual political choices. </PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about an inherently unfair medium-a medium that is used depending on the size of one's bank account; a medium that sets the agenda in the interests of not the majority of the Australian people but in the vested interest minority; and a medium that, to date, has been kept secret in the way that it has operated. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been asked to look at other aspects of this issue. For the months I have looked at this issue, I have looked very closely at alternatives. I have looked at the alternative of caps, of free time and of more limited bans. But to me, and I am sure to honourable senators if they fairly approach this issue, the fairest way to go is the one that we have proposed. If one is looking at caps, free time periods or whatever, one still has to grapple with the issue of what happens with third party organisations and with front organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party would not be concerned about that because at the last New South Wales election it spent $20 or $30 to set up a company in New South Wales, set up a front organisation called Community Polling, and ran a parallel campaign to the State campaign through that organisation. The organisation raised money, it conducted polling-it did all sorts of things. It was so easy to set up that front organisation. Such issues as caps and free time leave the way open for massive loopholes-loopholes that the Opposition has exploited and which have been exploited to the state of the art in the United States where political action committees basically run the campaigns. Community Polling was run out of Mr Metherell's office in New South Wales because Mr Greiner had no confidence in the then Liberal Party secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, we are talking about the immense problem of the interrelationship between the corporate dollar and campaigning. The Government has responded to it in the fairest and most democratic way. In our response, we have recognised that the medium of advertising is inherently undemocratic. It is a late twentieth century version of the property franchise-something that the Opposition would not know about. It is nothing more or less than a property franchise before one participates in our political process. We are sure that the Government's proposal stands the scrutiny of international covenants. We have no trouble supporting this afternoon's matter of public importance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition asks us to debate today as a matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need to ensure that all Australians continue to enjoy the right to freedom of expression that they currently enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a pleasure to rise to speak in a debate brought on by the Opposition about the rights and freedoms of Australians. I do hope that this is the beginning of a changed trend from that side of politics. I remind the Opposition that the need for a Bill of Rights for all Australians to protect all our freedoms, including our freedom of expression, has been a matter of high priority policy and parliamentary action for the Australian Democrats ever since we have been in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, Senator Haines, the former leader of the Party, introduced a private member's Bill in this place in 1982. Subsequent to that, the Australian Democrats supported the thrust of, and attempted to strengthen, the Bill of Rights which was introduced by the Hawke Government later in the mid-1980s. I could go through in some detail the private member's Bill of former Senator Haines and our attempts to improve the legislation brought forward finally by the Hawke Government. But in this debate it is important to note not only the lack of support from the Opposition, then in government, for former Senator Haines's legislation but also the mass hysteria generated from the Opposition side of politics towards the Hawke Government's Bill when it was finally introduced. The Government finally went to water and pulled that Bill off, even though it always had the numbers in this place, and of course in the House of Representatives, to enact such a Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I nail right here and now the myth that the reason we do not have a Bill of Rights in this place was obstruction in the Senate; it was not. The numbers were always here. We have throughout our existence as a political party had a strong commitment to the rights and freedoms of all Australians and to legislation to underpin those rights and freedoms. It is worth reiterating that when such legislation was before us a hysterical public campaign was generated and supported by the Opposition in this place. The Bill was called treasonable and it was described as a communist or socialist plot. It was suggested that existing rights would be extinguished by the Government's legislation and totally inaccurate information was given out about the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on which the Bill was based, on which the Democrats' own Bill was based, and on which I presume the motion before us today is also based. </PARA>
<PARA> We do need to make it clear that certainly the Democrats support that covenant in all its aspects. I remind the Senate that article 19 (2) of the international covenant provides for the right to freedom of expression, which is the subject of our debate today. This right is expressed in subsection (3), however, as being subject to certain restrictions provided by law and is necessary, as Senator Bolkus has already pointed out, for the protection of public order. No freedom of expression, as it exists under that covenant, is totally without some restrictions, which are there to provide for the protection of public order. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of those restrictions do spring to mind. For example, the defamation laws and other restrictions which currently exist on advertising specifically go to the Opposition's motion today. Indeed, I stand here as a person who has successfully restricted advertising in this country. I am proud to say that, by way of a private member's Bill, I have stopped the advertising in the print medium of tobacco products and other enormously harmful products. It is advertising which, through the promotion of those products, has created damage and death in our community. That legislation followed only a decade after restrictions in electronic advertising of that substance. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not advertise other commodities such as pharmaceutical products in the general public arena for obvious reasons. Since they are not products to be promoted to the general public, the freedom of expression of the producers of those products is limited in the public interest, for the public good or to maintain public order. These sorts of restrictions are common. </PARA>
<PARA> I make those points because it is important to get the debate about the Government's package of reforms to the electoral process in context. I stand in agreement with the Opposition on one aspect of its position, which is that the blanket ban on everybody all the time on paid political advertising is too draconian, even in the context that I have set down. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is important also to make it clear that the Democrats welcome the Government's package. As I say, it is a package designed to improve the conduct of elections in this country and, indeed, the general political debate. We were delighted with that aspect of the Government's proposal which calls for complete disclosure of all political funding of political parties and other players in the political arena. That has also been a matter of policy for the Australian Democrats ever since our inception. We have pushed for it and promoted it in this place for 14 years. </PARA>
<PARA> We were pleased that the Hawke Government went so far as to have disclosure for election campaigns. It recognises, as we made clear at the time, that partial disclosure left massive loopholes which no doubt were used to circumvent that disclosure, since the disclosure of other funding for reasons other than campaigning was not required. All the evidence is there to prove that that was the case. So we totally support that aspect of the Government's package, although we do make it clear that the form of the disclosure is important. We believe that it must be virtually instantaneous disclosure so that there cannot be any shonky deals about funds being passed across and time passing between the passage of funding and an election or the fulfilling of some commitment that might be attached to it. It must be transparent and the public must know of funding that is passing into the political system on an ongoing basis. That part of the legislation is very welcome and will be supported by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> We also welcome what appears to be at least movement on the side of the Opposition, through its leader, Dr Hewson, and in defiance, it seems, of the party organisation on the Opposition side of politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always subject to the legislation; there is no doubt about that. As I say, it is good to see movement on the question of disclosure in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, the detail of a blanket ban on everyone all the time, as put forward by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) and again pending legislation, did seem to us to be too draconian. But from it we take the understanding that the Government is interested in regulating the advertising that takes place in the political arena. We agree with it on that principle. While we will not support a blanket ban, we are very interested in further regulation of political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> The case for truth in advertising is a matter of public record and action in this place. We have been active in this place in all the matters that I am raising, usually without any support from either side or with only partial support. The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 amounts to a licence to lie, and it is used. It is a licence that is exercised on a regular basis such that it is futile even to imagine bringing any kind of action in the current political context against an absolute untruth that is perpetrated about one's views or one's Party's views. </PARA>
<PARA> As recently as 31 May last year Senator Macklin once again moved in this place to bring the Electoral Act into line with the sorts of provisions that are in the Trade Practices Act 1974 and which apply over all other forms of advertising. The Opposition might want to argue that there are restrictions on freedom of speech. Nevertheless, no advertising is free and clear of restrictions except political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats want to see as part of the package, when it eventually gets through this place in whatever form, those amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act which were most recently put before the Senate in May last year by Senator Macklin. All we are asking is that basic matters put forward as matters of fact as part of a political advertisement are indeed provable as fact. That is not a lot to ask. We know that a government cannot legislate against politicians making promises and that politicians cannot be locked up if their promises do not come true. Some people might say more is the pity, but we are not attempting to do that. All we are attempting to do is introduce into the Electoral Act the most basic aspects of truth on matters of absolute fact. To us, that is the sort of regulation that is absolutely vital in the political process. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also have some system where fairness can be addressed, particularly in the broadcasting area. A fairness-in-broadcasting code, administered through what would have to be a better resourced Australian Broadcasting Tribunal than we now have, would go a long way towards improving election campaigns and the level of information that is given to voters. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of advertisements that do appear, other steps need to be taken. There are other ways to meet the concern, again which we share with the Government, of the costs of election campaigning. In our view, there ought to be some time limits on advertisements. We are concerned that, in particular, television advertisements have become not a matter of information for the electors in the process of election campaigns. A lot of the advertisements have not even involved speech making; they have been more about image making. We have had depictions of octopuses and bulls in china shops, et cetera. There is not a lot to do with speech or information; it is all about the image building or, more particularly, image breaking of one's political opponents. I understand that the former Prime Minister of Great Britain refused to take minimum time-limited free time on the British Broadcasting Corporation because of the requirement that the candidate or the party representative simply stand before the camera and speak to the audience for a minimum period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our view that that is the sort of process that would create much more effective, much more efficient, fairer and, therefore, better election campaigning in this country. It is in that area of regulation of political advertising that we will want, firstly, to look at what the Government brings forward and, secondly, to bring forward our own proposition and our own amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> As someone else has already said in this debate, this whole question has been a matter of public debate for a considerable time. I welcome the opportunity to urge the Opposition in the future to pay much more attention to the rights and freedoms of Australian people and I look forward to the time when it will begin to support Democrat initiatives in this area. I also welcome the Government's package for the opportunity it provides for this country finally to lift the veil on the things that we have seen in the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters, the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry and the brown paper bags in Queensland. I look forward to all of us working together here in this Senate coming forward with a package which will provide fair, truthful, effective and efficient election campaigns that are democratic and do provide, add to and enhance the democratic process in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the need to ensure that Australians retain the right to freedom of expression that they currently enjoy. Senator Bolkus says that freedom of expression can simply be reduced to the notion of free speech. He used that to oversimplify the argument and to say that he is not trying to ban free speech; he is trying to ban bought speech. I say to that that if free speech, that is, the right to freedom of expression, means nothing more than speech for which we have not paid to have it distributed, for several decades the United Nations, academics, politicians interested in promoting civil and political rights, including those in the Party of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), the Australian Democrats and also people on my side, have been wasting their time. They have been wasting lots of time. They have wasted countless hours of negotiating on this issue, writing about it, talking about it and resolving what the issues really are. That has been a complete waste of time because we could have gone off to Senator Bolkus and said, `What does free speech mean?'. He would have said, `It is anything that is not bought'. We all know that that is not what free speech means. The Minister has oversimplified this argument to a degree that I would think must be an embarrassment to his Party which, until this stage, has a very honourable record in terms of promoting civil and political rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Minister's simplification did not display such a monumental misunderstanding by a Government Minister of what is meant by the right to freedom of speech, it would be laughable. In fact, I have no doubt that primary school children and secondary school children, as part of their social studies debates, are now being asked, `What does free speech mean? Should we be able to ban political advertising? What do you mean by free speech?'. I have no doubt that primary school children are laughing at the Minister's concept of free speech being anything which is not bought. It is a laughable notion. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at our legal rights for example. We need an enormous number of dollars to exercise them. People may have a right of action in a court but they need an enormous amount of money to access that right. Is the Minister now going to say that we should ban the use of courts and lawyers because only the wealthy can afford them and because the wealthy will get a fairer slice of legal rights? Of course he will not say that. We are concerned about the cost of justice. One of the Senate committees has an inquiry with a reference into the cost of justice. But no-one is having the temerity or the stupidity to come into this place and to say that, because it is expensive to access legal rights, we will ban that access and everyone will have the same access, that is, none. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what Senator Bolkus is saying about our rights to gather some money together and put our views across. He is saying that because to use the electronic media is expensive-and he does not refer how efficient it is - -</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says that because advertising is expensive and, therefore, some people cannot afford it, political advertising will be banned for everybody. It is a laughable notion. It is a disgraceful notion for a Minister of the Crown to be putting forward. Under article 19, freedom of expression, or the guts of it anyway, has been defined as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression;-</PARA>
<PARA>and it goes on to enunciate for us-</PARA>
<PARA>this right shall include the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not complaining that this ban will simply take away my right to place an advertisement; I am complaining because it takes away the right of all people sitting in the gallery, all people in the country, to read that advertisement, to listen to it, to see what I have to say and to decide whether they want to vote for me on that basis. It is not just a question of the right to place an advertisement; it is the right to hear the views that people want to express. That right is also being taken away. </PARA>
<PARA> Scholars have spent an enormous amount of time on the question of why we need to protect the right to freedom of expression. What is so special about it? Why are we getting excited about it? There are four simple reasons that have been settled on; not by me but by people, such as Professor Emerson who, in an article in the California Law Review in 1980, listed four reasons why we want to protect freedom of expression. </PARA>
<PARA> First, individuals get some self-fulfilment from being able to express themselves, being able to say what they think. Secondly, freedom of expression will advance knowledge and discovery of truth. The argument is that if I say that the sky is black today, Senator Macdonald goes outside and says that it is not, it is grey, and someone else goes outside and says that it is blue, a couple of us will be lying and/or mistaken; but someone will be telling the truth. Those who are listening will be able to say, `That person is the one telling the truth; I agree with that person'. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is with political advertising. People will put forward a particular view. Some of it will be, for want of a better expression, embroidered, for example, the Democrat advertisement which says, `We will keep the b's honest.' If ever there was a mistruth in advertising, it is that one. Nonetheless, some of us will judge some advertisements to be untruthful. We will judge that some are a waste of money and say, `What idiot put that ad in? Who would do an ad like that?'. However, that advertisement tells me something about that person. It tells me that that person's priorities are different from mine and that, therefore, I probably do not want to vote for that individual. We are not just talking about my right to place an advertisement-a sensible one or a stupid one-but about the right of all Australians in here, around the country, to make an assessment on the basis of those advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, freedom of expression ensures a proper balance between stability and change. A constant push for change brings about change. If people cannot really express themselves, change is stifled and limited. Fourthly, what has been agreed on as the most essential element of the need to protect freedom of expression is that it is essential to effective decision making by society. That is what this is all about. That is the guts of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister could turn his mind to some American cases on the first amendment, loosely referred to as that which guarantees freedom of speech in the United States. In the judgment in the Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy case, the Minister would see these words:</PARA>
<PARA>It can hardly be debated that the constitutional guarantee-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, freedom of speech-</PARA>
<PARA>has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no good this Minister coming in here and saying, `I am not banning freedom of speech, I am just banning political advertising'. That is the very advertising, the very passing on of speech and ideas that the freedom is expression is designed to protect. That is the very guts of it. That is what the Minister wants to get at. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister does not like the case of Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, because he does not think it is relevant, he can turn to Mills v. Alabama. America has a very rich history of litigating this matter of freedom of expression, much richer than ours. The Minister will see that the judgment in Mills v. Alabama states:</PARA>
<PARA>There is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of the Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs . . . including discussions of candidates. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask: when else would we want to do that but at election time? What do we mean by freedom of expression? It is all very well for people on the other side and the Democrats to wear the badge `freedom of expression' and march around the country saying, `Vote for us, we are for it'. But they have not given much thought-and if they have, it has not been displayed in this debate-about what we really mean by that. It is just a convenient badge to wear around in order to try to suck up a few votes. But they should give a bit more attention to what they actually mean by it. One of the noted academics in this area, Mr Alexander Bickel, says:</PARA>
<PARA> The social interest that the First Amendment vindicates is the successful operation of the political process, so that the country may be better able to adopt the course of action that conforms to the wishes of the greatest number.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is quite clear that the United States will not tolerate an intervention in freedom of speech that limits the exchange of views in relation to political matters. This will not be tolerated because it is the very reason that freedom of expression is meant to be protected. It is there to ensure the unfettered interchange of ideas for bringing about social change. Those words can be found in the case of Roth v. US. The case of New York Times v. Sullivan shows how freedom of expression allegedly demonstrates a `profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be wide open'. There is no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do I say that this blanket ban will necessarily cut down freedom of expression? This is shown in an even newer case, Buckley and Valeo, in which the Government tried to do what Senator Bolkus is trying to do. It missed out. It breached freedom of expression in doing so. That case is very useful to us to look at to see how we can go about achieving what the Minister wants to achieve without limiting freedom of expression. </PARA>
<PARA> That case spoke about a restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend. The Minister says that he does not want a restriction but he admits that he wants to cut the cost. One cannot cut the cost without putting some sort of restriction, de jure or de facto. He does not want to allow us to spend money on the more expensive things. It was argued in the Buckley and Valeo case that this necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. They went even further and pointed out that it would be disastrous to exclude all citizens and groups except candidates, political parties and the institutional press from significant use of the effective modes of communication. We find in Buckley and Valeo that these effective modes of communication should be kept open at least to candidates and political parties. But the Minister wants to ban everybody from using them-not just at election time but at all times. If we go to the case law in the United States, we find that the Americans can see how important it is that candidates and political parties have unfettered access-that means, unedited access-to the media in order to put their ideas across. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that we have some people in the gallery today who wear the honorific title of being the Rats of Tobruk. I do not imagine that those people fought for anything other than these rights-that is, the right to express one's view freely, unfettered and unedited. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, we find in Buckley and Valeo that the electorates' increasing dependence on television has made radio, television and other media the most expensive modes of communication but the most indispensable instruments of effective political free speech. This Minister wants to ban my access, these people's access and anyone's access to putting their view across in what Buckley and Valeo say are the most indispensable instruments of effective political speech. That is what we are on about. That is what this Government is trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister quotes the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. He says that some people on my side said that they did not think election advertising was very effective. But he misleads this chamber. He did not tell us that they went on to say that if people want to waste their money with ineffective advertising, they should have the right to do so. He does not say that not one Government member of that Committee supported the complete ban that his Government has now turned around and decided that it wants. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no dissenting report saying, `Hold on, I think a complete ban would be a good idea'. I notice that some people are trying to squirm out of that now by saying, `Oh well, I thought it was a good idea but, you know, I went along with the majority'. If people come into this place and are so weak as to not put their view, if they are so cheap in delivering a service to the people that they will not tell the Parliament what they really think, and if they just go along with majority, that is on their shoulders. </PARA>
<PARA> The exchange of ideas will be limited because I will not be able to put advertisements on television and radio which most people spend most time looking at and listening to. My freedom of speech will be further limited because the cost of reaching a thousand people is the cheapest by radio and cheap again by television. It is far cheaper than doing it in the newspaper. So I will be restricted. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told that I can go through the media. But journalists have to service critics and to do that they have to have intellect, special expertise, reflection and judiciousness. Journalism is not intellectually rigorous. It does not attract the best minds. Journalists are generalists. They are required to write for a 12-year-old and the very nature of their profession requires them to be sceptical-that is, to see the flaws and then list them. Political advertisements will tell us what the parties think. What current affairs programs will tell us is what is dramatic, what is scandalous and what is tantalising. For example, at the next election if I throw an egg at the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), that will get on television. But if John Hewson wants to elucidate the benefits of a goods and services tax, I will get on television throwing an egg and the electorate will be poorly informed because he will not be able to put his view as a result of some drama. That is what this Government is trying to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, the Labor Government can strongly support the matter of public importance that has been proposed. Indeed, as Senator Vanstone has pointed out, the Labor Government and other Labor governments in this country have for the last century been strongly committed to and continue to support freedom of expression in this nation. Our record is very clear. Such issues as the Bill of Rights and one vote one value have been very strongly supported by the Australia Labor Party. We will continue to support matters such as that. I would like to offer the following quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We would not, I don't not think, support a full ban, however, I do believe that the cost now of running elections . . . is escalating at a rate which I don't think is in the best interests of any of the citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is something we ought to be looking at in a non-partisan sort of way. </PARA>
<PARA> I do think, otherwise it will get out of hand. We don't want the situation like we've got in the US where you have got to be a multi-millionaire to stand for President. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said on 8 April 1990 by none other than John Elliott, the out-going President of the Liberal Party of Australia. Before I develop the arguments in support of the proposition put forward by our Government, I would like to respond to some of the positions put forward by those opposite, particularly by Senator Parer. The honourable senator said that he never expected to be standing in the Senate pleading for freedom of speech. I would suggest that they are hollow words when matched against the attitude of those opposite on such issues as a Bill of Rights, one vote one value and the International Covenant on Human Rights. They are hollow words indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer also mentioned that the Government's proposition has been condemned by all of the media. Well, surprise, surprise! He did not mention, of course, that the media does have something of a vested interest in that it receives some millions of dollars during election campaigns and that perhaps-just perhaps-it is motivated by the desire to gain extra revenue rather than any proposition to uphold the rights of free speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer attacked the role of trade unions. He quite legitimately mentioned that trade unions, through affiliations, do give money to the Australian Labor Party. He suggested that that should be restricted in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not a balanced approach to the giving of moneys to political parties. Senator Parer referred to trade unions allegedly failing to consult with their members, some of whom do support the conservative parties. I draw the comparison with companies that donate money to political parties. Do companies consult with their shareholders about the giving of money to political parties? Of course they do not. As usual, those opposite do not draw an equitable comparison in a debate. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot said about a one-party state and that the proposal of the Government will lead to the establishment of a one-party state. The countries where advertising in the electronic media is banned, such as the United Kingdom, Italy and Scandinavia-in fact, almost all Western democracies, except for the four named by Senator Bolkus earlier-are not one-party states. It is absurd and ludicrous to maintain that the prohibition of advertising in the electronic media will lead to one-party states. Indeed, on the basis of that logic we could only assume that prior to the advent of radio in the 1930s and 1940s, and the advent of television in the 1960s, every democracy was a one-party state because there was no radio or television. In fact, there were thriving democracies without the need for advertising on radio and television.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone made a very interesting comment about laying the issue before a class of school children. I will take up that challenge. If we laid the issue before children fairly, and talked about free speech and the need for them to have freedom of expression, and we then said to those children, `Only one or two of you could afford to pay $40 or $50 to get up and advertise yourselves through radio or television' I dare say most of them would not consider that proposition terribly equitable or fair. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to spend a great deal of time on Senator Vanstone's contribution because, frankly, it is not worth it except to say that the reference she made to people in the gallery-the rats of Tobruk-I believe is an unnecessary and, as was referred to in the interjection, totally cheap shot. If she wants to substantiate her arguments with those sorts of comparisons that is up to her, but it just shows how desperate she has got to be in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the background to the reforms that are being proposed by the Government, our motivation is to ensure a continued, clean, political environment. Secondly, we are going to ensure that there is equity in the political process and that we have a level playing field. The Government is doing this by proposing the full disclosure of all income and expenditure for political parties and partial disclosure for third parties. Was it not a knock-down, drag-out fight from those opposite to get that commitment out of Dr Hewson? We are still not sure whether we have a commitment. It is always prefaced with, `We need to see the legislation' and I suspect that will be its way out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area is the containing of the costs of campaigning by prohibiting radio and television political advertising. Senator Bolkus mentioned just a few areas when giving a breakdown of third party expenditure on broadcast advertising. The forestry industry spent over $1m. Looking down the list of those third parties that spent $1,774,000 in the last Federal election, I suspect there are not too many people in the gallery, for example, that Senator Vanstone referred to, who could or did spend anywhere near that amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA> Saab and Yorke Motors spent $27,000; the Local Government Association, $90,000; the pharmacists, $175,000; the union movement, which is so often berated by those opposite, $56,000; the Brotherhood of Saint Laurence, $26,000; miscellaneous-and I suspect this includes at least some ordinary, common citizens who managed to buy time on the airwaves-some $10,006. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the democratic issues that motivate the proposal from the Government, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, while not specifically agreeing to what is proposed did agree that reform was necessary. The proposal that is being presented is the most democratic outcome from the Committee's recommendations. The most fundamental premise in our society-one vote one value, one person one vote-has consistently been opposed by those opposite. Mr Justice Skelly Wright, who has already been quoted in this debate, of the Appellate Court in the United States of America (USA) said:</PARA>
<PARA>Financial inequities pose a pervasive and growing threat to the principle of `one person one vote' and undermine the political proposition to which this nation is dedicated-that all are created equal. </PARA>
<PARA>Advertising is an inherently undemocratic medium. It is not free speech. It is very expensive. It can cost up to $13,000 a minute. Again, I do not think there are too many people in the gallery-there are not too many people there-who would be willing to spend up to $13,000 a minute. A person's voice should not depend upon the size of a bank account. </PARA>
<PARA> Advertising leads to money, not people, setting the agendas. It is interesting, despite all that we have heard from those opposite, that there are two States in this country where people have actually been convicted in the process of eliciting bribes and being involved in the political process. They involve the National Party of Australia in Queensland, and the various links between the Liberal Party of Australia in Tasmania and Edmund Rouse-who has ended up in gaol-which may well be established through the current Royal Commission in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite would do well to remember that there is more than one royal commission going on in this country at the present time. I do not criticise Opposition members for drawing to our attention the role of the Royal Commission in Western Australia. I just criticise their lack of balance and the fact that they seem to forget that what has been going on in Tasmania for some time has yet to be exposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are going to have a very good dig around in Tasmania, I can assure Senator Vanstone of that. Senator Barry Goldwater of the US Senate said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It's not . . . the people . . . but moneyed interests who are setting the nation's political agenda and are influencing the position of candidates on the important issues of the day.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not an issue of buying influence before an election, but the influence that is bought with future governments after they have been elected. I would like to quote from Commissioner Roden who reported on the North Coast Development in 1990. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Whether the parties intend to allow the donations to influence them or not, they are unlikely to react to them in a manner that will chase the benefactors away. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>So long as substantial donations can be made to political parties or candidates without disclosure, they can be used to purchase influence. The law that allows secret political donations, creates conditions conducive to corrupt conduct . . . The alternative to compulsory public disclosure, I believe, is an unacceptable risk that through financial necessity, influence with Government (of any political colour) will be a purchasable commodity. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the main motivations that leads political parties to seek such enormous donations on both sides of politics in this nation is the cost of political advertising. Advertising is no substitute for the real aim of political process, and that is addressing the issues. Those opposite seem to believe-I do not accept it-that this is some sort of secret plot to ensure that we are re-elected at the next Federal election. It is certainly not true because, if that were the case, then other nations of Europe, where political advertising is banned in the electronic media, presumably would have remained one-party states. I suspect, in fact I am sure, that in the next Federal election, should we be defeated-I do not believe we will be-it will have absolutely nothing to do with whether or not, and how much, money is spent on political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> If, at the end of the day people believe that we have failed to run the economy properly, and that we have failed to address the issues, then they will defeat us. I am confident that they will not come to that conclusion but, at the end of the day, I believe that the cost of political advertising, and the fact that there will be, I hope, no advertising in the electronic media, will make little or no difference to the outcome of that election. It certainly has not occurred in Europe. There have been numerous changes of government, despite the fact that advertising in the electronic media is prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters had this to say about political advertising:</PARA>
<PARA>We reject as absurd the assertion that political advertising is a social good.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It seems likely that it is the news and current affairs programs, and not the party advertisements, that provide the information which makes television a significant influence on individual political choices. We have seen no convincing evidence of any correlation between election results and either the quality or the quantity of political advertising on the electronic media. </PARA>
<PARA>Public funding, even though linked to the consumer price index, cannot keep up with the increased costs of radio and television advertising. Since the introduction of public funding, radio rates have increased to five times the rate of public funding. Television advertising rates have increased to three times the rate of public funding. Advertising has placed participation in the political process out of the hands of the ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, if we look through the list of third party expenditure in the last election, we see very few individuals-in fact I could not find any at all-who through their organisations spent any significant sums of money on advertising in the electronic media. The net effect of all this is that the cost of advertising leads practically to censorship; that is the outcome of it. The right to speak is based on the size of one's bank account. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the issue of undue influence, it is interesting that the former Liberal Party director, Tony Eggleton, told Michelle Grattan that when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister he was told when the Liberal Party donors wanted to see him, `It might get them in the door marginally more quickly'. By the following two measures, we distance the political process from undue influence. We take $19m worth of purchasing out of the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Freedom of speech is more than just the right to have a say. Freedom of speech is the right to hear what other people have to say. This is the hallmark of democracy and this is why I believe so firmly that we must stand up against the attempts of this Labor Government to ban paid political advertising. Yes, it is paid. The banning of paid political advertising bans not only our right to have a say, but also our right to hear what other people have to say. I believe that resistance to what the Australian Labor Party has to say about banning political advertising is critical, not because I am a member of parliament-not because I am a parliamentarian-but because before and after being a member of this Parliament I was and always will be a concerned Australian citizen. The arguments that have been advanced by Senator Bolkus boil down to three essential points, but he fails to understand the crux of the debate, which is the right to hear what other people have to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two thousand years ago, eminent Greek philosophers understood this principle of democracy, but Senator Bolkus does not because he is only a third of the way there. Senator Bolkus does not understand the fact that there can be all sorts of extraneous circumstances that limit a person's right to hear what prospective political candidates have to say. Senator Bolkus's best argument-perhaps his only argument-is that what the Government wishes to do is to make the system fairer by equalising the rights of the people who put themselves before the public, and there is a lot of superficial value in this argument. It is superficially very attractive to say that we are going to put everybody on the same basis, but in Buckley v. Valeo, the case to which Senator Vanstone has already alluded, the judgment of the court was very interesting. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, the equalisation of permissible campaign expenditures might serve not to equalise the opportunities of all candidates, but to handicap a candidate who lacks substantial name recognition or exposure of his views before the start of the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us bring it back to ordinary terms. The judgment was saying that, suppose Richard Carlton or Max Walker or Derryn Hinch chose to stand for Parliament, they would not be on the same footing as everybody else just because they were allowed to spend the same amount of money. Of course they would not. They would have a substantial advantage because they are well known, people who are on the air all the time, people whose faces are before the public. </PARA>
<PARA> There is more to equalising opportunity than just equalising the amount of money that people have to spend. There is more to equalising opportunity than limiting the rights of people to have their say when they ought to have their say. We must remember that, to equalise opportunity, we must also equalise the opportunity to hear. This is the flaw of the Labor Party's campaign, this is the flaw of Senator Bolkus's arguments, and this is why the legislation which was brought before this Parliament by this pernicious Labor Government must be knocked back, must be defeated-because we believe wholeheartedly in freedom of speech and freedom to hear. </PARA>
<PARA> The next argument that was advanced by Senator Bolkus and, to his credit, by Senator Sherry, was that there is a limitation on how much an individual has to spend. Certainly there is a limitation on how much an individual has to spend, but there is no limitation on how many individuals may club together, pool their resources, to have a collective say. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sherry, a member of the Labor Party, should know all about collective voice, should know about people forming political parties because they have similar views. Just because one party is on one side and another party is on the other, why should they have to have the same amount of money to spend? The party that is on one side may well have fewer members than the party that is on the other. It may well have fewer supporters. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot just say that we are going to make everybody equal by giving everybody the same amount of money. That is like saying we are going to make everybody equal by giving them the same amount of pay. In the past couple of years we have seen how this concept was destroyed in the socialist countries of eastern Europe. Senator Sherry and Senator Bolkus both claimed that there were only four countries in the Western world that allowed freedom of electronic advertising. That may be the case. Senator Sherry then tried to say that we were saying that banning political advertising creates a one-party state. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody on this side of the chamber would be naive enough to advance that argument. Senator Sherry might be naive enough to think that we were advancing the argument, but that is not the case at all. All we say is that banning political advertising increases the likelihood of a country becoming a one-party political state. Although only four Western democracies give the freedom to advertise political beliefs, none of the communist totalitarian regimes we see around the world give people that right at all. We are saying: let us not drag the best down to the level of the worst, but let us increase democracy; let us increase freedom and increase the right of individuals to say what they think and to listen to what they like because we have already pioneered the processes of democracy which we believe are so important. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia was one of the first nations in the world to give women the right to vote. If we follow the argument that Senator Bolkus and Senator Sherry have advanced, we should have said in 1930 or 1940, `There are not many other Western countries that give women a right to vote, so why do we not ban women from voting?'. It is the same sort of ludicrous argument that we hear time and time again from the other side of the chamber-the same sort of ludicrous argument we hear from the Minister of propaganda, Senator Bolkus. He makes great play of quoting from the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. If Senator Bolkus did not have a beard, I would be tempted to call him a bare-faced liar, because he has said that that Standing Committee report justifies everything he wants to do. </PARA>
<PARA> But the truth is-and truth is very important here-that not one member of that Committee supported the argument that Senator Bolkus is making; not one member of that Committee said that we should ban political advertising. Here is the rub, and it brings it back to my original point: freedom of speech is not just the freedom to have a say but the freedom to hear. The sorts of mistruths and the sorts of deceitful, untrue arguments we have heard from Senator Bolkus, not just today but day after day-because Senator Bolkus is one of those people who believes that the more one says something the more people are likely to swallow it-are allowed to flourish in a society where we ban political advertising. Only one side-in this case Senator Bolkus and his mates-has a chance to put forward its argument. This is why we on this side of the chamber object to that which they are setting out to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus said, `You do not have to advertise; you can always use radio interviews and television interviews and all of those other things to put your point of view'. But, unfortunately, Senator Bolkus was not listening the other day to his Labor Party colleague Senator Walsh, who highlighted-I believe very clearly and succinctly-the danger in putting one's trust in the press. According to Senator Walsh, he was gravely and, in his words, `gruesomely' defamed and manipulated by an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program. Either Senator Bolkus was not listening to what Senator Walsh had to say, or Senator Bolkus does not care what Senator Walsh had to say. The important point is that we cannot trust the freedom of our political system to journalists who may have a vested interest. If we do not have the right to advertise-the right to say what we believe-then we increase the likelihood that the freedoms of this society will be hijacked, either by people in the media or by people in government whose sole interest in governing is not to benefit Australia but to benefit themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we can go through some of the individual arguments that Senator Bolkus has raised and see the fallacies in the sorts of things he has been talking about. He tries to say that those of us on this side of the chamber are not interested in human rights because we did not support a proposed constitutional amendment to give trial by jury. But Senator Bolkus has not looked on the first floor in the public gallery of this building and seen the protection of our rights that we have in the Magna Carta. He does not understand that the right to vote does not need to be put into the Constitution because it has existed in this country since Federation. It is one of the principles-the axiomatic, undeniable principles-on which this country is built: a democracy of people who have a right to choose and in the process of having a right to choose have a right to speak and in the process of exercising their choice have the right to listen. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why Senator Bolkus fails to understand what is going on. That is why only Senator Bolkus and his mates will flourish in the sort of Australia that their political censorship would give us. I use the words `political censorship' very carefully because if we ban political advertising on radio and television we have to choose what is political and censor it accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Television and radio advertisements do not cost $13,000 per minute. In fact, I put out a lot of radio advertisements over Christmas and I will tell honourable senators what the radio advertisements said. They said, `Congratulations to all of the high school students who have just completed their last year at school. If you have a difficulty this is the telephone number of my office; I would be pleased to hear from you'. Somebody on the other side of the chamber could say that this is political because I am a member of parliament. Somebody on the other side could say, `We have to ban this. We don't want Senator O'Chee getting up and having his say because, after all, he is an elected member of parliament'. But, of course, what that side is trying to do is ban the access of people to their elected parliamentarians and ban the rights of their elected parliamentarians to report back to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the flaw, the weakness, in the argument that we have heard from the other side. In fact, if Senator Bolkus had done his research properly-and the questioning to which Senator Parer has submitted him over the last week and a half would indicate that he clearly has not-he would know that the absurd figure of $13,000 per minute does not describe accurately the cost of political advertising. In many places in Queensland one can get a television advertisement for $50 per minute. If a person does not have $50, as Senator Vanstone has said quite clearly, that person can get 50 people together who can pay $1 each and they can all have their say. This is what we believe in: the right to speak and the right to listen. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Senator Bolkus reminded us that the amount of advertising has tripled in the last eight years. Why has the amount of advertising tripled in the last eight years? The Government has led the way by spending the taxpayers' dollar to achieve its ends-the Government that gave $1 1/4m to the Australian Conservation Foundation so it could further its political ends and then comes back and talks about equalisation of opportunity. This debate is much more complex than this Government would have us believe. I believe it is important for the enduring freedom of this nation that people have a right to free speech, a right to free expression and a right to hear what other people have to say. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance raised this afternoon by the Opposition, in seeking to justify its opposition to the electoral reforms proposed by the Hawke Government, has two flaws. Firstly, the Opposition carelessly assumes that there is no room for improvement in the freedom of expression currently enjoyed by all Australians-a very unwise assumption. On the contrary, there are still many Australians who, for the reasons of socio-economic, educational, linguistic, physical or locational disadvantage, are able to exercise much less than the freedom of expression which could be considered optimal. The Hawke Government has introduced well-targeted programs, as some people may have noticed, which are designed to bring this right-the right to speak, the right of expression, the right to hear and be educated-within the reach of all Australians. The Government is conscious of the inequities which still exist. This consciousness is one reason, but not the principal reason, for our commitment to this particular reform. Such considerations are not the chief purpose of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second flaw in Senator Parer's motion is in the attempt of the Opposition to equate the capacity to purchase advertising-excessively expensive electronic advertising in many cases, though not in all-with the right to freedom of expression. This is an indication not only of muddled-mindedness but also of a late conversion by the coalition to the principles of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the instrument which was rejected categorically in this chamber as recently as 1986 when Senator Durack stated that if we are to have a Bill of Rights it ought to be based on something more apt and appropriate for Australia than the United Nations International Covenant on Human Rights. He got that wrong too: it was the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which was being used as the basis for the amendments that we were seeking to the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> This vehement and ill-informed rejection of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by the coalition was responsible for the defeat of this Government's proposal to include a Bill of Rights in our Constitution. That has been referred to several times this afternoon. The coalition's outrage at our intention to legislate to bar electronic political advertising is mild by comparison with the fury that it directed against the United Nations Covenant in 1986. This is the same covenant that the Opposition is now calling in aid and, at the same time, misinterpreting. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's confusion about rights should not surprise us however. Every move that has been made by successive Hawke governments over the past eight years to protect the rights of individuals by legislation has been opposed by the coalition or at least by substantial numbers of the coalition. This includes the sex discrimination legislation of 1984, based on the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. With the assistance of the Australian Democrats, we proceeded and were able to have that legislation finally adopted in the Senate. It is now widely accepted in the Australian community that this is an extremely valuable piece of legislation. In fact, it is very much taken for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also referred to the constitutional amendments which failed in 1986, but even more recently we had considerable opposition from coalition members in this Parliament and also in State parliaments to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child-a convention which had been endorsed by all 160 member nations of the United Nations. It was ratified by many countries ahead of Australia because of the opposition to it here, especially opposition from National Party of Australia members around the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time I made my first speech in this chamber in 1981, I had just read a slender volume entitled Liberal Thought by C. J. Puplick and R. J. Southey. I commented at the time that their approach to the issue was idiosyncratic, to say the least. One conclusion of the authors was that there are no unqualified rights except to be treated like a man. I asked at the time, `Which man?'. I have received no answer to that question, but I think this is indicative of the confusion that reigns within the Liberal and National parties about what is meant by imperatives and by human rights. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be clearly understood that all rights, as now codified in various United Nations instruments but as discussed by philosophers for centuries, are qualified. I too recommend to the coalition J.S. Mill on this subject. No rights are absolute. My rights are circumscribed as soon as my exercise of those rights encroaches upon the rights of another individual or in some way damages the public good. It is bizarre to try to elevate paid advertising to the status of a public good. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not just purely my opinion as a member of the Australian Labor Party. It is also the opinion that was agreed to by the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Services (FACTS), which also incidentally cast serious doubt on the degree to which television is a significant influence on political choices. That opinion has been quoted several times in this debate this afternoon. The actual quote is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . free advertising is unnecessary as the public are informed through news services, commentaries and interviews in current affairs programs . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I also quote from the minority report of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA>Australians are well provided with such programs by the television and radio stations, both commercial and the ABC, and this is much to the credit of the stations. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not pretend for a moment that the Fourth Estate in Australia is completely without flaw, but there is considerably more opportunity for small groups and individuals to have their opinions and views aired and to hear the views of other people through the medium of news and current affairs programs rather than through the medium of paid advertising. What in fact do we get from paid advertising? By its very nature, it simply reflects the way in which advertising agencies filter and manipulate realities in order to attract swinging voters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is either dishonest or inept for the Opposition to quote article 19 (2) and to ignore article 19 (3), which is the qualifying clause. As I have said, every imperative in any United Nations document about civil, political or other rights has these qualifications, and such instruments should be quoted in full and not ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> Part (3) says that these rights are subject to certain restrictions provided by law and necessary for the protection of public order. This is where we come to the real point of the legislation that is being proposed by this Government. What could be more crucial to public order than the integrity of the electoral system? In other words, the proper functioning of the electoral system is the paramount consideration in our proposal to eliminate the necessity for political parties to raise huge sums of money to pay for advertising. That absolutely fundamental part of our position has been almost ignored this afternoon by the Opposition. I am aware of no set of imperatives which includes the right to advertise. That is what we are talking about, and that is what the Opposition is obsessed with, regardless of its protestations.</PARA>
<PARA> If during the next election campaign Senator Vanstone is suddenly taken by an overwhelming and unavoidable desire to throw an egg, I am quite certain that if she does it in the right place at the right time she will appear on the news and will probably be asked by someone later that day why she did it. There will be no need for her to advertise that she is the champion egg thrower of that campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> If, on the other hand, Dr Hewson makes some policy statement which is actually worth publicising-and I have no doubt that he will have things to say during that campaign-and it is in the public interest for it to be heard, that will also feature on the news, in commentaries and in interviews. In that way, there is more likelihood of the message he is trying to distribute and communicate coming over in its complete form and in a far more accurate way than would have been the case if one short phrase had been taken out for a grab, highly polished and filtered through goodness knows how many different ways of sanitising the way he looks, the way he speaks and the things he is saying. It will cost nothing except a little bit of careful thought in putting that policy or statement together in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid that the debate this afternoon on the Opposition side has been very much at an undergraduate level in relation to an understanding of human rights and an understanding and preparedness to give some real thought to what is intended, to what is behind the intentions of the Government and also to what the implications are of continuing the roller-coaster of having to raise enormous amounts of money in order to fund ever more expensive electronic advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in getting rid of political advertising in the electronic media, we are not jeopardising free speech; we are enhancing it. We are eliminating at least some of the selectiveness and the notorious superficiality of the grab: those few seconds, skilfully illustrated, which seek to focus the mind of the viewer, to exclude analysis and to appeal to the swinging voters, those precious few extra votes that we all woo-my Party, the same as others, in years past. In the future as well, we will still be trying to attract the swinging voters but in different ways, I assume. </PARA>
<PARA> The most effective election advertisements do not pretend to make a positive contribution to the debate. They are slick; they are beautifully produced; they are beautifully photographed; and they are about as stimulating as or slightly less so than the average sitcom. Nor are they used to put forward policies. At best, they will attempt to reduce a complex slogan, as has been said before this afternoon, to an idiot simple slogan. They try to seduce a voter with some slurring exercise for an anthem. Their real job is to hit and run. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been enough manipulation of people's voting intentions; it has not been very effective. It has cost an enormous amount of money, but most of all-and I go back to this point-it has been the raison d'etre for the raising of enormous and ever increasing sums of money by whatever methods. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that this is the total antithesis of the way in which an electoral system maintains its integrity. We will do all that we can to ensure that this system of ours is one in which there is honesty and equity and in which the opportunity to degrade the system is eliminated as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, under section 191 I seek to explain a speech of mine which has been either misquoted or misunderstood. In the debate that has just concluded I made certain remarks. Senator Giles, among other speakers-I choose Senator Giles because she has just spoken-has either misunderstood those remarks or she has misrepresented what I chose to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two aspects in which this has happened and I would like to deal with the first aspect, and probably the most important one, first. In my speech I made the point that, if at the next election I were to throw an egg at the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), undoubtedly that would get on television. It was my assessment that if on the same day my Leader, John Hewson, were to make some comments elucidating the benefits of a goods and services tax, when the two were juxtaposed I would get on television for throwing an egg at the Prime Minister but the important information about the value of a goods and services tax would not get on. I made that point to make it clear that the media work on what is tantalising, what is sensational, what is confrontationist and what is news. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles in her speech referred to those remarks that I made-she has only recently said this, I think even before you came in, Mr President-and said that, if I were to throw an egg at the Prime Minister, she was quite sure that I would not need to advertise the fact that I was a champion egg thrower. This misrepresents to people who may have been listening to her speech but not to mine what I was saying. I was not saying at all that if I threw an egg at the Prime Minister I would want to be able to advertise the fact; quite the opposite. I would have thought that any idiot who threw an egg would want to hide that fact. The very point that I was making was that stupid acts would get free coverage through current affairs and news programs and quite sensible statements would not. In that sense my speech was either misunderstood by Senator Giles or was most clearly misrepresented by her. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect in which I claim to have been misquoted or misunderstood is in relation to my reference to article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I made reference to that, as did a number of other speakers. Senator Giles in her speech-this is the second and last aspect in which I claim to have been misquoted or misunderstood-pointed out that, because people on this side, including me, had been opposed to a Bill of Rights, we were therefore opposed to article 19 relating to freedom of expression. She expressed surprise at the use of it in my speech. What she was conveying to people listening at that time was that in my speech I had rejected a position that I had held in the past. If that is the impression that Senator Giles got-it is certainly the impression that she gave to people who were listening when she was speaking-it is a misunderstanding. It is quite true that in my speech I did not refer to cases that I could have, for example, Davis v. the Commonwealth, which is the most recent one to uphold the common law right to freedom of expression, where certain Aboriginals claimed that the Australian Bicentennial Authority Act - -</PARA>

<PARA>AUSTRALIA-USSR RELATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>Report of the Senate Standing Committee</PARA>
<PARA>on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade</PARA>
<PARA>Government Response</PARA>
<PARA>presented by Senator Gareth Evans,</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's decision in September 1989 to conduct an inquiry into the implications of Soviet reforms for Australia-USSR relations was timely in its conception. The inquiry covered a broad range of issues-political, economic and strategic-and was undertaken at a time when the changes it dealt with occurred at a bewildering pace. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government welcomes the Report, which provides a contribution to public debate and policy formulation with regard to Australia's relations with the Soviet Union. There is much in the Report with which the Government can readily agree. The Report contains a number of valuable findings and recommendations, most of which are either consistent with the present thrust of Government policy, or are already being implemented. At the same time, these recommendations must be considered in the light of changes that have taken place in the USSR since the Committee delivered its findings, which have raised concerns about the direction of the Soviet reform process. </PARA>
<PARA>SOVIET REFORMS</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has drawn attention to the major developments in the Soviet Union in that key period of 1989-90, coinciding roughly with the Committee's own deliberations. On the domestic front, we saw the emergence of embryonic democratic institutions which have done so much to crack the monolith of the Communist command system formed over seven decades. We also witnessed major improvements in the USSR's human rights performance, particularly in such areas as freedom of speech, religion and movement, although many reforms in those areas are yet to be thoroughly rooted in law and practice. </PARA>
<PARA>Of singular importance has been the growth of representative institutions in the 15 union-republics of the USSR (and indeed in many smaller autonomous republics and other administrative units) culminating in the election during 1990 of republican governments which were variously non-Communist, reform-minded or asserting republican autonomy and seeking to loosen links with Moscow to some degree. In the process, the question of the very future shape and existence of the Soviet Union has been raised. Insofar as it touches on fundamental intra-Union power relations and insofar as some republics, such as the Baltic States, are seeking to leave the Union, the nationalities issue has assumed an importance equal to that other great problem which has dogged the course of perestroika-the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>1989-90 saw the continuation of faltering steps towards economic reform. The election of reform-minded republican governments gave a boost to such efforts, particularly with early attempts at cooperation between the central government and the government of the Russian Federation, which focused on the much-discussed ``500-days'' plan for a transition to a market economy. Those attempts did not bear real fruit, and many of the precepts underlying the ``500-days'' model of a decisive shift to market conditions were watered down in the version finally adopted by the USSR Supreme Soviet-in large part because they challenged important institutional strongholds and long-cherished ideological beliefs. Nonetheless, the ``guidelines'' adopted did have the major virtue of enshrining a commitment to a transition to a market economy, albeit after a lengthy transition period. </PARA>
<PARA>The debate on economic reform was to a large degree conditioned by the acceleration of the Soviet Union's economic decline during 1990. The latter can be attributed to a number of factors: the way in which the reforms were implemented; the decline in the Soviet Union's external position, particularly as a result of falling oil export values; resistance by bureaucratic interests associated with the old command economy; and dislocations caused by the breakdowns in traditional chains of command and confusion and conflict over lines of authority following the emergence of new political structures. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has also highlighted the changes in Soviet foreign policy the impact of which was felt to an unprecedented degree during 1989-90. These changes were driven both by domestic economic factors and by a reassessment in the Soviet Union of its own interests and of the rationality of previous foreign policy. The results have been noted by many commentators. First and foremost, superpower cooperation reached a level undreamed of several years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>Other key results have been the conclusion of major arms control treaties, such as the Agreements on Intermediate Nuclear Forces and Conventional Forces in Europe; and the transformation of the strategic landscape in Europe, with the relinquishing of Soviet military domination of Eastern Europe and the emergence of fledgling democracies there; and the drawing of the Soviet Union into the pan-European process, particularly following the signature of the Paris Charter last November. In a broader perspective, a fundamental aspect of the new East-West relationship has been the decline of ideological competition which had been for over forty years the centrepiece and organising principle of international relations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has recognised the fundamental changes that have been encapsulated in the statement that the Cold War is over, as well as the formidable challenges and considerable opportunities they present, not least of all in our own region. The Committee points to the shifts that have occurred in the Soviet Union's relations with the Asia-Pacific region and the fact that they are occurring in a security environment which has its own characteristics and is quite different from the European strategic landscape. I would take issue, however, with the Committee's suggestion that the Government is not addressing in a thoroughgoing fashion the longer term implications for our region of the changes in the global security environment. This is a point to which I shall return. </PARA>
<PARA>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</PARA>
<PARA>The Government can therefore agree broadly with the Committee's assessment that the Soviet Union has changed in fundamental ways; that a return to an exact replica of the past is impossible; and that radical and probably irreversible changes have taken place in the global strategic environment which will have a profound impact on our own region. The Government can also concur with the Committee's prediction that uncertainty and instability are likely to be a feature of the Soviet political landscape for some time to come. That assessment has been underlined by the course of events there in recent months since the Committee's Report was released. Indeed, the development that first caused alarm bells to be rung loudly, the resignation of Eduard Shevardnadze, occurred on the same day that the Report was tabled. The events of ensuing months have introduced a note of caution into assessments of the Soviet Union and of appropriate policy responses. </PARA>
<PARA>The main trend of recent months could be characterised as a resurgence of traditionalist forces in the central organs of Soviet power, concerned that changes were going too far or too fast; as well as sharpening of conflict between the central government and the republics. The developments which have raised serious concerns about the future of the reform process include the use of force in the Baltic States; the departure of leading reformist figures from the ranks of President Gorbachev's key advisers; strengthening of the roles allotted to military and security forces domestically, including in the economic field; statements by senior ministers redolent of pre-perestroika days suggesting that Western governments and business have engaged in subversion in the USSR; efforts to place curbs on some of the more critical and outspoken elements in the media; and economic measures which appear to reinforce centralised controls rather than open the way to market reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>Considerable uncertainty continues to surround the future shape of centre-republican relations. The recent referendum on preservation of the Union, held on 17 March, continues to leave many questions unanswered. While it showed that a majority in the participating republics voted to support the retention of a Union of republics in some form, it did nothing to resolve the future of those republics whose governments boycotted the poll, particularly the Baltic States whose plebiscites conducted in preceding weeks underlined the strength of support for their governments' aspirations to regain independence-aspirations which Australia has supported for many years. It is also an open question as to what kind of a Union people thought they were voting for, given that some republics amended the question or added supplementary ones which reflected differing ideas about the kind of ties that should obtain between the centre and the constituent units of a new federation. This issue will be at the top of the Soviet political agenda for some months and seems likely to be the subject of intense bargaining and negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA>In the area of foreign policy, it has also been disconcerting to hear the stridency and increasing volume of voices criticising the foreign policy path followed by the Gorbachev-Shevardnadze team. Those voices were raised in particular against the position taken by the Soviet Union in relation to the Gulf War. There have also been difficulties associated with implementation of the CFE treaty and in progress on negotiation of a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, and in resolving arrangements for the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Poland. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, it is heartening to note that Mr Gorbachev has reaffirmed his commitment to reform and in particular to the ``new thinking'' in Soviet foreign policy. It is notable that the Soviet Union stood firm in its support for United Nations action in countering Iraqi aggression against Kuwait; the Supreme Soviet has ratified the Two-Plus-Four Agreement on German reunification; and the Soviet Union agreed with its Warsaw Pact partners to dismantle the military structure of the Warsaw Treaty Organisation effective from 31 March. </PARA>
<PARA>The developments of recent months do raise the prospect that the Soviet Union could take one of a number of different paths, some of which the Committee has noted in its conclusions. While the Committee argued that the general direction of reform which the Soviet Government has been implementing is towards a more open and increasingly democratic society with a market-based economy, and maintaining its current foreign policy line, we cannot be so sanguine that this is an inevitable course. Possible scenarios include the reversal of key reforms and the installation of an even more hard-line government with or without Mr Gorbachev, with more repressive policies aimed particularly at rebellious republics. In such a case, while a return to the full-blooded confrontation of the Cold War is highly improbable, a more difficult relationship with Western democracies, and the possibility of many of the gains made in recent years being challenged or threatened, would be more likely. </PARA>
<PARA>IMPLICATIONS FOR AUSTRALIA</PARA>
<PARA>It is in that context that our policies must be formulated, including with respect to the specific recommendations of the Report. It is not a situation that calls for a single-track policy. Clearly, much will depend on how the unfolding Soviet drama is played out. On the one hand we will continue to encourage reform within the limits of our capacity to do so, so long as there is an underlying commitment to basic reform. Our aim should be to give both moral support to the proponents of reform in various regions and levels of public life-through engaging the Soviet Union in dialogue, and encouraging its integration into the international community-and to provide access to expertise and experience, that will assist those reforms to take root. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, it must be made clear that cooperation and support for the Soviet Union will not be forthcoming at any price, regardless of the domestic policies it pursues. We, along with other countries, made clear in responding to the use of force in the Baltic republics in January, that such recourse to violence cannot but affect the course of cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western countries, including Australia. We believe that the Western message on this point was clearly received, and possibly averted an even more tragic turn of events. </PARA>
<PARA>The role of countries like Australia in responding to the manner in which centre-republican relations and other contentious domestic issues are resolved should be to encourage a peaceful and democratic resolution of these problems. Notwithstanding the difficult and complex challenges facing the Soviet Union, it is important that democratic institutions be given a chance to take root and the desire of ethnic and other minorities for autonomy in governing their affairs should be respected. We strongly urge that the path of dialogue and negotiation be followed. In the case of the Baltic States, we have urged the Soviet Government to respect their aspirations to independence, as we do not recognise their incorporation into the Soviet Union. These are principles which we should support both for their own sake, derived as they are from our strong support for human rights and international law, and because it is by following that path that the Soviet Union is likely to achieve a prosperity and security which will be to the benefit of the entire international community. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government stands ready to support the reform process within the means available to us, but our capacity in this regard should not be overstated. It is prepared to consider the question of extending technical economic assistance of the kind already provided to Eastern Europe, as the Committee recommends, and has already offered to arrange a high-level business mission to the Soviet Union to study and advise on food storage, processing and transport problems. Our decision to provide credit facilities, which will enable the Soviet Union to purchase traditional commodities as well as food, took into account the present economic difficulties facing the USSR. The Government decided, however, not to provide direct food aid to the USSR, given a number of practical difficulties rather than through any lack of sympathy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is also ready to continue to strengthen the web of dialogue, exchanges and formal arrangements which we have with the Soviet Union. Those relations have been developed vigorously by this Government since 1983. The number of bilateral agreements concluded has grown from four to sixteen. The two-way exchange of visitors and delegations has expanded considerably. These provide a framework which contributes not only to advancing our economic and political interests, but also to the process of drawing the Soviet Union into a more normal relationship with the international community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>In this process, the Government will pay special attention to fostering ties with the Soviet republics, as the Committee rightly suggests. Assuming that the republics continue to strengthen their autonomy, particularly in the field of economic decision-making, it will be necessary for Australia to establish broader contacts with the governments and peoples of the republics. At the same time, the extent and the type of arrangements that Australia is able to enter into with those republics will depend very much on the kind of status the republics acquire as a result of negotiations within the Soviet Union in the months and years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS</PARA>
<PARA>An important aspect of the Report concerns the implications of changes in Soviet foreign policy for our own strategic environment. The Committee notes the trend towards declining superpower competition and a multi-polar world, which is likely to have a profound impact on our region, a subject that will continue to require careful review and reassessment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not believe, however, that it is appropriate at this point to engage in a strategic review by Cabinet as recommended by the Committee. We consider that the Committee has underestimated the extent to which the Government has already responded to the changes that are occurring in the Asia-Pacific region. Indeed, my December 1989 statement on Australia's Regional Security was premised on a recognition that the global and regional environments in which Asian and Pacific countries pursue their security policies are changing rapidly, and that changes in East-West relations have implications for the Asia-Pacific region as well as for Europe. The assessments of the Regional Security Statement not only remain valid today, but have been reinforced by a rapid series of events over the past year which further underline the fluidity of the present regional security situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, it should be emphasised that the changes flowing from reform in the USSR do not undermine the bases on which Australia's defence policy and force structure development have been formulated, particularly as set out in the 1987 Defence White Paper and the classified report to Government ``Australia's Strategic Planning in the l990s''. Those policy documents, which concentrated on developments in Australia's areas of primary strategic significance-South East Asia, the Eastern Indian Ocean and the South-West Pacific-retain their force and effectiveness. Reform in the USSR has little direct relevance to the formulation of Australia's defence policy and force structure development, as the USSR in current and prospective circumstances does not pose a direct military threat to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has recognised that it must respond to the more fluid and complex regional security environment Australia now faces through contributing in an active and considered way to the development of new processes and dialogues in the region. An important example was Australia's proposal at the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference in Jakarta in July 1990, and in a number of subsequent discussions, for the development of enhanced regional dialogue on security issues. The Government has given priority to the deepening of existing dialogues with regional partners and to the commencement of new regular dialogues on regional security issues where these did not already exist, for example with the Indochinese states. </PARA>
<PARA>Active engagement in a continuing process of dialogue and review is the most appropriate way to tackle the task of analysing and responding to the changes in our region, both indigenous changes and those flowing from the changes that have occurred in the USSR and in East/West relations. Central to the Government's approach has been the need to pursue assiduously processes of dialogue, both bilateral and regional, in order to develop a sense of shared strategic interest and mutual security understanding in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA>The development of any sort of comprehensive regional security institution is not a goal of our policy. It is too early to say what role such an institution might play, or what form it might take. We therefore believe that our efforts should be directed to developing and expanding the region's network of bilateral and multilateral security dialogues. </PARA>
<PARA>In developing this process, it is essential that we take account of realities distinguishing the Asia-Pacific region. In particular, the Asia-Pacific region differs from Europe in that there is multiplicity of security concerns, varying from country to country and sub-region to sub-region. Moreover, countries of the region have demonstrated a preference for bilateral solutions, particularly in matters of security, and there are some mechanisms already in place for handling aspects of security. These include the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation and the Five Power Defence Arrangements. For Australia, our alliance commitment to the United States remains of fundamental importance. The maintenance of US strategic engagement in the Western Pacific is vital to the security of the region as a whole. To be soundly based, any future regional security arrangements would have to take full account of United States interests and views. </PARA>
<PARA>The evolution of the Soviet Union's role in regional dialogue will be tempered by the uncertainties regarding political outcomes in the Soviet Union, to which I have already referred. Nevertheless the Soviet Union has made some contributions to improving the security environment in the Asia-Pacific region. It has drawn down its forces in the region and is withdrawing its power projection capability from South East Asia. It has played a constructive role in seeking a settlement of the Cambodian problem. Normalisation of Soviet relations with the Republic of Korea has also been an important step. </PARA>
<PARA>With the strengthening of this more positive role in the region and of its political and economic reforms, the Soviet Union is likely to be engaged more deeply in processes of regional dialogue, including in regional economic mechanisms. Australia already discusses regional security and arms control issues with the Soviet Union. While Soviet participation in the APEC mechanism is unlikely for the foreseeable future, the Government wishes to support the development of the USSR's economic links with the region and its involvement in regional economic dialogue, not least in recognition of our economic interests, as well as the need to encourage a broader and more constructive Soviet role in the region. As a measure of this, Australia has supported the USSR's application to join the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC). No consensus has thus far been reached on the Soviet application within PECC. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIA-USSR ECONOMIC RELATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has identified a number of important trends which will affect Australia's trade with the USSR in both the short-and longer-term. The Government concurs with the Report's overall conclusion that while the Soviet Union's worsening economic conditions are a barrier to any significant increase in bilateral trade, it is essential for the Australian Government and business community to remain alert to any opportunities that might arise as the Soviet authorities seek to transform its economy, and realise the potential latent in its endowments of great natural resources and a large and well-educated population. </PARA>
<PARA>The Soviet Union has long been an important and stable trading partner for Australia. However, recent developments underline the extent of the challenges facing Australia in maintaining its exports to the USSR at the level of previous years. These have fallen from some $l billion in 1989 to $414 million last year, largely reflecting the hard currency crunch that country is now facing. That, in turn, is as good an indicator as any of the accelerated decline of the Soviet economy; according to Soviet estimates, the GNP could fall by as much as 11.6% in 1991, industrial production by more than 15% and agricultural output by 5%. Last year the Soviet Union also recorded its second successive hard currency trade deficit, a problem that is likely to continue, particularly given declining oil production, exports of which have been a principal source of hard currency revenues. </PARA>
<PARA>Another difficulty lies in the uncertainty surrounding the economic direction that Soviet policy makers wish to pursue. While there is a stated commitment to a transition to a market economy, recent economic measures in many respects are characterised instead by continued centralisation. No steps have been taken to implement any effective price reforms, planning norms rather than market signals remain in primacy, the vital sector of agriculture remains in state hands, and even cooperatives, representing the first faltering steps towards private enterprise, have come under attack from the traditionalist forces. To some extent all this is the result of understandable concern to reassert control over the economy in a period of rapid decline and dislocating changes, but, unfortunately, it is also attributable to vested interests in, and ideological resistance to changing, old methods and structures. </PARA>
<PARA>While the Soviet Government has acknowledged a role for foreign participation in the country's economic development, the ground rules regarding rouble convertibility, joint ventures and foreign investment remain vague and the bureaucracy obstructive. A particularly significant problem now emerging is the great uncertainty over hard currency reserves and earnings between the centre and the republics, straining at Moscow's economic leash. In short, there is thus considerable uncertainty regarding the future environment for trade with the USSR. </PARA>
<PARA>It is against this background of economic uncertainty that the Government's efforts during the last year have been focused on protecting existing levels of trade, particularly following Soviet delays in payments for Australian imports, especially wool. The Government's decision to extend credit facilities to the Soviet Union worth $525 million, which the Committee has welcomed, was part of a strategy aimed at securing the repayment of those debts, and encouraging a resumption of traditional commodity trade. Following that decision, the bulk of the outstanding amounts owed for wool exports has been paid, and Soviet buying organisations have utilised the credit facility to make significant purchases of Australian wheat and barley. The Soviet Union has also now re-entered the market for Australian wool, using the credit facility. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government takes note of the Committee's recommendation that additional credit arrangements be considered for other Australian exports. The Government believes that a more cautious approach would be prudent for the time being, to allow assessment of the performance of the current credit facility. Similarly, the Government is not convinced that such arrangements can be extended to individual republics until their status and their capacity to pay for imports are resolved with a much greater degree of clarity than presently exists. While the Committee has perhaps overestimated the capacity of the republican governments to enter into formal foreign economic relations at present, it is undeniably correct in pointing to the need to pursue a broader range of economic contacts involving decision-makers at the republican level. This is now an increasingly important focus of our trade diplomacy towards the Soviet Union, one which will lay important foundations should the republics' powers to engage in foreign trade become established and consolidated. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has provided a number of pertinent recommendations with respect to enhancing our economic relations with the USSR. The Government concurs with the view that the provision of technical economic assistance, particularly management training, is potentially of benefit not only to the Soviet Union but also in strengthening Australian business links with that country. The Government also accepts the need to keep under review the quality and dissemination of information and advice to business to assist the latter's efforts to export to the Soviet Union. The possibility of establishing regular air services between Australia and the USSR is now being explored. The Government will also seek to strengthen the existing bilateral framework underpinning economic relations with the USSR, both through existing agreements, and through the negotiation of new agreements on Investment Protection and Double Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government also accepts the thrust of the Report's findings concerning the need to work actively to reduce unnecessary restrictions on exports of technology to the Soviet Union, governed by COCOM controls. It is precisely the interests of Australian exporters that prompted the Government's decision for Australia to participate in COCOM. The Government has also sought to ensure that timely adjustments are made to Australian regulatory mechanisms and prompt advice is provided to industry in relation to changes in COCOM controls. However, the Government does not believe that COCOM controls have been a significant impediment to expansion of exports to the USSR. To a large extent, the basic problem facing exporters to the USSR will remain that of identifying, in the face of bureaucratic, structural and personnel changes in the Soviet Union, the right people to deal with who have the capacity to pay for Australian goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA>SOVIET FAR EAST</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has identified both opportunities and difficulties facing the development of economic links with the Soviet Far East. The difficulties include not only those applying to trade with the USSR as a whole, but also poor economic infrastructure in the Soviet Far East, similarities between that region and Australia as well as natural limitations which flow from the latter's proximity to Korea and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA>That said, opportunities nonetheless exist for the development of a worthwhile partnership with the Soviet Far East. This was the thinking behind the Government's initiative to mount an Australian Trade Exhibition held in Vladivostok in July last year. The Exhibition was successful in generating a significant amount of business for Australian firms, but equally significantly, it laid the foundations for longer term commercial relationships between Australian business and Soviet partners in the region. Many of the firms exhibiting at Vladivostok are engaged in precisely those areas that the Report identifies as offering scope for Australia: mining and mining technology, food handling and processing, transport, and construction. AUSTRADE is developing a strategy to follow up the Exhibition in consultation with interested companies. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Committee's findings and recommendations make a valuable contribution to the development of policy with regard to Australia's relations with the Soviet Union and in relation to our broader security environment. The schedule of responses tabled with this statement addresses the specific recommendations in detail. </PARA>
<PARA>The changes taking place in the Soviet Union are of profound significance for the world community, and the task of assessing and responding to those changes will continue to occupy an important place in Australian foreign policy. Recent events have served to emphasise the fluid nature of the situation in the Soviet Union, which will temper the way in which our relations develop. While Australia's capacity to influence developments in the Soviet Union is limited, we will seek to play our part in encouraging the continuation of the democratic reforms and reorientation of foreign policy initiated by President Gorbachev's program of perestroika; and will seek to foster a constructive and mutually beneficial relationship with the Soviet Union and its diverse republics and regions. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SCHEDULE OF RESPONSES</PARA>
<PARA>STRATEGIC ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION ONE</PARA>
<PARA>5.13 Recommendation One: The Committee recommends a Cabinet review of Australia's strategic environment to supplement, and go beyond the Defence White Paper of 1987 and the Foreign Minister's December 1989 Statement of Regional Security. </PARA>
<PARA>5.14 In conducting such a review one important issue that needs to be addressed is the need for appropriate mechanisms or processes for regional security consultations. Ways of promoting an approach in the Asia-Pacific region similar to that pursued with considerable success in Europe need to be more fully explored by Australia and other countries. The risks of an arms race spiral amongst members of the region are too great to permit Australia the easy options of accepting without question the policies and framework of the Cold War or of leaving it to others to determine the direction and pace of change. </PARA>
<PARA>5.15 In the Asian region, President Gorbachev proposed in his Vladivostok speech of 1986 a process similar to that started in Helsinki in 1975. In 1990 a similar proposal was tentatively put forward by Australia as a possible goal for the future. </PARA>
<PARA>5.16 It is generally recognised that the situation in the Asian region is different from that in Europe. The Cold War dynamic of two hostile camps has worked more indirectly in Asia, though with more devastating results, making the unravelling of that dynamic more complex. So, for instance, although the Indo-Chinese states have been closely aligned with the USSR the alliance relationship has not been as close as that between the USSR and the Eastern European countries. This is also the case with North Korea, which has maintained close relations with both China and the USSR. Not only has there not been a Warsaw Pact in Asia but allies and friends of the USSR have often had minds of their own. This has been most evident in the case of China, once firmly in the Soviet camp but subsequently an implacable opponent. India, too has never entered into an alliance with the USSR, and has not only maintained its independence as a sovereign nation but also asserted itself as a regional power in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA>5.17 Nonetheless, super-power rivalry has been imposed upon regional disputes, and has been evident in the India-Pakistan relationship, the Vietnam War, the Cambodian problem, and in the division of Korea. It has also been a significant factor in the high levels of US and Soviet military presence in the northeast Pacific, as well as the US presence in the Philippines and Soviet military and other assistance to Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The paragraphs preceding the Committee's first recommendation note the strategic significance to Australia of developments in the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The Committee acknowledges that the impact of these developments on Australia's immediate strategic environment is less easy to assess, and asks a series of questions which, in its view, call for a thorough reassessment of Australia's strategic environment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has constantly monitored the changes to the strategic environment referred to, and has responded accordingly. It is firmly of the view that the bases of its strategic policies, in particular the Defence White Paper of 1987, Senator Evans' Regional Security Statement of December 1989, and the classified report to Government, ``Australia's Strategic Planning in the l990s,'' retain their force and effectiveness. It does not consider that a Cabinet review, going beyond those policies, is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA>For defence, it needs to be noted that reform in the Soviet Union has little immediate relevance to the formulation of Australia's defence policy and force structure development as set out in the Defence White Paper, which concentrated on developments in Australia's areas of primary strategic significance, namely South East Asia, the Eastern Indian Ocean and the South-West Pacific. In current and prospective circumstances the USSR does not pose a direct military threat to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In terms of foreign policy, the 1989 statement on Australia's regional security was premised on a recognition that the global and regional environments in which Asian and Pacific countries pursue their security policies are changing rapidly, that changes in East-West relations have implications for the Asia Pacific region as well as for Europe and that these issues are already being actively and comprehensively addressed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Government's view and as the Report itself implicitly acknowledges, the assessments in the Regional Security Statement remain valid today. Indeed they have been reinforced by a rapid series of significant events over the last year which further underline the fluidity of the present regional strategic situation. Some of the changes occurred as a direct consequence of the fundamental change in East-West relations. Others were indirect consequences of that change and some were indigenous to the region. But it is clear that the effects of rapid changes in East-West relations are not confined to Europe alone but have implications for the security of countries in the Asia Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee goes on (paragraph 5.14) to state that a review should address the need for appropriate mechanisms or processes for regional security consultations. This is a pertinent observation, which goes to the heart of current Government policy attention. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has recognised that it must respond to the fluid and complex regional strategic environment which Australia now confronts and is actively engaged in efforts towards the establishment of new processes for security consultations in the region. The Government's objective is the gradual development of a regional security community based on a sense of shared security interests. The situation in the Asia-Pacific region differs in important respects from that in Europe. There are disparate regional conflicts (e.g. Korea, Cambodia and the Spratlys) and, apart from the Korean Peninsula, there is an absence of the bloc-to-bloc confrontation that marked the Cold War in Europe. The second factor is that countries of the region, even those in associations such as ASEAN, have demonstrated a preference for bilateral solutions, particularly in matters of security. </PARA>
<PARA>For Australia, our alliance commitment to the United States is of fundamental importance. The United States' presence in the Asia-Pacific region, which is essentially maritime, has underpinned the stability and prosperity of the region since the Second World War, and the maintenance of the US strategic presence in the Western Pacific is vital to the continuing stability of the region in the future. The views of other allies of the United States, notably of Japan, are also important in the Government's thinking. As the Government said in December 1989: ``The United States-Japan Security Treaty continues to underpin North Asian regional security.'' Accordingly the Government places priority on the need to ensure that the US continues to maintain a viable presence in the region. </PARA>
<PARA>These factors have played a significant part in the Government's approach. It has examined what Australia can do on its own, what bilateral opportunities can be exploited and what multilateral options are available. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has taken a number of initiatives over the past two years at the bilateral level with the aim of improving Australia's security environment. It has built on the existing pattern of talks at ministerial and official level, for example disarmament talks and discussion on strategic issues and threat perceptions. It has significantly improved dialogue and cooperation with neighbours such as Indonesia. It has extended its links with all countries of the region in this period. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also taken multilateral security and security-related initiatives, including disarmament at the international and regional levels. The Government's multidimensional approach to security is detailed in Senator Evans's Regional Security Statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The essence of the Government's approach-which is covered to an extent by the Committee's second recommendation-is one of dialogue. Dialogue with allies ensures that essential security interests are harmonised. Dialogue at the bilateral level with regional countries provides an effective way to address their specific concerns, to cope with the risk of weapons proliferation and arms races, and to work out ways to make further progress, whether through one-to-one cooperation or through the involvement of a wider range of parties. Dialogue at the multilateral level is a matter for cautious handling, and is still in the exploratory phase. The objective of such a process of dialogue is what the Government has called the gradual development of a regional security community based on a sense of shared security interests. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has recommended (paragraph 5.18) that the network of bilateral defence and security contacts already established should be further developed, including with the Indochina states. The Government has already been able to include Vietnam and Laos as full participants in its efforts to develop dialogue on regional security issues. The first round of talks with Vietnam took place in Canberra in February 1991; both sides would like to see these talks continue on a regular basis. Given the difference in perceptions on defence issues between Australia and Vietnam and Laos, there is not yet a basis for defence contacts. In the event of a comprehensive settlement being achieved in Cambodia, Australia would be prepared to make a major contribution to a United Nations presence in that country. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION TWO</PARA>
<PARA>5.18 Recommendation Two: The Committee recommends that, at the same time, the Australian Government should continue to press for the establishment of regular processes of multilateral dialogue on security issues for the whole region. The USSR should be a part of this regional process. The Soviet Union has legitimate interests in the region and legitimate aspirations to be part of that region's efforts to promote the economic well-being of members of the region within a secure regional environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>In recent years regional dialogue on security has increased significantly. The Government has encouraged this process, because we recognise that the process of dialogue can quickly bring in its train a building of confidence, transparency and readiness to cooperate in specific ways. </PARA>
<PARA>But the development of any sort of comprehensive regional security institution is not a goal of the Government's policy. It is too early to say what role such an institution might play, or what form it might take. We therefore believe that our efforts should be directed to developing and expanding the region's network of bilateral and multilateral security dialogues. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has pursued that goal with energy and innovation. Some of these efforts can be briefly summarised. Existing dialogue with regional countries has been extended, and regular talks have been supplemented by other exchanges, visits and defence cooperation. Global activity in disarmament has been supplemented with initiatives at the regional level, particularly with regard to chemical weapons. Non-governmental and academic exchanges have been supported as additional aspects of the enhanced dialogue process. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Government's view established regional organisations and mechanisms are of primary importance in helping to manage change in the evolving strategic environment. In particular, the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) process is a mechanism through which active and frank exchanges on regional security issues can be held among South East Asian states with their designated dialogue partners, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Japan, the EC and Canada. The Republic of Korea is expected to be admitted as a dialogue partner later this year. Regional security issues appeared on the ASEAN agenda for the first time last year, in Jakarta. Australia put forward a proposal for the development of enhanced regional dialogue on security issues at the ASEAN PMC and in subsequent bilateral discussions. </PARA>
<PARA>The absence of any single commonly perceived threat distinguishes Asia from Europe in security terms. There is instead a multiplicity of security concerns, varying from country to country and sub-region to sub-region. The mechanisms already in place, such as the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, regional disarmament arrangements and the system of alliances with the United states all make important contributions to processes for enhancing security or for conflict resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes the contribution made by the Soviet Union to debate on regional security issues, notably in speeches in Vladivostok by Mr Gorbachev in 1986 and by then Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in 1990. Australia welcomed the acknowledgement by the Soviet Union in the latter, less ambitious speech, that a step-by-step process is necessary for the Asia Pacific region. The Government remains cautious on the proposal made by Mr Shevardnadze for a meeting of Asian Foreign Ministers in 1993. This is some way off and its current status uncertain. In the meantime there are a number of contributions the Soviet Union itself could take towards enhanced regional security and confidence-building, including greater transparency in military dispositions in the Soviet Far East and resolving its longstanding bilateral issue with Japan. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government fully recognises the major contribution made by the Soviet Union to reducing tensions at the global level, with significant implications for the Asia Pacific region. It has drawn down its forces in the region and is withdrawing its power projection capability from South East Asia. The Soviet Union's constructive role in seeking a settlement of the Cambodian problem and its normalisation of relations with the Republic of Korea are instances of its contribution to an improved security environment in the region. Problems remain, however. One set of problems relates to Japan, and the North Asia sub-region in particular, which remains one part of the region where old tensions persist. Moreover recent events in the Soviet Union may indicate a broader retreat from domestic and foreign policy reforms; this tendency could increase if the Soviet traditionalist lobby gains increasing sway over policy.</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION THREE</PARA>
<PARA>5.19 Recommendation Three: The Committee recommends that one area that should be the subject of regional discussions is the overall levels of armament in the Asia-Pacific region. While there have been some unilateral reductions both by the Soviet Union and the United States, there is no comprehensive multilateral discussion of arms control in the region similar to that which has occurred in Europe. Such discussion is important not only because of the dangers inherent in the concentration of superpower military power in the Northeast Pacific but also because of the potential for arms races to occur between the major regional powers in the multi-polar security environment now emerging. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government shares the Committee's concern that changes in the Asia Pacific region should not lead to greater strategic uncertainty or precipitate a regional arms race. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's proposal for enhanced dialogues on regional security issues is directed precisely towards achieving these ends. Through the encouragement of communication, dialogue, transparency, and through understanding how others view the threats they face and how they feel they need to respond, we hope to discourage competitive arms acquisitions or the adoption of policies which increase military tensions. These processes will reduce suspicions and misapprehensions that might emerge as a result of the changes taking place and lessen uncertainty about the new strategic balance in the region. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is working on two broad fronts: to promote global regimes aimed at constraining or eliminating proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and excessive arms transfers, and at the regional level to develop a common sense of security to remove the rationale for any arms race and to encourage support within the region for global actions. It recognises that the Gulf War has accentuated the dangers of weapons proliferation, although the aftermath of that war has also provided a unique opportunity to address the obvious challenge to security posed by the proliferation of the means of mass destruction and by the excessive accumulation of weaponry, as in Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia has the capacity and international standing on arms control to play a significant role in endeavouring to advance international arms control and disarmament efforts. The Government sees it as part of its global responsibilities and as part of Australia's direct national security interests to make every effort in these directions. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an urgent need for measures to strengthen the existing export control regimes on items related to nuclear, chemical, biological and missile proliferation. We are active participants in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and the Australia Group which has instituted controls on chemical weapon precursors and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>We recognise however, that the only feasible long term answer to the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons is through global multilateral agreements. In this regard, we have stepped up our efforts by working to revitalise and impart a new sense of urgency to the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament (CD) on the comprehensive Chemical Weapons Convention; continuing to work in the CD and at this year's UN General Assembly for the early conclusion of a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT); and pressing for the development of a verification package to tighten the Biological Weapons Convention at the forthcoming Review Conference in September 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The international community has yet to come to grips with the proliferation of massive amounts of offensive conventional weaponry. This is a complex issue but clearly more restraints are needed on a global basis and we expect it to become a major focus in the future. Australia is an active participant in the growing exchanges between countries on this particular problem. The United Nations Expert Group on Conventional Arms Transfers has been focusing on increasing transparency of conventional arms transfers. An Australian expert is a member of the group. The Australian Government looks forward to finalisation of the group's conclusions and recommendations, to which it will give careful consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>Conventional arms are readily available from a wide variety of sources, except for specialised categories involving very high technology. Wide agreement amongst arms producers could be expected to have some effect particularly with respect to more sophisticated items, but it has to be recognised that effective supply side controls are difficult to realise in practice. </PARA>
<PARA>The most enduring and satisfactory outcome for restraint, in the Middle East for example, would be the achievement of a political settlement which at least reduced the incentive to purchase arms and hopefully included a regional agreement capping arms levels. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a strong regional aspect to Australia's international work on arms control. The Government recognises that its efforts in multilateral forums is contributing to the emergence and establishment of non-proliferation regimes which can shape the pattern and habits and practice of countries in our region towards avoidance of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We are, in addition, taking direct steps to address the regional situation:</PARA>
<PARA> (i)  As a member of the South Pacific Forum, we are proud of our role in the establishment of the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone which is a significant regional measure in the fight against regional nuclear proliferation;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) We have sought to ensure that the region is kept free of an entire category of weapons of mass destruction by the Chemical Weapons Regional Initiative. Based in our strong commitment to secure complete chemical weapons disarmament, this concept, initially advanced by the Australian Prime Minister, seeks to develop a solid regional consensus for the early conclusion of a global Chemical Weapons Convention to eliminate chemical weapons and to prepare for its implementation;</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) We are stepping up our efforts to strengthen Asia-Pacific regional commitment to international arms control treaties and to keep the region free of proliferation pressures. </PARA>
<PARA>As well, the Government firmly believes that it is important that countries in the region develop a sense of shared strategic interests and an understanding of each other's security needs, objectives and capabilities in order to remove the rationale for any excessive build-up of arms or a regional arms race. We see this developing through a growing network of bilateral and sub-regional dialogues on such issues as military capabilities and doctrine, and security requirements and perceptions. This is of particular significance in a South East Asia context because of the region's importance for Australia's security. The bilateral disarmament consultations we conduct are an important component of security-related dialogue with regional countries which is fundamental to the Government's approach to handling regional security issues in the post Cold War era. </PARA>
<PARA>Compared with the process of dialogue in Europe in recent years, there is little in the way of free-flowing exchanges on security issues between countries in the Asia Pacific. It is, however, only through such processes of dialogue that mistrust can be broken down, different interests better understood and accommodated, constructive patterns of reassurance developed, and a beginning made on establishing common security as the prevailing security perception in our region. Australia is working hard to develop these habits of consultation and exchange in the hope that a strengthening of the web of dialogue at the bilateral and sub-regional level will lead to an understanding of shared security interests in the region, and a realisation that as a region we have much more in common than we have to separate us. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION FOUR</PARA>
<PARA>5.20 Recommendation Four: Regarding possible nuclear proliferation Australia has consistently supported initiatives to achieve a global nuclear non-proliferation regime. In line with this approach, the committee recommends the review should therefore thoroughly explore what measures Australia might take to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation in the region, particularly on the Korean peninsula and by Taiwan. More specifically, the review should examine what scope there might be for Australia to act as a facilitator in bringing the three nuclear powers with a direct interest in the issue, namely the United States, the Soviet Union and China, together to address the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government acknowledges the great importance of the issues addressed in this Recommendation. Australia is a leading participant in international efforts to restrain nuclear proliferation, both through its own efforts and in multilateral forums. The recommendation refers to both the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan as presenting the risk of proliferation in our region. There is good reason for considering these two separately. </PARA>
<PARA>Taiwan</PARA>
<PARA>Concerns about Taiwanese development of a nuclear weapons capability have abated, although not disappeared, since it was last an issue in the 1980s. Taiwan, although not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), has its nuclear facilities subjected to safeguards applied under an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)/Taiwan/United States trilateral safeguards agreement. There is, however, no cause for complacency, and Australia will continue to monitor Taiwan's nuclear program closely for any indications of renewed interest in nuclear weapons development. </PARA>
<PARA>Because Taiwan does not have formal state to state relations with Australia or with the three nuclear powers with interests in the issue (and indeed is considered to be part of one of them-i.e., China), it is likely that there would be little scope for joint action on Taiwan by the three nuclear powers as envisaged in the Recommendation. The United States on its own, however, still has considerable influence on Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA>Korean Peninsula</PARA>
<PARA>Concerns about the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are of a different order and should be more amenable to the sort of cooperative international action mentioned in the Recommendation, although success will be problematical. The persistent refusal of the DPRK, a party to the NPT, to conclude its obligatory NPT safeguards agreement with the IAEA, thereby submitting all of its peaceful nuclear activities to international inspection, is of great concern to its immediate neighbours and to all other countries in the Asian/Pacific region, including Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the last two years, in concert with other countries strongly supportive of the NPT, including Japan and the United States, Australia has made representations to the DPRK bilaterally and through multilateral action, urging it to honour its NPT obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>Most recently, Australia, along with the United States, Japan, Canada and Poland, has responded to a letter from the DPRK to the President of the UN Security Council which attempted to make conclusion of its NPT safeguards agreement conditional on the removal of United States nuclear weapons from the Republic of Korea (ROK). The Australian letter rejected the DPRK's attempt to place conditions upon the fulfilment of its NPT obligations. This position was supported by a large number of NPT Parties at the meeting in late February of the IAEA Board of Governors, in which Australia holds a designated seat. </PARA>
<PARA>The proliferation pressure building on the Korean Peninsula must be addressed at both the global and regional levels. At the global level, we should continue to strengthen the operation of the multilateral treaty system. Australia is actively contributing to this process. </PARA>
<PARA>But it is primarily at the regional level that the key to a solution to proliferation on the Korean Peninsula will have to be sought, given the high level of tension between the two Koreas, and the vital security concerns of neighbouring countries and the United States. A regional layer of commitments and confidence building measures could be based upon and complement the global non-proliferation regime. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government sees some prospect of progress in the DPRK/ROK high-level dialogue, despite the cancellation of the last scheduled talks by the DPRK. Beyond this, in the face of continued refusal by the DPRK to meet its NPT obligations, if proliferation is to be averted it will be necessary to look beyond the symptom of the safeguards agreement to try and address the reasons behind the DPRK's unsafeguarded nuclear activities. A carefully balanced mix of incentives and disincentives related to the NPT and the strategic situation on the Korean Peninsula may be needed to induce the DPRK to abandon a nuclear weapons option. It may be, however, that only a political solution on the Korean Peninsula and outright reunification will ultimately resolve the issue.</PARA>
<PARA>Facilitation of Dialogue</PARA>
<PARA>The following points should be noted with regard to an additional role for Australia as a facilitator of dialogue. Australia already consults regularly and in depth with the United States on matters relating to nuclear proliferation, including on the Korean Peninsula. The Government also takes appropriate opportunities to regularly encourage the USSR and China to bring to bear whatever influence they can in order to persuade the DPRK to abide by its NPT undertakings. For example, at the recent nuclear consultations between Australian and Soviet officials in Moscow, the visit by a senior Soviet official to Canberra in February, and at regular disarmament talks in the latter part of last year in Beijing. </PARA>
<PARA>Just as Australia consults with these major powers over the proliferation pressure building on the Korean Peninsula, so too do these countries already maintain a regular dialogue with each other on this issue. There may be scope for trilateral contacts between these three countries adding weight to their existing efforts to influence the DPRK. </PARA>
<PARA>However, any attempt by the three to attempt to address the sources of tension on the Peninsula, and to impose a solution on the two Koreas (and Japan) without their participation, would be doomed to failure. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will continue to keep Australia's interests in averting nuclear proliferation in this volatile region before these three powers, and to seek their continued vigorous engagement in the search for a regionally-tailored solution. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIA-USSR ECONOMIC RELATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION FIVE</PARA>
<PARA>5.23 Recommendation Five: The Committee recommends that more effective channels of communication and a greater flow of information be established between Government assessment agencies and departments and the Australian business community. The objective should be the establishment of an active program for the regular dissemination of assessments on the USSR to important user groups within the community. The Government needs to give greater emphasis to supporting Australian businesses seeking to export by providing more responsive, high quality commercial intelligence, and by offering greater country expertise to solve specific problems that Australian exporters face in dealing with the complexities of a situation such as that in the USSR. Essentially, Government departments and agencies should assume more effectively the role of a clearing house for information on the Soviet Union. The precise nature of such a mechanism would need to be the subject of discussion between all departments and agencies involved, including the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Defence, Industry and Technology, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, AUSTRADE, Office of National Assessments and the Defence Intelligence Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Government Departments have developed regular channels to facilitate dissemination of information to the Australian business community. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) produces a range of commercially-oriented material on the USSR, including its Country Economic Brief series and the monthly publication Eurofile, to which a wide range of business and other organisations subscribe. Officers from DFAT, AUSTRADE and other Departments dealing with trade with the USSR are available to provide briefings and assist exporters, and have frequent contact with business people through such mechanisms as the Australia-USSR Business Council. AUSTRADE also disseminates commercial intelligence to Australian business through the East Europe Market Development Office based in Canberra and through the Trade Commissioners based in Moscow. This process involves not only providing information, but also spending time with companies, interpreting for them what is happening in the USSR, relating it to their own company situation and then advising them the best way to approach the market. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's recommendation nonetheless highlights the need for better coordination among Government Departments to improve the flow of Soviet economic and commercial information to the business community at a time of rapid change and uncertainty. The Government will continue to monitor and keep under review its role in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA>Recent initiatives by the Government to improve coordination of strategies should improve services provided to exporters to the USSR. The recent decision to implement the McKinsey report on AUSTRADE and transfer responsibility for AUSTRADE to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development from 1 September 1991 will enhance the role the Government is playing in markets where governments have a significant impact in the conduct of international trade, such as the USSR. </PARA>
<PARA>More generally, the Government has announced that the Ministerial Trade Strategy Group, chaired by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development and including the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Industry Technology and Commerce, and Primary Industries and Energy, will be working with State Governments and industry organisations to develop a coordinated national trade strategy, particularly with respect to overseas trade missions and contacts with foreign governments on trade development activities. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION SIX</PARA>
<PARA>5.23 Recommendation Six: The Committee further recommends that the Australian Government, in collaboration with private business, seek to establish a high level joint working group, comprising both Australian and Soviet government representatives, business and academics. Such a committee should meet regularly to discuss the evolving economic situation and identify potential trade and investment projects. Representatives of USSR republics should also be included in the joint process as necessary to deal with specific issues of direct interest to Australian business in individual republics. In a period of turbulence such as that now occurring in the USSR, the Committee considers that there needs to be more direct and more frequent contact at a high level between involved organisations. Australia should take the initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not consider that a high level joint working group of this kind, in particular one covering such a range of interests, needs to be added to the existing framework of institutional mechanisms at this stage. The most important of those mechanisms are the Australia-USSR Mixed Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation and the Australia-USSR Business Council. The Mixed Commission enables regular review of the bilateral trading relationship with high-level participation by Government and business representatives. The Business Council provides a framework for regular consultation between the business communities of both countries, and has frequent contact with Government. While academics are not routinely included in either body, the point is that Government and business representatives keep abreast of academic analyses of Soviet developments through economic/political seminars and conferences that are frequently held on this subject both in Australia and the Soviet Union. An additional institutional mechanism, largely consisting of the same Government and business representatives as on the existing bodies, is likely to complicate and confuse the handling of the bilateral trade relationship. </PARA>
<PARA>The Soviet republics are already involved to a certain extent in the Mixed Commission and other bilateral consultations. It is the Government's policy to expand and strengthen our relations with the republics, given the likely trend towards their greater autonomy in economic management, and will continue to encourage this process. Towards this end, the Government actively encourages contacts with representatives of the Soviet republics, including high level visits to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION SEVEN</PARA>
<PARA>5.24 It has become evident that the loosening of central control over foreign currency transactions will enable some Soviet enterprises to enter into more extensive and more imaginative arrangements with foreigners, with potential advantages for both sides. It is equally evident that these activities will carry with them a significant element of risk. From the point of view of Australia's long-term economic interests there is obvious benefit in getting a firm foothold in the Soviet market sooner, rather than later, when international competition can only become more intense. The Committee applauds the Government's initiative in offering a A$525 million line of credit for Australia's wool and wheat exports. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation Seven: The Committee recommends that similar credit arrangements be considered for other potentially significant Australian exports for the immediate future. These arrangements should not be confined to the central Soviet authorities but should also be extended to individual republics. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>While the Government will naturally keep its options open with regard to the possible extension of the credit facilities to the USSR, it believes it would be prudent to first gain experience in the operation of the facility currently in operation, particularly the Soviet Union's payment performance, before considering additional facilities. It is important to note that the credit facility currently in operation comprises two elements: a $125m facility for wheat, and a $400 million rollover facility on 240-day terms covering not only purchases of wool but also other commodities. </PARA>
<PARA>As noted above, the Government considers it important to develop relations with individual Soviet republics. However, with regard to extending credit facilities to the republics, the main difficulty is that the central Soviet authorities remain in full control of hard currency reserves. The Government could consider the participation of individual republics in the current credit facility, which would be a matter for internal consideration within the Soviet Union. Any facility negotiated directly with an individual republic would require a guarantee from the Soviet Foreign Economic Relations Bank such as already applies to the existing credit facility. However, the Government will keep this issue under consideration in the context of the developing pattern of the Soviet centre-republican relationships. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION EIGHT</PARA>
<PARA>5.25 The Committee agrees with the view expressed in a number of submissions that there is scope for considerable expansion in Australian export of technology and scientific expertise to the Soviet Union. This applies particularly in the agricultural and mining sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation Eight: In pursuing these opportunities the Committee recommends that particular attention be given to joint venture possibilities, including with third parties, such as, for example, Korean companies. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the view that Australian companies should give consideration to joint venture possibilities in expanding economic links with the Soviet Union. A number of Australian companies have already entered into or are negotiating such arrangements. Government Departments already provide information to companies on the legal and economic conditions concerning joint ventures in the USSR. At the same time, however, it is important not to underestimate the difficulties associated with joint venture operations in the Soviet Union. Of some 2000 such ventures registered, only 10-20 per cent are effectively in operation. The difficulties essentially lie in repatriating profits overseas, obtaining reliable supplies and skilled labour, and in the vague nature of the regulations (concerning foreign participation in the local economy), often restrictively interpreted by the bureaucracy. That said, clearly the Government and Australian companies should be alert to any opportunities that might arise, particularly in the context of Soviet attempts to arrest the country's economic decline through foreign economic links. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION NINE</PARA>
<PARA>5.26 The Report notes the high level of controls still applied under the arrangements agreed to by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Strategic export controls (COCOM), notwithstanding certain advances in recent times, such as the removal of the former German Democratic Republic as a proscribed country. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation Nine: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government work actively to ease the restrictions further in order to open up new trade opportunities for Australian exporters of high technology goods and services to the Soviet Union. An important opportunity to do so will be at the forthcoming meeting of COCOM in early 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Policy coordination and development on COCOM matters is handled through an interdepartmental committee, comprising the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Defence, Industry, Technology and Commerce (including the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Trade Commission), Primary Industries and Energy, Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Transport and Communications. The Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio has prime responsibility for Australia's participation in COCOM. The Department of Defence administers Australian export controls on dual-use (civil and military applications) technology and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy administers the controls on exports of nuclear materials and technology. These controls are enforced at the barrier by the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA>The extensive coordination on policy matters is necessary to achieve the broadest possible perspective, including commercial considerations in the formulation of Australian positions on COCOM. However, the arrangements for administration of Australia's controls ensure that Australian industry is given timely advice of changes (including intended changes) to controls and that Australian controls are adjusted quickly following agreement by COCOM. For example, bulletins are sent to all known exporters alerting them to changes of the control lists. To supplement this, industry advisory groups are being set up to provide a commercial input into the development of the Australian position on list changes and to provide industry with advance information on proposed changes/liberalisation of the control lists. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of the profound changes in East/West relations and the consequent impact on strategic considerations, COCOM has been examining the liberalisation of controls to all proscribed countries and has recently agreed that favourable consideration will be given for the export of controlled goods to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Defence conducted a survey in 1988 to gauge the impact of foreign controls on dual use technology on Australian importers and exporters. Significant delays, particularly from the US, in granting export licences were evident. Similarly, the US tried to exercise control on the re-export from Australia of US origin goods and technology. Australian membership of COCOM has removed most of this delay and has provided Australian importers access to technology that had been previously denied to them. So long as major technology suppliers seek to restrict access to high technology, Australia sees membership of COCOM as being in its self interest. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of COCOM members, including Australia, have recently introduced special arrangements within their national controls eliminating the licensing requirements for most controlled goods on trade with other COCOM participants. Australia has also participated in the work to develop a new and significantly reduced COCOM list of dual-use technology which will reflect the changed West-East strategic situation. Most of the new core list items were agreed at an Executive Committee meeting held in February 1991. The COCOM High Level Meeting scheduled for May 1991 is expected to decide on the final shape of the new list and its implementation date. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION TEN</PARA>
<PARA>5.27 The Report notes the recent increase in the number of persons travelling between Australia and the Soviet Union. The Report also notes with some concern that in recent times there has been a decline in the level of Russian language and other studies in Australian universities. Greater person-to-person contact is, in the Committee's view, a vital ingredient in the development of a healthy and mutually beneficial relationship. In order to facilitate and encourage such a development, the Committee makes the following recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA>5.28 Recommendation Ten: The Committee recommends that the decline in Australian University resources made available to Russian studies be halted, and preferably reversed. One avenue would be for the representatives on the joint working groups proposed above to explore ways and means of developing, in cooperation with the private business sector, a long-term program for a steady increase in Russian studies in Australia. In addition, a student or senior scholar exchange with specific institutions in the Soviet Union, preferably both in Moscow and in the Soviet Far East, should be established. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that it is important that a sound base of Russian language study, as well as teaching and research on the Soviet Union in other disciplines, be maintained in Australia in order to facilitate the development of the bilateral relationship, both at the official and people-to-people level. While University funding allocations to individual disciplines are principally a matter for tertiary institutions themselves to determine, the Government will seek to encourage them to maintain and, subject to demand, if possible expand resources available to Russian studies, as well as to the study of other languages of the USSR. The Government hopes that business will see the value of employing such language skills in dealing with the USSR; this will be a factor in maintaining demand for Russian studies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is currently reviewing its literacy and languages policies. A discussion paper, ``The Language of Australia: Discussion Paper on an Australian Literacy and Language Policy for the l990's'', was released in December 1990. Following extensive consultation, a literacy and languages policy paper will be released in the context of the 1991-92 Budget, covering the general issue of promotion of languages other than English. The Committee's recommendations will be taken into account in consideration of the issues involved. The professional development of language teachers is likely to be identified as a priority. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has already sought to support tertiary study of the Soviet Union, providing in 1990 $100,000 to the Australian National University program of research and teaching on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe covering a number of disciplines. This allocation was approved in the context of considering the Government's response to the historic changes taking place in Eastern Europe, and was aimed at supporting Soviet and East European area studies at an Australian university with a reputation as a leading centre in this field. The Government also notes the establishment in 1990 of the Centre for Soviet and East European Studies at the University of Melbourne, which will provide added momentum to research and teaching on the Soviet Union in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that a framework of institutional contacts with Soviet universities is an essential element in maintaining and developing Australian expertise on the Soviet Union and its languages in particular. To that end, it has encouraged and facilitated the establishment of such institutional ties and will continue to do so. Over the last five years these ties have expanded significantly, to an extent far beyond that reached in 1979 prior to the freezing of cultural and academic ties by the Fraser Government in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Several Australian tertiary institutions have concluded institute-to-institute arrangements with Soviet counterparts, including Moscow State University, Leningrad State University, the USSR Academy of Sciences, the Pushkin Institute for Russian language study, Kiev University, and the Far East Maritime College in Vladivostok. These arrangements provide for exchanges of a number of senior scholars and students. The introduction of the Overseas Postgraduate Research Scholarship Scheme (OPRS) in 1990 has seen some 150 overseas students undertake research training in Australia at the Masters and Ph.D level each year. Currently four students from the USSR are in Australia on these scholarships. From 1992, 300 OPRS scholarships will be made available. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provides funding for exchanges of senior scholars and students under the bilateral Cultural Cooperation Agreement with the USSR. There is scope for a limited number of places for such exchanges under the present budget for the USSR ($110,000 in 1990-91). </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is pleased to note that a number of youth exchanges have been established or are under discussion, involving Australian schools and organisations such as Rotary and AFS. These should play a significant role in developing people-to-people contact as well as knowledge of the USSR and its languages. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION ELEVEN</PARA>
<PARA>5.29 Recommendation Eleven: The Committee recommends that members of ethnic communities in Australia with origins in the Soviet Union be encouraged to use their natural advantages, such as knowledge of language, to establish business contact with the Soviet Union and with its constituent republics. In particular, efforts should be made to remove obstacles, including any limiting regulations, and to facilitate such contacts. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that the background and language skills of members of ethnic communities in Australia with origins in the USSR are potentially valuable assets in business dealings with the USSR. A number of Australian business people from those ethnic communities have been active in establishing business contacts with the Soviet Union. The Government is ready to encourage and facilitate the further development of such contacts. Government Departments, in particular the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, maintain close and frequent contacts with ethnic organisations (for example, the Baltic Council, the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, and the Armenian National Committee) with cultural links to the relevant Soviet Republics. </PARA>
<PARA>The Agreement on Human Contacts and Humanitarian Co-operation, signed in February 1990, is a particularly useful document in removing any impediments to ethnic communities being able to maintain links with Soviet republics of their origin. The Agreement will facilitate a broad range of human contacts between people in Australia and the USSR. These include family reunion visits and permanent settlement for family reunification. </PARA>
<PARA>The Agreement will also make it easier for religious organisations in both countries to establish and maintain contacts and for journalists to communicate personally with their sources of information, and commits both Governments to ensure rapid communication by mail and telephone between the two countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Both Governments, in providing for contacts, commit themselves under the Agreement not to discriminate between persons on the ground of their origin, social and property status, race, nationality, colour, sex, education, language or religion. They are also obliged not to discriminate against people seeking to have such contacts (for example with regard to employment, housing or educational privileges). </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION TWELVE</PARA>
<PARA>5.30 Recommendation Twelve: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government draw the attention of Australian business to the possible benefits to be gained from offering management training to senior executives of their potential or existing business partners in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is desperately short of expertise to manage the transition to a market economy and representatives of the Soviet Union have actively sought such assistance, both in Australia, the United States and in Europe. In particular, the Australian Government should establish a program for the Soviet Union similar to the Australian Programme for Training in Eastern Europe (APTEE). </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees with the Committee's comment that there is a shortage of expertise in the Soviet Union in the field of business management. The foreshadowed movement towards a market economy presents a great challenge in circumstances where knowledge of business, commercial and trading practices is almost non-existent. The absence of this skill base is bound to hamper, or at worst make unachievable, economic restructuring, as well as make more difficult the development of mutually beneficial commercial relations with the West. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is considering the question of establishing a program of management and business training for the Soviet Union similar to APTEE. This issue will be considered in the light of Australia's regional aid priorities and current budgetary constraints, taking into account the recommendations of international funding institutions and the experience gained in relation to APTEE. While Australia's capacity to contribute to efforts to address this problem is limited by our size and budgetary constraints, provision of management training in Australia should be of advantage to Australian companies in the future. Some companies have already initiated programs in this area, and one Australian company has concluded an agreement to train Soviet managers. Their experience, as well as the experience of overseas countries and of Government programs such as APTEE, will help other Australian firms to assess for themselves the possible benefits of introducing similar management training programs. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION THIRTEEN</PARA>
<PARA>5.31 Recommendation Thirteen: The Committee recommends that Australia's aviation authorities and Qantas should take fully into account the potential trade and tourism benefits that would flow from expanding further the present agreement allowing Aeroflot to operate charter flights and to establish regular services together with reciprocal opportunities for Qantas in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that potential trade and tourism benefits should be taken fully into account in considering the establishment of regular air services with the USSR. The Soviet Government has recently proposed that Australia and the USSR conclude an air services agreement. This question is currently under consideration by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION FOURTEEN</PARA>
<PARA>5.32 The Report notes the range of bilateral agreements signed by Australia and the Soviet Union at the time of Prime Minister Ryzhkov's visit in early 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation Fourteen: The committee recommends that there should be a sustained effort to implement those agreements and not allow them quietly to gather dust. In particular, scientific exchanges in the area of monitoring major environmental changes such as ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect should be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government endorses the Committee's view that there should be a sustained effort to implement the bilateral agreements signed at the time of Prime Minister Ryzhkov's visit. It can report that implementation of the agreements in their first year of operation has, by and large, been satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>Three of the agreements-on Human Contacts, Consular Relations, and the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy-were framework documents, establishing the principles according to which the two countries would conduct themselves in particular areas of bilateral relations, rather than agreements requiring implementation in the form of a program of activities. The first bilateral talks on implementation of the Human Contacts Agreement were held in Moscow in January 1991. The Australian delegation was able to raise a number of issues of concern to the Government and undertake a review of the Agreement with the Soviet side in a constructive and business-like atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA>The Agreement on Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy was brought into force by means of an Exchange of Notes between the Australian and Soviet Governments on 24 December 1990. Administrative arrangements for implementation of the Agreement were negotiated during 1990 and signed on the same date. The first bilateral consultations on nuclear issues under the Agreement were held in Moscow in March 1991. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) has concluded a Memorandum of Understanding with the USSR Academy of Sciences in September 1990 to promote collaboration in radioactive waste management technology. </PARA>
<PARA>Three other Agreements-on Fisheries, Commodities and the Environment-were also signed during Premier Ryzhkov's visit. Some progress has been achieved in the implementation of the Fisheries Agreement. Soviet fisheries agencies have been negotiating a possible joint venture agreement on feasibility fishing in Australian waters. The Government has agreed to the Soviet Government's request to open a fisheries representative office in Melbourne, in accordance with the Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commodities Agreement has been overtaken to a large extent by Soviet foreign exchange difficulties since mid-l990, which has severely hampered its capacity to fulfil existing contracts, let alone conclude new ones. The focus of the Government's trade relations activity towards the USSR has been to ensure that debts owed by Soviet organisations to Australian exporters are paid and to encourage them to maintain the level of exports to the USSR to the maximum extent possible. Unavoidably, Soviet buyers have not been able to meet some of the indicative quantities for purchases of commodities set out under the agreement, but major sales of wheat and barley have taken place. The Government hopes that new credit facilities provided to the Soviet Union will facilitate a return to former levels of trade, but given the USSR's continuing economic problems, assesses this as unlikely in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA>No collaborative activity has yet commenced under the Environmental Co-operation Agreement, as a result of budgetary restraints both in Australia and the Soviet Union. The Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories is examining ways of obtaining funding to advance cooperation under the Agreement. The Government agrees that scientific exchanges in the area of monitoring major environmental changes would be of substantial value to both countries. </PARA>
<PARA>MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC</PARA>
<PARA>COOPERATION</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION FIFTEEN</PARA>
<PARA>5.35 The Committee does not expect to see a rapid, or complete, transition from a command to a market economy in the Soviet Union. On balance, and notwithstanding some of the reservations noted previously, it is in Australia's interests to see a transition which boosts activity in the USSR succeed. It is equally in Australia's interests to encourage economic interdependence between the Soviet Union and the Asia-Pacific region, and to link the Soviet Union into regional efforts to devise mutually beneficial ways and means to encourage the overall growth of trade and economic development in the region. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation Fifteen: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government look at a possible mechanism for involving the USSR in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) process. At a minimum it should ensure that the USSR is kept fully informed on the APEC progress. Consideration might, in the first instance, be given to some form of observer or other partial membership status for the USSR. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government regards the participation of the USSR in APEC as desirable and inevitable in the long term. To this end, the Government has encouraged the USSR to develop its economic links with the region, and has undertaken to keep the USSR informed of developments within APEC. </PARA>
<PARA>However, Soviet participation is not considered feasible in the immediate future. APEC Ministers agreed in 1989 that further applications for participation should be assessed in the light of the strength of economic linkages with the region, and that decisions should be made by consensus. The USSR's economic links with the region are currently not developed to an extent which would assure it of entry into APEC. </PARA>
<PARA>The question of wider participation is being addressed within APEC; the present focus is on participation for the PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong, three economies which clearly form part of the region's economy. Once this is resolved, it will be possible to consider whether there is a consensus for further expansion, including economies such as the USSR and Mexico which are of growing importance to the region. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no provision for a country being given observer or associate status in APEC. The three entities that have observer status are regional organisations (ASEAN, PECC and the South Pacific Forum). The Australian Government is of the view that all economies which become part of the APEC process should do so as full participants. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government supports the USSR's application to join the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC). As noted in the Committee's report, the USSR has already formed a Committee for Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation, one of the prerequisites for PECC membership. In 1990 the USSR lodged a formal membership application, which was considered by the PECC Standing committee in September 1990 (along with seven other applications). Despite Australian support, some other PECC members still have reservations about Soviet membership, and no consensus on the Soviet application was reached. The Government considers that it is probably only a matter of time before the USSR joins PECC. </PARA>
<PARA>FOOD CRISIS</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION SIXTEEN</PARA>
<PARA>5.36 Finally, it is Committee's view that the reform process in the USSR is to be seen as a positive development, which should be supported. The most pressing and immediate need is likely to be for food supplies in the coming months. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation Sixteen: The Committee recommends that particular attention be given to devising effective means for Australia to contribute to international efforts to provide food during this critical period. In line with the approach being considered by Germany and Canada, such assistance should not be a hand-out but a commercial transaction in the form of favourable terms of credit. At the same time, it should be made clear to the Soviet Government that the use of force, including the imposition of economic blockades, in dealing with the wish of some of the republics for greater autonomy is not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Under the credit facility the Government has extended to the Soviet Union, the latter is able to purchase food supplies from Australia. The Government also considered the question of providing direct food aid to the Soviet Union in view of the food shortages in the country. It decided that, for a number of reasons, it was impractical to do so, given our competing regional aid priorities, current budgetary constraints, and complications involved in both sending such aid and assuring its effective distribution. Moreover, the shortages appear to have arisen primarily from the breakdown of the central distribution system and other deep-seated infrastructural factors, rather than from production shortfalls, and the experience of countries extending direct food aid to the USSR has demonstrated the difficulty of distributing it to those actually in need. The Government also took into consideration the fact that Australian exporters were negotiating commercial food purchases by the Soviet Union. The fact that significant sales were ultimately made vindicated the Government's view in taking the interests of Australian companies into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is nonetheless taking practical measures to assist the Soviet Union in its present time of difficulty. As noted above, the Government has made available credit facilities worth $525 million to support Australia/USSR commodity trade. Following an initiative from the Prime Minister, the Government has also agreed to organise an Australian business advisory mission to the USSR to look at problems in the areas of food storage, processing and distribution. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's efforts to broaden the scope of assistance to the USSR will take into account developments in the USSR, as the Committee suggests. In developing the bilateral relationship, Australia wishes to encourage the Soviet Union to stay on the course of both political and economic reform. In forthrightly condemning the use of force by Soviet authorities in the Baltic States in January 1991, the Government made clear that the use of such force was not only unacceptable, but that repeated use of force in this way can not but affect the course of cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western countries such as Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I also take note of the response from the Government, presented by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), to the report of the Committee entitled Perestroika: Implications for Australia-USSR Relations. The Committee was empowered by the Senate to begin its investigation on 7 September 1989 when the following terms of reference were laid down for the Committee to inquire into and report on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(a) the implications for Australia of economic and political reform in the Soviet Union, with special reference to strategic relationships in the Asia-Pacific region;</PARA>
<PARA>and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) the opportunities for expanded Australian trade with the Soviet Union, particularly the Soviet Far East and Siberia. </PARA>
<PARA>I should say at the outset that the focus of this inquiry, although on perestroika generally and its implications for Australia, was very much on the eastern regions of the Soviet Union, those in the Pacific region, the Soviet far east and Siberia. The Minister's response is available today and no doubt members of the Committee will study that response at some considerable length. It is certainly another edition to a very welcome and useful debate that has been occurring in this Parliament on the reforms in the Soviet Union and on what perestroika means for Australia, both in a security sense and also on the trade and economic front. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular report was tabled in this place on 21 December last. As I pointed out, the inquiry began in 1989. In regard to the overall thrust of the Minister's response, I note that he, on behalf of the Government, welcomes the report and points out:</PARA>
<PARA>There is much in the Report with which the Government can readily agree. </PARA>
<PARA>In regard to recommendation 1 of the report which the Senate Standing Committee put forward as a need for a review at Cabinet level in this country of the current security position in the region in the wake of the various reforms in the Soviet Union under the banner of perestroika, the Minister has pointed out that the Government will not be accepting this particular recommendation and points out that there is a classified document in the hands of the Government entitled Australia's Strategic Planning in the 1990s which assesses the current security position in this country in regard to the various changes that have been occurring in the region. Of course, as a backbencher, I am in no position to comment on that particular document. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that on page 9 of the Minister's response he points out that, in both the current and prospective circumstances, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not a direct military threat to Australia. That is a very significant point. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of trade, for example, the Committee recommended the extension of extra trade credits to the Soviet Union to allow it to trade its way through its present difficult economic circumstances and to enable it to finance the further importation of Australian products, mainly commodities. The Minister has said that the Government intends to proceed cautiously on this particular recommendation. It will not extend further trade credits to the Soviet Union at this stage but, rather, it wishes to monitor the current performance of the Soviet Union, particularly the present existing credit facility of $525m, mainly for wool and wheat purchases. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly, the Minister has pointed out that the Government wishes to monitor the capacity of the Soviet Union to pay for the commodities it has purchased from Australia. The Committee also put forward the view that not only should we examine extra trade credits with the central Government in the Soviet Union but also we should open up the question of trade credits to the various constituent republics of the Soviet Union. The Minister suggested that Australia monitor the capacity of those countries to pay before extending credits to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 10 in the report is about the teaching of Russian studies and Russian languages in Australian universities and other tertiary institutions. The Committee identified that the resources available for teaching Russian languages were in decline in our universities despite the momentous changes occurring in the Soviet Union and that country's apparent willingness to play a more constructive role in the world. Our ability to study the Soviet Union and the implications of its changes in policies were perhaps being constrained by a definite decline in the availability of resources at the tertiary education level. The Committee called on the Government to look at measures to halt the decline in resources and preferably to reverse that decline if possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that on page 39 of the Minister's response he puts forward the Government's view that it will seek to encourage universities to maintain resources and, subject to demand, if possible expand resources to Russian studies units in Australian universities as well as resources for the study of other languages in the USSR apart from Russian. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 12 put forward by the Committee in its report brought down last December was that there should be a specific business management and economic training scheme for people working in the embryonic business and commercial sectors in the Soviet Union. The Committee pointed out that there is currently in existence a scheme called the Australian program for training in eastern Europe (APTEE). We said that it could be worth while, given the momentous changes in the Soviet Union and given that that country has been without an entrepreneurial class for over 70 years now, whereas eastern Europe already has a scheme and has not had an entrepreneurial class for some 40 years. So there is quite a difference in the time during which the Soviet Union has lacked economic managers and planners in a Western sense compared with that lack in the eastern European countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to recommendation 12, the Minister endorses the need for Australia to supply technical economic assistance to the Soviet Union. Presumably that would include the Government looking at Australia's ability to provide some management training for those in the economic and commercial sectors in the Soviet Union. The Minister is now considering extending a scheme such as APTEE to the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> With those remarks, on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I note the Minister's response. I shall pore over the specifics of the Government's response to this important report. I shall look at the details as to how we can implement some of the proposals in the future. I commend both the report and the Minister's response to the Senate as being very useful in continuing the debate on what is happening in the Soviet Union, on the internal dynamics of that country and, most importantly, what that means for the Pacific rim of that country. That area, of course, was the focus of our terms of reference-Siberia and the Soviet Far East. The debate has also been very worthwhile on the implications of the changes in the Soviet Union for Australia's security in this region and the implications for Australian trade with Siberia and the Soviet Far East. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Deputy Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and reflecting the views of Opposition senators, I welcome the Government's response tabled today on the Committee's report entitled Perestroika: Implications for Australia-USSR Relations. That report gained the unanimous support of eight members of this chamber: four from the Government, three from the Liberal Party on behalf of the Opposition and one from the Australian Democrats. It is a three-party report based upon many submissions and the Committee's discussion and evaluation of all the submissions we have had. It is a unanimous report. It is forward looking and it could never be described as conservative. It is cautious but it delivered 16 recommendations to the Australian Government, urging specific actions that would, we believe, enhance Australia's opportunities in relation to the post- perestroika Soviet Union and in matters of very great importance to this nation-assessments of the security interests of Australia in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Specifically, the Committee addressed two terms of reference: first, the implications of perestroika policies, restructuring policies-the reforms over recent years in the Soviet Union and the implications of these changes for Australia's strategic relationships in the Asia-Pacific region; and, secondly, the implications for expanded opportunities for Australian trade with the Soviet Union, particularly the Soviet Far East and Siberia. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have the same swelling optimism as the Committee Chairman, Senator Maguire-a Government member-in welcoming entirely the response of his own Government to this report. I know the Chairman has just chided the Government on a few matters, on which we urged action whereas the Government is only going part of the way. However, there is an aspect of the Government's response to the report, not so much of complacency but of not having the same sense urgency, the same alertness, to take up opportunities that the Committee has spelled out in the report and in our recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response is somewhat defensive. It is saying, `We welcome the Committee's report and we are doing most of that anyway'. I do not see it so much as complacency as what I would call `bureaucratspeak'; that is, that a hardworking Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and even a hardworking Minister, will profess that they have something to learn from a Senate committee but not a huge amount, and that they are already doing a great deal.</PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that the Department is increasingly alert but we have made direct criticisms of both the Department's and the Government's record: for example, on information flow; the failure to announce new dialogue with the Soviet Union on security matters in the Asia-Pacific region; and the lack of demonstration that the agreements signed when Prime Minister Ryzhkov was in Australia are actually achieving some tangible results. We could go on. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Maguire referred to the need to review the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Strategic Export Controls arrangements, which are effectively trade restrictions, shared by a number of allied countries and affecting the Soviet Union-that is, restrictions about some of our technical knowledge not being as readily passed to non-COCOM countries as they are to our immediate allies and friends. We are asking for that to be reviewed in order to ease the restrictions but, of course, none of us want to see any weakening of the genuine security interests of Australia or of our allies. The Government's response to that is, `We will be proceeding cautiously'. </PARA>
<PARA> A COCOM meeting was held in February of this year and there is to be another meeting next month, in May. The Government may profess at that time that they are reviewing COCOM, but the words we have in the Government's response here today do not live up to the kind of urgency that the Senate Committee expressed. I notice that recommendations eight, nine, 10, 11 and 14 are largely agreed; that is about half of the 16 recommendations. But there are seven or eight recommendations where the Government does not so much disagree but says either `We are doing it already to the extent we think is appropriate' or `Caution is the order of the day. We note the light on the hill that the Senate Committee has put for these couple of years but we will proceed to it in our own judgment'. I am therefore not prepared to give a glowing congratulation to the Government for this report. I would rather ask the Minister, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-and, to some extent, the Department of Defence in regard to some of the security matters-to think again and give some edge to their professed acceptance of the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of the recommendations of our inquiry actually address 1991. They address the enormous change presently going on, although we are now going through a period of chaos before we settle down, we hope, to steady progress in economic development and a successful transition to the post-perestroika Soviet Union. There is an opportunity for Australia to take up the 16 recommendations of the Committee with much more urgency than the Government has shown in its response today and to address, with the same urgency that the Committee has set out, the opportunities that we believe will help in the relationship between Australia and the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two matters that I wish to refer to. Our first recommendation is referred to on page 9 of the response where the Government states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not believe, however, that it is appropriate at this point to engage in a strategic review by Cabinet as recommended by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>That is typical of the response of the Government to our recommendations to which we have got an expression of welcome but not a profession of action. I ask the Government to think that through again. We do not want to see the Cabinet address only the relationship between Australia and the Soviet Union. We are saying there have been such changes, which I am sure the Department is up to date with, affecting the Asia-Pacific region that in these months of 1991 there ought to be a review introduced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade addressing that region, which includes the findings of this Senate committee report and the reassessment of Australia's relations with the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Do not let us be so conservative that we miss opportunities. Do not let us be so slow to act that we do not help achieve goals for Australia's benefit and, indeed, for what we would assess to be the Soviet Union's benefit. For example, the Government response echoes our descriptions of the emergence of embryonic democratic institutions in the country. It also echoes the Committee's highlighting of both the disarmament achievements in the Soviet Union and the complete revolution in its foreign policy-as we have seen demonstrated in the release of eastern Europe and the flourishing of democracy in so many States there, however difficult the transition may also be for them. There have been massive changes which ought to be taken into account in a review by Cabinet-not just by the Minister-so that all departments of government are working to a 1991 strategic assessment of Australia's relationship with the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Our final recommendation is about food aid. We did not say that it should be a hand-out; we said that it should be by extended credit to ensure the existence of food and consumer goods to meet the present desperate needs of the Soviet Union. The Northern Hemisphere is just emerging from its winter-the Soviet Union's great discontent over many decades now. The transition from the central socialist economy to a market oriented economy was disruptive and heading for chaos. Grave concerns were expressed that there would be a desperate shortage of food and that this would put in jeopardy the moves to democracy that we had welcomed. So the Committee wants to ensure that the Cabinet addresses the opportunities that exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area to which I want to refer to is also contained within the introductory pages on page 10. The Minister and the Department have set up something of an Aunt Sally by referring to an institution for regional security in the Asia- Pacific region. That was never mentioned in the Committee report. We did not call for an institution to be set up; we called for dialogue. Let the Senate bear that in mind when I read this paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>The development of any sort of comprehensive regional security institution is not a goal of our policy. It is too early to say what role such an institution might play, or what form it might take. We therefore believe that our efforts should be directed to developing and expanding the region's network of bilateral and multilateral security dialogues. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to the Minister and to the Government: it is dialogue that we call for, not an institution. To demonstrate this point, I refer to the relevant words in the first three or four recommendations of the Committee. Recommendation two on page 94 of the Committee report contains these words:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that, at the same time the Australian Government should continue to press for the establishment of regular processes of multilateral dialogue on security issues for the whole region. </PARA>
<PARA>In recommendation 3 we note that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is no comprehensive multi-lateral discussion of arms control in the region similar to that which has occurred in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA>We want to see that discussion involving the Soviet Union in the Asia-Pacific region, not only in Europe. In recommendation 4 we talk about the risk of nuclear proliferation. Two areas are specifically highlighted-North Korea and Taiwan. We want to guard against that so we ask in the context of these pages that there be a review to see what initiatives Australia could support in order to inhibit, and indeed prevent, the acquisition of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula or in Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no call for an institution. This Aunt Sally is referred to because the Minister last year was calling for an institution and he has been caught out. He has been directly criticised for that proposal by the Opposition. Last week, Senator Hill, on behalf of the Opposition, again specifically chided the Minister for wanting to develop a conference on security and cooperation in Asia, a so-called CSCA, that the Minister had proposed last year, to parallel a quite successful new development in Europe called the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, or CSCE. It was the Minister's initiative that there be such an institution. Happily last week the Minister responded to the Opposition's chidings and is now talking about dialogue. We have been saying to him for six months that he should be promoting dialogue about security and cooperation in this region and not setting up some new institution like the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation or anything that involves bricks and mortar. We do see a regular process that can have more concrete expression in economic matters-that is Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation-but we want to see a dialogue in this region. </PARA>
<PARA> To cap it all off, last week a direct letter was sent from the Secretary of State in the United States to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade agreeing with the criticism of this Opposition, which said that the United States did not support any CSCA that would be in any way like the CSCE. He pointed out that the Asia-Pacific region had unique characteristics that were not in any direct parallel with the situation in Europe. I am very happy to see that in this Government response the Minister has adopted the position that is set out in the paragraph I read at page 10, but it is his own Aunt Sally that he is answering and not the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by coming back to the very first paragraph of the Committee report. It is expressed in dramatic terms because not only the Government but also many institutions in Australia-businesses and academics-should come to terms with the post-1989 Soviet Union. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The `Marxist-Leninist' political system in the USSR, a system of all-embracing political and economic dictatorship involving severe repression and cruelty, has now been acknowledged by the Soviet leadership as an historic failure. . . . The failure is historic in two senses. First, the allegedly utopian economic system, held up for seventy years as the only salvation for humanity and forced on many nations, has now surrendered or lost the world-wide potency that once threatened many countries with subversion or war. Second, the social system that produced dramatic advances in economic potential within the USSR in the 1930s destroyed many of the country's finest people and has proven ultimately to have directed the Soviet economy and culture into a dead end street. </PARA>
<PARA>When we fully grasp that the Soviet Union has rejected so much of its post-1917 past in these recent years-the years that we are describing with the concept of perestroika-we have to take stock in Australia and be prepared to face a new reality. Firstly, we have to ask what Australia's advantage will be in terms of the new opportunities from that much more approachable Soviet Union, particularly in the years ahead and not in the present transitional chaos. Secondly, given the enormous changes in foreign policy in the Soviet Union to make it a more normal nation-the breakdown of the last imperialist in the world-we must reassess strategic matters that affect Australia and this region. Finally, taking the evaluation of these changes into account requires more than just the Government welcoming the Committee's inquiry and appearing to go along with half the recommendations while making more noises about some of the others. There needs to be more urgency and action and a more direct positive response to the very considered recommendations that the Senate Committee has brought forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to include the Australian Democrats in the response to the response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) on this report. I was only a very new member of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade when we started writing up the report, Perestroika: Implications for Australia-USSR Relations, so I did not have much to do with the first part of its formation. Nevertheless, I found it quite fascinating. One of the most interesting points is reflected in the Minister's response when he says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . these recommendations must be considered in the light of changes that have taken place in the USSR since the Committee delivered its findings, which have raised concerns about the direction of the Soviet reform process. </PARA>
<PARA>The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) certainly has changed an awful lot since we got that report together. It is also interesting that, in his response, the Minister mentions that the resignation of Eduard Shevardnadze occurred on the same day that the report was tabled. We thought that was quite appropriate. Events were occurring at an enormous speed at that stage. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TW4">Senator BOURNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps not appropriate. Even though I have only been a member of that Committee since August last year, I found its area of inquiry to be of tremendous interest. The discussions I was part of were very constructive, given those developments which have taken place in the Soviet Union over recent years. Clearly the Committee's terms of reference were drawn up at a time of enormous historic change in the Soviet Union and this made participation in those deliberations all the more fascinating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over a short period of only a few years perestroika, which began as an attempt to make socialism more efficient and more humane, has become an attempt to change the Soviet Union into a multi-party democracy and into a free market economy. It is obvious that enormous risks are involved in such a process of transforming it into a liberal democratic society. It was also apparent that there are strong implications for Australia-Soviet relations in that the relationship between our two countries would be affected by the process of perestroika. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the submissions received by the Committee in the original report suggested that the transformation process of perestroika in the Soviet Union has been so vast that virtually no part of international relations has been left unaffected by that change. Most of all, it was quite apparent to the Committee that today the Soviet Union is facing problems of enormous magnitude. I think that is also quite apparent to the Minister in what I have read of his response. We found that these were not just of an economic nature but also that there were ethnic and cultural problems. </PARA>
<PARA> As to human rights-immediately post-perestroika hundreds of prisoners of conscience were released and detention for political crimes was made more open and was cut down quite considerably. Capital punishment is now an item on the agenda. A list of the number of executions carried out in the USSR has just been published. This is the first time that has happened. That is a step in the right direction although that list is very long and the number of executions has to be cut down. </PARA>
<PARA> The excessive use of force in protest movements is a real problem. In particular, it must be accepted by the USSR that the goodwill of the Western world will depend on such things as whether the political situation in the Baltic republics improves. A repetition of events, such as the vicious crack down in Lithuania, will clearly do enormous damage to East-West relations and attempts to improve those relations. A continuation of existing Soviet policy, which involves the repression of the wishes of the Baltic peoples and of their human rights, will need to be taken into account when the Western world is addressing ways of increasing economic assistance or aid to the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the Baltics. Earlier this year the Ukrainian people's deputy, Levko Lukianenko, visited Australia. Along with several other Federal and State members of parliament, I met him. On 4 April, I received a press release which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>On March 26, the Presidium of the Communist-dominated Ukrainian SSR Supreme Soviet voted in favour of suspending the immunity from criminal proceedings of several national-democratic opposition people's deputies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Among the MP's now threatened are top Ukrainian Republican Party leaders, Levko Lukianenko and Oles Shevchenko, both of whom participated in an ``unsanctioned'' Kiev public demonstration in defence of Ukraine's new political prisoners on February 9. </PARA>
<PARA>When I met Levko Lukianenko he did predict that this could happen to him. He was quite willing to go back to the USSR and to take his chances. I hope that it does not happen. I do not believe it has happened yet. This is an opportunity to urge the USSR not to take such drastic measures when it is trying to stop people talking about change and reform and improving life in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not had an awful lot of time to look at this report so I have not gone through a great deal of the things that the Minister has said. As a member of the Committee, I would like to put on record my appreciation and my thanks to those involved in producing the original report and, in particular, Senator Maguire, who is a very good and reasonable Chairman; Senator Teague, who is a most thoughtful and sensible Deputy Chairman; and Ilze Svenne, the current Committee Secretary, who joined the Committee at about the time when I did. I have found her to be a very sensible, very good and very reasonable person and I am sure she will do as good a job on future reports as she has done on this one. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I have chosen to speak on the Report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody relating to the deaths of Perry Daniel Noble, Richard Frank Hyde and David Mark Koowootha because it deals with an area in the State that I represent. These three deaths occurred at Yarrabah. Yarrabah is an Aboriginal community near Cairns in north Queensland. It grew out of an Anglican mission founded in 1882. Missionary rule there was all pervasive and succeeded in bringing about the demise of traditional cultural practices and the institutionalisation of the population at an early stage. The State facilitated the process and reinforced it upon assuming control of Yarrabah in 1960. </PARA>
<PARA> Yarrabah was rocked by events in late 1986 and early 1987 which brought home the extent of the challenge of bringing together the diverse peoples that had been concentrated in Yarrabah. Three men, two of them barely adults, hanged themselves within 10 weeks of each other while incarcerated alone in the cells of the dilapidated Yarrabah watch-house. All of them had been locked up on account of drunkenness and disruptive behaviour, two at the behest of family members. Each had his life tragically cut short in a moment of crisis when, left alone with his anguish and feelings of rejection, he was driven to a desperate expression of pain. The report concludes that whether any of these men ultimately intended to bring about his death is a judgment that is impossible to make. </PARA>
<PARA> The first man, Perry Daniel Noble, aged 20, was arrested by Aboriginal police on 4 December 1986 for being drunk and creating a disturbance at the Yarrabah Aboriginal court. Noble would not have been imprisoned that day had he not contested one of the charges against him in a loud and forceful manner. At the watch-house Noble was isolated from other prisoners in the depressing environment of a small concrete cell furnished with a toilet pedestal, mattress and bedding. After the police left, and within the hearing of other prisoners, he threatened to hang himself but his threats were taken lightly. He then asked for a sheet so that he could sleep, and an hour later was discovered hanging by this sheet on the bars of his cell window. As a result of the unavailability of watch-house keys to unlock his cell, there was as delay of about five minutes before he was rescued. </PARA>
<PARA> Two weeks later, 42 year-old Richard Frank Hyde, known as Charlie, became involved in an argument at his mother's house, while intoxicated with methylated spirits, after a night of heavy drinking. His mother hailed a passing police patrol and Hyde was arrested by Aboriginal police at her request. He was driven to the watch-house and locked alone in a cell. Less than half an hour later, another prisoner saw him hanging by a vinyl mattress cover tied to a bar of the cell window. No police were present at either the watch-house or the police station opposite who could be alerted. </PARA>
<PARA> The report points out there had been no attempt to remedy the problem of exposed cell window bars following the first death, that of Perry Noble. Action was finally taken after Charlie Hyde lost his life, and wire mesh screens were erected over each window in the three cells. However, poor workmanship rendered at least one of these screens ineffective and resulted in the death of the third Aboriginal man. Each of the deaths raises serious questions regarding the adequacy of custodial facilities and practices during this period. The absence of appropriate management strategies for drunken prisoners, including the lack of a system for watch-house surveillance, is highlighted. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also addresses the matters of major social changes at Yarrabah and the need for caution in drawing conclusions about the concept of suicide in respect of these three cases. It also points out that the possible significance of Aboriginal notions of collective responsibility over individual autonomy in explaining these events and their actions is not quantifiable, nor is the potential spiritual dimension to these events. I think that this is an excellent report and I particularly commend its final paragraph which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The legacy of one and a half centuries of enforced submissiveness, dependence and de-valued identity is not easily redressed. However, Yarrabah is a strong community and, with time and resources, very capable of managing its own affairs so as to be in a position to address some of the issues highlighted by these tragic deaths. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I speak to this report from an electorate perspective. As a senator for the Northern Territory, I am very pleased to note that the Commonwealth Grants Commission, as has always been the case in respect of its reports that address the various relativities between the States and Territories, can be relied upon for its professionalism and for the extreme care and diligence that it has always taken in putting together these reports. </PARA>
<PARA> From the perspective of the Northern Territory, I note that the large and widening disabilities that are faced by the Northern Territory are again acknowledged in the report. The report, which consists of two volumes, is very comprehensive and the tables, annexes and additional evidence that have been put forward cover many factors. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Northern Territory, the factors of distance, remoteness, transport and the special needs of Aboriginal people are properly acknowledged and given due weight in respect of relativities. The challenge extended by this report will be addressed in May by the Premiers at the Special Premiers Conference which is reviewing so many areas to do with Commonwealth and State functions. </PARA>
<PARA> We must recognise that areas such as the Northern Territory, north-west Western Australia and north Queensland are still exposed to macro-economic policies of the Commonwealth which impact on them in a way which is not reflected in the more populous States and the more closely populated urban areas in other parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is important that the Commonwealth Grants Commission recognises very carefully all of these issues and disabilities. I am very well aware that Commonwealth funding to the Northern Territory has fallen by some 25 per cent since 1984-85 compared with a fall in the six States of the order of some 14 per cent. This has had a dramatic impact on the lifestyle and the funding of support facilities in remote and rural parts of the Northern Territory in particular. I hope that the Budget for next financial year will redress that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also well aware that the Commonwealth Grants Commission has recently carried out another inquiry in which it addressed the issues that affect local government with regard to the equalisation factors that have not been available in measuring disabilities or defining for equalisation purposes Budget allocations for local government. It is going to be very interesting to note the responses at the Premiers Conference and particularly the pressures that will build up at that Premiers Conference from the larger States of New South Wales and Victoria as opposed to the many shires of the regional parts of Australia which rely very heavily on their local government grants. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be important for the Government to pick up the proposals put forward by the Commonwealth Grants Commission for the basis of fiscal equalisation, particularly for local government. In recent years, the remote and rural parts of Australia have come to rely very heavily on the work of the shires and local governments and, in the Northern Territory, many of the Aboriginal community government schemes. I would certainly hope that we will see an acceptance by government and by the Premiers Conference of the necessary changes that need to be made in this regard. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>As honourable senators are aware, the Committee currently has before it a wide-ranging inquiry into the cost of legal services and litigation in Australia today. The inquiry has become known as the inquiry into the cost of justice. Since the matter was referred to the Committee, the Committee has received more than 200 submissions and almost as many expressions of interest and concern, and has conducted a series of public hearings and private meetings in most of the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist it to formulate its final recommendations, the Committee has decided to publish a series of discussion papers, each of which will deal with a particular aspect of the inquiry. The first two of these-Cost of Legal Services and Litigation: Introduction to the Issues, which is discussion paper No. 1, and Lawyers' Fees, which is discussion paper No. 2-I have tabled today for the information of honourable senators. These papers do not set out the final views of the Committee. They have been prepared to raise issues and to elicit more detail where that is required. They also highlight those aspects on which the Committee needs evidence. All information received in response to the papers will, of course, be taken into account when the Committee comes to make its recommendations for reform in this very important area. </PARA>
<PARA> The response so far experienced by the Committee in conducting this inquiry has been overwhelming. Clearly, the terms of reference have identified areas of great concern to many in our community. The Committee hopes that these discussion papers and those which follow will help focus further contributions to the debate and, in so doing, will help it draw up recommendations which address the concerns that have been put to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill gives effect to a government decision announced last August to introduce a new superannuation scheme for Australia's regular Defence Force personnel. The Scheme, to be known as the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS), is intended to take effect from 1 October 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>The scheme was recommended in the report of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme Review Committee under the chairmanship of Sir William Cole, a former Secretary to the Department of Defence. The report was tabled in the Senate last year.</PARA>
<PARA>The MSBS has been designed to comply with the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987, which sets out the government's guidelines on the structure and operations of superannuation funds. The scheme also finalises arrangements for the treatment of the three per cent productivity benefit, which has been paid in respect of members of the Defence Force since 1988.</PARA>

<PARA> An important feature of the MSBS is that it provides equitable treatment for members of the Defence Force who serve for less than 20 years. Under the present Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) Scheme, these members receive only a refund of their contributions when they leave the Defence Force. They receive no interest on their contributions and no employer benefit except the three per cent productivity benefit. This is contrary to community standards. Under the MSBS, members will have returned to them not just their contributions but also whatever these contributions earn in the MSBS investment fund, and will accrue an entitlement to a substantial employer benefit in addition to the three per cent benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> The MSBS will have the following features:</PARA>
<PARA> a. Contributions at a rate elected by the member, in the range of 5 to 10 per cent of salary. Contributions will be invested in a fund and returned to members with earnings when they leave the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA> b. An employer benefit which will provide a full range of options, that is, lump sum payments, pensions calculated at a rate more generous than that available in the commercial annuities market, or a combination of both. The three per cent productivity benefit will be part of this. The total employer benefit must be preserved until age 55 or later retirement from the Defence Force except in special cases.</PARA>
<PARA> c. Invalidity benefits for those members retired from the Defence Force on medical grounds with a disability which appreciably affects the person's civil employment.</PARA>
<PARA> d. Reversionary benefits for spouses and children of deceased members or deceased pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA> e. An appeals system for persons dissatisfied with decisions of the Board of Trustees or its delegates.</PARA>
<PARA> The occupational superannuation standards prevent the inclusion in the MSBS of the benefits structure of the DFRDB Scheme which allows members to receive a life-indexed pension, part of which can be commuted to a lump sum, on resignation at any age provided they have served for 20 years. The existence of this benefit has encouraged many members to serve to the 20-year point who might otherwise have resigned earlier. Its necessary omission from the MSBS, combined with the availability of a lump sum refund of members' contributions, with earnings, on resignation will lessen the incentive for members to serve to the 20-year point and thus has the potential to increase the premature loss of personnel.</PARA>
<PARA> To offset this, the Bill provides a retention benefit payable to certain members who complete 15 years continuous full time service and undertake to serve for another 5 years. The benefit is equal to one year's salary and is taxable as income. Conditions attaching to payment of the benefit are set out in the Bill. The benefit will be administered by the Department of Defence, not by the trustees of the MSBS.</PARA>
<PARA> Persons joining the regular Defence Force on or after 1 October 1991 will automatically join the MSBS. Members who are contributors to the DFRDB scheme on that date will have the option of remaining in that scheme or joining the MSBS. Membership of the MSBS will also be available to reservists who render continuous full time service for periods of or exceeding 3 months, and to reservists who render continuous full time service for less than 3 months with a unit of the Defence Force allotted for duty in an operational area.</PARA>
<PARA> Members will have until the end of September 1992 to decide whether to join the MSBS unless they retire or resign earlier, in which case an earlier decision will have to be made. Each member will be provided with the information necessary to enable him or her to make a considered choice and individual counselling will be available.</PARA>
<PARA>Permanent part-time service</PARA>
<PARA> The report of the review committee included a proposal for inclusion in the new scheme of provisions which would be appropriate for permanent part-time service if this were to be introduced for the regular Defence Force. However, the present legislation governing the rendering of service by members of the Defence Force makes no provision for the rendering of permanent part-time service and, until it does, it would not be appropriate to make provision in MSBS. If permanent part-time service is introduced changes will be required to a number of Acts and the necessary changes to MSBS would be included.</PARA>
<PARA>FINANCIAL IMPACT</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of MSBS has a number of financial impacts resulting from:</PARA>
<PARA> a. The funding of MSBS member contributions.</PARA>
<PARA> b. The funding of the 3 per cent productivity benefit for MSBS members.</PARA>
<PARA> c. The provision of a retention benefit to members of the requisite rank who have completed 15 years service.</PARA>
<PARA> d. The credit of notional interest to the DFRDB contributions of members transferring to the MSBS.</PARA>
<PARA> e. Increased administrative costs during the MSBS implementation period including the provision of advice to members on their transfer options.</PARA>
<PARA> f. The change in the form of the primary superannuation benefit from a pension in the DFRDB scheme to a lump sum in the MSBS.</PARA>
<PARA> g. The deferral of payment of the MSBS employer-financed superannuation benefit until members reach 55 years of age in the majority of cases.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be recognised that these costings are dependent on assumptions made about future behaviour and circumstances (such as transfer rates, commutation decisions and CPI increases), many of which cannot be tested against actual experience for many years.</PARA>
<PARA>Short and medium term impacts</PARA>
<PARA> There are bring-forward costs associated with the introduction of MSBS in the short and medium terms. These will result mainly from the funding of member contributions and the 3 per cent productivity benefit in MSBS, the provision of the retention benefit, and the transfer provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The estimated net impact of the introduction of MSBS on annual budgetary outlays for Defence Force superannuation is expected to be $151m, rising during the transitional period to $209 for 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA> Budgetary savings are expected to commence in about 35 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Longer term impacts-current Defence Force membership</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government Actuary and the consulting actuaries (TFP&amp;) have forecast that the expected net long-term employer costs, after tax and social security clawbacks, for current members who join MSBS will be less than the projected net long-term employer costs of the DFRDB scheme for these members if they remained in that scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>Net employer liabilities for current Defence Force membership</PARA>
<PARA> The estimated net reduction in costs of superannuation for the past and future service of current members of the Defence Force is $690m.</PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill was under consideration by the Senate prior to the suspension of the sitting for lunch today. At that point, I was highlighting the fact that a number of implications, particularly in regard to the increased levies that have been required to be imposed on the Ranger uranium mine in the Northern Territory, were exclusive. I had developed a number of points with regard to that argument. Also, I had expounded the view that I was disturbed at the paucity of contribution to this debate by members of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was not one Australian Labor Party speaker on the speakers list with regard to this important consideration of uranium policy at this time. As I said earlier, I give credit to Senator Coulter and Senator Vallentine who, while they hold diametrically opposite views to my own on this matter, did have the courage to come in here and put their views. I think it ill behoves Labor Party senators in this place, who are not only gutless but also spineless, and are totally devoid of any capacity to make a contribution on such an important policy issue that is listed on the agenda of the Labor Party's convention this year. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw them. We need to be aware that Ranger's operations have, at all times, been clean and straightforward. The strong record of the Northern Territory's Department of Mines and Energy in administering procedures and safeguards has also been well documented. The same cannot be said of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. Section 28 of the November 1988 report of the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled, The potential of the Kakadu National Park Region, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Quite apart from the complexity of the regulatory framework and problems of liaison with Ranger, other criticisms have been made of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. Ranger, for example, stated that `duplication of responsibilities, personnel and reports flowing to and from a Sydney office have inevitably resulted in gross inefficiencies'. The Committee is aware that the division of the Office of the Supervising Scientist responsibilities between Sydney and the Northern Territory is a cause of concern to several groups. These concerns relate not just to the possible duplication of effort, but also to the fact that decision making is located away from the mining operations themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee went on to recommend that the Government urgently consider locating all operations of the Office of the Supervising Scientist in the Northern Territory. I would like to point out that the administration and decision makers within the Office of the Supervising Scientist are still located at Bondi, Sydney, even though a parliamentary committee; an independent consultant, Professor Geoff Taylor; the Northern Territory Government; and Ranger Uranium have very important bearings on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The report by Professor Taylor had 47 recommendations before it. Of course, the Government has chosen to ignore them because of the implications of publicly addressing that report on the review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, and the implications that it has on its own hidden agenda-secret agenda-with regard to uranium policies that have to be determined this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that media reports of Labor's uranium policy review mention two options. Laurie Oakes's article in the Bulletin dated 16 April 1991 states:</PARA>
<PARA>One is a ``phasing out'' policy, under which no new mines and no new contracts would be permitted, resulting in the industry winding down over a 15-year period if Labor remained in office. The second option, ``conditioned and controlled mining'', would allow the development of new uranium projects as long as they complied with stringent conditions covering the interests of Aboriginal communities, the health of workers, protection of the local environment, economic viability of existing projects and, of course, nuclear non-proliferation and safeguard requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>I certainly hope that the Uranium Policy Review Committee will have success in reviewing the current discriminatory three-mine uranium policy at the Labor Party National Conference in Hobart in June this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins has taken a very strong public stance on this particular issue and, as a colleague of mine from the Northern Territory, I welcome the public view that he has expressed with regard to the necessity to change this particular policy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is well known that Senator Bolkus shares factional allegiances with the Federal member for the Northern Territory, Mr Warren Snowdon, in that they have, certainly from the viewpoint of the left faction of the Labor Party, taken a strong position to any change to the present three-mine uranium policy. Therefore, his sensitivity on this issue should be well recognised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similarly, I am concerned that the Australian Democrats have, of course, reflected a philosophy with regard to the changing of the uranium policy that can only properly be described as a doomsday type of philosophy. Similarly, they develop policies which can only be compared to an ostrich, with its head constantly in the sand and certainly no recognition of where we are going. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to note a press release earlier this week by my Leader, the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, who made it very clear that he saw the only impediment to the uranium decision as being Mr Hawke. The incapacity of the Hawke Government to tackle the issues at the heart of Australia's uncompetitiveness has been very well documented, particularly with regard to this uranium saga. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that we are left with nonsensical and restrictive policies, is the only way to define or describe the three-mines policy at the moment. It is a pity that in a time of economic consequences for all of Australia, the Labor Party continually denies and disallows any major change in these particular areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Uranium is now clearly established as a world resource for the generation of electricity. I was pleased to note the comments earlier today from Senator Parer in this regard. He adequately conveyed the point that the present ALP uranium policy has absolutely no influence on the use of uranium resources in the world. Of course, the Australian Government, over a number of years, has developed very good guidelines in so many areas-whether they are to do with our international obligations and treaties in this area, our localised requirements for the protection of the environment, or looking after the interests of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The present restriction on the number of mines should be removed. It is interesting to note that a recent report of the Industry Commission also commented on the unsuitability of the present three-mine policy when it said that the three-mine policy, and any price controls, should be abandoned so that there is no restriction on the number of uranium mines in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed increased duty raised an additional $0.222m during 1989-90 and is expected to raise an additional $0.932m over the full 1990-91 financial year. In the 1989-90 financial year the levy raised $4.007m. Between July and February of the 1990-1991 financial year, $6.146m has been raised by the levy. Based on current projected exports it is expected that a further $1.066m will be raised during the March to June period, giving an estimated total amount to be raised during the 1990-91 financial year of $7.212m. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1991 impose a discriminatory additional levy on the principal operator of a uranium mine in the Northern Territory. This is imposed at a time when Australia's uranium exporters are struggling to remain competitive in the international marketplace, which does not suffer the same burdens. Senator Parer has indicated that the coalition will present an amendment in this regard, and I understand that Senator Crichton-Browne will also be addressing that issue. I certainly support their views at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, it concerns me that the issues relating to the Taylor report on the Office of the Supervising Scientist were inadequately addressed in the Minister's second reading speech. There was only cursory comment with regard to the fact that Professor Taylor had conducted a review and that the 47 recommendations of that review had not been picked up. We are now seeing a financial impost without regard to the true facts. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly challenge the Labor Party to look to the future, to determine a policy that scraps the three-mine uranium policy and gets on with restoring the Australian economy, not only to commonsense but also to a position that will guarantee a sound future and jobs for Australians. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(6.31)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1991 amends the original Act in order to increase the duty on exported uranium concentrate mined in the Alligator River region of the Northern Territory from $115 a kilogram to $130 a kilogram. The duty will continue to be used solely to finance the various operations of the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS), established by the Fraser Government in 1980 to monitor uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 2 of the Bill provides that the Bill is to be taken to have commenced on 21 February 1990-over a year ago. The increase raises an additional $220,000 in the year 1989-90 and is estimated to raise an additional $920,000 this financial year. The estimated total duty to be raised from the duty in the current financial year is $7,200,000-odd dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Ranger mine is the only mine still operating in the region, this change effectively means that the mining company Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) will pay another 15c a kilogram in duties to the Government to finance the operations of the OSS. The OSS was established by the coalition Government for the purpose of monitoring the environmental impact of uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region to ensure protection, assessment and control, along with the provision of sound advice on the level of protection being maintained in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Office's activities include, amongst other things, tailings management, geomorphological studies to help with the necessary containing and isolation of tailings, and the development of strategies to help with the revegetation of decommissioned mine sites. The OSS is also involved in making sure that radiation exposure of workers and the public is kept to a minimum. The OSS spent $7.3m in 1989-90, up 11 per cent on the previous year, but much of that increase was due to the construction of an environmental radioactivity laboratory at the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute. </PARA>
<PARA> As the proposed changes to the export duty will raise over $7.2m, the OSS should become almost entirely independent of the need for government funding for the time being. I am sure that honourable senators on both sides of the chamber agree that the Kakadu National Park area is worthy of the utmost attention to ensure that the environment is not damaged to any significant degree by mining operations, and to that end I am sure that the OSS will continue to receive bipartisan support for the work it carries out in respect of the Alligator Rivers region. We on this side of the chamber are concerned that, while ERA is being forced to foot the entire bill of the Office, much of the research being undertaken by the Office is not directly relevant to the operations of the Ranger mine. As my colleague the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) noted last week in the other place, this is not to say that the work being done is completely irrelevant, only that a strong case exists that ERA should not be responsible for financing all of it. This is something which we think the Government should take a good look at with a view to making it more truly a user-pays system. Until it does, export duty will continue to add something like 5 per cent to ERA's production costs at the Ranger mine, thereby having an inevitable impact upon the company's competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> The original duty as introduced by the coalition was not intended to have such an impact, and there is one simple reason why it has that impact today. That reason is the Australian Labor Party's three-mine policy. We will be moving an amendment calling upon the Government to review its uranium policy with a view to removing the existing policy, an amendment which we would certainly hope that the Australian Democrats would support and one which we should be confident that many members of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) will support as well. Many members of the ALP have insisted that the Government amend and review its uranium policy. Our amendment will be calling upon that, so we expect support from Government senators. </PARA>
<PARA> When we introduced the system, it was envisaged that there would be several mines operating in the area to share the burden, but because of the Government's continued ridiculous three-mine policy, which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself calls illogical, Ranger at the moment has to pay all the costs itself that are associated with the Office. If other deposits in the area such as Koongarra and Jabiluka were allowed to proceed, the cost to ERA would be substantially reduced but, true to form, the Government continues without any in-flight repairs to its pie in the sky uranium policy out of fear that it might lose its left wing altogether and crash sooner than it inevitably will. </PARA>
<PARA> While the person who seems to be the de facto Prime Minister, Senator Richardson, himself concedes that a three-mine policy is a disaster, he will not change the policy to keep the amount of blood on the floor at this year's national convention to the very minimum. The last thing he wants is a uranium policy change to send the Left running off to join Senator Vallentine and Dr Brown and the new Green Party which seems to be forming in place of the party formerly known as the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The last thing the Labor Party wants is to send its left wingers over to join this other left wing party. It would probably be good for Australia if it did that because it would then leave the right wing of the ALP to join with us in liberalising the country's uranium policy, thereby ensuring a return for the exports commensurate with our vast reserves of low-cost recoverable uranium. Until that happens, the country will slide closer to official Third World status and the people of this country will continue to watch with amazement the perennial conflict and indecision which this issue causes within the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Tambling has mentioned that the ALP has chosen not to participate in this debate at all, a decision which is absolutely remarkable because of the importance of this Bill to Australia and because of the very many public statements that the ALP has made on the issue over the years and more particularly in recent weeks. One would think that, with all that public statement, the ALP would want to get up and talk about this Bill in this chamber of the Parliament of Australia, but again it has wimped out. </PARA>
<PARA> It has done the same thing that it did when we were talking about rainforest imports a few weeks ago. There was too much conflict between the Left and the Right and the Centre and the far Left wings of the ALP. It chose the easy way out-the way out that shows no courage at all and no intestinal fortitude, just by sitting mute and saying nothing. I hope that the people of Australia understand and accept that this Government is indecisive; it does not know what it is doing and it is not game to get up and say something about this very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has chopped and changed its position on uranium over the decades. I will not go through all of the various changes, but I cannot resist referring to the period from 1971 to 1975-a period when the uranium policy was something which the ALP changed almost annually. In 1971 the ALP platform urged early initiatives to build nuclear power stations. Then in 1972, upon coming into government, all new uranium contracts were stopped. Rex Connor, the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, imposed his export embargo, supposedly because of low world uranium prices. A year later, in July 1973, on the back of higher prices the ALP Federal Conference approved a strong pro-uranium policy similar to the one that had applied in 1971. By 1974 the pro-uranium policy gained momentum, but it soon became apparent that Mr Connor's embargo had more to do with government ownership of Australian uranium mining and processing than it did with world prices. As Mr Whitlam was besieged by foreign buyers, Mr Connor's embargo became an embarrassment. But, more importantly, the environmentalist rebellion was brewing within the Party and the uranium policy was turned around substantially at the February 1975 ALP National Conference. By June 1975 Mr Connor was saying that, `with adequate coal and hydro-power supplies, Australia was not prepared at present to consider its own nuclear reactors'-a complete about-face from the policy which the ALP had at the beginning of that decade. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on charting the course of indecision from which the current three-mines policy was born, but I will spare the Senate that boredom and, possibly, humour. However, suffice to say that over the years the commitments from the ALP with regard to uranium have been about as rock solid as are ambassadorial posts to Ireland at the moment; or as rock solid as the governments in Western Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. They change at any moment and are as wobbly as they can be. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than things getting better, things have become even worse as uranium has once again found its way onto the agenda. Internal ALP chaos and public outbursts are worse than ever, especially if one happens to be a Minister. Risky stuff, you might say, Madam Acting Deputy President, when the Prime Minister has just announced publicly that he will sack the next Minister to speak publicly about matters not relating to his or her portfolio. But as the Prime Minister realised that solidarity was beyond his control, he backed right away from his threat because it soon became apparent that if he sacked every Minister speaking out on the issue of uranium who should not have been he would have a Ministry of about one. The people of Australia want to know: who speaks on behalf of the ALP and the Government when it comes to uranium?</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth mentioning some of the more notable utterances made by Ministers recently, starting with Mr Hawke who calls the three-mines policy `illogical'. Next there is the Treasurer, Mr Keating, who, being a master of sleazy politics, has used uranium as his vehicle for gaining some support from the Left of his Party in his never-ending bid to topple the Prime Minister. According to Mr Keating, there is nothing magic about the three mines, as distinct from four or five mines, so the policy should remain. So who speaks for the Government? Is it the Prime Minister, who calls it illogical, or is it his deputy, who says that it is okay for it to stay as it is?</PARA>
<PARA> Should we believe the messages coming from the bona fide Left via Mr Howe who, before retreating on the Sunday television program this week, was reported in the Age as having said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . no way could any member of the Left support a relaxation of the policy. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . no-one's going to bargain about it . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He has since cooled off and instructed his factional colleague, Mr Hand, to do the same publicly. But since the Sunday program Mr Hand has made it clear that he will not be shut up. He recently told the Brisbane Courier-Mail that he was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . outraged and disgraced at attempts by some party members to hijack the debate on uranium. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that the Left would `take it right to the wire' and warned that any moves to axe the three-mines policy could split the Party. All of this is very prophetic and we will watch with some interest to see how strong Mr Hand is and how much he backs up his comments when he says that the Left will `take it right to the wire'. We will see how far away that wire is. </PARA>
<PARA> Do we believe Messrs Howe and Hand, or maybe we should believe the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, who I think is at least speaking on a matter that is within his portfolio? He has agreed with his own Department's submission which recommended that the policy be axed. It is interesting to rehearse some of Mr Kerin's quotes. Mr Kerin is reported as having told a committee of review in a leaked letter that the existing policy did nothing to meet the concerns about the environment, health and safety, nuclear non-proliferation, Aboriginal welfare and returns to the community. He is further quoted as saying that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a policy considering all nine proposals, with strict safeguards, ``would provide a basis for maximising the benefits to all Australians from our abundant uranium resources without compromising our position on the legitimate concerns of the vast majority of party members and most Australians.''</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Kerin has said. It is rather a different statement to that of Mr Hand who said that the Left would `go to the wall' and that the Party would split. Obviously Mr Kerin does not believe in that too much. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we should believe the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins-a self-professed supporter of uranium mining in Australia. Senator Collins is a member of the uranium policy review committee and he said last week that the three-mines policy should be scrapped and that it is `self-contradictory'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there has to be a change. We're either mining uranium or we're not mining uranium. </PARA>
<PARA>Although I disagree sometimes with Senator Collins, he often has commonsense-a bump of sensibility-as he comes from the bush, and he is at least sensible when he talks about those sorts of things. He is right on track in relation to this matter: we either mine uranium or we do not. Whether we mine it from one, two, three, four or 100 mines really makes little difference. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be recalled that Senator Collins has been singing the praises of liberalising uranium mining in this country for some years. Maybe that is why Mr Hawke was so keen to take him from political obscurity in the north: to bring him down here to try to throw his weight around and get some political sense from some of his colleagues down here, who say that they will `take it to the wire' and split the Party over it. Senator Collins went to the point of issuing a research paper to his colleagues which concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>This-</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the existing three-mines policy-</PARA>
<PARA>extremely detrimental position does not appear to be offset by any conceivable advantage to Australia from either an economic or an ideological point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that the party take the next logical step, and allow Australia to develop its low-cost uranium resources in a manner consistent with both the market opportunities that do exist, and Australia's national interests. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of Senator Collins, and I agree wholeheartedly with them. We then turn to Senator Bolkus. As he comes from the loopy Left we could expect nothing less than his outrageously naive statement about axing the three-mines policy. He is on public record as having said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there are no social or economic arguments in favour of axing it. </PARA>
<PARA>Only someone of Senator Bolkus's capabilities could be so stupid as to make a statement like that. It is absolute rubbish and I am sure he has been told that by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, who is at the table, and his other colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking of the economic and social arguments in favour of the three-mine policy, we have not heard much from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Bilney, but it is worth noting that he issued a pro-uranium paper a couple of years ago in which he said that by 1992 Australia stood to gain 240,000 jobs and $5 billion if the three-mine policy were ended. I repeat that: Mr Bilney, a Minister in this Government, said that Australia stood to gain 240,000 jobs if this three-mine policy were ended. That is more than a third of the enormous number of Australians who are suffering on the unemployment queues at the moment. They could get jobs tomorrow, according to Mr Bilney, if the ALP had the courage to end its stupid three-mine policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Who speaks for the Government? Is it Senator Bolkus with his ridiculous statement about there being no economic arguments in favour of axing the policy; or is it Mr Bilney, who says that axing it would gain 240,000 jobs, more than a third of those currently employed, and give Australia $5 billion in foreign money, which we so desperately need at this time? For a quote that really sums up the Party's pathetic position, one need go no further than Senator Tate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think the points of tolerance have been reached and if the Party is to retain a wide spectrum in its embrace then I think it's important to hold these people in-even at the price of logic . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That sums up the confusion, does it not? I commend Senator Tate at least for his honesty, if not his logic, in speaking as he did. He is saying this: despite the fact that the change is logical and that Australia would be better off as a result, the ALP will not risk losing the loopy Left fringe by changing its three-mine policy. That is Senator Tate's position. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government does change its position, it is not only doomed to electoral defeat, but also to facing extinction as a party. That probably would be appropriate in the one-hundredth anniversary of the foundation of that Party, because it is not the Party it used to be; it is now a party of people from funny positions who cannot seem to understand what is best for Australia. Again I ask: who speaks for the Labor Party? Which Minister in this Government speaks for the Labor Party, or do we have to go to the back bench to get the ALP's real position?</PARA>

<PARA>In the current environment the policy is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hulls need not be concerned because there are no active mines in Queensland, but if we are to believe Senator Reynolds, Mr Goss, the Premier of Queensland, has taken an anti-uranium stand and he will make sure that there are no uranium mines in Queensland in future. Not only are the Prime Minister, Ministers and backbenchers all singing different tunes, but ALP premiers are also calling the shots when it comes to uranium. We wonder just who is speaking for the ALP and for the Government on this particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Until we find out, the ALP's snail-pace of change in its attitude to uranium within its Party will continue to keep Australia from taking the place it deserves in the world uranium market. The opportunities being missed by Australia because of the three-mine policy are enormous. Australia has some 30 per cent of the world's low cost recoverable uranium reserves and 50 per cent of reserves in the Western world; and yet we have only 10 per cent of the market. Contrast that with Canada, which has 10 per cent of the reserves and 30 per cent of the market, and it is easy to understand the current estimates that Australia is missing out on some $750m a year because of the three-mine policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the ignorant rambling from the ALP Left about demand for nuclear power being on the wane, it is worth noting that as the world turns away from fossil fuels to reduce greenhouse gases, it is estimated by the International Atomic Energy Agency that overall global demand for uranium will increase significantly over the next 10 to 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> That makes one smile at the naive `fairies at the bottom of the garden' approach that the Democrats have to this issue. I heard one of them speaking before about the causes of cancer and how dangerous uranium is. I did not hear him say that if we stopped uranium mining that would stop cancer, because it just means that Canada and all the other places that produce uranium would take more advantage if we pulled out of the market completely. It would not make one iota of difference to the consumption of uranium around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> As has often been said, Australia has a good record in its sale of uranium and in the safeguards it puts in place, but the `fairies at the bottom of the garden' Party would have us pull out of that and leave it to someone else who possibly does not have the same concern that we do that uranium is used properly. </PARA>
<PARA> The big growth areas for the use of uranium are in the Asia-Pacific region, as countries in north-east and south-east Asia turn to nuclear power for environmental reasons. Again I make passing reference to the Democrats. If they had their way, we would not be able to use uranium for power. They do not want to countenance hydro-electricity power in the Tully-Millstream area; they do not want fossil fuel power and coal mines operating; but they want to go out every night, flick the switch and get electricity. I wonder how we are meant to do that if all the reasonable, sensible and logical forms of power use are not agreed to by the Democrats. But that is typical of their `pie in the sky', `fairies at the bottom of the garden' attitude to all real policy issues in Australia at this time. We on this side of the chamber have made it quite clear that we would abolish the three-mine policy and allow for both an increase in the number of uranium mines and in mining itself. In doing so, we would treat each new proposal on its merits, taking into account before a decision is made any adverse impact on the environment. If, in any case, it were shown that dangers were to be too great, the project would not proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1991 amends the principal Act so that the duty on uranium concentrate exported from the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory is increased from $1.15 to $1.30 per kilogram. It is a significant measure-one which goes, in a sense, to the heart of the uranium debate. The Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) is the direct user of the funds raised from the levy proposed in this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to commend Senator Macdonald for the way he has just taken this debate up, having just come in. He has been saying all of the right things and, obviously, he knows a lot about it. He has actually taken the fight up to the Australian Democrats in what they have been trying to do with our export industries and also to some of the left-wing members of the Australian Labor Party who obviously would not be very happy at all with the amendment that has been moved in this place by Senator Parer. The Labor Party is having quite a formal debate following on the recommendations of a committee of that Party to proceed with an expanded uranium policy, and with uranium enrichment. </PARA>
<PARA> I expect that between now and the special conference of the Labor Party, there will be a wide-ranging debate in the community at large. The Left will continue to go berserk on the issue and the Ministers will continue to speak up on the issue way outside the ambit of their particular portfolios. It is good to see the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, here tonight as a representative from the Northern Territory. Obviously, he has a big interest in the uranium debate because of what it does to help his territory-the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The duty involved in the legislation was imposed by the coalition Government in 1980 in recognition of the special costs incurred by the Commonwealth for environmental monitoring and research activities related to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory. According to the Government, the increased rate of duty reflects its position that costs associated with protecting the environment from the potential adverse effects of uranium mining should be borne as far as practicable by the industry carrying out that mining activity and not by the ordinary taxpayers. It is the Office of the Supervising Scientist that carries out the Commonwealth's responsibilities in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the principle of user pays. It is only right that the users of the OSS should pay for its operation. However, at the moment, through the Government's ridiculous and illogical three-mines policy, the burden of the duty falls on just one company. Under a coalition government, there would be no impediment other than the necessary environmental controls to the Koongarra, Jabiluka and Coronation Hill mines, sharing the burden with the Ranger mine and creating significant export dollars for Australia in the process. We would lift the three-mines policy, and that is a very big difference between us and the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The duty provides approximate cost recovery for the operation of the OSS, which has an appropriation of around $7m per year. However, the duty raised only $4m in 1989-90. With the proposed increase in the rate of duty, the total duty recovered is expected to be some $7.2m in 1990-91. This will provide a small surplus to balance a low return on the previous year. There will be an increase in the volume of uranium sales which happened to fall into 1990-91. The duty is raised only on operating mines in the region. The OSS provides services to other organisations and is of potential benefit to mines that will begin operation in the future. Therefore, the funding structure for the OSS should comprise appropriate payments from all users. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission, in a recent draft report, recommended that the charges to cover environmental monitoring be levied on all users of the region. The injustice of this duty falling on one company because of the Government's absurd three-mines policy is only highlighted by the fact that uranium prices are falling and the market is depressed. Yet, Energy Resources of Australia, the operator of the Ranger mine, must compete in the international market-a market which does not suffer the same tax on its products as we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The three-mines policy must go now so that when the upturn of the uranium market comes, as projections by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has forecast, Australia is able to gain its appropriate market share, and the market share should be considerable. Australia, as has already been mentioned, has 30 per cent of the world's low cost reserves of uranium but has only 10 per cent of the market. What an indictment of us in Australia. Canada, on the other hand, has only 10 per cent of the world's low cost reserves of uranium yet it enjoys 30 per cent of the market. With the current mismanagement of the export industries and the external debt by this Government, it is imperative that the three-mines policy go now so that potential mines, including world class deposits in the Northern Territory-this is Senator Collins's territory, and I am sure he would agree with this-get their share of the cake when the mines are opened up in the future. The development, the interests and the standard of living of all Australians will rest on our export dollar in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, in accordance with the international safeguards, we have to have proper environmental guidelines being complied with. Nobody would disagree with that. Changes in the rate of this duty are achieved by an extraordinarily complex process. It amazes me that that process is necessary. In brief, a gazette item is published, followed by a customs tariff proposal being introduced into the Parliament. This allows the new rate of duty to be collected. Although the customs tariff proposal must be backed up by legislation, such as the Bill under consideration, the customs tariff proposal will lapse if legislation is not passed within 12 months or if Parliament is dissolved. </PARA>
<PARA> In the present case, a previous customs tariff proposal for the rate increase now under consideration lapsed at the end of the last Parliament. Accordingly, the companies concerned will have over $200,000 returned to them, being duty paid at the higher rate until the end of the last Parliament. Usually, if there is an outstanding customs tariff proposal, when the intention to dissolve Parliament is known a validation Bill is passed in the last days of the Parliament. However, it was decided not to recall Parliament to pass a validation Bill. So the Government became liable to a refund claimed from the companies paying the levy. The Office of the Supervising Scientist, as the body expending the funds appropriated by the duty, must be both efficient in its work and must perform appropriate work. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent review of the OSS, the Taylor review, was tabled in Parliament in December 1989 and the Government has still not responded. The Government stands condemned for that. One of the recommendations of the review was the transferral of staff from Bondi in Sydney to the Northern Territory. Although I understand that there may be problems in recruiting appropriate staff to work there, I believe that it is ludicrous that the Government has not yet acted on that particular recommendation. I understand the complexities involved but it was a firm recommendation of that report and I cannot understand why the Government has not acted on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's inaction on this issue and the provision of a response to the Taylor review inevitably brings into question its seriousness and competency in providing appropriate reform for the Office of the Supervising Scientist. It is still happily located at Bondi, of course. It is a long way from the Northern Territory, from the Kakadu National Park and from the Alligator Rivers region, to which its work directly relates. The Taylor review found some serious inadequacies in its performance, including the lack of a published research plan and the lack of published environmental standards to guide the mining industries in their operations. These two items would seem to be absolutely basic to the credible functioning of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. The Government has to be condemned again for failing to respond to the Taylor review in a sensible time frame so that these reforms could have had Government backing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission, in its recent draft report of its inquiry into mining and minerals processing in Australia, found that there were substantial problems in the administration of mining activity in the Alligator Rivers region due to overlapping responsibilities held by the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy. However, there is no point in commissioning reviews which arrive at significant findings such as these if the Government does not act upon recommendations that are given to it. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill highlights some serious flaws in the Government's policies, including the underlying absurdity of its three-mines policy. There is a potential for an upswing in uranium demand. Unless we move more quickly Australia will miss the proverbial boat. The Northern Hemisphere will be bringing new reactors on stream in the next 10 years. I believe it is essential that Australia be able to supply this market, because if we do not, someone else will and Australia will have missed out on a vital export income.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome any attempt to have the costs of environmental monitoring and research activities to protect the Alligator Rivers region met by the industry rather than by the taxpayers, as the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill intends. A large proportion of taxpayers, of course, are not in favour of uranium mining, and the vast majority of them do not favour uranium mining within any national parks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have several reservations about aspects of the Bill and comments made in the second reading speech. While endorsing the comment in that speech that, `The significance of the Alligators Rivers region should not be underestimated', I am not confident that the Government has realised the significance at all. If it had, there would be no question of mining either at Ranger or at Coronation Hill, both of which, of course, are inside the Kakadu National Park, a World Heritage listed area. </PARA>
<PARA> My reservation about this Bill, however, is that it does not acknowledge the environmental and health and safety costs associated with any uranium mining operation. There is, for example, no equivalent body to the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) monitoring the effects of the Olympic Dam site at Roxby Downs. This is where I must take issue with Senator Brownhill, who says that the Ranger uranium mine is bearing the total cost of the user pays policy. That is fair enough at that particular location, but there is no equivalent monitoring of the largest uranium mine in Australia, and some say the largest uranium mine in the Western world, at Roxby Downs. So it really is not a logical argument. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the estimate of $7.212m to be raised by the levy for the full 1990-91 financial year. This is slightly less than the 1989-90 budget for the OSS, which of course accounts for only part of the cost borne by the Commonwealth as a direct consequence of the mining operations in the area. So there appear to be grounds for the levy to be increased still more to meet the true costs to the taxpayer of mining within this significant area, although I would argue that the true costs are never really borne out by any dollar figures. This area should not be mined at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I am well aware that the last time the uranium export levy was increased ERA-Ranger, ably supported by the Australian Mining Industry Council and the Coronation Hill joint venturers, embarked upon a campaign to have the OSS discredited and disbanded on the grounds that, if ERA were paying for it, the OSS should be working for ERA's benefit. The industry criticisms of the OSS have been dismissed by an independent review of the organisation, the report of which was tabled in Parliament, as Senator Brownhill said, at the end of 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken in the Senate previously in support of the work done by the OSS, and wish to repeat now that the Office of the Supervising Scientist deserves the strongest support, including strengthening of the Commonwealth environmental requirements, to ensure compliance by Ranger and amendment of Commonwealth-Northern Territory arrangements so that the OSS is able to carry out its regulatory role more effectively. It has often been referred to as a toothless tiger. I think that situation should change and the Government should implement some of the recommendations that were made in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> There are grounds for expanding the role of the OSS to cover all uranium mining operations in this country. I trust that there will be no more than the two at present-this includes Roxby Downs, of course-and that these will be phased out as current contracts expire. But I would also include so-called exploration sites such as CRA's operation at the Kintyre uranium deposit at Karlamilyi or Rudall River National Park, where there is a large field camp and significant drilling activities, the products of which are delivered across the country to be assayed in Melbourne. There is no regulation whatsoever of that camp's activities, which have been set up by CRA for quite a number of years. I visited the site in 1988 and it had a certain air of permanency about it, which was very different indeed from the Aboriginal communities inside the boundaries of the national park, which I visited on the same trip. </PARA>
<PARA> As at Kakadu, the Kintyre deposit occurs on land of the highest significance to the traditional owners of the land. The Martu people lost their `resource security' many years ago and are the forgotten part of this story. They have returned from the reserves and mining towns to which they were forcibly removed in the past and are absolutely united in their determination to preserve their cultural integrity by remaining on the land to which they belong. They do not want their land mined. There is no question of royalties or jobs being accepted as a trade-off. The Martu are resolute in their determination to preserve their land and their lives: the two are inextricably linked and neither is compatible with mining. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to one of the points mentioned in the well leaked letter by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, recently when he wrote to all members of the Australian Labor Party's uranium review committee. He mentioned five particular points, and the Aboriginal claim was one of them. He said that Aboriginal interests are being looked at at every level. That is patently not true. They are certainly not being looked at as far as the Kintyre deposit is concerned, and this deposit would be one of the very first to get the go-ahead if the three-mines policy were changed to expand the uranium industry. It would be the first in line. The Martu people will not stand for that and neither will the Western Desert Support Group, which is considerable and Australia-wide. We should ask the former Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, what he thinks about this particular deposit. In the run-up to the last election, when he had responsibility for this portfolio, he said, `No way will that Kintyre deposit be mined, because it is in a national park. It is uranium on Aboriginal land'. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also ask the Premier of Western Australia, Carmen Lawrence, her views because before that election she also said that that would be off-limits. Yet recently the Western Australian Government foolishly declared that it was going to excise areas from the Rudall River National Park, from the D'Entrecasteaux National Park and from the Hamersley Range National Park in order to allow mining to go ahead. Carmen Lawrence is on record for many years as being opposed to uranium mining and being a supporter of Aboriginal issues in general. It is really quite difficult for people in Western Australia to understand how on earth she can make such a change to policy to allow uranium mining to go ahead with bits of the national park excised. Mind you, there are many things which the Western Australian Government has been doing recently which are difficult for the people in Western Australia to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the five points that Mr Kerin mentions in his well publicised letter. The letter was very well timed in its leaking because it means that his arguments can be demolished successfully one after another. First of all, he talks about non-proliferation and says that the issue is not a problem any more. I cannot imagine where he is getting his advice from. </PARA>
<PARA> We trade with the French, who are not signatories to the non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The French used to trade with the Iraqis and they are about to resume trading in nuclear materials again. The French also trade with the Israelis and Pakistanis, who also have not signed the NPT. It has been very clearly demonstrated that Australian uranium, which goes to France and then goes on its merry way through the nuclear fuel cycle, cannot be separated out. Our uranium could be ending up in Iraq, in Israel or in Pakistan; all countries which are threshold countries and not signatories to the non-proliferation treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how Mr Kerin can say that there is no further concern about that. He is obviously referring just to glasnost-the situation existing between the two former superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. Glasnost may have had a very small impact on the nuclear weapons stockpile of those two nations. Most of the plutonium which is being removed from ground-based nuclear weapons is being redeployed onto Tomahawk cruise missiles. There is not a reduction in the amount of plutonium on nuclear weapons between these two superpowers. In addition, neither Britain nor France has placed their nuclear weapons on the negotiating table. As I mentioned, there are so many threshold countries-including those that France deals with, and also South Africa and India-which have not signed the NPT but which are, presumably, going on apace with their nuclear weapons programs. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting that on the same day that Mr Kerin's letter was leaked it was disclosed that the Western Mining Corporation, Pancontinental and the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, had been in Taiwan-another non-signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty-trying to scrounge up some deals, seeing if they could help gear up some uranium sales in the future with Taiwan. When I asked a question about that yesterday, the Government was so confused that it may also be trying to line up some deals with Taiwan. There are not too many other deals going. That is the first of John Kerin's arguments totally demolished. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Mr Kerin says that nuclear safety is better now since Chernobyl. How can he say that? There has been a lot of talk about that particular accident being discredited because of inferior Soviet technology. Mr Kerin may make those claims but there was an accident on 9 February in Japan-which, of course, was denied by the industry until several weeks had passed. However, it shocked the Japanese Government into reviewing its program for an atomic energy future. </PARA>
<PARA> When this accident happened on 9 February, it was not until radiation in one section of the plant had multiplied 10 times in five minutes that the technicians felt sufficiently bothered about a possible meltdown to try manually lowering output from one of the station reactors. At 1.50 p.m., as what turned out to be a leak from the primary cooling system into the secondary system sent radiation levels to 1,250 times normal, computers automatically shut down the plant's number two reactor and poured huge quantities of water into the reactor core, thus averting a possible meltdown. This is Japan, which is meant to have superior state-of-the-art technology. I remind Mr Kerin and anybody else in the Labor Party who cares to listen, as they anguish with this issue yet again, that this incident occurred on 9 February this year. The worst nuclear accident in Japan was four times greater than officially reported. This is typical of the lies, the deception and the secrecy that the nuclear industry regularly adopts. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also a great deal of concern in Czechoslovakia about a possible meltdown when, one year after an accident, contamination of ground water was finally admitted. Across the border, the Austrians, who know full well post-Chernobyl that the nuclear cloud knows no national or international boundaries, have demanded that the Czechoslovaks shut down the reactor at Jaslovske Bohunice. So many accidents have happened that they are scared of the big one. A very difficult situation exists between those two Governments. People are very worried and scared, an accident having been proved to have happened one year after it did happen-it not being acknowledged officially that the ground water was contaminated was bad enough-that there will be an even greater accident. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many instances of the nuclear industry covering up and lying about the problems that it has had. In the United States things have not fared much better. Clean-up costs for the crippled Three Mile Island reactor have risen from an initial estimate of $US100m to $US4 billion and the clean-up is not complete yet. There are so many instances that Mr Kerin's ridiculous claim that nuclear safety has improved since Chernobyl has been demolished totally. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin talks about worker and public health as though that, too, has been allayed. Senator Coulter early in the debate today made quite a number of comments about that. I remind the Senate that the International Commission on Radiological Protection is constantly issuing new guidelines downgrading the amount of radiation to which workers can be exposed without danger of permanent health risks to them. The levels have been dropped from 50 millisievert per annum to 20 millisievert per annum, which is a two-and-a-half fold reduction. There are more reductions on the way. Yet the Minister says that worker health and public safety is okay. Mr Kerin should ask the people who live not only in the Ukraine but also in Byelorussia or the Russian republics: they know only too well that public safety is not looked after by the nuclear industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, there are the Aboriginal interests. In the Kintyre deposit, Aboriginal interests are not being looked after. These people have gone back to their own territory. In 1988, which was meant to be a year of some sort of national celebration of 200 years of European settlement in this country, all that the Kintyre people could think about was that they had no security over that land. Yet CRA Ltd, with its camp just outside the national park border, had absolute security and absolute permanency. CRA is just waiting for a change in Government policy, which of course we are now seeing in danger of unfolding. Aboriginal interests have not been dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The next reason that Mr Kerin gave for changing his mind was the supply and the burgeoning market. Mr Kerin cannot deny that there is an oversupply and a glut of uranium on the world market. There are stockpiles all around the world, including at Roxby Downs, which is at the moment selling only 60 per cent of the uranium that it is mining; it cannot get rid of the stuff. So why open up more mines when some of the Australian uranium that is already here cannot be sold? The burgeoning market that he talks about is an absolute furphy-because there is no evidence. I demonstrated this yesterday very clearly when I asked a question about the Minister's exaggerated figures on Japan and the calls by Korea for nuclear power stations in the next 20 years. The Minister did not have the backup for the allegations that he had made in his letter. He was unable to confirm them. There is a huge discrepancy between what he said about both Japan and Korea and what is the reality. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to tell the story of a shipyard. Many of you will have read or seen on television at the weekend the launching of the last ship from the Hunter shipyard, Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd. This last ship, the Searoad Tamar, was built for the Australian National Line (ANL).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last workers at Carrington Slipways said that the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, should have attended the launching. They said that he always was to be seen at grand finals. Sadly, this was not a grand final but something reminiscent of T.S. Eliot's The Hollow Men:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the way the world ends</PARA>
<PARA>Not with a bang but a whimper. </PARA>
<PARA>One has to ask why. Why was it the end for Carrington Slipways? Why did it all go wrong? Carrington Slipways was founded by the Laverick family in 1959. It was not a large shipyard. The modern flow-line facility was established in 1972 on a site acquired in 1969. The company early established a reputation for stability not matched by some of its contemporaries. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major contracts awarded in 1983 to a Carrington subsidiary was for part of the minehunter project for two fibreglass hulls. A $12m fixed-price contract was awarded to the German firm, Krupp Atlas Elektronik, to supply mine- hunting sonar equipment for the vessels. However, according to a report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade last year, the Krupp sonar system did not satisfy fundamental tests. As a result of the contract for the minehunters, Carrington developed a glass reinforced plastic facility at Tomago. This facility was purpose built for the minehunter project. </PARA>
<PARA> The major contract in phase two for the provision of a ship building facility and two prototype minehunters was let to Carrington Slipways in 1983. Two have been built, but an order for four more has been postponed. There would appear to be a question mark over the persistence by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) with the Krupp sonar system, which was found to be faulty. This has resulted in a catch 22 situation. Because the Navy insisted on the Krupp system and the system did not work, it then rescinded the order for the minehunters beyond two prototypes. If the faulty system had not fouled up the minehunter project, the project would have gone ahead for the other six minehunters that were originally planned and Carrington would still be operating. </PARA>
<PARA> Then in 1989 began the saga of the Anzac frigate contract. A consortium was established to bid for the latest frigate tender to be built in Australia. The consortium was titled Australian Warships Systems Pty Ltd and consisted of the Australian companies, TNT Ltd, AWA Ltd, Carrington Slipways, and two overseas companies. The consortium was offered a Dutch-designed M class frigate to be built principally in Newcastle but with some subcontracting let elsewhere in Australia. The hulls of the warship were to be built by Carrington Slipways and most of the technical work, including installation of the defence systems and masts, was to be carried out in the old State Dockyard in Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> More than half the value of the construction was to be made up of sophisticated electronic equipment. The winning bidder for this would have gained a very solid base for future industrial development in high technology.</PARA>
<PARA> To quote a newspaper at the time, Newcastle was `sweating blood' to secure the RAN frigate contract. The people of Newcastle even placed thousands of signatures on a white bus which was driven to Canberra; it was probably one of the most original petitions ever received by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no doubt that Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd (AMECON) was offering the cheapest ship, but that Australian Warship Systems was offering better value for money. Despite all the lobbying and all the efforts, the contract was finally awarded to AMECON, but with the promise that some of the work would be contracted interstate, and especially to Carrington Slipways. Promises are promises. Since that day not a single piece of work has come to Carrington or, for that matter, to any other shipyards in the Hunter. </PARA>
<PARA> It was reported last May that Dr John White, the managing director of AMECON, said that his consortium did not intend to set up a shipbuilding operation in the Hunter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>AMECON is committed to spending $700m or more on shipbuilding work in Newcastle but that will be done on a sub-contract basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Possible subcontractors included Eglo Engineering Pty Ltd and Carrington Slipways. In May last year Dr White said this:</PARA>
<PARA>I am very confident that Carrington Slipways will be involved in the project. It has capacities that we do not. </PARA>
<PARA>Since that statement, no work has been negotiated with Carrington Slipways. Just to indicate what Newcastle lost and Williamstown gained, I point out that the awarding of the Anzac frigate project to AMECON will create work for the Williamstown dockyard in Melbourne for more than 15 years. In December 1990 the only major subcontracts let by AMECON were for the hull and superstructure units by its subsidiary, Eglo, in Newcastle and Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> Carrington Slipways has been highly regarded for its shipyard building work. Just to indicate what some of these projects are, I will go through some of its most recent projects. Last year it completed an $11.6m dredge, the David Allan, for the Maritime Services Board. In addition, it has been Australia's largest supplier of tugs. </PARA>
<PARA> When the demise of Carrington Slipways began to look more of a reality than a mere threat, the people of Newcastle did all that they could to try to save the yard. The Port Stephens Shire Council unanimously passed a recommendation to support any feasibility strategy that would save Carrington Slipways and keep it operating as a shipyard. There were discussions between the New South Wales State Development Minister, Mr John Hannaford, and Senator Button, but the future continued to look bleak. Where now was the famous government support that saved Kodak Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button met a Newcastle delegation consisting of Hunter Valley parliamentarians, the Newcastle Lord Mayor and a number of union officials. Nothing happened. All Senator Button did was issue a press statement in which he said that he was looking to have a viable shipbuilding operation in the Hunter region in the long term. Of course `in the long term' was no use to Carrington Slipways. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the blame was laid with the Australian tax regime, which was a great deterrent to potential investors in the shipyard. There was hardly any inducement to investors to become involved in the yard when their return was equivalent to leaving the money in the bank. There is a real need for inducements for investment in this country in high-risk projects with the enormous potential of Carrington Slipways. </PARA>
<PARA> The final blow for Carrington came with the foreclosure by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia on the outstanding loans owed by the shipyard. The company went into receivership last year. The yard finally collapsed on 21 December. Its assets were placed in control of the agents-in-possession by the Commonwealth Bank. The Australian National Line leased the shipyard assets to complete the 8,500 tonne ship, Searoad Tamar. ANL negotiated with the unions to employ on a casual basis some of the 429 employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Did the Federal Government offer any last-minute reprieve for Carrington? The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) uttered a pious wish for a buyer for the shipyard, but he ruled out any assistance from the Federal Government. Mr Vernon Broome, the Executive General Manager of the ANL's marine management services, paid tribute to the shipyard's efforts in building the Searoad Tamar, which was started in December 1989. He particularly praised the cooperation of the unions and workers in the months since the collapse which allowed the ship to be completed. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>This shipyard has been fitted out as a very modern yard. It will be a pity to see it just disappear. </PARA>
<PARA>The way in which the Government has, through bungled planning and playing political favourites, allowed a major manufacturing and export facility like Carrington Slipways to collapse is a tragedy for the Hunter and indeed for Australian industry. Every month we have evidence in the balance of payments that Australia cannot pay its way in the world. This Government claims that it wants a more diversified economy; a halt to the decline of the manufacturing industries; the development of high technology industries; a boost to manufacturing exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, when a successful, innovative, high technology manufacturer, such as Carrington Slipways, fulfils the Government's wants, the Government destroys this valuable company with bungled contracts, political favouritism and heartless financial constraints. People in high places need to answer certain questions. Let me put some of those questions. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Collins for that interjection. Perhaps he could answer some of these questions. Who in Canberra influenced the decision of the Commonwealth Bank to pull the plug on Carrington Slipways when the yard had assets in excess of $20m? What organisations or companies now control the total naval defence spending budget for the next 20 years? Why were repeated representations by Carrington Slipways management requesting the Government and the Department of Defence to consider fitting an alternative proven sonar system to the mine hunters ignored, thus affecting possible orders to the Middle East and South East Asian countries? Why did AMECON not fulfil its pledge that 27 per cent of the work associated with the ANZAC frigates would come to the Hunter? What factors influenced the decision to award the frigate contract to AMECON?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real problem for Newcastle and the Hunter now, as in the past, is government neglect. Labor did not care because it could not lose in the Hunter. Up to 1988 the Liberals did not give the region preference because they could not win it. Labor should not be so complacent now about its political future in Newcastle and in the Hunter. I invite the people of the Hunter to send in submissions to the forthcoming House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology which is conducting an inquiry into the future of the shipbuilding industry. The Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Dobell, Mr Lee, will be conducting sittings in Newcastle to hear submissions about the collapse of Carrington Slipways. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the inquiry into the banking industry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration was established last year I was hoping that this ritual would end and that I would not have to stand night after night speaking on the adjournment pursuing the question of bank malpractices and corrupt practices. Unfortunately I have to continue to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators are aware of the fact that I have been in the practice of tabling affidavits and supporting documents as case studies of how ordinary Australians suffer at the hands of banks. I seek the leave of the Senate tonight to table two such affidavits, accompanied by supporting documents, as further evidence of how these things unfold in the daily lives of ordinary Australians, namely, in relation to Dr Catherine Nemeth, who has been in dispute with the Commonwealth Bank in a very spectacular way for quite some time, and in relation to Mr and Mrs Smith of Manypeaks in Western Australia who are in a less spectacular but nonetheless worthy dispute with the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia in that State. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gave assurances early in the day that the evidence I am tabling is not at the moment sub judice. It may well be before the court at some future time. In some cases, it has been before the court previously, but it is not at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall speak about the case of the Smiths briefly because I sent details of their case to every Federal member of parliament some months ago. These ordinary people find themselves in quite an extraordinary situation. They have been in dispute with the bank for 10 years. Twice during that time they have been granted legal aid to carry their case to court. Twice that legal aid has been withdrawn because they have been unable to get the bank into the court in the necessary period of time. Their letter was one of despair from ordinary Australians. It was for that reason that I circulated particulars of their case to all members of parliament some months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall now return to the case of Huon Valley Springs Pty Ltd. People have asked me why. I shall just relate to the Senate my experience of having appeared before the banking inquiry. As I said, I was hoping that that appearance would put an end to this ritual on my part. Indeed, it has not. On the occasion that I appeared before the banking inquiry, as I mentioned two evenings ago, I tabled 3,000 pages of documentary evidence, a good deal of which related specifically to the Huon Valley Springs case. I considered it to be a classic case of targeting and asset stripping. From a statement by the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Stephen Martin, it is apparent that the Committee at large-certainly Mr Martin but I believe he claims to be speaking on behalf of the Committee at large-has chosen to ignore that evidence. In fact, Mr Martin publicly stated that I did not provide it. He must have failed to have seen it and certainly he has failed to peruse it. I am left with no option other than to return to that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of my three and a half hours before the inquiry and in the course of speaking to those 3,000 pages of evidence, one of the members of the Committee asked whether I could reduce it a few paragraphs; whether I could possibly reduce the concept of proof of targeting and asset stripping to a few paragraphs. I did not laugh at the time but, in retrospect, it is quite a laughable suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA> On the last occasion I spoke on this issue, two nights ago, I attempted to establish, to prove, for the benefit of the Committee and others, the fact that senior officers of the Commonwealth Bank in relation to this case perjured themselves. I was asked in relation to this and other cases what anybody had to benefit from the processes which I described. A lot of people stood to benefit from the processes I have been describing; sometimes the banks, sometimes the clients of the banks, but seldom the person who was targeted-in fact, never the person who was targeted. That is the essential situation which I have been attempting to describe and will now return to in the case of Huon Valley Springs. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of this presentation I shall be citing and quoting from 39 pages of evidence, the evidence that Mr Martin says that I did not provide and has chosen to ignore in all of the 70 cases that I have cited during the past two and a half years. I shall be quoting from 39 pages of documents. In advance, I seek leave to table those documents, with one exception. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I return then to the subject of Huon Valley Springs Pty Ltd. The company conducted a mineral water bottling plant upon land owned by Durna Pty Ltd. It is significant that it conducted its operations on land that it did not own. The principals of Durna were Maxwell Reynolds, Anthony Sofia and Dominic Vizzone. Durna leased the land to Huon Valley Springs. The lease provided that, if receivers were appointed to the assets and undertakings of Huon Valley Springs, Durna could there upon terminate the lease. The Commonwealth Development Bank held a registrable, equitable mortgage over the assets and undertakings of Huon Valley Springs with the power to appoint a receiver.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What that means is that if Huon Valley Springs failed to pay the instalment of interest due to the Commonwealth Development Bank on 1 January 1986, the Commonwealth Development Bank could appoint receivers. Durna would then cancel the lease and the receivers would be prevented from selling the business as a going concern. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Development Bank, as the bankers to Huon Valley Springs, would then stand to lose heavily. Durna, on the other hand, stood to purchase the assets from the receivers on favourable terms. If the Commonwealth Development Bank appointed receivers, Messrs Reynolds, Sofia and Vizzone would inevitably be the beneficiaries. Therein lies the essence of this allegation and the rebut, of course, suggests the necessity to prove it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Bank of Australia recognised the inevitable. In a diary note dated 6 December 1985, the Deputy Chief Manager of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Mr J.J. Vanner wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Rural Officer Hobart, Terry Cracknell, visited the Cygnet factory this morning . . . at this stage he doubted if the operations would have any value to an investor or a larger company. Mr Cracknell said that in the event of the show closing Reynolds would be the principal beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . A very considerable loss is in prospect and CBA has little alternative but to count its losses. </PARA>
<PARA>I have tabled the document from which I have quoted. By an extraordinary coincidence, the diary note was written the day after the first shipment of contaminated product was dispatched to Sydney. The contamination of the mineral water crippled the cash flow of Huon Valley Springs. Reynolds was in charge of quality control. In a memorandum dated 13 January 1986, Mr Vanner wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes there is a marketable product there and, with proper financial management and adequate equity backing, it would be brought to a profitable level of operation. Just who might do this is terribly difficult and an offhand comment some weeks ago that Reynolds will be the principal beneficiary of all that has happened seems close to the mark. </PARA>
<PARA>I have tabled the document from which I have just quoted. The Commonwealth Development Bank was in a similar predicament to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. In a memorandum dated 31 December 1985, which I have previously tabled in this place, Mr K.I. Whatson of the Commonwealth Development Bank Head Office wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>What we would do if the factory closes down is not immediately obvious. First step would seem to be to get hold of what book debts there might be . . . There is a risk of loss of most, if not all, of our investment of $500,000.00.</PARA>
<PARA>In a memorandum dated 8 January 1986, which I have previously tabled, the Commonwealth Development Bank State Manager, New South Wales, Mr J. W. Thompson, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it now appears that the company may not be able to reach a position where its product will generate sufficient cash flow to service its commitments. We understand that the CBA is in the process of making demand for payment of its debt if this happens it seems to us very likely that the company will have no option but to close its operations. In this event, there would be little worth in our R/E/M security (that is, Registered Equitable Mortgage security). </PARA>
<PARA>What this means is that officers of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia had painted the bank into a corner by imprudent lending practices and were about to drag the Commonwealth Development Bank down the drain with them. At this stage there was no suggestion from the Commonwealth Development Bank of appointing receivers. The memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA>We have prepared in draft form notice of demand including fixing our charge in respect of R/E/M security. We have also prepared in draft a notice to individual debtors requiring funds due to be paid to CDB . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Development Bank resisted approaches by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to appoint a receiver. In a memorandum dated 15 January 1986, Mr Thompson wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Vanner of CBA was in touch with us on 15th January . . . It was put to us that having in mind the supposedly substantial value of this stock CDB may wish to consider appointing a receiver to dispose of it. I told them we would be unlikely to wish to entertain such an arrangement as this may precipitate the folding up of the company which would not help CBA in the present investor negotiations and is unlikely to help CDB's case. </PARA>
<PARA>I have tabled the document from which I have quoted. In a memorandum dated 21 January 1986, Mr Thompson wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>We were telephoned yesterday by Messrs. Robinson and Vanner of NSW Branches Administration, CBA. . . . The CBA representatives suggested that CDB may care to take action under its R/E/M with a view to taking possession of and selling the stock said to be on hand. Whilst we did not reject that suggestion outright it was made clear we were not terribly enthusiastic . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I have tabled the document from which I have just quoted. In a memorandum dated 24 January 1986, Mr Thompson wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Vanner of CBA informed us this morning . . . We were asked whether CDB has thought any more of acting under its securities and appointing a receiver. I said we had not done any more regarding this and in fact we may have no cause to do so as we believed borrower is proposing to pay arrears of interest which is the only default under the CDB R/E/M at this stage . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I have tabled the document from which I have just quoted. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia even pre-empted the appointment of a receiver. In a memorandum dated 21 January 1986, Mr P. J. Shoebridge, an officer of the Commonwealth Development Bank wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Miss Batiste went on to say they had just undertaken discussions with Mr Neil Sim (General Manager NSW Branches Administration) regarding CBA's position . . . Mr Sim also indicated that CDB were reviewing their position and in fact were considering Appointment of a Receiver! Mr Sim stated in regard to the above, ``I am at liberty to disclose that! This lead to the conclusion that CDB was on the point of taking action under its securities. Miss Batiste was informed that at this point in time CDB had not reached a decision as to appointment of a receiver . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I have tabled the document from which I have just quoted. The statement by Sim was a blatant lie. That lie was told by the General Manager, New South Wales Branches Administration-the right hand man to the then Managing Director, Mr Vern Christie. Then, again, that revelation should not surprise us because Peter Poppett committed perjury in Wilfred Taylor's case-a case which I have similarly unfolded here. Geoffrey Kyngdon committed perjury in Tony Rigg's case, which I have similarly exposed. Jim Vanner committed perjury in Donna Batiste's case. Senior management of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia used the lie told by Mr Sim to influence the Commonwealth Development Bank's decision to appoint a receiver. In a memorandum dated 5 February 1986, Mr Thompson wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>There have been considerable developments throughout this week in relation to this account. On Monday 3rd February we were telephoned by Head Office with the message that the Managing Director (that is, Mr Vern Christie) had said at the 9.30 meeting that something must be done about this account without further delay. I was asked to arrange an urgent meeting with General Manager NSW CBA Mr Sim and this discussion took place immediately after lunch when Messrs Robinson and Vanner were also present. </PARA>
<PARA> It was clear from that, that Mr Sim's understanding was that CDB had virtually given a commitment in the previous week to take action. This was not as we understood it. Be this as it may however, it was clear that the time for action had arrived . . . Subsequently the case was reviewed by Deputy General Manager CDB, Mr Wright, Ken Whatson and myself. It was decided later, on the afternoon of 3rd February that CDB should move towards appointment of a receiver as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>I have tabled the document from which I have just quoted. I suppose the question then arises: why did Mr Sim lie to Miss Batiste? I would contend that Sim lied to pressure Miss Batiste into selling the business. Senior management knew that Miss Batiste was endeavouring to sell a share of the business to pay out the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. In a record of interview between Messrs Robinson, Vanner and Simington and Miss Batiste dated 16 January 1986, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The sale package they are offering is 49% of the company with Miss Batiste staying on in the company. They are negotiation for total cover of the Bank debts (company only) for between $1.5Million and $2Million for a 49% share . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I have tabled the document from which I have quoted. I return to the memorandum of Mr Shoebridge dated 21 January 1986 which I have also tabled. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Miss Batiste went on to say that they had just undertaken discussions with Mr Neil Sim . . . there are three people stated to be interested in purchasing the business. Negotiations are proceeding but nothing has eventuated. </PARA>
<PARA>I contend that Miss Batiste passed this information to Mr Sim, and he then lied to her. </PARA>
<PARA> The question arises: why did Sim, Robinson and Vanner hold an urgent meeting with Mr Thompson? Why did they influence the Commonwealth Development Bank to appoint a receiver? Robinson and Vanner knew that Miss Batiste was negotiating with an Italian syndicate. Robinson and Vanner knew the terms of the negotiation. Robinson and Vanner knew Miss Batiste's attitude to those negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to Mr Thompson's memorandum dated 21 January which states:</PARA>
<PARA>We were telephoned yesterday by Messrs Robinson and Vanner . . . They had shortly beforehand interviewed Brian Wickens who was the director of a borrower company . . . Wickens mentioned also that Batiste is believed to be trying to sell the company to an ``Italian syndicate'' for $4Million. The Italian syndicate is believed to be somewhat interested, provided Batiste is out of the company altogether. She is not impressed with this and wants to retain a 49% interest but with herself to receive $2Million in cash for sale of the 51% interest. </PARA>
<PARA>On 24 January 1986 a meeting took place and a deal was struck. In a memorandum from Max Reynolds to the Sunday Telegraph relating to that meeting, which I have tabled previously in this place, it is recorded that an offer was to be made to Miss Batiste as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>That the offer would be made to Donna Batiste and that the money would come through the ICLE bank via a group as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ICLE...20%</PARA>
<PARA> AEFC...20%</PARA>
<PARA> ABC...20%</PARA>
<PARA> D. Batiste...10%</PARA>

<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that `ICLE' refers to the Instituts Nazionale Di Credito Per Il Lauore Italiano All'Estore, an Italian resident merchant bank owned by Banca Nationale del Lauoro of Italy. </PARA>
<PARA> The reference to AEFC refers to Australian European Finance Corporation Ltd, an Australian resident merchant bank then owned by the Banca Nationale and the CBA. The reference to ABC refers to ABC Property Planners Pty Ltd, 25 per cent of which is owned by AEFC. What this means is that if the deal was consummated, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia would have carried equity in the project. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will also recall that the ICLE bank was the banker for the Italian syndicate's company, Durna Pty Ltd. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia had a material interest in the deal, as part owner of AEFC. The ICLE banked with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and loaned money to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. I have tabled the audited accounts of the ICLE bank as at 31 December 1984 showing loans to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The ICLE would have informed the Commonwealth Bank of Australia of the deal. </PARA>
<PARA> Senior management of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia would have reason to believe that Miss Batiste would reject the offer. Senior management of the CBA had reason to believe that Miss Batiste would pay the arrears of interest to the Commonwealth Development Bank. Senior management of the CBA knew that the CDB did not want to appoint a receiver. I contend that the best senior management of the Commonwealth Development Bank could hope for was to consummate the deal and take its carried equity in the project. I contend that Sim, Robinson and Vanner used Sim's lie to influence the Commonwealth Development Bank as part of a corrupt deal to defraud Miss Batiste. </PARA>
<PARA> The ICLE bank wanted to take over Huon Valley Springs. In a letter from Messrs Sofia and Vizzone to ICLE Finance Corporation dated 31 December 1987, the Italians wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that we were duped and forced into entering into the Huon Valley Springs mineral water venture by the Bank's over zealous General Manager, Dr Giorgio Draskovic. Dr Draskovic, we maintain was driven by his own personal ambitions and desire to achieve status within your own corporate structure and also amongst the wider banking community. </PARA>
<PARA> In grandiose terms he-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Dr Draskovic-</PARA>
<PARA>said that he was about to show the Australian banking community how Italian banks operated and in the process use HVS as the spearhead for IFC (ICLE Finance Corporation). </PARA>
<PARA>. . . Draskovic continued to stress the importance of Huon Valley. He recounted the story that at a congregation of the banking fraternity i.e. amongst his peers, that the Federal Treasurer, Mr Keating, had singled IFC and himself as a model for other bankers to follow. Mr Keating has specifically mentioned the fact that he (and IFC) had picked Huon Valley springs when other banks did not want to touch it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that I previously named Dr Draskovic some months ago. At that time I alerted him to the fact that there were privilege procedures available to him, as Senator Collins has quite rightly stated once again. The question arises: how did Giorgio Draskovic, the model banker, take control of Huon Valley Springs? I return to the letter from Messrs Sofia and Vizzone:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Naghten (the Managing Director of ABC) structured a proposal which effectively took over all assets and liabilities of HVS Pty Limited. </PARA>
<PARA> He told us the revised share structure would be:</PARA>
<PARA> - 50% Durna</PARA>
<PARA> - 20% IFC</PARA>
<PARA> - 20% Australian European Finance</PARA>
<PARA>Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> - 10% Batiste</PARA>
<PARA> The offer was presented to Miss Batiste, who rejected it. A meeting was then arranged with Draskovic, Naghten and ourselves to review the state of play. In spite of the offer being rejected Naghten and Draskovic were confident we could take over HVS Pty Limited. We were advised that they had already taken such steps through their contacts in the Commonwealth Development Bank to have the ``plug'' pulled on Batiste. A Notice of Demand was being served on Batiste almost at the moment. We were further advised that Mr Naghten would be taking Miss Batiste's percentage of the equity. We don't know what actually transpired but almost immediately HVS Pty Limited went into receivership . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What was the consequence of the action taken by Dr Draskovic? The answer is obvious. The inevitable happened. In a memorandum dated 14 February 1986, Mr J. E. Healey of the Commonwealth Development Bank head office wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Naghten said Durna Pty Limited had terminated Huon Valley Spring's lease of the factory property on the grounds of appointment by the Bank of a receiver and also non payment of rent. In view of this situation it must be acknowledged that Durna Pty Limited can effectively prevent sale of the business as a going concern to anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA>I have tabled the document from which I have just quoted. Messrs Sofia and Vizzone summarised the position as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The appointment of a receiver meant that Batiste contravened her contractual obligations and lost both her mineral water extraction rights and the lease on the factory buildings. Effectively the receiver had nothing to sell, as Durna owned the water and the factory building. </PARA>
<PARA>This means that Reynolds, along with the Italians, became the principal beneficiaries. The Italians recorded this comment, and I am quoting from documents which I have just tabled:</PARA>
<PARA>Channel 10 and Batiste were pretty close to the mark over a conspiracy to get her. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement they made in a documentary produced on this incident by Channel 10. In closing, I return to the fact that it is this type of evidence which the Martin committee has chosen to ignore. The Martin committee ignores it, as does the Attorney-General of Tasmania, whose attention I drew to this evidence some months ago. I can only say that they ignore it at their own risk and at our peril because the Huon Valley Springs case, I am convinced, is a classic case of targeting and asset stripping, of fraud, of rank corruption and of malpractice-call it what you like-the type of practice for which it is the responsibility of this Senate, and me personally, to target and give evidence of. It is our responsibility to call upon the responsible authorities in this country to take the necessary action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a short reference to a rather unfortunate speech that was given in the other place earlier this evening by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). He spoke about East Timor and, in doing so, about a parliamentary delegation to Indonesia which visited East Timor. He then proceeded to go on to other things. The contents of that speech were, in my view, quite outrageous, misleading and inaccurate, and the timing of the speech was improper, contrary to what I understand to be the ethics of this Parliament and unfortunate in the extreme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I dissociate myself entirely from the remarks of the honourable member for Moreton. I want to make it clear that, whilst the honourable member for Moreton mentioned the delegation, in no way could what he said in that speech tonight be taken as being my impression as a member of that delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to speak on the delegation's visit to Indonesia, and I want to do that at greater length at the appropriate time which is, I understand, when the delegation's report is presented to Parliament. I will be speaking in a very positive way because the delegation was a very positive exercise and one which will do much to cement relationships between our nearest neighbour, the Indonesian republic, and the fine people who live in that nation, who looked after us extremely well and were very kind and helpful to us on that delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> I was somewhat shocked to see on my in-house monitor the honourable member for Moreton speaking as he did about East Timor and about the Indonesians. He said that he had recently been to the United Nations as a member of a parliamentary group for East Timor. I assume that he was sponsored by the Australian Government, although I do not know. It seems that the things that he said were simply not correct in anyone's view. He made some quite outrageous statements and, whilst I do not want to enter into a debate on those, I simply want to say that I find them quite improper and incorrect and, as I say, quite unfortunate. He spoke about our being surrounded by troops all the time we were in East Timor, which is quite improper and quite inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA> I concur with many of the remarks that the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall), who is also a member of that delegation, said when he was, I think, shocked into getting to his feet immediately to respond to the outburst from the honourable member for Moreton. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say, without going into any detail, which I will certainly do at another time, that I am sure that Senator Sherry, who was also part of that delegation, will speak. He will have a slightly different view or a different angle on the visit from mine, but I am quite sure it will not be the approach that the honourable member for Moreton adopted tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I found that while there were some problems in East Timor, the Indonesians were doing all they could to improve the health and the education of the people there. Massive amounts of money are being poured into it. The Indonesians generally are trying to do the right thing. There are reports of civil rights abuses. Whether they are accurate is a matter for debate, and I do not want to do that today. But I do not think there is any debate on the fact that the Indonesian officials there-the Governor and the Military Governor-are doing their best to ensure that there are no civil rights abuses and that the welfare of the people is enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say I was absolutely flabbergasted to hear the honourable member for Moreton praising the Portuguese Government and talking about how the Indonesians had invaded and thrown the Portuguese out, how the Portuguese were the rightful rulers of that country and how the people of East Timor wanted the Portuguese back. That is absolutely outrageous and incorrect. At the time the Indonesians came into East Timor, East Timor was in a state of civil war. The Portuguese had left, had walked out on the East Timorese people and left them to a blood bath that had 40,000 East Timorese moving over to Indonesian Timor, which was West Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> It is universally recognised that no matter how bad the Indonesians might be-and I do not think they are bad-the Portuguese were far worse. They did nothing for health, they did little for education, and their civil liberties record I think would not stand the test at all. For the honourable member for Moreton to get up and praise the Portuguese, and say they are the rightful rulers of that country, I find too much to accept. </PARA>
<PARA> At another time, at the appropriate time-at a time which is in accordance with the ethics of this Parliament-I certainly wish to speak a lot more on that particular subject. But I did want to put on record tonight that I totally dissociate myself from the comments made by the honourable member for Moreton in the other place earlier this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The information provided in the answer to House of Representatives Question on Notice No.1334 of 16 June 1989 reflected the previous accounting approach of providing detailed information on the costs of the input items such as fuel, rather than relating the cost of such inputs to the achievement of specific Defence objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> The changes resulting from the introduction of Program Management and Budgeting has rectified this problem. Defence expenditure is now presented by Program and sub-program which, in effect, gives the same overall level of details on expenditure but from an objective and activity perspective rather than one based on input costs. There is no readily available means of relating these two approaches. Between 1988-89 and 1989-90 there was a further change in presentation as Defence moved from an initial Five Program Structure to an Eight Program Structure.</PARA>
<PARA> The following tables show Defence expenditure in 1988-89, 1989-90 and estimated expenditure for 1990-91 for the equivalent of the previous expenditure categories of supporting equipment and stores and repairs and overhaul.</PARA>
