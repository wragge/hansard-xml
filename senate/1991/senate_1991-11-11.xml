<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question was to be directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade but I guess it is now to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. There was a time when the Leader of the Government in the Senate used to advise us in advance of these necessary absences from the chamber, but that courtesy seems to have been lost these days. I ask the Minister: in the light of the further bombardment of Dubrovnik and street fighting in Vukova, what decision has the Australian Government made in relation to joining the European Community, the US and Canada in imposing economic sanctions on Yugoslavia in an effort to press the parties to respect the cease-fire?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Hill knows, the European Community has been leading the diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. Last Friday the Community decided to impose a range of measures against Yugoslavia. It is probably not necessary for me to go through those measures: they are largely trade and aid related matters which I think have been published in the newspapers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EC has been supported in these measures by the United States and Canada. My colleague Senator Gareth Evans told the Senate last week that Australia would also support the European Community actions. It is important that the international community does support these efforts. The Government will be consulting and looking at the details of the European Community measures as they become clear and at what action Australia might take to support those measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government would act only to make it absolutely clear to the Yugoslav parties, and the Yugoslav National Army in particular, the abhorrence of Australia and the rest of the international community to the violence taking place in Yugoslavia. There is still hope that some reason will prevail. We will continue to support European and United Nations efforts to find a peaceful solution in Yugoslavia.</PARA>

Am I correctly interpreting that the Minister said that Australia has decided that it will impose sanctions but it has not decided what sanctions or when they will take effect? If that is correct, I draw to the Minister's attention the position of Canada, which has already outlined the sanctions that it has imposed and, furthermore, has said that they are to have immediate effect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Will the Minister confirm whether a countervailing duty of $A20 is imposed on Canadian pigs entering the United States? I ask the Minister to describe what measures this Government is taking to counter unfair trading by Canada, especially with regard to subsidies to its pork producers. Will the Government consider implementing immediately special measures to allow for the increased grain and feed costs to pig producers caused by the present drought?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2796" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not necessarily take those questions in the order that they were asked, because the concept of Canadian pigs entering the United States at a subsidised rate perhaps requires some special treatment at the end of my answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government is aware of concerns of pork producers in Australia. According to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, there is an acceptable risk that the pigs do not carry any disease and thus are acceptably disease free. Senator Bell may recall that a major argument that the industry raised was that there was some transmissible disease present, but that has now been taken care of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aware that the industry continues to be concerned that, since July 1990, Canadian pig meat has been available in its frozen form to come to Australia. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy monitors the situation and, together with the industry&mdash;in this case the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council&mdash;is investigating whether or not there is a possible subsidy for this pork. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for the year 1990-91, 1,000 tonnes of frozen pig meat valued at $4.4m came from Canada. That should be compared with the Australian production of 310,000 tonnes, or a value of $660m, for the same period. That is to say, the Canadian imports represent 0.3 per cent of production and 0.7 per cent of value. They are not a significant presence in the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the Government's intention to provide any payment to Australian pork producers. If there is a belief about dumping, the Government has taken steps recently to simplify the regulations and processes in taking applications about dumping. The Australian Pig Industry Policy Council, it was thought, might do that. It has not. It is now rumoured that some producers may. Thus far they have not. It is not a government function to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the last question about what subsidies apply to Canadian pigs entering the United States, according to the brief on this point, on the matter of United States investigations of subsidies of Canadian pig meat, the US did apply a countervailing duty of 9c Australian per kilogram in 1990 on imports of fresh processed pig meat from Canada. However, the Canadian Government challenged the US countervailing duty through the appeal mechanisms of the Canada-US free trade agreement. The US international trade commission subsequently determined that subsidies provided under the Canadian national tripartite stabilisation program were countervailable, but there was no threat of material injury to US pork producers. As a result, the countervailing duty was subsequently dropped and all duties previously paid on fresh pork were refunded to Canadian processors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all honourable senators will know, Senator Maguire assiduously pursues questions relating to aircraft safety in Australia, and I commend him for it. I have been given some advice by the Civil Aviation Authority on this matter. I am advised by the CAA that there are no Australian Boeing 767 aircraft with the same engine-airframe combination as was involved in the Thai accident in May this year. However, there was initial precautionary action taken in the form of an airworthiness directive taken by the United States Federal Aviation Administration on 16 August which involved the deactivation of thrust reversers on these aircraft. By Civil Aviation Authority agreement with Qantas Airways Ltd, eight of the Qantas Boeing 767-300 aircraft were temporarily modified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, further investigation into the accident revealed that in the systems of other types of engine such as General Electric, as are used in Qantas aircraft, and Rolls-Royce, the deployment of the thrust reversers in flight could not occur. Subsequently, the original United States FAA requirement for these engine types was rescinded and the thrust reversers in Qantas aircraft have now been returned to normal operation. The Australian Civil Aviation Authority is maintaining a very close watching brief on the situation in case of any matters of relevance to Australian domestic or overseas carriers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has proposed the removal of four navigation aids from the Spencer Gulf in South Australia. There is concern that their removal is potentially dangerous for the small vessels, trawlers and recreational boats which rely on these aids, and that their removal will bring consequential costs to the community for search and rescue missions at sea. Will the Minister comment on these concerns, the status of the proposal and the Government's response to it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crowley has been pursuing this issue with me. I can advise her that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority is conducting a review of navigation aids provided in Spencer Gulf. Under arrangements that have existed since 1934 the Commonwealth Government does take responsibility for the efficient marking of ocean highways and coastal shipping tracks, apart from their termination points. All the costs of operating the Commonwealth network are met by commercial shipping through a levy which is imposed. The provision of port, river and navigation aids for inner waterways is the responsibility of the State governments or the local authorities concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year it was concluded that the four navigation aids that have been referred to by Senator Crowley were redundant to the requirements for the safe and efficient navigation of commercial shipping. The review included consideration by the Maritime Services Advisory Committee, which is a consultative body providing advice to AMSA on planned changes to the navigation aids system. The Committee comprises representatives from the shipping industry, including the Australian National Maritime Association, the Australian Chamber of Shipping, the Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Office and AMSA. Following consultation with their respective associations and ships' masters who are actually transiting the area, in October 1990 the Committee confirmed that the commercial shipping industry did not have a continuing requirement for these navigation aids in Spencer Gulf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of Commonwealth and State navigation aids in northern Spencer Gulf which do mark hazards and allow fixing of position on the recommended shipping track and port approaches. In relation to one of the four aids nominated by AMSA for decommissioning, known as the middle bank beacon, I am advised that the decision to continue this as a Commonwealth navigation aid was based on the surrounding area already being adequately covered by other Commonwealth navigation aids. In relation to the navigation aids in the other three locations in the Gulf, the argument for their retention appears to be based upon their use as port approach aids, which is a State responsibility. Hence, AMSA proposes to decommission these four navigation aids unless the South Australian Department of Marine and Harbors is prepared to assume responsibility for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AMSA has been consulting with the Department of Marine and Harbors on this matter and is always prepared to examine proposals for more cost effective operational practices in relation to the provision and maintenance of marine navigation aids.

The situation is that these navigation aids are no longer needed for this purpose. That is a joint view of all of the industry parties that have been consulted by AMSA.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter falls within the portfolio of the Minister for Resources under the portfolio of Primary Industries and Energy. I have some comments to make on the subject. The meat export industry has been very concerned for some time about the use of metal shot for cattle mustering. The practice often results in metal pellets being lodged in the meat which are not easily detectable with current technology. It has the potential to seriously jeopardise Australia's export meat trade and the Minister&mdash;in this case, Mr Griffiths&mdash;has strongly opposed it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter is one which falls within State-Territory responsibilities, however, and the Standing Committee on Agriculture has recommended that States and Territories develop, where appropriate, legislation prohibiting, from January this year, the non-fatal use of shotgun pellets on stock.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications. Has the Minister noted reports last week that Australia Post last year achieved a record $144.1m operating profit for 1990-91, over a $70.1m profit for the previous year, and that the Managing Director of Australia Post, Ms Rae Taylor, said that her organisation's rate of growth had contracted sharply over the past two years and that its real achievement had been in its delivery performance? Is the Minister aware that in the past two years Australia Post has closed hundreds of country post offices, replacing them with franchises and agencies, and that this was done under pressure from the Federal Government in order to move the organisation to a commercial footing? Does this current record profit now mean that Australia Post has all but abandoned any concept of promoting public benefit before profit? Can the Minister give an unequivocal guarantee to those in rural Australia who rely so heavily on their postal services for vital communications and deliveries that their current services will not be reduced?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The performance of the Australian post office is indeed a primary concern of the Government. It is not simply a question of profits but the efficiency of performance that is a major aim of this kind of restructuring. Australia Post has achieved a record profit of $144.1m but it is important, from a customer point of view, to say that 94 per cent of mail was delivered on time and most of the balance was delivered within one day or more. The performance of the post office was measured against delivery standards that are generally a day faster than in countries such as Canada and the United States. I must note in passing that of great assistance to Australia Post's financial and delivery performance has been the lowest level of industrial disputation in the organisation since its establishment in 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other highlights of 1991 in terms of improved service to customers have been a productivity improvement of 1.6 per cent; the announcement of an independent monitoring of letter delivering service performance; a decrease in the basic postage rate in real terms for the sixth successive year, for the benefit of all Australians&mdash;those living in country areas as well as those living in urban areas; the opening of 30 new retail postal facilities; and the completion of a new network of parcel centres to improve delivery performance. From just those few things I have noted, it can be clearly seen that the very extensive restructuring that Australia Post has undergone is directed not only to improving service for customers but also to delivering it.</PARA>

Mr Ron Brown, a former Secretary to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, was the reporter. The review acknowledged the success of recent reforms to improve Comcare's performance, including a major reduction in the duration of claims lasting more than 28 days and a significant drop in the average premium rate charged by Comcare.

In particular, the question of co-payments in relation to the provision of some services needs to be correlated with other proposals, for example, to do with practice grants and so on. In other words, a complex bundle of proposals was put forward, which would indicate to an impartial observer that what was being attempted was a series of changes which, overall, if implemented, would bring about a change which would benefit those who seek the provision of medical advice, health advice, from the general practitioner.</PARA></TALK.START>

Nonetheless, because the representation came from the Western Australian Government to the Commission, the Commission has decided to have another look at the information that was before it and has also invited the Western Australian Government to submit any other information to it. The Commission has indicated to the Western Australian Government that it will consider any new information at its meeting on 21 November. Because that is so close to the 26 November date for a gazettal, it will not be gazetted then.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that the estimate now for the amount of money which was spent on Jobsearch allowance, Newstart and special benefit for newly arrived migrants under assurances of support was about $32m. Due to major difficulties in existing computer programs, only about $1.77m of that was raised as debts in 1991.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discrepancy between the $9m and the $32m arises because with the number of recipients to assurees one finds that there can be a change of name, names can be misspelt and also they can be anglicised.

Let us talk a bit about last week and the farce we had on the other side where the campaign manager for Mr Keating, the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson&mdash;a senior member of the Hawke Government and the Hawke Cabinet&mdash;spent the whole week undermining his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in the meantime? In the meantime, apparently, a truce has been reached between Mr Keating and Mr Hawke. The question was, therefore, quite a reasonable one. In these new circumstances following the truce&mdash;following Senator Richardson writing letters to the newspaper announcing that the war is over&mdash;the question was: does Senator Button now give loyalty to the Prime Minister, and Senator Button said yes. But in answer to the supplementary question he said, `I am not prepared to speculate on the future. You never know, Mr Hawke might get run over by a bus'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what the New South Wales Right is like; it is a bus in most people's terms.

Their guerilla tactics are to attack, to undermine the Prime Minister&mdash;I remind honourable senators that this was coming from one of his senior Cabinet Ministers&mdash;to withdraw and go on radio all around Australia and say, `It's over. There's now a truce. We are with the Prime Minister. Mr Keating's fight is finished. We're not going to undermine him any further'. They wait a month or two, then build up the pressure again and undermine the Prime Minister. That is what happened up until the end of last week. </PARA>

It would not matter but for the fact that they are operating in an environment when nearly one million Australians are unemployed, and when this country is deserving of a government that concentrates on the task of government, rather than on undermining its own leadership.

He has done that two or three times in the past week. If that is the procedure which Senator Hill is condoning in the Senate, it is an absolute disgrace.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak in support of the motion just moved by Senator Hill and simply make the statement that I wanted to make earlier. The question I asked of Senator Button was not just any old question; it goes right to the heart of the paralysis of government of this nation. We have one million people unemployed, we are in a recession, bankruptcy rates are way above any rates for 60 years, people are hurting and people's lives are being destroyed, yet all this Government continues to do is squabble and fight about who will have the leadership and the spoils of office.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. If Senator McMullan was listening, he would have heard me say that the reason we need to address this question is that this Government is in a state of paralysis; we have no leadership; the Government has no direction; and the people of Australia are suffering. That is why we should suspend Standing Orders. If Senator Button chooses to call that an inconvenience, that about sums up how he regards the business of government and the business of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Senator Button gave a very cute answer and said, `I support the leader'. When he is put to the sticking point on whether Mr Hawke will remain leader, all he can say is, `It is Mr Hawke, unless he is run over by the proverbial bus'. This surely casts great insincerity and great doubt over the grand statements over the weekend of Senator Richardson, who wrote letters to the paper and made statements all over the radio waves saying that the challenge is off, nothing will happen and we will have a truce. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, he does always say that. One could say that the last time it was building up to a challenge Senator Richardson made exactly the same statement. But how curious it is that Senator Button chose to use the bus analysis. Only in September last, when asked whether there was a third candidate in the offering, Senator Richardson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not looking for a third candidate myself, but I would have thought that if the bus factor came into play and it ran over Hawke and Keating this afternoon, I think I'd probably have my money on Beazley.</PARA>
<PARA>So the bus analogy is well and truly on the agenda. One could well and truly say&mdash;at a time when this nation and the Government are paralysed; unemployment is rising; the recession is biting; the bankruptcy figures are higher than they have been for 60 years; and the Treasurer, Mr Kerin, has been told that he has to recant and re-educate himself and correct the statement he made overseas that he really did not mean to say the truth, that it was the worst recession for 60 years&mdash;that the leadership issue in this Parliament is alive and well and on foot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only ask now whether there is any way of insisting that this Government come to terms with its responsibilities and understand that it is allegedly the government of the day. Senator Richardson will be known from here on in as `the bus driver', with or without his licence&mdash;that will remain with us. But the question is: how long can Senator Button go on representing Mr Hawke in this place without saying that he will remain loyal to him?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this motion is to allow us to discuss the very important issue of whether this Government and its Leader in the Senate have any loyalty to Mr Hawke. We must debate this issue because there have been continual statements from senior Labor Ministers that there will be no challenge to the leadership. This goes back to 2 February this year when Senator Richardson said, `All I can say is that there is no challenge on. I just think this is all nonsense'. On 20 May, Senator Richardson said, `I can see absolutely no need for a challenge. The best thing for Labor is the team that is there now with both Hawke and Keating leading us'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 17 September, Senator Richardson said, `We've not got a challenge planned'. That statement meant absolutely nothing. The challenge ground on. On 3 October, Senator Richardson said, `There is no point in a challenge. It is not anywhere on my list of priorities'&mdash;not anywhere publicly, but privately the challenge went on until it reached a peak last week. It reached such a peak that the leadership of the Labor Party had to gather together to try to hose the situation down. </PARA>

Of course, we then have to assess how meaningful that statement is in the context of Senator Richardson's continual statements. But it is vitally important to this nation that the Leader of the Government in the Senate state whether he supports the Prime Minister, not the prime ministership.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. Senator Button has drawn our attention to the very reason this particular issue is now being debated. Senator Bishop's question required a very simple answer, and it was this: `Yes, I will remain loyal to the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke'. That is the only answer that was required. But Senator Button chose to answer the question in a way which can only be interpreted as raising the issue of leadership again. The Minister said that, if the proverbial bus arrived, that would change everything. Of course, that is the issue which we are trying to clarify: if the proverbial bus arrives and the choice has to be made, will Senator Button remain loyal to the Prime Minister in whose Cabinet he serves and continues to serve, or will he dump this man, as he dumped Mr Hayden, and support Mr Keating? It is a very serious issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have before us is not that Mr Keating has called off his challenge but that a truce has been called. In other words, the fight will continue but at a lower level. We are quite entitled in this chamber to ask a senior Minister of the Government whether he is loyal to Mr Hawke. He has refused, for the second day in a row, to give a clear, uncomplicated answer, and on that basis he stands condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I wish to make in support of the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders is that it would be very easy for Senator Button and Senator Richardson to kill this issue stone dead. All it requires of Senator Button is to stand up and say that under no circumstances will he support Mr Keating, that he deplores his efforts to undermine the Prime Minister and that under no circumstances will he vote for Mr Keating. That is all he and Senator Richardson have to say. If that is said, then the leadership challenge is off. That is why I support the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders so that we can debate this vital issue of the Labor Party leadership. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition, I join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in expressing our regret at the recent death of former Senator Lawrence Wilkinson. Senator Button outlined former Senator Wilkinson's background and experience before coming to this place. He also outlined his contribution to the Senate, serving on a number of different committees during his eight years, approximately, in the Senate. The Opposition recognises that distinguished contribution. We also recognise the work and effort he particularly made in the areas of primary industry and telecommunications. He died just before his eighty-eighth birthday. On behalf of Opposition senators, I extend our sincere sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Former Senator Lawrence Wilkinson was not known to any of the Democrat senators. Indeed, he served in this chamber before the Australian Democrats came into existence in 1977. Nonetheless, it is clear from the resume of his career both before he entered parliament and after he was a senator that he served the Senate well, he served his constituents well and he was clearly a credit to the institution of parliament. Accordingly, we join with both the Government and the Opposition in supporting this condolence motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am honoured to support this condolence motion regarding former Senator Lawrie Wilkinson. He was the first Quaker to serve in Federal Parliament; so for that reason, among others, I have felt a special link with Lawrie and his family. I must admit that it was the late Nancy Wilkinson, Lawrie's lifelong partner, who gave me very strong encouragement to get increasingly involved in community lobbying for disarmament and justice. Unfortunately, she died some months before I began campaigning for the Senate, but I know she would have been delighted in my being here arguing the issues so dear to her heart. Lawrie was always supportive of my role here, although different from his role as a Labor senator, and I certainly appreciated that support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first met Lawrie Wilkinson in 1972 when I started attending Quaker meetings in Perth. He was a Western Australian senator at that stage. His parliamentary career may have been much longer than the 1966 to 1974 period had it not been for a new ruling within the Labor Party at the time of the double dissolution in 1974 to the effect that any candidate who turned 65 years of age in the sitting period beyond that election had to be endorsed by three-quarters of the State executive, and Lawrie was just one vote short of that endorsement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe time out of parliament proved more fruitful for Lawrie's lobbying on the issues which were of fundamental importance to him. When I first landed in the Quaker circles in Perth, Lawrie and Nancy and another Quaker couple, Cyril and Elsie Gare, provided very important role models for me. One thing that had attracted me to Quakerism was that this group seemed to be very active in the moratorium movement opposing Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war. The peace testimony is something to which Lawrie was absolutely committed, and I admired that steadfastness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wilkinsons worked tirelessly for the Quaker movement throughout Australia and internationally, always challenging people's beliefs and commitments in a positive way. In fact, they were great planetarians, not bound by the confines of nationalism or parochialism. Consequently, they were strong advocates of the United Nations organisation as a vehicle for social change towards a more equitable society. It is highly appropriate that one of their offspring, Harold Wilkinson, is now national President of the United Nations Association of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am referring to the pair of Wilkinsons in these remarks. It is important for me to include Nancy in this condolence motion because this was an unusually strong partnership. This is not to say that each was not a strong individual; but they made an amazingly effective team as catalysts for change. They understood well that without justice there can be no peace, and were prepared themselves to live simply in order to share resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working through the United Nations provided them with a platform to argue for a new social order&mdash;and not, I hasten to add, along the lines of President Bush's new world order. No, this was to be a world with a just, participatory and sustainable society. Many of the issues are much more acceptable nowadays but were quite radical when I was first aware of them through the Wilkinsons espousing such visions in the early 1970s; and they had probably already been on that track for some time prior to that. They were indeed ahead of their time. For such consistent and generous work, Lawrie was honoured with life membership of the United Nations Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support for budding peace workers and other activists for change was important to the Wilkinsons. Many a weekend planning meeting took place in the shack on the Wilkinsons' farm at Wooroloo outside Perth. One that I knew a lot about in the early 1980s was the Pacific Peacemaker Project, where the Ethell family of Perth were strongly supported by the Wilkinsons to embark on their ambitious project to sail right across the Pacific in protest against Trident submarines. It was a tremendous voyage which would be as relevant now as it was then&mdash;despite the welcome cuts in tactical nuclear weapons recently announced but which do not cover the long range ballistic missiles carried by the deadly Trident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another community group which received Wilkinson support, and in which I was involved, was Project Iceberg. This was a group of people prepared to undergo direct action to the point of committing civil disobedience in relation to the intrusion into our ports of nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered warships. Many useful actions were undertaken and, as long as they were absolutely non-violent, these were supported by the Wilkinsons. That kind of backing from experienced campaigners such as the Wilkinsons and the Gares was much appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being people very concerned about the future, the Wilkinsons carefully planned two foundations to ensure that, after their time had passed, others could follow on their work and they would continue to be supported. The Oikumene Foundation continues to fund research and action oriented projects directed towards justice and equity issues. The Glenburnie program is a fund affiliated with the Australian Council of Churches, giving tangible support towards ecumenical work, particularly in the context of liberation theology; that is, encouraging people of any Christian persuasion to actually live the message of the gospels. That is what I saw the Wilkinsons attempting to do, to their credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lawrie Wilkinson will be missed by his friends&mdash;especially Quakers and United Nations members, for whom I can speak to some degree&mdash;and by people who respect his hard work. His contribution towards making the world a better place was substantial. It is so good that the tasks undertaken by Lawrie and Nancy Wilkinson live on through the Oikumene Foundation and the Glenburnie programs which they instituted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His family, too, will sorely miss Lawrie's gentility, his compassion and his good humour. He was a very funny man who could always do a good turn in entertaining people gathered together either for celebration or for heavy deliberations. If some light relief were needed, Lawrie could provide it. I support all of Lawrie's family in honouring him and in giving thanks for the life of Lawrie Wilkinson. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to associate myself with the remarks in the condolence motion for the former Senator Lawrie Wilkinson. I knew Lawrie very well in my early days of political involvement and for many years thereafter we continued to see him as a resident here in Canberra because his sons, Harold and Alan, lived here and Lawrie was here to be with them in his later years. I always knew him as an honourable and principled man, and a diligent and very competent senator, both on issues and on a constituency basis. He set some standards of constituency work to which I have strived, perhaps unsuccessfully, to equal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I knew him mainly because of his activities in opposition to the war in Vietnam, in opposition to conscription and, subsequently, more broadly under the general heading of peace; but particularly in our joint efforts in Western Australia in the 1960s and early 1970s in opposition to the war in Vietnam and in opposition to conscription. I note with interest that that was the first subject he raised in the Parliament. In his first speech here he dealt first of all with the issue of Vietnam and conscription. That was very appropriate because it was then the issue that was dominating the political agenda and it was that issue on which he had been most active. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is never possible to sum up the contribution of a complex human being who has been involved in a wide range of issues, but I think he was a very committed and distinguished citizen. He contributed to all the groups of which he was a part and to the society as a whole. I respected him greatly. I do not know all the members of his family well but I want particularly to refer to and express my condolences to his sons, Harold and Alan, whom I regard both as very good friends and as following very much in Lawrie's footsteps as outstanding citizens through, in Harold's case, the United Nations Association and very many other organisations, and, in Alan's case, through his work for AIDAB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not always agree with Lawrie Wilkinson. We often did agree on matters, but, as with all citizens with whom one has robust debate over 20-odd years, from time to time we disagreed about issues. I always respected the integrity with which he developed his views and projected them. I always enjoyed his friendship. He was made a life member of the ALP, which was a very suitable recognition for the long years of work which he gave to the Party and to the society of which he was a member. I join with other senators in supporting this condolence motion and in mourning the passing of Lawrie Wilkinson. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NE4">Senator BEAHAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator McMullan, I first met the former Senator Lawrie Wilkinson prior to joining the ALP during the early 1960s when I was involved as an undergraduate in the movement opposing the war in Vietnam. Former Senator Wilkinson and his wife, Nancy, were closely involved with that movement. His involvement, and that of Nancy too, was of a special kind. Both of them were interested in rational analysis. While their feelings about the war and its effects both on Australians and Vietnamese were clearly strong and their emotions involved, they were at pains to analyse the historical background and the current nature of the conflict so that they were in a position to explain rationally and logically to young people their reasons for opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus it was that they were such strong supporters of the teach-in movement which became so influential in turning opinions during the later 1960s and early 1970s. The same interest in rational analysis, sometimes stemming from strong and emotionally charged concerns about issues, also influenced the way both former Senator Wilkinson and his wife approached other policy issues. I was involved with many of them in later years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was interested in new ideas which challenged the orthodoxy that prevailed at the time. He maintained his involvement with young people. He maintained his involvement with education and, above all else, he maintained his involvement with the idea of rational analysis. He pursued these interests through the ALP, which he became a life member of; through the Fabian Society, which is the intellectual arm of the Left movement within Australia; through the society of Quakers, as has already been mentioned by Senator Vallentine; and through the United Nations Association, which he also became a life member of and of which his son is now the national President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a strong supporter of the role of the United Nations, as Senator Vallentine has already pointed out, in its maintenance of peace and world order. Although I have not met him in recent years, I think he must have been heartened by the growing stature and importance of the United Nations in recent months and years, however one defines that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Wilkinson and his wife were people with deeply held convictions and a great deal of integrity. They were concerned about the need for a peaceful world; about the need for a more just and equal distribution of wealth; and about the need for more equal opportunities for all the people who make up the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the best way of summing up former Senator Wilkinson's life, both as a politician and as a member of the community, is by saying that he was a man of very strong principles. I did not always agree with his position on issues and, like Senator McMullan, I often argued with him. But he was a man who stood steadfastly behind his chosen position, as did his wife, Nancy. I convey my sympathy to his family and to his friends and join with other senators in supporting this condolence motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, as the longest serving Labor Party senator from Western Australia, I, too, want to be associated with this motion of condolence. Indeed, if my memory is correct, only Senator Durack was actually a member of the Senate when Lawrie Wilkinson was also a senator. I did not directly replace Lawrie Wilkinson. Gordon McIntosh was his more direct replacement. But we both came into the Senate after the 1974 election, at which time, of course, Lawrie Wilkinson ceased to be a member of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike Senator Vallentine, who first met Lawrie Wilkinson in 1972, I met him in the late 1960s at a time when the great moral issue in Australian politics was Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war and the associated issue of conscription&mdash;the same time as Senator Vallentine was joining the Country Party. I believe that there was no stronger opponent of the war in Vietnam and conscription than Lawrie Wilkinson or I and the other Labor senators who have spoken, including Western Australian Labor senators and former Western Australian, Senator McMullan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first contested, unsuccessfully, the Federal seat of Moore in 1969, Lawrie Wilkinson was associated with that campaign and to a limited extent&mdash;to the same limited extent that I did&mdash;toured around the electorate and spoke to people. We produced a very large swing in Moore, as we received in Western Australia generally at that time, but not enough to win the seat. I suppose, thinking of my own career in politics, it is probably just as well because had we managed to win Moore, we would have lost it again in 1972 and that probably would have been the end of me in politics, which some people probably think would have been a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lawrie was a life member of the Labor Party. I am not sure whether in his latter years he was primarily a Labor Party supporter and voter or whether he was supporting latter-day Peaceniks like Senator Vallentine who, as I mentioned earlier, were joining the Country Party in the 1960s when the war in Vietnam was actually the dominant issue. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department has investigated the drafting oversights raised in your letter and has confirmed the conclusions of the Senate Committee.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">(COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">REGULATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STATUTORY RULES 1991 NO.266</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parent Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 is intended to provide for the protection of the health and safety of Commonwealth employees at work. The Regulations provide for elections under the Act and for machinery matters relating to advice, investigations and inquiries. The Committee was concerned at the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)An eligible voter at an election for health and safety representatives may request a secret ballot. However, there is no provision for voters to be informed of this right, despite other detailed provisions for voters to be informed of other aspects of the election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)A voter is required to indicate a preference by placing the number "1" in a box opposite the name of a Candidate. Thus, there appeared to be no option of placing a tick or a cross or any other indication of choice. However, another later regulation provided that a ballot paper is only informal if, among other things, the intention of the voter is not clear. Under this provision such intention could be made clear by using a tick or some other indication other than the number "1". Therefore, the two provisions may be contradictory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)If a candidate requests a recount then the returning officer must conduct a recount. Therefore, the returning officer does not have a discretion to refuse a request for a recount. However, the returning officer does have discretions in the conduct of a recount, which include to admit or reject votes, to declare an election void where there are reasonable grounds to believe there has been an irregularity, or where it is "just" to declare the election void because of illegal practice. There was no indication on the face of the instrument whether these discretions were subject to review of their merits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)The returning officer must notify the winner of the election. However, there is no requirement that unsuccessful candidates must be notified, not even a provision that the result should be publicly notified and displayed in the way that the holding of the election and the notification of the candidates are required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)A certain type of notice issued by an investigator must only be in an approved form, not in a prescribed form. These notices cover serious matters such as taking possession of plant and issuing prohibition notices and improvement notices. These notices appear to be at least as important as search warrants and should therefore be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Less important notices are set out in full detail in the regulations themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6)There are various drafting errors in the regulations which, although not affecting validity, should be corrected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ORDER NO.L10/91</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This instrument substitutes a new Form which gives information relating to the consignment of live-stock by ship or aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument requires that the original of the Form must be "posted" to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation no later than the first working day after the departure overseas of a consignment of stock to which it refers. This would appear to be an appropriate provision, to which the Committee has no objection. However, the same clause then provides that if the number of stock in the consignment changes, or the destination of part or all of the consignment changes, the licensee must send an amended Form to the Corporation "by facsimile transmission", not later than the first working day after the consignment arrives at its final port of discharge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee asks why posting would not be sufficient in this case as well. The Explanatory Statement advises that the purpose of the Form is to provide the Corporation with statistical information which is used to analyse markets and to determine the levies payable by exporters. The Committee accepts that these are important matters, but is concerned that the instrument may force licensees to obtain a facsimile machine to send amendments of a form, the original of which may be sent by post. The Committee also accepts that there may be valid reasons for the apparent urgency with which amendments of the Form are needed, as compared to the original. Nevertheless, the Committee would like to be assured that people exporting live-stock are not having to incur additional expense which may be avoidable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of other Commonwealth departments and agencies have been moving towards electronic transmission of information, with the relevant delegated legislation being amended accordingly. This is a development which should generally improve the administration of parent Acts and regulations and assist users who wish to avail themselves of these new procedures. However, in such cases the Committee is anxious to ensure that small businesses, or those which are not affected frequently by the new provisions, are not disadvantaged by them. The Committee in these cases usually tries to ensure that there is no obligation to use the new electronic methods, and that users if they wish may continue with the older, manual, paper entries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present concerns of the Committee relate to this general concern that smaller businesses should not suffer commercially through the introduction of a new system.</PARA>

<PARA>I note from this annual report that last year Australia Post achieved a record $144.1m operating profit for 1990-91, and a profit of over $70.1m for the previous year.

I wonder whether the alternative to closure could have been to have offered small agencies the same rights as Australia Post is now giving to agents to have more flexible hours. This should be borne in mind in the light of this report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the tremendous profit made by Australia Post, it has said that at the beginning of January it will increase the price of stamps once again.

We also know that we cannot now send telegrams but are able to send only lettergrams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a new way that Australia Post will charge for the sending of parcels in future. There was a piece in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on Friday, 8 November 1991 saying that if one plans to mail a Christmas present, one could be in for a shock. We are told that the taxpayers are no longer subsidising Australia Post, but if taxpayers are mailing parcels and paying higher prices to do so, they are still subsidising Australia Post in a certain way. The article said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to deal with the annual report of the Australian Postal Corporation and to note that the report talks about its increased productivity. However, much as we welcome that and the fact that postage costs have increased at a lower rate than has inflation, the fact is that with the very large amounts of capital investment that have gone into Australia Post, it is important that there should be such a significant increase in productivity. In fact, one wonders whether there is not great scope for further increases in productivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is unfortunate to notice that the number of postal articles handled last year went up by only 1.7 per cent; the report says, because of the recession. Nonetheless, there was a significant increase in expenditure of 5.8 per cent. When we get increases in expenditure which so significantly increase expenses in business, clearly a problem is developing. It may simply be that the recession which the Government engineered has caused problems for Australia Post. Nevertheless, there does seem to be some trend towards increasing costs in handling each item that I hope can be offset more effectively by this evident trend towards greater efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, we see in the tables provided that expenditure was $1,450.2m in 1986-87 and that 3,438.5 million articles were handled. There has been a 40 per cent increase in expenditure but only a 20-something per cent increase in the total number of articles handled through the mail network. Costs, no doubt as a result of inflation, have been going up. One would hope that even further attention will be given by Australia Post to the need to continue and hasten the efficiency of its services. That is absolutely vital. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of those key infrastructure elements that is a major cost to large sections of Australian industry on which the cost base, unfortunately, rests in many industries. Some of those industries feel that they are not getting as fair a go as they would hope to get from Australia Post. I think that we can commend Australia Post on its efforts, but also note that there is still a great deal to be done to reduce costs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer briefly to what I believe should be the Commission's responsibilities in the carriage of certain mail. I refer to the International Convention for the Suppression of the Circulation of, and Traffic in, Obscene Publications. Australia Post is making a good deal of money out of the distribution of X-rated videos from this particular city. One of those videos was received in my office in December 1989. I wrote to the relevant Minister, Senator Michael Tate, in March 1990. This video was received without any request from our office. It had two words, both commencing with `F', in its title. If I mentioned the title I am sure I would be contravening Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has just come to my attention that that same video, an X-rated video, coming through Australia Post, was one which clearly influenced a person who, in February 1990, pleaded guilty to rape and indecent assault in Victoria. I have the details of the case with me. I am very disappointed that in late 1989&mdash;I think it was in December&mdash;my amendment to the Postal Services Act through which I sought to prevent Australia Post from carrying this material into the States was unsuccessful. It was unsuccessful by one vote. I am sorry to say that whilst my amendment was supported by the whole of the Opposition and, at that time, by quite a number of Australian Democrats, not one honourable senator on the Labor side voted for that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is increasing concern being expressed in the community about this material being forwarded via Australia Post to various States.

I think it is up to Australia Post to look at that convention to see whether it has obligations under that convention, and whether it agrees that there should be some legislative or administrative measure which will prevent this type of material being sent, either solicited or unsolicited, to the other States from Canberra. I would also like to indicate that I will be following up with the Postal Commission the effectiveness or otherwise of its investigation branch. </PARA>

I notice that the annual report of the Australian Postal Commission says that while the bulk of its services is concentrated in cities and regional centres, Australia Post is committed to providing regular mail services to the most distant parts of the nation, using 3,300 contractors who are managed by staff based at regional centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make the point that during the recent strike in New South Wales some of those mail services did continue to operate on the day of the strike; but some other services did not operate on the day of the strike to areas where the mail service runs on only every second day. I would have thought that the mail should get through. I imagine that that has always been the way in the past when people swam across flooded creeks with mailbags on their backs or, as we sometimes had to do, pulled a mailbag swinging in the middle of an endless rope across the creek. I think it is quite sad that just recently during that strike that type of action was not taken. If the people providing this service were not going to work on the day of the strike, it is a pity that they then did not deliver the mail to the people on that mail run the next day. As I said, it meant that no mail went through for three days which is not to be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also notice that changes to letter delivery timetables followed market research. I know that there are some problems in the northern part of the State where mailboxes have been taken away completely and people are not getting any delivery of mail service outside some towns or cities because it is regarded as being non-profitable. When we see that so much profit is being made by Australia Post, we should also look at the services that are provided to the people in those communities by Australia Post. </PARA>

It is just as important for somebody in a country area to get a solicitor's letter or a cheque as it is for another person in a city area to receive that letter or cheque or whatever it happens to be.

<PARA>In doing so, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on the dairy industry and the Industry Commission report, particularly at a time when so much is being said about international competitiveness, streamlining, cost cutting and so on. I would like to say a few words to the credit of the dairy industry at this time because it has had 20 most traumatic years and in that time it has delivered so much&mdash;probably more than any other primary industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, in 1971 there were 43,293 farms and by 1990 this had fallen to 14,728&mdash;a drop of two-thirds. In 1971, there were 2,833,000 cows which by 1990 had reduced to 1,631,000 cows&mdash;a drop of about half. In 1971, the average production per cow was 2,609 litres, which by 1990 had increased by virtually 50 per cent to 3,804 litres. This was done through good management, good breeding and good feeding, and that is all to do with the excellence of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with New Zealand, Australia is one of the two outstanding economically successful dairying countries in the world. The cost of production was cited as one of the indicators, and Australia and New Zealand produce milk at about 10c or 11c per litre. In the United States and the EC it is about 33c to 35c per litre and in Japan it is 60c per litre. In other words, the cost of production in the EC and the United States is almost three times the cost in Australia, and in Japan the cost is about five or six times the cost in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the Australian dairying industry operates under a very satisfactory scheme of management. It ensures the future of a very sound business; it operates in very diverse parts of Australia in every State; it is a high employer of labour; it works on an improving export situation; it is the highest value-adding primary industry in Australia; it provides very low priced products to Australian consumers, and every drop of Australian produced milk is processed in Australia. With the value-adding I mentioned, the value of the milk as produced is $1.7 billion. To that is added approximately $3 billion in value-adding to make a total of $4.7 billion. The export quota of that amounts to some $700m per year. That is a very good industry to have and we should make more of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not yet studied thoroughly the Industry Commission report due to a lack of time, but I find some of the figures very hard to reconcile. I will need to do some more work before I can agree with all of the figures I have inspected so far. I am surprised that there is no mention in anything that I have seen of the economic or sociological aspects of what Australia's general position would be if the recommendations were accepted. The comments seem to assume that the cost of milk or manufactured products is high or internationally uncompetitive, when clearly it is not so. The cost of dairy products to Australians&mdash;whether it is milk or products in a manufactured form&mdash;is amongst the lowest in the world. The dairy industry still has real growth potential; we can still earn export dollars and head off a lot of imports. The major importance of the industry in fringe rural areas needs to be taken into account and, most of all, Australia's productivity needs to be maintained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add a few words to the discussion of the report of the Industry Commission on the Australian dairy industry. I note that one of the main arguments in the report is that Australian consumers would get cheaper milk if controls in the Australian dairy industry were removed. Indeed, it contends that consumers paid $280m more for fresh milk and dairy products in 1989-90. I also note that the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further reductions in assistance must take place if the dairy industry is to maximise its contribution to national welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>It adds that the Australian industry has to prepare for increased competition from New Zealand dairy products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the report also recommends that assistance to the industry should be phased out in the next two to 10 years and that the Commonwealth should phase down maximum market support payments from 20 per cent of average export prices to 5 per cent by 1996. I also note that the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current policies, excessive resources are retained in the dairy industry and the costs of doing so are borne by the whole community. It would be more appropriate for the dairy industry to bear costs.</PARA>
<PARA>However, I ask honourable senators whether they honestly believe that the whole community would benefit if, in the long run, these proposed changes were to result in decreased production, a significant reduction in jobs and the industry being unable to compete on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission seems to believe that it is acceptable for Australia to become a dumping ground for European dairy products. It is asking Australian farmers and manufacturers once again to accept as right and proper prices which are based on the world market's dumped prices. We have seen this asked of producers in other rural industries. These prices are the result of political decisions in Brussels and Washington. They do not reflect retail prices in the exporting countries where consumers are paying more for their produce than consumers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian dairy industry is alive with innovation, technical progress and a driving will to compete. Our dairy foods are as good as, and in many cases better than, anything in the world. Dairy food exports earn more than $700m each year. The industry's major investments in research, technology and market development will see these export earnings grow. Dairy farm productivity is increasing by 5 per cent per year, as it has for the past decade. The industry's willingness to adapt to change means that it will benefit from even minor reforms in the international trading environment. Australians already buy premier quality dairy foods at prices which are as low as anywhere in the world&mdash;although sometimes, when one sees that the price of milk has gone up each time one goes to the supermarket, one cannot always agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Australian dairy farmers produce milk at a lower cost than farmers in Europe, the USA, Canada or Japan, thanks to our pasture based farming. In fact, few countries can produce quality dairy products as cheaply as Australia. More than 100,000 Australians have jobs thanks to the dairy industry. The industry provides about 20 per cent of employment in a number of important dairying regions. This is especially important in light of the particularly difficult times that rural Australia is now experiencing. Studies show that, for every 100 jobs in dairy factories, an additional 110 jobs are created in associated regional activities while the flow-on effects beyond the region are about as large again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dairying is indeed a very real industry. It is close to the people it employs, its products are part of everyone's day to day life, and it earns export dollars for all Australians. Currently, Australia's dairy industry manufactures many specialised products for markets here and overseas and its farmers currently produce milk valued at $1.7 billion each year, all of which is processed within Australia. On top of this, processed dairy foods are valued at about $4.5 billion a year, an added value of $3 billion annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representations to me from the Australian dairy industry indicated that it recognises that neither regulation nor protection offer a panacea for the problems created by unfair trade policies. However, the industry does advocate a thoughtful and cautious approach to addressing the future.

We have a great deal of concern for the dairy industry. In particular, I am concerned about the dairy industry because, not far from where I live in north Queensland, at Malanda, there is the largest capitalised dairy processing facility in Queensland. The quality of produce that is produced there is excellent. Most importantly, it is starting to get an enormous part of the export earnings for the dairy industry in this nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bjelke-Petersen has said, the dairy industry, through the Australian Dairy Industry Council, and particularly its Chairman, Mr Rowley, has already expressed the belief that subsidy in itself is not a panacea and nor is a totally free market environment. It stressed the importance of having a thoughtful and considerate view of the changes in the industry. We in the National Party of Australia believe that this is absolutely essential because the dairy industry does have a major role to play. As the incomes of people in South East Asia rise, so will their demand for products like cheese, milk and butter also rise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has become practice in the Senate in recent years to debate the Statements of Heads of Expenditure and the amounts charged thereto pursuant to section 36A of the Audit Act 1901&mdash;namely, the Advance to the Minister for Finance in the overall context of the consideration of the Budget and the immediate post Budget. This chamber passed the Appropriation Bills last Thursday evening or early Friday morning, so this is a consequential follow-on from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Advance to the Minister for Finance is supposed to be a form of contingency fund which, in effect, gives the government of the day authority to deal with unforeseen circumstances that may arise in the course of a financial year and which cannot be provided in the appropriations that are brought before the Parliament in the budgetary Bills. Funding which is a final charge on the Advance to the Minister for Finance does not go through the usual parliamentary scrutiny processes that the Budget bills are subject to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document that is the vehicle of Government Business Order of the Day No.1, the Advance to the Minister for Finance 1990, is a document which discloses those issues from the advances and their related expenditure that remained as a final charge to the advances as at 30 June 1991. That does not include, of course, all the funding that goes through the Advance to the Minister for Finance during the year. The annual Appropriation Acts appropriate funds to the Advance to the Minister for Finance to enable the Minister to, firstly, make advances that will be recovered during the financial year; secondly, make money available for expenditure where the Minister for Finance is satisfied that expenditure is urgently required and was unforeseen at the appropriate practical time or had been erroneously omitted from, or understated in, the relevant legislation; and, thirdly, make money available for expenditure, pending authorisation under section 32 of the Audit Act 1901. So the document that is the subject of debate now relates to the expenditure of only part of the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, namely, those issues from the advances and the related expenditure that remained as a final charge to the advances at the end of the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On many occasions, the Opposition has been very critical indeed of the use by this Government of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. As I said, it is supposed to be a contingency fund which has very tight provisions pertaining to it. Much of the expenditure is in that category that is supposed to be urgent and unforeseen. The Opposition believes that the Government has abused the Advance to the Minister for Finance to an increasing degree. It has used the Advance as a tool to approve funding that it seeks to shield from proper parliamentary scrutiny. As I said, funding for the final charges on the AMF does not go through the usual parliamentary scrutiny processes that the Appropriation Bills, the Budget Bills, are subject to. That comes up in the course of the next financial year after the expenditure has been incurred and after the proper processes of scrutiny have been completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen that process used par excellence in recent years where the Advance to the Minister for Finance has been used to fund secret deals to three Labor States over and above agreements reached at Premiers Conferences. Last year we had the disgraceful situation where deals were done with Tasmania and Western Australia, and I think South Australia, which totalled more than $70m. Those deals were done between the Government and individual Premiers at the time of the Premiers Conference but without any communication of those secret deals being made to the Premiers Conference as a whole. Therefore, the other Premiers were in ignorance of those deals until they were exposed by the Opposition here in the Senate several months later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, whilst the Advance to the Minister for Finance is a necessary piece of the Government's financial machinery, I repeat that it has been abused on many occasions in recent years. The Government, in particular the Department of Finance, woke up to that when, as a result of questions in the Senate Estimates committees and in this place, it did amend the guidelines in August to emphasise the need for government departments to make a greater effort in their applications for funds from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Indeed, the Finance minute that circulated the guidelines acknowledged that the changes have resulted from concerns expressed by the coalition at Senate Estimates committees. That was contained in memorandum 1991/24 of 25 July 1991. At the time we welcomed that change to the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the relevant Minister in this chamber at the appropriate time will be able to give the Committee a report on just how effective those changes to the guidelines have been, how much extra discipline they have imposed on the departments. In my criticisms before, I was being particularly critical of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for their use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. We had a classic example in June of this year when the Prime Minister, apparently without any authority from Cabinet or any consultation with other Ministers, during a spin through Queensland, approved use&mdash;or, to put it more correctly, abuse&mdash;of the Advance to the Minister for Finance for the purposes of payment of drought relief to Queensland. There was no question on our side of the chamber that it was appropriate to pay that drought relief, but we were very critical of the way in which it was done and the abuse that was made of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the guidelines have been changed, partly to try to shore up and prevent such abuses, I look forward to the Government providing to us, at an appropriate early time, a report on the operation of the new guidelines. Hopefully, we will see an improvement in the situation and the revised guidelines will make it more difficult for these sorts of payments to be made. The criticism, of course, extends to many departments throughout the bureaucracy. I am not suggesting that it has been a deal on the part of Ministers. There has been a lot of laxity by many departments in their accounting procedures and in their necessary notification and advance contacting, particularly with the Department of Finance in terms of its financial provisions. It is stretching a very long bow to include in the description of urgent and unforeseen many of the things that departments have claimed. Hopefully, the new guidelines will change that situation because they do emphasise the need for departments to be more specific about how a request for funds from the AMF fits in with the legislative requirements of the terms `unforeseen' and `urgent' expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No longer will departments be able to assume that requests for funding will be automatically approved. In the past, many applications merely stated that the request was urgent and unforeseen without specifying any particular reason at all. I believe those requests should have been subject to much greater scrutiny before they were approved. The new guidelines also state that the approving delegate may request additional information in order to be satisfied that the use of AMF funds is appropriate. That is a good thing. It will assist in avoiding the invidious situation that Ministers have put departmental officials in by ordering payments to be made from the AMF without providing adequate information. In that context I refer again to the payment earlier this year to Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to say any more on this matter at this stage. This document is a vehicle for debate; it is not in any way a document to express opposition to. It is a retrospective document because it relates to payments in the last financial year, 1990-91. As I have said, we have been highly critical of some of the individual payments and we have been highly critical of the procedures and the laxity that has applied on many occasions. This is a useful forum today to raise some of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To finish on a positive note, I welcome the changes that have been made in recent months to the guidelines. I look forward to seeing a report on them; hopefully, it will be positive. If it is a positive report, the Government, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Finance and the Senate ought to look at what is the appropriate size of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. It now totals more than $300m, of which $170m is associated with Appropriation Act (No. 1) and $140m with Appropriation Act (No. 2). They are very large amounts of money for payments that are not specifically contained in the Appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That figure has not increased as much over the last decade as, prima facie, I thought from an earlier examination it could have. It has not increased as outrageously. Given the changes in the guidelines and the need for tighter financial control in government, I think the actual amount requires a review. I suggest to the Government that, when reviewing the application of the new guidelines, it takes that into account. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, as a result of questions that I have asked at Estimates committee hearings, there has been an undertaking from the Department of Finance that it will now keep a register of all applications that are made in respect of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, including the number that fail. The interesting statistic will be which departments are more efficient than others and, in fact, get their figuring right in the first place, and those which cannot even get their first application for an advance correct. I think that will be quite a useful indicator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to draw on material which we gained today. It is interesting to look at the particulars of payments made from the Advance during October and to see how the claims compete in terms of worthwhileness. I would like to compare two such claims. The first is an advance of $3 1/2m to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services relating to emergency relief. The notes put forward in support of that Department's application are really quite revealing&mdash;it is information which otherwise does not see the light of day. The notes state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This unforeseen additional requirement arises from the Government's recent agreement to increase the overall provision for Emergency Relief to $14.342m. This decision recognises the high demand for Emergency Relief assistance being experienced as a result of the recession and especially related to the high unemployment levels. There is an historical peak demand period of call on Emergency Relief assistance in Nov-Dec and as agencies are currently drawing more heavily on the existing allocations than in the same period in past years, there is an urgent need to build up the quickly diminishing supply.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that, with the announcement that that money will be made available, there is an expectancy of quick delivery and, therefore, it is necessary to bring forward the December payment and to predicate the need for a subsequent additional payment to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could say that those payments are perhaps unforeseen. However, as the Government has told us that we are having a recession that we had to have&mdash;a recession which it personally planned&mdash;we could say that it should have made provision for the payments in the Budget itself. Nonetheless, the payments are being made to ease the enormous hardship that is being suffered in the community by individuals through no fault of their own but because of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to compare that drawing with an application made on behalf of the Governor-General's Office by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. If one looks at drawings against the Advance in terms of need and, perhaps, compassion, one wonders why it is necessary, in this period of hardship, to spend an additional $600,000 on a new kitchen in Government House and to `refurbish'&mdash;that is the word used in the supporting statement&mdash;the state guest rooms. One state guest who was coming&mdash;President Bush&mdash;is now not coming. One can only wonder whether these rooms were being refurbished so that he could stay in them. When we realise that a progress payment of some $147,000 was required for these rooms, we can only imagine the sumptuousness of the curtains, carpets and other titillations that will attach to those rooms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that it is not proper that we should have proper state accommodation for visiting dignitaries; I am not even saying that Government House may not need a new kitchen. I am saying that in a time of great hardship, when every dollar should be used to relieve the hardship of ordinary Australians, there is a great need for the Advance to meet additional payments for emergency relief. Despite this, we find that there is another plea, which has equal standing, to provide money to tart up&mdash;a phrase I have used previously&mdash;a few rooms in Government House. Perhaps this could have been postponed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when belts are being tightened, perhaps the tightening has to apply to everything. There is certainly a need for increased funding for emergency relief, although I say that the Government should have foreseen that that would be necessary. But I wonder whether it is necessary to spend that additional money simply to refurbish Government House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the payments, clearly, should have been expected. I note, for example, that last year there was an advance of $47,000 to the Office of Australian War Graves&mdash;not a very large sum, we would agree. I would have thought that War Graves, of all people, should have very little difficulty in assessing its expenditure ahead of time. This year, once again, we find that War Graves wants to spend more than a quarter of a million dollars over and above what it presented to the Parliament in the Appropriations Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">War Graves, of course, has had a continuing embarrassment over some Australian Construction Service projects in South Australia and New South Wales. I think these War Graves projects are a classic example of why the Opposition is so concerned&mdash;and Senator Short pointed this out&mdash;about the whole use to which the Advance to the Minister for Finance is being put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make it clear how the War Graves advance is currently being abused. We have had a whole saga in the Senate about the Rookwood garden of remembrance. You will recall, Madam Temporary Chairman, that I have been asking questions about this issue for just over a year. It has become known as the saga of the gold plated bricks at the Rookwood garden of remembrance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, that is coming back to the Parliament by way of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. It is asking for $73,000 balance on the final contract and a further $190,000 for delays due to industrial action and wet weather. But the answer which the Minister, Senator Bolkus, gave me some months ago was that the second contractor, who came in after Girvan Constructions went into liquidation, was being introduced so as to avoid industrial action. We have just gone through the appropriations process. The opportunity was there for senators to scrutinise the expenditure of the Office of Australian War Graves. It must have been well known then that there would be additional expenditure in relation to the Rookwood garden of remembrance. Was that made known and obvious to members of the Senate? No, it was not. Yet, only a few weeks later, we come back here and find that War Graves is looking for a further $263,000, which it must have known would be needed&mdash;or something in that vicinity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information that we have from the Government is that R. N. Cooper, who was the second contractor, originally submitted a final claim far in excess of the $263,000. The Government has not seen fit to advise the Senate how much it was in excess&mdash;we are just told it was `far in excess'. That amount was disputed by Australian Construction Services. The Government sought legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor and the Government Solicitor recommended that the Government should settle as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This project has not long been opened. It was due for completion back in 1989. In March, I referred the project to the Royal Commission into Productivity in the Building Industry in New South Wales, so dissatisfied was I with the blow-out in expenditure which had gone from $3.8m to $6m, by the Minister's own admission in the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the Minister's contradiction. The counsel assisting the Royal Commission advised the Commission that the output per brickie at times was as low as 50 per day, or lower. That tends to justify the concerns which were expressed previously in the Senate about this issue and which were pooh-poohed by Minister Bolkus, whose Department was responsible for the project. I draw attention to the annual report of the Australian War Graves for 1989-90. We are waiting eagerly to see what it will say this time, but at that time the report criticised the role of Australian Construction Services in the building of the two new gardens of remembrance, one of which was in Rookwood. The report said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The erection of the new gardens in South Australia and New South Wales could only be described as disastrous from the aspect of time, cost and quality . . . The employment of Australian Construction Services as the construction authority on any future major war graves projects must be carefully considered.</PARA>
<PARA>Here it is back asking for more money, but is it doing it up front and honourably? No, it is doing it by way of the Advance to the Minister for Finance to try to avoid any more embarrassment. In March the Minister, Senator Bolkus, in answering my question said that there had been overruns since R. N. Cooper had taken on the contract on 16 February 1990, although there had been overruns before that with Girvan Constructions. He said that the project had subsequently experienced delays resulting from wet weather combined with safety, industrial and some contractors' problems, although he did not spell out what those were. Of course, that had delayed it even further. The Minister went on to tell the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what we have is a contracting out arrangement which is subject to the vicissitudes of weather and the economy; one that has been entered into in accordance with normal and acceptable contracting practices; and one that is proceeding despite difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>This was all trying to give the Senate the impression that everything is fine and going along as normal, but the reality is quite different. Now we are being asked to look at the way the Advance to the Minister for Finance is being used. As Senator Short has already made clear, there are very fair and reasonable concerns on the part of the Opposition that embarrassments such as this are being quietly moved through the Parliament so that there will not be proper scrutiny. The Royal Commission in New South Wales is concerned about the issue, and I am very glad to see that at last the Government is starting to be concerned. </PARA>

When I asked him about the role of the BWIU, he claimed that it was gratuitous point-scoring on my behalf and refused to answer me on that issue. As I say, I am glad that his Government now recognises there are serious questions which need addressing by the Government, including dealing in a substantial way with fraud and collusion. But, by turning its eyes away from the reality of what was before it, the Government has cost Australian taxpayers dearly, and now it needs to pay urgent attention to the matter. Prevention would have been the most valuable way of dealing with an issue as important as this. However, having failed to prevent the expenditure, at the very least the Government should have insisted that this matter be spelt out in the Appropriation Bills for the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

It has been a very widespread complaint that there is often considerable delay before new overseas titles are published in Australia and that, in some cases, there is no publication in Australia at all. The Bill gives the publisher of a new overseas title 30 days in which to publish in Australia if the publisher wants to have control over distribution in Australia; if publication does not occur in that time, booksellers will be free to import copies without the publisher's licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)The Government does not accept that, as is proposed by the Senate amendment, a publisher of a new overseas title not published in Australia within 30 days should be able to retain some control over distribution of the book by reason of having made arrangements to publish an Australian version. If there is a perceived market for an Australian version, it will not be the same as the market for the original.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our position, upon consideration of the Copyright Amendment Bill, is that eight of the 10 amendments that we moved or were involved in supporting in this place now seem to be basically supported by the Government.

The Government in some way feels embarrassed if it has to concede Opposition amendments and return here with support after it has opposed the amendments in the Senate. Nevertheless, we are pleased that the Government is now supporting eight of our 10 amendments because that will significantly improve the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that the Government has not agreed to relates to amendments Nos 5 and 10, which were the Australian adaptation provisions. The Committee will be aware that we supported Senator Spindler in these amendments on the basis of the argument that had taken place in the hearings of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It seemed to us that there was an argument to support this exception from what was our general principle, and that was looking for a more open market in printed works. However, we accepted that exception on the basis that we were concerned that works which might otherwise be adapted for Australian use might not be adapted and that that would be to the disadvantage of Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, we acknowledged at the time that our position was somewhat inconsistent with our overall theme. Nevertheless, in these issues where it is a matter of balancing merit sometimes that inconsistency can be outweighed by the benefit of the amendment we are seeking; that is, to ensure that there is not a loss of textbooks that might be adapted for use within Australia, which is something we obviously want to encourage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further debate has taken place in the meantime in the other place and outside this place on whether the loophole that would occur by the acceptance by the Government of our amendment would outweigh the benefit that we were seeking. Those who have read the speech in the other place by the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peacock, will be aware that in the end he was persuaded that the loophole that would be created by the position that we were nevertheless pressing in this chamber was such as to outweigh the benefit that we wanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, in a spirit of believing that eight amendments out of 10 is better than none, and since we want to get this piece of legislation through because we think it is significantly to the benefit of the Australian consumer, we determined that we would no longer press the amendments relating to Australian adaptation. Our position, therefore, it might be said, is more consistent with the whole line that we developed both through the Committee and through the consultancy process. </PARA>

However, for obvious reasons, I cannot join him in congratulating the Government on its position on amendments Nos 5 and 10, particularly since both the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peacock, seem to be under a misapprehension.

The amendments in question took great care to ensure that the original remained available to Australian readers and purchasers unhindered while the adaptation was being prepared. Not surprisingly, that statement was repeated by the shadow Attorney-General in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other criticisms made of that amendment which, however, could have easily been fixed if the Government had seen fit to encourage Australian adaptations of overseas works. I would have thought that was an admirable objective. The amendment said that there was no time limit, that it would be difficult to contest an application to the Copyright Tribunal, and that once an order had been made it would be difficult to have it terminated. They are technical matters which could easily have been introduced by the Government into the amendment if it had supported the basic strategy of encouraging Australian adaptations of overseas works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as it stands, it is clear that the Opposition and the Government have seen fit to join forces or, should I say, that the Opposition has capitulated to the Government's entreaties.

It will become clear very quickly whether the impact of these amendments to the Copyright Bill will have the success that we all want it to have&mdash;that is, easier access to books for the Australian population and, hopefully, at cheaper prices. I do not think we should have to wait three years to have a review. In view of my remarks in an earlier debate, I ask the Minister whether there is any response from the Government on conducting a review after 12 or 18 months.

In that context I find it absolutely extraordinary that the Democrats&mdash;who pride themselves on their commitment to freedom of information, and the circulation of all the material which forms part of our cultural inheritance so that it is open to as many inhabitants of this country as possible&mdash;should persist in indicating that they would prefer to see a situation where, merely because overseas book publishers indicate that they are minded to bring out an Australian version of their books, they can prevent the ordinary operation of this Bill which would require them to ensure that books were available within 30 days of overseas publication, or somebody else could bring in the books under a different arrangement without their authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that quite remarkable and very disappointing on the part of the Democrats, but I am pleased that the Opposition has seen fit to change its view on this matter. We will now be in a position where those Australians&mdash;whether they are students, teachers, academics, researchers or anybody else&mdash;who want to have access to a title, will be able to do so within 30 days of the first overseas release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which is of some importance is Senator Schacht's request that the review by the Prices Surveillance Authority be brought forward from the end of 1994, which I think was the indication given by the Government. I understand that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) will be writing to Senator Schacht today in terms which will indicate that, whilst the Government retains 1994 as the formal deadline for report by the PSA on the operation of this particular new regime in relation to access by Australians to the world body of publishing, nevertheless, if it becomes apparent that the regime we are instituting does not provide the beneficial consequences which we all hope for and, in particular, if it leads to any difficulty or any undesirable consequence when the actual operation gets under way, then there would be an opportunity for consideration of what ought to be done without awaiting that formal Prices Surveillance Authority review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Special Broadcasting Service Bill 1991 is a very important piece of legislation. It gives the Special Broadcasting Service greater freedom to manage its own affairs, it provides a new charter and it makes the SBS a statutory authority with similar powers and operational structure to the ABC. However, unlike the ABC, it does allow limited sponsorship and advertising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SBS was established as an independent authority by a coalition government in 1978. Since that time we take the view that SBS has performed a very valuable service, not just to the multicultural community but, indeed, to the wider community. There is no reason at all why the SBS should not be given its own degree of independence, its own separate charter and, therefore, its own ability to function according to its own rules rather than simply being treated as another element of broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the second reading debate was taking place in the House of Representatives, the shadow Minister for communications, Mr Smith, reiterated that the Opposition has been very happy and satisfied with the way that the SBS has been run. He said that, for his own part, he had been very impressed with the way that it conducted its programming and, more particularly, its commercial operations. I can certainly say that that was my experience during the time that I was shadow Minister for communications prior to the last election. In general terms, the Australian public can be very satisfied that they are getting value for money from what is currently a Budget allocation in the order of $66m. One is tempted to say that that pales into insignificance alongside the budget for the ABC, but it is also true to say that the ABC has many more responsibilities and takes on board many more production activities than does SBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, we regard SBS as a lean and efficient organisation, providing consistently high quality programs, and an organisation which is not shy when it comes to taking initiatives and purchasing overseas material. I think, therefore, that we ought to be prepared to give SBS every incentive to become, to a greater extent, self-funding but also to have more flexibility in its funding arrangements. SBS, for example, is in the process of purchasing its own headquarters for a fairly expensive sum of money, but to the extent that that will give it additional independence I think that is desirable. It currently spends very little on Australian production initiatives, and if it is able to raise additional funding by way of sponsorship and advertising that would seem, on the face of it, to be a desirable outcome because it will enable it to undertake more production activities and, hopefully, to fund further capital intensive expenditures, such as being able to broadcast to regional areas which currently do not receive the SBS signal. There are some fairly high expenses involved in conversion from VHF to UHF and no doubt the more funds that it has available the quicker that it can achieve that wider coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly SBS's news and current affairs programs are of a very high quality. For my own part, I watch as many of its current affairs programs as I can and programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dateline</EMPHASIS> and its other news summaries are very useful and give an international perspective in much more depth than one is likely to get from the ABC on a regular basis, and often at prime time. So, in every respect, I think SBS is delivering what we would want from it; that is, it has identified a niche where it can deliver high quality programs that are of particular interest to people who might come from countries where programs are sourced or stories are based but which have a much wider appeal to Australians who do not come from that region. I think its current affairs analyses and assessments are generally of the highest order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support this Bill. We also take the view that the advertising and sponsorship announcements are acceptable, given that there will be strict limits on the extent to which SBS can broadcast them. Advertisements and sponsorship announcements will be able to go to air only between programs or during natural program breaks and they will be restricted to a maximum of five minutes in any 60 minutes of broadcasting. This compares with 12 or 13 minutes under the self-regulatory regime of the commercial broadcasters. Whilst there is not a definition of natural program breaks, one would think that it is not too difficult to identify what the channel ought to have in mind, and clearly the half-time break in football and other sporting programs is a fairly common occurrence. The topping and tailing of programs so that good quality films are not massacred by advertisements is something that most people will readily identify with and recognise the breach of very quickly. So the guidelines would seem to be quite sufficient at this stage. We believe that the guidelines that are to be developed by the board ought to be subject to the Acts Interpretation Act so that they become a disallowable instrument and so that there will be some ongoing parliamentary scrutiny of the way in which those guidelines operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporate plan which is proposed in the Bill is not subject to any overall ministerial review other than in a very limited form. As a result, we will be moving amendments to change that situation to allow the Minister for Transport and Communications to have the power to vary the corporate plan. At the moment, the Minister may give the board such written directions in relation to the performance of SBS's functions as appear to the Minister to be necessary in the public interest. This could well cover the corporate plan, but the Minister may still only give directions for prescribed matters or in prescribed circumstances. We think that that ought to be wider, that there ought to be more discretion, and therefore more ability on the part of the Minister to provide guidance. We would certainly not expect that to cover programming or anything of that nature, but it would enable a review of commercial content and other matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other amendments deletes a clause exempting the SBS from paying sales tax. In general terms, it is moving very much down the path of commercialisation. I think its ability to stay within its own budget and to generate additional income is commendable and suggests that there is therefore no good reason why it ought to be given any free kick in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the legislation. We accept the charter and the limitations on advertising sponsorship that are proposed. We think they will go a long way towards enabling the Special Broadcasting Service to have a measure of self-funding and therefore give it a greater degree of flexibility and power to take initiatives and, in the ultimate, that it will be an even better and stronger and higher quality organisation as a result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the principal thrust of the Special Broadcasting Service Bill but will be moving an amendment, which I had hoped would have been circulated but which will be circulated shortly. The Bill seeks to corporatise SBS along the lines of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and to put it on a footing similar in every respect to the ABC, with the exception&mdash;and this is where we would differ very strongly from both the Government and the Opposition&mdash;that the Government is seeking to legislate to allow both sponsorship and the carriage of advertisements on the SBS channel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not seem to have dawned on the Opposition that if an organisation gets money from the Government to run&mdash;in this case&mdash;broadcasting, that money comes from the community by way of a tax. If the organisation seeks its funding alternatively from advertising revenue, that money still comes from the community. It comes from the community by way of a tax which essentially is the profits which are made on the sale of goods and services by the companies that run the advertising. It still comes from the total productivity of the community. It just comes by a different route. It costs the community exactly the same, whether it comes by way of a tax through government or by way of a tax on goods&mdash;in other words, the additional profits which are made on the goods and services which are advertised sufficient to pay for that advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference, of course, lies in the fact that if it comes by way of a tax through government sources the organisation remains free to carry out its charter in terms of best serving the ethnic community in a fully professional way which does not then impede professional judgment, nor does it distort in any way the sorts of programs which the carrier is able to carry. If, on the other hand, funding or part of the funding comes by way of commercial interests, then one sees the intrusion of those commercial interests into decisions as to what will be carried, what will not be carried or how much of what will be carried. For instance, SBS currently runs advertisements for Coca-Cola. Can one really imagine Coca-Cola sponsoring a program to do with the dental hygiene of children in the ethnic community? I find it extremely difficult to imagine that Coca-Cola would want to sponsor such a program or advertise in such a program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for these sorts of reasons that we are strongly opposed to the advertising or the sponsorship of programs<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> on either the ABC or the SBS. We will be moving an amendment on those lines to delete clause 45 of the Bill, which deals with sponsorship and advertising. There are several other consequential amendments to clauses 56 and 72 which mention advertising and sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see this also as to some extent the thin end of the wedge. If the SBS broadcasting system is allowed or encouraged to carry advertising and sponsorship, we feel that before very long there will be further pressure on the ABC to do the same sort of thing. Once having gone down that road even to a small extent, one simply is on the greasy pole which leads eventually to full commercial operation of both those organisations, with the quite disastrous consequences that Australia will be in even a worse position in respect of its media if it loses the two substantially independent sources of information which the Australian community now has&mdash;the one that is serving the community as a whole and the other that is serving specifically the ethnic community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the purposes of the Special Broadcasting Service Bill 1991. I want to refer to some aspects of the present legislation and to discuss the history of SBS-related Bills and parliamentary inquiries into the role and function of the SBS over the whole 12-year period since the SBS was introduced. There have been two Senate committee inquiries and I was closely involved in both. The first was about 10 years ago and the other about five years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a great supporter of the Special Broadcasting Service, particularly SBS Television. In my own home city of Adelaide we can receive SBS television only. It is only in Sydney and Melbourne that there is an SBS radio service. I am aware that SBS radio makes available some programs and some technical advice and help to the ethnic radio broadcasters in the other States. But in my own State, which is the norm, there is an independent ethnic radio station, whereas only in Sydney and Melbourne are there SBS radio stations as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diversity of television programming by the SBS is commendable. I find the overall range of the programs stimulating, and particularly commend SBS's Television's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World News</EMPHASIS> program for the extent and strength of its overseas news coverage which is by far the best of any of the television news services in this regard. I occasionally watch the news programs on the commercial channels. I still find myself mainly out of habit locked into the ABC's television news and I find that commendable. I know where I am with the ABC's television coverage with regard to news but I find every time I get a chance to watch it, the SBS news service is quite exciting and for one such as myself involved in foreign affairs and defence matters it is quite international, and of course deliberately so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the Special Broadcasting Service is a lean, efficient, professional service. I prefer its contracting out approach to a number of its activities rather than going through a huge bogged down bureaucracy that we can find in some other areas of the media. I welcome the multiskill expectations of SBS personnel. I am also impressed with the SBS in the most general sense as an exciting, creative television service. I think it is fantastic that in Australia we have a range of television offerings in most languages of the world, creatively produced according to other people's views of a serious documentary or feature film and according to the legitimate perspective of a director or group of producers in another country. It is amazing that that is available to us in the language of that other country with SBS subtitling. Again, SBS subtitling leads the world in accuracy, readability and appropriateness to communicate to, say, an English-speaking audience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are all enhanced through their access to this range of offerings from around the world. That is why I have always argued, from the very first time this was suggested in a government back bench committee, about what we should be doing to make multicultural television for all Australians. It is not confined to those Australians who speak languages other than English or those who were born in another country and want to keep in touch with that other country. I regard that as ethnic television and we do not have ethnic television in Australia; we have multicultural television for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that in contrast to multicultural television, there is ethnic radio which, by and large, is aimed at a discrete minority group of speakers of that language. That is what I would call ethnic radio.

That is the diverse aspect of the use of the word. The second part speaks of promoting tolerance, understanding, harmonious relations and mutual esteem amongst all Australians. The third part talks about the promotion of a cohesive Australian society, by assisting members of the Australian community to share with one another their diverse cultures within the legal and political structures of that society. We have only one national language; we have only one legal framework; we have only one political system in Australia; and we are seeking to have the diverse individual Australians to all come to terms with that one unity of Australia, that one set of institutions. The fourth part of the definition is to encourage all Australians, from whatever cultural background, to participate in that one Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past 10 years that is what I have always meant by multiculturalism. I really regret that some people who have a prejudiced and opposing approach to the term `multiculturalism' often distort that meaning by talking only about those things that make for diversity. Overwhelmingly, it is a word that is about the uniformity of all Australians. Our experience in multicultural television and in a number of other multicultural programs has led us now to quite a rich experience not only over the 12 years since this definition was first determined but over the past 20 years&mdash;not much more than that. There was some sense of a multicultural Australia before the First World War. However, from the First World War until the revolution that started in the early 1970s, we were highly conformist and constrained to one assimilationist Anglo-Saxon Australia in every respect, not only in language but in thought forms, in expectations of each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One basic feature of the present Bill that I commend is the charter that it gives to the SBS. This is set out in clause 6. This is a much more extensive statement of the purpose of the SBS than has been on the statute book until now.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If we go back to the 1977 amendments to what was then called the Broadcasting and Television Act, we find that the functions of the SBS were briefly stated in this way in section 79D:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The functions of the Service are&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)to provide multilingual broadcasting services and, if authorized by the regulations, to provide multilingual television services; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)to provide broadcasting and television services for such special purposes as are prescribed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before us states a principal function for the SBS and a series of duties that flow from that principal function. Clause 6(1) of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal function of the SBS is to provide multilingual and multicultural radio and television services that inform, educate and entertain all Australians, and, in doing so, reflect Australia's multicultural society.</PARA>
<PARA>Subclause (2) goes on to state eight duties that follow from this. Together they amount to the charter of the Special Broadcasting Service. I applaud this more extensive setting out of the purposes for the SBS's existence. It should be of significant help to SBS management staff, as they develop their corporate plans, to have this legislative charter as a starting point . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major changes in the present Bill is that it will allow advertising on the SBS under certain limitations. My colleague Senator Alston has referred to this innovation. This will become a source of some revenue for the SBS along with sponsorship of programs that is already allowed. I see this, as the Opposition does, as a reasonable proposal, for it diversifies SBS's revenue sources and, to that extent, makes it less reliant on the taxpayer for funding. That is welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which advertising is permitted is important. I note the restrictions in the Bill in this regard. The SBS board is required under clause 45 to develop guidelines concerning advertising. The Opposition has been arguing that those guidelines should be disallowable instruments; that is, when they are defined, they need to be tabled in this chamber and in the other place. If a debate led to their being disallowed for some inadequacy, they ought to be able to be disallowed. Therefore, I support the amendment that my colleague will move on behalf of the Opposition to give them that status unambiguously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The placing of this Bill on the statute book gives a firm indication that the future of the Special Broadcasting Service, as a separate body with its own statutory basis, is assured. This certainty is welcome. It would be much more difficult for the SBS to develop effectively were there to be continual uncertainty about its future structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of whether the SBS should exist in its own right is one that has arisen in the past, particularly in 1986, five years ago, when the present Labor Government decided to merge the SBS with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It was a cost cutting exercise which was supposed to raise $1m. It was a Budget decision in 1986. The Opposition immediately opposed it, and so did the community at large, because it had been exposed to enough of the SBS's particular objectives and the SBS's mechanisms for presenting a service that it felt it would suffer and could be drowned were it incorporated within the ABC as one national broadcaster at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) greatly underestimated the strength of community objection to this Budget decision. As a result, the Government finally had to yield to the views of so many people. During the Senate inquiry, which eventually reported in 1987, it was clear what the evidence was. It was clear that the report would say&mdash;as it eventually did&mdash;that this was not the time to merge the SBS and the ABC. During the inquiry the Government called it off. It was wise to call it off. As I have said, this is the legislation five years later which is making more solid, giving more certainty to, the separate existence of the SBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add just for the record that that episode in 1986 was of no credit at all to the Labor Government. It was a bureaucratic decision made by the former Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh. He is not in the Senate during this debate so I will not go into the matter in any detail. It certainly did not come from the watchers and listeners of multicultural television and ethnic radio. Of course, they opposed it, as was clear in the evidence which was presented to the 1986-87 inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was not the first inquiry into the SBS. For that, we have to go back to 1980. Although I might look as though I am getting long in the tooth because of our long sittings last week, I happened to be here for that 1980 inquiry and was very much a part of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, which looked at what the Fraser Government was then proposing. The Liberal-National Party Government had brought forward a Bill to take the SBS out of the Broadcasting Act and to set it up with its own Act&mdash;the sort of legislation we now have before us 11 years later. It was going to be called the Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting Corporation, not the Special Broadcasting Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Bill reached the Senate&mdash;I remember it well; it was in the old Parliament House&mdash;the Senate resolved by one vote to refer the Bill to the Standing Committee on Education and the Arts for inquiry. A number of then Government members were unhappy about this development and wanted it researched fully. I was a member of the Senate Committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Davidson, as he then was, which carried out the inquiry. That Committee recommended that the Bill should not be proceeded with, that the SBS should continue to operate by the interim arrangements in the Broadcasting Act and that the question of whether its role could be placed with the ABC should be considered further by a Government inquiry into the ABC which was then being held&mdash;the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That ABC inquiry, under the chairmanship of Mr Alex Dix, reported in 1981 and included in its report the fact that it did see scope in the longer term for bringing the ABC and the SBS into a closer relationship&mdash;that is, as one integrated national broadcaster&mdash;but it was critical of the reluctance of the ABC to cater adequately for the interests of Australians of non-Anglo-Saxon cultural backgrounds. That was a very important finding in the Dix report. It was the same type of finding that was arrived at by the Senate Committee in 1986. I would say that it would still be the case right now, in 1991, when we are debating this legislation to give a more certain and separate existence to the SBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still look to the day&mdash;maybe it will even be during this decade&mdash;when there will be such a growth in the Australian people's relaxed acceptance of multicultural television and it will be so supported that it will not need to have a separate statutory authority any longer. Then, later in the 1990s, there could be an exploration of whether it would be appropriate to merge the SBS and the ABC into one umbrella organisation&mdash;one national broadcaster. At that point, we could be confident that there would be no chance of what we know as multicultural television being drowned in the larger organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, I also note that in 1983 there was an inquiry into the SBS under the chairmanship of the Hon. F. X. Connor. The Connor report concluded that the two organisations should not be amalgamated at that time, although it did not rule out such a development in the longer term. I have already referred to the 1986 Senate Committee report and the way in which, along with the community at large, it forced the Government to back away from its 1986 Budget decision. I refer to only the final page or two of that Committee report&mdash;the conclusions and recommendations&mdash;where we said that we felt the question of merging under a national broadcaster could be revisited sometime in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Parliament ever did legislate for any sort of merger between the SBS and the ABC, I hope that the resulting national broadcaster would be run as economically and productively as the SBS is run today. In the 12 years of debate about these matters, too many people have assumed that, if there were to be a merger, the ABC would take over the SBS. To those who are asserting that, I would put it the other way: I would much prefer the SBS to take over the ABC and to bring to the rather large bureaucratic organisation&mdash;which has a number of bright spots, by the way&mdash;its professionalism, creativity, multi-skilling, contracting out and up-to-date services which serve Australians so well. It is a recently organised service involving many aspects which I am afraid the ABC has not yet embraced fully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those remarks, I take the opportunity to recognise the importance of this new re-establishment of certainty as well as the charter, definitions and clarity that this will give to multicultural broadcasting services in this country. I support the Bill and the amendments that the Opposition will be moving. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly in the second reading stage of the Special Broadcasting Service Bill 1991 mainly to flag a couple of matters that I will be raising in the Committee of the Whole. This is an important and significant measure which establishes the SBS as an independent authority. As has been said during the debate, it provides the SBS with a new and expanded charter. It points out particularly that the principal function of the SBS will be to provide multicultural and multilingual radio and television broadcasts to inform, educate and entertain Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apropos of that, most&mdash;no doubt all&mdash;honourable senators realise that Australia is a great multicultural nation. Forty per cent, or thereabouts, of Australians were born overseas or have parents who were born overseas. I think it is fair to say that, by and large, the Australian community is one of the most tolerant and non-racist communities that one will find. That is my impression anyhow, having travelled around the country. In fact, the viewing potential of the SBS is far greater than the actual number of viewers the SBS has now. Unless I am mistaken, the ratings are around 4 per cent at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Teague has said, the SBS seems to have quite wide-ranging news sources available to it and, by and large, the news service is appreciated by those who are very interested in international affairs. Of course, the problem some people have in viewing the SBS is that somehow or other they cannot receive it on their televisions very clearly. That is the case in my home, although a good kick to the television set does improve the situation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have studied the Bill and I cannot see in it even the provisions that are now contained in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 with regard to the determination of standards, and the ability of viewers of SBS to lodge either complaints or expressions of approval, as it were, which could be dealt with in a reasonable way. I am not saying that what is contained in the ABC Act does this. As has been said by someone else&mdash;and I am not sure who it was&mdash;in the second reading debate, there is a good deal of concern in the community and amongst opinion makers that there needs to be for the public broadcasting services, both ABC and SBS, something like an ombudsman or, better still, an independent authority which could receive complaints about program standards and content. I flag that point. I will not go into the detail of it now, but I will in the committee stage. </PARA>

The Special Broadcasting Service Bill 1991 is an important piece of legislation, setting up under its own charter&mdash;with, it appears, the support of all&mdash;an organisation that is generally held in the community to provide a commendable example of excellence in broadcasting at a reasonable cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what the current figure is for the national audience of the SBS&mdash;I think it is around 5 per cent&mdash;but I would certainly count myself within it. Unfortunately, I live in an area of the world where we do not get it at the moment. I have to say that, personally, in terms of what is available on SBS, I cannot wait until 1993 when we do have access to it. With regard to my interjection to Senator Harradine, I have to say on reflection that it is probably worse to get SBS badly than not to get it at all. Perhaps we are better off by not being teased by what is available&mdash;Senator Harradine cannot see it too clearly, so perhaps he is in a worse position than we are. I take the opportunity to say on behalf of the Government that I commend the SBS on the excellence of its broadcasting, its particular attention to matters of public affairs and the excellence of its sports coverage. </PARA>

The concern we had about the Opposition's amendment is that it gave far too narrow an ambit to the work of the committee, which we have attempted to broaden to turn it into a meaningful, permanent committee that can advise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before the Committee suspended for dinner we were about to deal with clause 3. The amendment to clause 3 is contingent on the major amendment being accepted. There was a discussion before the dinner break on this matter and I will be seeking some clarification from Senator Alston about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the Government is satisfied with the provisions that already exist in the legislation to provide for the Special Broadcasting Service board to set up its own arrangements for consultation. The Bill contains provisions for the Minister to do that if he is dissatisfied with the board's arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation, the consultative mechanisms for gauging community concerns are then established by the board. The Committee will find that the board is required under the Bill to describe these measures in the corporate plan of the SBS. Due to public interest in effective consultation, this element of the corporate plan will, under the legislation, be subject to alteration by the Minister if that is thought necessary. I must say that basically I think it would be an extraordinarily incompetent SBS board&mdash;which it is not&mdash;that would not be able to determine, with the kind of audience that it has to relate to&mdash;and which it relates to so successfully&mdash;what organisations it would consult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personally, I have no doubt whatever that the board would exhaustively ensure that consultation was carried out, without a special committee having to be set up to advise it on the procedures it needs to use for consultation. It would be an extraordinarily incompetent board that would need that sort of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if through the process that is outlined in clause 49(3) on page 18 of the Bill the Minister directs the board to vary the community consultative measures, the Minister may also direct the board to establish a community advisory council in accordance with such arrangements as are specified in the direction. I must say that I think that is a very appropriate way for expressing the concern of the Parliament that consultation is correctly carried out. At least in the first instance the board is given the opportunity to determine its own consultative mechanisms. But the Bill provides a fail-safe device that if, in the opinion of the Minister, the board does not do that adequately, he has the power to vary those measures and also direct the board, as a consequence, to establish a community advisory council if he is not satisfied with the directions. At least, on first blush, I think that is a fairly appropriate and reasonably staged approach to take with the board of SBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, frankly, I do not see the need for either the Opposition's amendment or the Government's amendment. We would not have circulated our amendment if there had not been an indication that the Opposition was going to proceed with its amendment. Our amendment simply goes on to say that if one is going to set up this board pre-emptively&mdash;which the Bill does allow&mdash;and assume that it is not capable of doing certain things, it should be given some job to do. Rather than it meeting every three years&mdash;perhaps it would meet more than that but it would not need to&mdash;this amendment advises the board as to the processes it would need to use to actually consult. Having drawn particular attention to those parts of the Bill that already provide for this, I urge the Opposition to give some consideration to withdrawing its amendment. If that happens, the Government will withdraw its amendment. </PARA>

On how the Bill is laid out, I said earlier that it would be an extraordinarily incompetent board&mdash;to a stage of incompetence that I, frankly, could not imagine&mdash;which would not consult. It would have to be unbelievably incompetent in the sense that it knows the provisions of the Bill. The clauses have to be read together in respect of the community plan. Clause 47(1)(e) places a requirement on the board to set out what the community consultative measures will be. The Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the measures that the Board proposes to adopt to ensure that it is aware of, and responsive to, community needs and opinions (including the needs and opinions of small or newly arrived ethnic groups) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 49, immediately below that, indicates that the Minister may, within 60 days, direct the board on that specific issue of community consultative measures. Clause 49(3) says that the Minister can also, if he wishes, direct the board to set up a community advisory council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the mechanics and the relationships that exist between these organisations and the Minister, it would be quite an extraordinary board that, in drawing up its consultative measures that it proposes to adopt anyway, knowing full well that if the Minister is dissatisfied with it he can direct it to do otherwise, would invite a direction pointing out an inadequacy in those plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the consultation that would occur between the board of the SBS and the Minister in drawing up those plans would ensure that, in practice, there would be no need for the Minister to direct the establishment of an advisory board.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fortunately, I have had the benefit of some advice from my colleague the shadow Minister. The position, as I now understand it, is that clause 77 spells out the requirement&mdash;this is the Government's proposal&mdash;for an interim committee to provide that advice on consultative community measures. That would enable the corporate plan to properly reflect an adequate consultation process. The concern that we have is that that ought to be an ongoing feature of future corporate plans so that the ethnic communities in particular are given an assurance on a permanent basis that they will be able to influence the corporate plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that, if we are starting from scratch, there is no need for an interim committee and that the board, in carrying out its normal functions and using the commonsense that it undoubtedly has, will consult as a matter of course. If that were the case, we would not have needed an interim advisory committee. Having established an interim advisory committee, the view is that we ought to make it a permanent feature. It may not need to meet more than once every three years&mdash;it would be a very good thing if it did not&mdash;but the fact remains that if we have it for the first one we ought to have it for subsequent ones.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the extent to which the Government has already gone in the Bill. We are establishing this for the first time&mdash;with a charter for the first time. Clause 49 provides for the Minister to direct the board in fact to establish committees and so on at any future time if he wants to, if he is dissatisfied with the community consultation. To completely allay community concern on this important issue, under clause 77, as a transitional arrangement, it is proposed to set up this interim committee in establishing these ground rules for the first time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, I can quite clearly draw the distinction: the Government does not see the need to set up this committee on an ongoing basis when the board itself should be able to make these decisions. This is simply to lay the matter to rest, without setting up more bureaucracies than, frankly, one needs and to have this committee become permanently entrenched. That is my objection to it. Under clause 77(5) there is a sunset clause firmly placed on this committee which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interim Community Advisory Committee ceases to exist on the day on which the SBS's first corporate plan is given to the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that I commend the sense of these arrangements to the Opposition. The Government is saying that it has recognised that this is a legitimate concern; it has given at least five specific references to it in the Bill; it has provided the Minister with the power to direct the board if he is not satisfied with its own arrangements; and it has instructed the board to set up a one-off interim committee to ensure that the initial guidelines prepared by the board are given the maximum amount of community input. We deliberately do not want to see this, and I am very frank about it, as I was to Senator Alston over dinner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want to see another committee on top of the board simply set up as a permanent arrangement where it may not be necessary to do so. We think the provisions of the Bill are more than sufficient to meet any reasonable community concern about community consultation. Again, I would ask the Opposition to give further consideration to the sense of this course and not proceed with its amendments, because we are reluctantly proceeding with ours to give it an ongoing charter. If it is going to have an ongoing charter, let us give it something to do rather than the measures proposed by the Opposition, which mean it would have to give advice to the board only on the procedures it had to adopt in community consultation, when in fact all of this will be done for the first time anyway. I guess I would throw myself on the carpet and plead with the Opposition not to set up unnecessary structures when the Bill goes to some length to deal with these concerns in a staged and reasonable manner. </PARA>

I think, Mr Chairman, that coincidentally answers your question as well. Originally, about 10 minutes ago, the Opposition indicated it would in fact withdraw its amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am of the view that there is a need for a community advisory committee. One reason for that is that clause 49 enables the Minister to act in one circumstance, and that is within 60 days of receiving the copy of the corporate plan. If the board of the SBS decides that it has a corporate plan and notifies the Minister of that plan, and if it does that only once in, say, five or 10 years, then the Minister's powers are limited to acting only within 60 days of that first corporate plan. We are all human and we all learn by experience. The initial corporate plan, on the face of it, may appear to be eminently reasonable as far as community consultative measures are concerned, but, upon experience, it may seem to have failed. That may be the case for the ethnic community but it may not seem to have failed in the case of the SBS board. Under those circumstances, who will be able to intervene to overcome that sort of discrepancy or division? The Minister cannot because, under the legislation, he can intervene only within 60 days of receiving the corporate plan from the SBS board.</PARA></TALK.START>

Presumably, the community advisory council could also make its views known to the Minister. That is the difficulty I have in this area: that the Minister's powers are somewhat circumscribed in clause 49 whereas, if there were a permanent community advisory committee, this would presumably generate some activity on the part of the board, if that committee were of the view that the consultative procedures were inadequate and something needed to be done about it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out what an absurdity the Opposition's proposal is, frankly, in proceeding, and the painstaking provisions that have been included in this Bill to provide for public scrutiny. First of all, I wish to correct a small technical problem. The Opposition has not simply shifted these provisions in clause 77 to an earlier part of the Bill; it has moved them from clause 77 to earlier in the Bill and made them permanent. Senator Coulter is correct except with that one addition. They have been deliberately put in clause 77 so that they can be in the transitional arrangements and be only a temporary measure instead of cluttering up these organisations with committees they may not need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already referred to about five provisions of this Bill where the community consultation processes have been emphasised by the Government. I will point to another one&mdash;and there are any number of them&mdash;in terms of how public this process is. I refer honourable senators to clause 72, which requires the board to include certain matters in its annual report which, of course, is debated in this chamber. Clause 72(h) says that the board must include in its annual report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">particulars of the measures taken by the Board during the year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, each and every year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to ensure that the Board is aware of, and responsive to, community needs and opinions on matters relevant to the SBS's charter.</PARA>
<PARA>The board is required on that specific issue to report annually to Parliament and to have the sufficiency of the provisions it makes debated in this chamber&mdash;which they will be&mdash;and, as a consequence, also to debate the Minister's response to those measures that the board has taken and whether it is sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out the difference between the very deliberate provisions of the interim board in clause 77 and the directed community committee in clause 49, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Minister directs the Board to vary the community consultative measures, the Minister may also direct the Board to establish a Community Advisory Council&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is not the interim one; that is a specific advisory council to advise the board on its deficiencies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in accordance with such arrangements as are specified in the direction.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought that would have been fairly obvious. In other words, the Minister has the power to direct the board to establish a community advisory council which would obviously be given a specific reference to correct whatever perceived deficiency the Minister found in its community consultation. That is the difference between clauses 77 and 49. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be an extraordinary SBS board, knowing that those directive powers exist in the Bill, not to have the sense&mdash;and I am sure it will&mdash;to have preconsultation with the Minister, which it would definitely undertake, of course, prior to the publication of the directions, to ensure it will not be given a direction. With the provisions contained in clauses 49, 47 and 10 requiring public disclosure in the annual report of the particulars of these measures subjecting this on an annual basis to debate in this Parliament, why one needs to set up a permanent committee to perhaps unnecessarily advise the board on a standing basis of community consultation when there may be no need to set it up&mdash;and experience will only show that&mdash;frankly, I do not know. </PARA>

Our amendment, which would have been well known to the Government because it was moved in the House of Representatives, made it clear that we did not think merely an interim committee was sufficient and that we wanted a permanent arrangement. For reasons best known to itself, the Government has gone a lot further than that. Without really giving anyone adequate notice&mdash;unless these amendments were available some hours before I became aware of them&mdash;it has introduced at the last moment an amendment which very substantially broadens the functions of a community advisory committee which it itself would propose be established.

In many respects, I think the Government is hoist with its own petard for raising it because it invites the Democrats to come in and support a very broad proposition when, really, it does not need to go that far at all. All the Government needed to do was to oppose our amendment, if that was its view of the matter, and then the choice would have been simple. It would have been either an interim or a permanent advisory committee but limited to consultative measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the Government has put on the table a much broader, ongoing role for that advisory committee. It seems to me that if that is not what the Government prefers it is left with the choice of our supporting the broader approach or the Government supporting our narrower approach. If the Government does that, I would not have thought that any great harm would follow. Looking at clause 49, on which the Government lays great store, it says the Minister `may direct the Board to establish a community advisory council'. That is the very point that concerns us. There is no requirement for the Minister to do it and the Minister may end up, after the interim process has been completed, not taking advice from the communities in a way that they would regard as adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which to achieve that is to have this permanent arrangement. It will be very sporadic&mdash;it will probably meet once every three or five years&mdash;but it will do the trick. It will give the communities the assurance that they will have a direct input&mdash;not the possibility that a Minister may direct the board, et cetera.

I do so against a background of interest that I have had in this for some considerable time and also against a clear and definite undertaking that was given to me by Senator Evans, representing the then Minister for communications, Mr Duffy, on 2 June 1987. That undertaking given by Senator Evans referred to the issue of community standards. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Harradine has raised two matters with the Government. The first is the issue of penalties available to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal on breach of program or advertising standards. Senator Harradine correctly notes that the only sanctions able to be imposed are either very severe&mdash;cancellation or suspension of a licence&mdash;or, arguably, rather mild&mdash;namely an admonishment. The Government has considered widening the range of penalties but there are constitutional doubts as to whether a power to impose monetary penalties, for example, could be conferred on the ABT. This matter has been discussed with the Minister for Communications and he has authorised me to undertake that the Government will now seek further legal advice and clarification of this issue, which will be provided to Senator Harradine. Following that step and depending on the advice, the Government will reconsider the matter of appropriate penalties.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator Harradine has drawn attention to the undertaking given by Senator Button, in the debate in this place in 1983 on the passage of the ABC Act. The undertakings related to the complaints process contained in section 82 of the Act. The Minister for Communications informed me that he has recently received advice as to the handling of complaints by the ABC, in particular, complaints which do not fall squarely within section 82. The Government believes that the ABC must have a proper and credible complaint handling procedure. The ABC has been addressing this matter and, as I understand it, a proposal for reform has been recently discussed by the ABC Board. The Government places considerable importance on this matter. It is to be hoped that the ABC brings its consideration of complaints handling reform to an early conclusion. Unless the ABC has public credibility on this issue, it will not be in a good position to resist claims that it should be subject to an external complaints monitor, as applies, for example, to the British Broadcasting Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, was dealing with the question of the ABC. We are dealing with the question here of another public broadcasting authority. We were also reminded during the second reading debate that considerable concern had been expressed about the fact that there was not an independent complaints handling body which could determine complaints from the public in a manner that was just and seen to be just and proper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, a complaints procedure that is handled internally by any public broadcasting body, or, indeed, private broadcasting body or television station, is neither just nor seen to be just. If it has the final determination it is seen as, and it is, an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. In the Special Broadcasting Service Bill there has been an attempt to overcome that. But one of the problems I see in the Bill is that the measures contained there appear to give the authority a power only to ensure that the codes of conduct that have been established by some other organisation are to be observed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I would like to have explained to the Committee is how complaints from the public concerning program standards are to be dealt with in the first place by the SBS and, in the second place, by some other authority if the complainant is not satisfied with the procedures that are to be adopted by the SBS. Clause 10 establishes those procedures. Subclause 10(1)(h) states that it is the duty of the board:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to ascertain whether that is going to be an internal system. Presumably, it has to be an internal system in the first place; otherwise the SBS could simply ignore its responsibility in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated in my remarks in the second reading debate, the Australian Democrats are unhappy with the imposition&mdash;I use the word advisedly&mdash;on SBS of the carriage of advertisements and the use of sponsorship as a way of funding at least part of the SBS program. Therefore, we are moving the amendment to delete clause 45. As with those earlier amendments, a couple of consequential amendments flow from that, and they are amendments 2 and 3 on the sheet which has been circulated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very briefly, the arguments that we would use would be that the carriage of advertising by SBS does not reduce the total cost of running the SBS. It still comes somewhere from the community. On the one hand, it comes by way of tax revenue through Government; on the other hand, it comes by way of an additional price on the goods and services which people buy and which then goes to fund that portion of the SBS which is paid for out of advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would suggest that, as we have seen in the past, although the Government has denied that there will be any cut in funds as a consequence of the acquisition of some funding from advertising, in a number of instances those undertakings have been given and not kept. Of course, student fees was one classic case and there are numerous others. We believe that it would not be too long before SBS would be going cap in hand to government and would be told, `You got X million dollars from your advertising; therefore, you will not get more than so much' or `You will be required to raise more money from advertising', and SBS would then simply be going down that slippery road towards a full commercial operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to recognise that SBS caters to numerous niche markets. Senator Collins indicated earlier that although he lives in an ethnic community, unlike the 40 per cent of Australians born outside Australia or whose parents were born outside Australia, he is one of the original Australians and yet he does not have access to SBS. He would recognise that it is indeed quite a small niche market and that once money is acquired from advertising there will be considerable pressure to appeal to wider markets, because it is wider markets of course that interest the advertisers. It is difficult to imagine an advertiser coming forward with too many tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars to advertise to the Aboriginal people to the north of Darwin. So the imposition of advertising will impose another source of pressure on the SBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, of course, the use of advertising as a source of revenue will, I believe, inevitably distort the selection of material which will be shown on SBS and, try as SBS might, it will be very difficult to avoid those commercial pressures. We need to recognise that any commercial company is interested finally and ultimately in its bottom line&mdash;its profits. It is not fundamentally interested in the serving of the public good and, consequently, when there is a conflict between profits and the public good the public good will be sacrificed in the interests of those profits. Consequently, pressure would be brought to bear on SBS, or, if this is the thin end of the wedge, eventually on the ABC to run certain programs in contradistinction to other programs, and that would again lead to the SBS not serving the interests of those for whom it was created. Accordingly, we oppose totally clause 45. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not be accepting the Australian Democrats' stated position. I do not intend to go at any significant length into why that is so. I think you either accept this proposition or you do not. The reason I will not do that is that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan), who is sitting next to me in the chamber, has threatened to kneecap me if I go on at tedious length or speak for longer than 60 seconds. I know that Senator Coulter would acknowledge that it is a matter for Parliament to amend from time to time the arrangements for both the ABC and the SBS, depending on Parliament's view of the community expectation at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has no intention of extending the current provisions. The provisions&mdash;and I think the Opposition agrees&mdash;are sensible and reasonable and strike a middle course. We are maintaining a national broadcaster that is advertising free. That is the ABC. I do not see any need to extend that provision to every broadcast unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been said, the SBS does a more than commendable job in producing quality broadcasting at reasonable cost. I personally think that there has already been some demonstration of the value of sponsorship and advertising. For example, I have in mind the superb series on the American Civil War that was purchased by SBS recently, and that happened because of sponsorship from the groups mentioned at the beginning of the broadcast. I think that everyone will agree that the advertising that was used was totally unobtrusive. The message was there as to who was sponsoring the program and it did not intrude upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Alston said in his speech in the second reading debate, for these provisions to be restrictive to five minutes out of an hour only and for them to occur at the end of programs or in natural program breaks will be so unobtrusive on audiences as to be almost undetectable. That will provide SBS with a useful opportunity, as has already been demonstrated in the sponsorship provisions that already exist, in both purchasing additional programs from overseas but, more importantly, in increasing the number of productions in which the SBS itself engages. For that reason, the Government will not be accepting the Democrats' stated position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is opposed to this amendment. The advertising-sponsorship guidelines are appropriate for the SBS Board. In our view, it is not a matter for the Government or the Parliament to determine. Parliament gets its say when specifying the restrictions on permissible advertising in the legislation. I think that those restrictions are already rigorous in terms of both the time and placement limits that are put on them. The legislation also requires the SBS to include in its annual report details of all advertising and sponsorship of programs, so that will be a public process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals for guidelines to be made disallowable will restrict the revenue raising ability of the SBS&mdash;that is, further than it is already restricted&mdash;particularly in the period between the SBS Board publishing the guidelines and Parliament considering them. Of course, it will inject a degree of uncertainty into any commercial arrangements with advertisers. The proposal will also throw into doubt existing long term sponsorship arrangements. The SBS is already disadvantaged in relation to commercial broadcasts, as I have said. Making this disallowable would already unreasonably restrict what are already fairly restrictive provisions. I believe that Senator Coulter indicated earlier that the Australian Democrats would be supporting this Opposition amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having looked at the amendment a little more closely, I would make the point that, if the total deletion of clause 45 is not accepted, it seems to me that as clause 45(2)(a) and (b) set out precisely the circumstances in relation to the amount of advertising which is carried, any change would require that the matter come back by way of amendment to the Bill, which is a far more thorough-going review than simply a regulation or disallowable instrument.

<PARA>This amendment relates to a relatively minor mechanical error. We are simply taking the opportunity to correct a problem. The Special Broadcasting Service Bill provides that the SBS will employ staff under its own legislation rather than under the Public Service Act. The intention is to provide the SBS with a flexible staffing regime that can accommodate a range of employment arrangements. The purpose of the proposed amendment is to ensure that SBS officers who have been appointed to the SBS under the Public Service Act but who will compulsorily become officers employed under the SBS Act are covered by the second tier of the officers mobility rights under division 3 of part IV of the Public Service Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are discussing the Hearing Services Bill 1991, which gives effect to the Government's decision in October 1990 that the National Acoustic Laboratories hearing services program would become a statutory authority to be known as Australian Hearing Services. The functions of the authority will include the provision of hearing services to eligible persons; research and development in the assessment of hearing; hearing aids; hearing loss prevention; the effects of noise on the community; and the development of standards in relation to hearing products, certain noise levels and the provision of hearing services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill does not alter the availability of the services provided by the NAL. It does, however, provide for the making of regulations to set charges for hearing services. The Commonwealth announced in this year's Budget that a $25 annual fee will be imposed to cover the annual supply of batteries. The charge is per individual, but will not apply to families in receipt of family assistance supplement, nor children of eligible clients. Most hearing aid users would pay $50 to $100 if buying batteries at normal retail prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development and maintenance of a reliable and innovative supply of hearing aids and appliances is important to people with disabilities. Nearly one in 10 Australians suffers from hearing impairment and this ratio leaps to one in three in the age group of 65 years and over. With an increasingly aged population, hearing services must be prepared and equipped to cope with an increase in the demand over the next decade. I expect that they will also need to cope with what may be an unexpected demand from younger people who, as recent reports have shown, suffer hearing loss which is very similar to those in the over 65 years age group as the result of being exposed to loud noises in discos and through their Walkmans. That is an area that we ought to be addressing as a community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hearing services subprogram is administered by the Disability Programs Division of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. The subprogram provides hearing rehabilitation services to eligible persons through a network of 46 permanently staffed hearing centres and 65 visiting centres located in major towns and cities in all States and Territories, as well as hearing impairment prevention services and advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Acoustics Laboratories is responsible for the design, purchase, distribution and fitting of hearing aids free of charge to hearing-impaired people eligible for assistance under the hearing services subprogram. NAL also undertakes repairs, battery issue, follow-up and after care services, and is involved in research, hearing loss assessment and diagnosis.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NAL fitted about 66,795 hearing aids in 1989-90 compared with 64,567 in 1988-89. The main client groups of NAL are holders of pensioner health entitlement cards, persons referred by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and service personnel, and persons under the age of 21 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Acoustics Laboratories has been subject to a number of examinations. In 1981, the Industry Commission report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing manufacturing arrangements are not subject to normal market competitive pressures and, hence, tend to encourage inefficient resource use. The arrangements proposed by the Department of Health, if implemented, would do likewise.</PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of witnesses stated that hearing aid technology is always advancing, resulting in new features and new models being released on a continuous basis by the world's major manufacturers. NAL was criticised for being slow to adopt new technologies and, in some cases, for not adopting them at all. As a result, it was claimed, NAL's aids were inferior to imported models and would not gain acceptance on the commercial market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Laubman and Pank estimated that 16 per cent of its customers were entitled to a free aid but, instead, chose to purchase a commercial aid. Another retailer stated that, although it was company policy to advise prospective clients on the free aid benefits, a high proportion of persons eligible for these free aids purchased commercial hearing aids.</PARA>
<PARA>The NAL did not receive totally favourable reports at that time. The Auditor-General conducted an audit of the South Australian regional office of the Department and hearing centres in Adelaide in 1989. In audit report No. 20 1989-90, the Audit Office noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AAO considered that the allocation of resources in conjunction with client case workloads between centres should be continually reviewed so that resources can be applied to hearing centres in an efficient manner.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AAO noted that the allocation of resources did not match the client case workload carried by the hearing centres. The lengthy client waiting times at some hearing centres are considered to be evidence in support of this conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA>In October 1989, the Industry Commission was asked to inquire into and report on tariffs and other measures subject to influence by governments in Australia which affect the availability and costs of aids and appliances for the disabled. It was also asked to look at the reasons for any high costs of imported aids and appliances within the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its final report, entitled<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities</EMPHASIS>, the Commission assessed that the NAL's monopoly position had adversely affected the efficiency and performance of hearing services in many areas. It found that, firstly, it has restricted choice and led to long waiting times; secondly, those persons eligible for assistance who are not prepared to wait have had to obtain private sector services at a cost to themselves; and, thirdly, it has increased prices for those not eligible for assistance and has inhibited the growth of a wider range of hearing related services for the entire Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission considered that the objectives of the program could be achieved with greater efficiency and equity. The key to achieving those aims was to introduce greater competition. The Commission did not consider the continued separation of the market to be in the best interests of hearing-impaired people. The Industry Commission's report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities</EMPHASIS>, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As long as the fundamental sources of NAL's poor record&mdash;its monopoly and lack of exposure to market disciplines&mdash;remain unaltered, there is no firm basis to expect sustained improvement.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the current segmentation of the market between NAL and other service providers be ended and that competition should be introduced across the whole market, and that the Government's proposed collaborative arrangement would not be in the community's best interests and should be set aside.</PARA>
<PARA>The reasons for this conclusion included the fact that the five-year contract period would isolate NAL clients from technological developments by other firms during that time, and that the contract winning manufacturer would have access to 65 per cent of the Australian market until 1997 and, thereafter, be in a privileged position to dominate the private market as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important point that must be acknowledged is that almost all the submissions received by the Industry Commission were strongly supportive of NAL's continued involvement with children. Given the fact that there has been, I suppose, considerable criticism of NAL in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, I want to relate a story of a friend of mine who used to come and teach my students in a speech therapy course at the Lincoln Institute of Health Sciences. I thought it was important for students in speech therapy to meet a mother of children with hearing loss. She used to come most generously and give of her time to discuss the problems she faced in having three of her eight children with very severe hearing loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One comment my friend would make to the students concerned the service she had had from NAL; she had a long and continued relationship with it. She very much appraised the service that it gave in understanding the needs of the children. For example, it made appointments out of school hours as often as possible so that the children would seem less different than they would if they had to go and have appointments during school time. It made sure that it did not program the three children one after the other. NAL understood that it could not expect all three to wait in a row. It was quite understanding compared with some of the other services that my friend reported where people got quite upset that maybe those three children were attended to while two other siblings were at their wits end after waiting for the end of three or four hours of appointments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I most especially want to add that not all the comments I have had about NAL have been negative. In particular, it backs up the comments made about the NAL dealing with children. Of course, NAL has had a monopoly on this age group. The reluctance of the private sector to take up this segment of the market is partly a reflection of the fact that its scope for involvement is limited by NAL's monopoly on the under 21 age group. The Hearing Aid Council of Australia said that the private sector has not picked up and run with children because children have a place to go and parents can go there for nothing. A number of commercial firms indicated to the Industry Commission that they would employ audiologists with experience with children if permitted access to NAL's clientele. So it is not as if the private sector is unwilling to do it; it is just that up until now NAL has had a monopoly in that field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter raised in the Commission's report was that the hearing services program has a significant influence on the structure of the Australian hearing aid industry. First, certain groups within the community have access to hearing aids free of charge. Secondly, successive Commonwealth governments have decided that these hearing aids will be dispensed solely by NAL. Thirdly, NAL is not permitted to compete with the private sector in the fitting and sale of aids to hearing-impaired people not eligible for free hearing aids under the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NAL has accessed nearly 65 per cent of the market, and therefore is not subject to normal competitive pressures. As a result, NAL audiologists have considerable influence over the types of hearing aids available to a large part of the market. Private suppliers are limited to competing for about 35 per cent of the market. This has restricted opportunities for private suppliers of both hearing aids and hearing related services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout both IC reports there was much criticism of NAL lagging behind the private sector. The Australian Science and Technology Council, ASTEC, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . provided several examples of where the introduction of new technology by NAL has lagged behind the private sector, sometimes by many years. These included post-auricular aids (introduced by the private sector in 1957 and by the NAL in 1972), binaural fittings (private sector 1961, NAL 1971), compression circuitry (private sector 1967, NAL 1985), FM systems (private sector 1974, NAL 1985), all in-the-ear/canal aids, programmable aids and remote control aids.</PARA>
<PARA>So ASTEC is saying that NAL is lagging 15 years or so behind the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a monopoly in about 65 per cent of the market, it is very important that NAL keeps pace and is in fact a leader in hearing aid provision and research and ensures that it is able to supply hearing aids of the type demanded by clients. On 21 December 1989, the Government announced that the NAL would be run along the lines of a government business enterprise and that its central laboratory in Sydney would be placed on a commercial footing so that it operated on a user pays basis. The Government called for expressions of interest from a number of Australian and international companies interested in entering a collaborative arrangement with NAL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of the proposed arrangement included: to ensure cost effective hearing aid supply for an initial five-year period; to ensure long term cost effective supply of hearing aids to current NAL clientele; to utilise the concentration of professional and technical expertise of NAL in helping hearing-impaired people to function effectively; to retain and enhance hearing aid design, development and manufacturing expertise in Australia; and to take advantage of potential commercial opportunities for NAL's products, services and reputation in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the arrangement, hearing aids will be manufactured in the production facility in Fortitude Valley. That commences in the second half of next year for release to the National Acoustics Laboratories hearing centres following full trialing of the products by 1 July 1993. Once the factory is in full production by 1994, AHA will be producing some 600,000 units which will include both hearing aids and remote controls. It is estimated that approximately 70 per cent of those units will be for export at a value of around $25m annually. Royalties of $9m are expected to be received by the Government over the period of the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) announced the joint venture on 17 October between NAL and AHA. AHA is a joint venture between Crystalaid, a wholly owned Australian company, and Ascom Audiosys, a hearing aid manufacturer and subsidiary of the Swiss telecommunications company, Ascom. They will jointly research, develop and manufacture hearing products for use by clients of the hearing services subprogram and for sale on exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, it sounds as though I have been totally in agreement with what the Government is doing, but it does concern me that apparently only a selected group of private firms were invited to tender for the collaborative arrangement. If this is the case, it is possible that the result of the tender was not the most competitive. The establishment of NAL as a statutory authority underpins this joint venture arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is claimed by the Government that a number of advantages would accrue from this proposal. The NAL stands to earn royalties of at least $2.6m on all exports with projected royalties of over $9m over the period of the contract. Streamlining the operations of the NAL has already seen dramatic reductions in waiting times in all the hearing centres. As a statutory authority, the NAL has further scope for improvements in the costs and timeliness of its services and will have low cost state-of-the-art hearing aids for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I hold a number of reservations. The Industry Commission report clearly recommended that competition be introduced into the whole market and recommended against the setting up of a monopoly. Doubts have been expressed that the level of exports claimed is achievable. The benefits of advances in hearing aid technology will be restricted for people under the hearing services program. Prices will not be subject to competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this Bill establishes yet another statutory authority, the Opposition supports the Bill and hopes that the establishment of the Australian Hearing Services Authority will promote the development of aids and appliances for people with hearing disabilities. I sincerely hope that if the arrangements do not achieve the desired results, the Government will review the situation for the sake of all Australians with hearing impairments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One last point I wish to raise concerns matters raised by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The Committee has a number of concerns that are outlined in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> No. 16 of 1991. I ask the Minister whether a response has been made to the Committee and, if so, whether the concerns of the Committee have been allayed. It is good to see a member of the House of Representatives raising this matter; we are training them gradually. Dr Woods, the shadow Minister for health, raised this issue in the House of Representatives and I was hoping that the Minister would have responded, because he has had due time. He has received the report and he has also heard the comments made by the shadow Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit that I do not hold out much hope for a positive response from the Minister, given that the Committee's sixteenth report of 1991 noted that while the Minister's responses were most informative, they were provided almost four months after the legislation was passed. This comment was made in response to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act 1991, the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1991 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Act 1991&mdash;not one Bill, but three, and the Minister's reply was four months late. Here we have another one. I am hoping&mdash;but I think I might be hoping in vain&mdash;that the Minister will have responded to the advice from the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hearing Services Bill 1991 follows last year's decision by the Government that the National Acoustic Laboratories become a statutory authority. It sets up the framework for the establishment of the Hearing Services Authority which will come into effect on 1 July next year. These changes largely arise from a report last year by the Industry Commission, which Senator Patterson has dealt with in depth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other things the Industry Commission recommended that the National Acoustic Laboratories should be privatised and that all suppliers should be able to compete to provide hearing aids through the hearing services program. The Industry Commission report caused considerable disquiet and, following its release, a number of organisations queried the ability of the private sector to provide a comprehensive audiological service. The groups responding to the Industry Commission's report were principally concerned about the possible effects of wholesale privatisation on hearing services, particularly for children and people on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately&mdash;as the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) acknowledged in his second reading speech&mdash;the Government accepted the view that total privatisation would disadvantage those people who would not be able to afford hearing services if they were supplied privately. Consequently, instead of opening up the hearing services market, the Government decided to reform NAL by way of creating a statutory authority which aims to provide hearing services to eligible&mdash;or, as the Minister calls them, public interest&mdash;clients, as well as undertake a range of other activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill does not alter the availability of services to the traditional NAL clients and I suppose that is something to be grateful for considering this Government's record in such matters. However, there are two areas of concern. Firstly, although the Bill ensures provision of aids and services to the existing clients of NAL, there is a continuing failure to address a significant gap in the delivery of such services. The Australian Association of Speech and Hearing wrote to me recently, pointing out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of a statutory authority without change of eligibility&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>while being welcome&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">still does not address a significant population in Australia who do not and would not meet the eligibility criteria. Many are on low or fixed incomes which cannot stretch to meet the costs of receiving services at the same professional level and accountability as the national service, plus the costs of suitable hearing aid devices. They are a significant disadvantaged group which should be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>More specifically, every group I have spoken to about this Bill expressed the same view to me&mdash;that NAL services need to be extended to people who are unemployed, particularly those who are receiving Jobsearch and Newstart allowances. For example, the Australian Deafness Council expressed the following view:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With rising unemployment, there will be a growing number of people unable to afford the $1000 necessary for a hearing aid.</PARA>
<PARA>Other groups pointed out that people who have a hearing impairment are quite clearly impeded in their search for employment if they do not have access to hearing aids and hearing services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many long term unemployed people with hearing impairment have received no assistance at all in this regard, and this Bill still offers them no assistance. The Hearing Services Authority will only assist the following people: pensioners; veterans; people under 21; members of the Australian Defence Force; a person whom the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees has referred to the Authority for medical treatment under the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988; a person referred to the Authority in connection with a service provided under a rehabilitation program under the Disability Services Act 1986; and Commonwealth public servants who are referred to the Authority by the Commonwealth for purposes relating to a medical examination in connection with their employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister also has the power to determine that a particular class of persons are to be eligible persons under the Act. This clause in the Bill was one that the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills considered to be an inappropriate delegation of legislative power because the matter is left entirely to the Minister's discretion. There is no mention anywhere of people who are unemployed, and this omission is most disturbing at a time when the Government is supposedly taking stronger measures to get the long term unemployed back to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also quite anomalous when one realises, for example, that under this list as it stands, it is possible for a senior, well paid member of the armed forces or the Commonwealth Public Service to receive assistance through the Authority, while an unemployed person who needs a hearing aid in order to obtain work cannot receive the same assistance. I find that extraordinary and quite ridiculous. Similarly, persons who are referred to the Authority for medical treatment or rehabilitation under the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act or the Disability Services Act are able to receive assistance, but what about those unemployed people who are compelled to seek rehabilitation under their Newstart agreements?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not difficult to imagine a situation where, in the course of a CES or DSS interview, it appears that a person has a significant hearing loss, or that a hearing device being used is inadequate. It could be considered, quite reasonably, that the person's employment prospects would increase if the hearing problem were rectified. It would then also be conceivable that remedying this problem could form part of the person's activity plan under Newstart. In other words, people could be compelled to seek assistance in order to improve their employment prospects but, under this Bill, they would have no access to the services provided by the Hearing Services Authority. Again, this seems to me to be rather arbitrary and bizarre. Where is the point in setting up a scheme to get people back to work&mdash;leaving aside the merits or otherwise of the Newstart scheme&mdash;if they are then denied access to the sorts of services that will undoubtedly enhance their employment prospects?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am constantly amazed by the way the Government chooses to treat the unemployed. Time and time again the unemployed are denied benefits that are given to others, despite the fact that unemployed people and their dependants are amongst the poorest members of our society. The only conclusion that can be reached is that, yet again, the unemployed are being punished simply for being out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why, if it is important for pensioners to have access to these services&mdash;and I would certainly not be suggesting otherwise&mdash;it is not equally important for the unemployed to have the same access. People in the field to whom I spoke about this Bill were all concerned about the inability of low-income earners to obtain hearing services. For example, ACROD pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many people on fixed incomes (that is, low income earners, recipients of Family Allowance Supplements and people who are unemployed) who although they are holders of Health Care Cards, do not have access to NAL services and have to go begging to service clubs for assistance to purchase a hearing aid.</PARA>
<PARA>Pamela Rosenberg from Disabled Persons International told me that there needed to be more sensitivity to what she called the hidden people with a hearing impairment, particularly women not in the work force and the long term unemployed. Others told me stories of coming across unemployed people with quite severe hearing impairments who had never had a hearing aid because of the costs involved, or who continued to use out of date devices because they could not afford to purchase more modern products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I discussed this matter with the Minister's office and requested that, even if he could not see his way clear to include all people on unemployment benefits as eligible clients, the Government should at least ensure equity and fairness by making sure that those who were required to obtain hearing aids or services as part of their Newstart agreement were included. I thank the Minister for arranging costings of my suggestions. I was advised today that the Department estimates the recurring cost per year to be $6.5m to provide access to NAL services for JSA and Newstart recipients and $16.8m to provide access for all health care cardholders. I find these figures somewhat excessive, but I cannot comment further as I was not able to look at the figures to see how the estimates were arrived at. I will not go into any further detail. However, I appreciate that such an extension of services would require additional resources and that there is already a problem with a shortage of qualified audiologists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government appears concerned that there would be some anomaly in splitting health care cardholders by enabling Newstart clients to have access to NAL services while denying other cardholders the same right. I understand that concern, but repeat that it would be preferable to give access to all health care cardholders. However, if this is not possible, it seems to me that it is quite appropriate that we should give preference to those people who are unemployed and whose employment prospects will be enhanced by giving access to the same free hearing services as the Authority's eligible clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been advised by the Minister's office that people on Newstart who have a hearing impairment at a level that is likely to affect their entry into the work force will be referred through the disability reform package for a rehabilitation program. At this stage of referral, they will pass through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to the Authority if they are assessed as needing a hearing aid. I understand that the Minister is willing to ensure that this situation is reviewed in order to ascertain whether unemployed people on Newstart who require hearing services are able to access such services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not consider this to be the best possible outcome, but I am prepared to accept it at this point in time. I will be suggesting to relevant organisations that they make sure that their unemployed clients are aware of the Minister's concerns and offer and that they keep monitoring any problems unemployed people experience in obtaining access to hearing services. I urge the Minister to at least consider a subsidy for health care cardholders when he looks at introducing regulations under clause 62. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second item that concerns me is the announcement that a $25 annual fee will be introduced to cover the annual supply of batteries and other maintenance services. This charge will not apply to families receiving FAS and the children of eligible clients. The charge will be made by regulation under clause 62 of the Bill which also empowers the Authority to waive any such charge. We do not intend to oppose clause 62 of this Bill; however, we will closely examine the subsequent regulations which introduce the fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going into great detail at this time, I want to make a couple of points about the proposed charge. Firstly, this additional charge, while relatively small&mdash;about 50c per week&mdash;comes on top of a number of other charges introduced by the Government over the past two years. The cumulative effect of these charges is particularly hard on people with multidisabilities or chronic illnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, a pensioner who has a chronic illness and who also has a hearing impairment and is now paying an up-front fee for pharmaceuticals will soon be paying an up-front fee for visiting the doctor, and will also be paying out for hearing services. In addition, he or she is more than likely to be up for some of the range of small charges and fees being introduced across a wide range of services: for example, the home and community care program. Because these charges are introduced under various schemes and programs, there is little recognition of how they can add up for the individuals involved. It is well within the bounds of possibility that my hypothetical pensioner will be up for at least an extra $10 per week simply to maintain his or her health at a very basic level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the introduction of a charge very clearly creates the potential for more significant cost shifting and one can only speculate about whether this Government&mdash;or, indeed, any subsequent government&mdash;will feel inclined to bump up the charge even further. There is then the issue of whether the Authority will waive the charge in situations of genuine hardship. If this does not occur, it is clear that there will be some people who will simply go without services. I know that this is of great concern to several of the groups that I have been in contact with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we come again to the issue of failure to recognise the additional costs of disability. Instead of acknowledging that people with disabilities already incur considerable additional costs, and making some moves towards the introduction of a disability allowance, here is yet another Bill which penalises people with a disability by making them pay for it. I appreciate the resource issues involved, but the proposed charge really raises some basic questions about how we expect disabled people to become full and equal participants in our society when we continue to disadvantage them at every available opportunity by the imposition of extra costs and charges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the Hearing Services Bill 1991. I notice that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), is heavily engaged at the moment on other matters. Some of the problems that have been indicated by Senator Patterson and by Senator Lees will, of course, be of concern to the Minister. I know that the Minister is interested in this whole area. I would like to add my expression of concern. I will not go into the background of the NAL or the Industry Commission's recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the debate started I got into my computer to try to get the data on the NAL. I first raised questions with respect to the NAL and the possibility of the government at the time&mdash;I am not sure which government it was&mdash;closing the place down. I looked up the Historic Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on the database and it was not there, so it must have been in the really old days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before us the Hearing Services Bill which, as has been said, is setting up the NAL&mdash;the statutory body. What worries me about all of this is that we have the provision of charges to be levied and a rather narrow area of eligible persons. With respect to batteries, $25 per year does not sound like a great deal. But that is $25 now. What about in five years time? What will the cost be then? As has been indicated by Senator Lees, there are families who have children with disabilities. The cost of batteries will still have to be paid out of the pockets of parents. Hearing aids are quite costly items. The greater involvement of the private sector in this particular area may bring down the cost of hearing aids and equipment. Nevertheless, my concern is that quite a large number of families will not be eligible for services from the NAL. I notice in the Bill that people receiving a family income supplement will be eligible for services from the NAL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are people just above that. For example, an electrician with a dependent spouse and two dependent children is above the FAS eligibility. If those two children are deaf or have hearing impairment, that inflicts a considerable cost on that family. It may be said that persons ought to be insured, but the enormous cost of health insurance at this point is of some real concern to those who have to pay it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be careful as to whether what we are doing here tonight will set in place a means by which a user pays system will operate in the long term. I admit that this Bill does not, in the short term, go right along the track of user pays, but I believe that we should be very careful to consider what is being done in this legislation and to see whether it is appropriate. The unemployment situation at the moment is devastating. I raised in this chamber just the other day the fact that many famil<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>ies are not in the situation of being able to cope on one income. Therefore, those families have to seek two incomes&mdash;the major income earner in a full time job and the other income earner, the spouse, in a part time job. The latest unemployment figures show that one of the causes of the very slight drop in unemployment is that those women who have gone into the paid work force to gain part time employment have been forced, because of the recession, out of the employment force without compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of those people if they develop a hearing problem? They will not be eligible for the purposes of this legislation unless they are receiving FAS. If they are just above the threshold for FAS that will be bad luck; they will not be able to receive assistance under this legislation as far as hearing aids are concerned. As I indicated, it is a very costly situation. So the recession will be a double whammy for those people. I make a special appeal on behalf of all those people who are paying their way, or attempting to pay their way, all along the line, are not receiving FAS and are forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something I now rise to remind the Minister about. Again, I hope that because of his personal interest in this area&mdash;no doubt he is not satisfied with the legislation&mdash;the message will be sent very clearly back to the Minister in the other place: that we will be taking a very close look at the operation of this legislation. I publicly invite those who are affected to make sure that they make representations not only to the Minister but also to the Opposition spokesperson in this area, Dr Bob Woods, and to Senator Patterson, Senator Lees and me, so that jointly we can keep our eye on the operation of this measure and make sure that it does not go along the line of complete privatisation, and to make sure that the voice of the people who are not eligible under this measure is heard and heard effectively by ultimate amendment to this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators who have spoken in support of the Hearing Services Bill 1991, a very important piece of legislation. I believe that they have indicated the sort of practical approach which characterises this chamber when it is dealing with a matter of such concern in the general community, as I was able to discover when, a few weeks ago, I opened new premises for the Tasmanian Deaf Society in Hobart and launched Deafness Awareness Week. I must admit that I was quite surprised and moved by the response from members of the community to certain comments I made at that time. It is a revelation for many of us who enjoy reasonably good hearing, if somewhat impaired in various respects, that there are so many people in our community who have a quite severe hearing loss, impairment or disability which can prevent their full participation in the social and recreational life of the community, quite apart from the paid employment aspects, which are also of vital importance to any household.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, which provides for the establishment of the Hearing Services Authority, achieves various objectives on the part of the Government. It does not change the eligibility under the Act. I suppose that in large measure Senator Lees and Senator Harradine were speaking about situations, perhaps exacerbated by present economic conditions, in which persons are forced out of the paid work force into unemployment and yet do not qualify for arrangements such as the family assistance supplement in their family situation which would enable them to qualify as eligible to receive the services to be provided by the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Senator Lees has received certain assurances, at least for consideration in relation to certain matters she has raised, in relation to Newstart participants and all health care cardholders. I think the Minister undertook to look at those matters, but I also believe that he pointed out that those who are unemployed and under 21 will qualify automatically by virtue of their age. That is an important point for the young unemployed in our community. As for those who are impaired&mdash;I do not know the exact criteria&mdash;and who qualify for assistance from the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, they too will be able to receive the services to be provided under the auspices of the Hearing Services Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators have commented also on the joint venture between NAL and its commercial partner, Australian Hearing Aids. This venture holds great promise, particularly as to the development and the marketing of high technology, new generation, programmable hearing aids. This applies not only to clients within Australia but also to those export markets, namely the United States and Europe, which one has to keep in mind as the very important aspect for any firm or undertaking in Australia: that it tries also to earn export dollars for this nation whilst providing a very good service or product for the Australian marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope, as Senator Harradine said, that the infusion of some of the quantities which come from the private sector will enable the costs of the production&mdash;and we are talking about the taxpayer in this instance&mdash;of these hearing aids and various ancillary services to come down. This could then enable the Government perhaps to widen the eligibility criteria and provide the Australian community with a greater availability of the very admirable products and services of this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson mentioned in particular the work of this organisation with young children. She commented very favourably on a particular instance which I have heard her mention before. But it is a very apt illustration and it is nice to get on the record that endorsement and expression of thanks on the part of a client whose children have been so well helped in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson also spoke about a number of matters that were raised by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Despite her thoughts to the contrary, I understand that a reply has been made available to that Committee. Whilst the problems that the Committee saw in relation to primary legislation being extended by delegated legislation are conceded, it is also a fact that determinations by the Minister are subject to the disallowance provisions and therefore subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Whilst I take the honourable senator's point, the ability of the Parliament, and particularly this chamber, to exercise its supervisory power and to disallow an instrument or a determination which it finds unsatisfactory does reassert the power of the Parliament in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee raised a concern in relation to the acronym NAL. I understand that this was simply to protect the National Acoustic Laboratories' logo, NAL. The Minister has given an undertaking to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee that, rather than postpone the passing of the legislation, he will introduce a clarifying amendment in the next session to make it very clear that that was the only purpose of dealing with that acronym. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also understand that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee commented on clause 70&mdash;the question of whether the delegation of the powers of the authority could be to any person or to a person who was a member of the authority. The Minister replied to the Chairman of the Committee in terms of undertaking to amend the legislation during the next session to achieve that purpose. But I understand that the Opposition has foreshadowed that at the committee stage it will move an amendment to substitute for the words, `a person', the words `a member of the board or a member of the staff of the authority'. That will achieve the objective and we would have no objection; we will accept that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable senators raised the question of the $25 annual charge. There is not much more that I can say in relation to that. It has been introduced to cover repairs and maintenance services and the annual supply of batteries for all NAL clients. In relation to the sort of situation that Senator Harradine raised&mdash;I do not have the exact figures before me&mdash;there are special provisions in the regulations to allow for a reduced fee where there are, for example, two children in the household. In other words, it would not be $25 per child within the family setting. In fact, I am informed by an officer that the children of the eligible clients are exempt, so that is even better. I may have to clarify that and provide Senator Harradine with a written note on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Hearing Services Bill 1991 is a most important piece of legislation. I thank those senators who have indicated their support for its passage. In passing the Bill, the Senate will be serving very well people in Australia who will use the services of this authority.

<PARA>This amendment relates to a matter raised by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. As the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, said, clause 70 provides that the Australian Hearing Services:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">may, by written instrument, delegate to a person all or any of its powers under this or any other Act.</PARA>

That Committee usually makes comment only after considerable consideration by members of all parties who have looked at a Bill in detail. It does not deal with these matters in a frivolous manner. Usually it is a very simple matter to move amendments. I would ask Senator Tate to draw to the Minister's attention how simply this could be done instead of leaving the matter hanging around until next session. As I believe the Democrats and the Government will support the amendment, I have no need to comment any further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1991 is a traditional machinery Bill which implements the decisions agreed at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council on 31 May this year. The Bill provides for general purpose assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1991-92 for an amount totalling $13.7 billion. The amount of funds paid by the Commonwealth to the States and the Northern Territory is, of course, based on a formula set out in the Bill. The formula is recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and is based mainly on a weighting for the population. Payments to the ACT are presently covered by Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1991-92 because the ACT, which has only recently moved to self-government, has not yet generated the statistical base for funding on the Grants Commission formula.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth accounts for something like 70 per cent of public sector revenues&mdash;in fact, the figure is closer to 80 per cent&mdash;but its own outlays account for only about 50 per cent of public sector spending. This is the underlying content of the term `vertical fiscal imbalance'. Vertical fiscal imbalance, the imbalance between the relative expenditure and revenue raising responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, was recognised by all concerned until very recently&mdash;until the last few days&mdash;as a major problem and a major form of inefficiency in the operation of the public sector in Australia. Indeed, fundamental reform of Commonwealth-State relations is one of the most important requirements that this nation has, as we head towards the twenty-first century with the overwhelming requirement for us to be a more efficient and competitive nation. Integral to that overall reform is the need for major change to the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only 16 months ago, in July 1990, that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced, in a quite blatant and rhetorical blaze of self-promotion, the establishment of a series of Special Premiers Conferences to address reforms to the fundamental problems facing the federation such as the imbalance in the financial relationship and the fact that there is great duplication and overlapping of functions between the Commonwealth and the States. This duplication is due largely to the fact that, over decades, there has been a continuing encroachment by the Commonwealth into areas that constitutionally and traditionally have been the preserve of the States. In announcing the Special Premiers Conferences in July 1990 the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Commonwealth, gave the States every indication that the Commonwealth Government would be prepared to look seriously at the major review and reform of Commonwealth-State relations and, particularly, reform of the financial relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is accepted on all sides that unless something significant is done to correct the vertical fiscal imbalance that now exists, and unless something is done to fix the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States, any other reforms that are undertaken will be gravely diminished by virtue of their not being accompanied by financial reform. The Prime Minister gave every indication that the Commonwealth was willing to look seriously at fundamental financial reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the ensuing 16 months the Commonwealth has, until the last two weeks, given every indication that it would be prepared to look seriously at significant reform of that financial relationship.

Tonight that has led to what I believe is a huge setback for Australia with the very understandable decision by the Premiers, given the attitude of the Prime Minister, to abandon the Perth Special Premiers Conference scheduled for next week. That is a devastating blow to the Prime Minister. It is a huge setback to Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recently attended the annual West Australian Sportswoman of the Year-QUIT presentation function. This was won for the second time by Shelley Taylor-Smith, the outstanding marathon swimmer whose records are increasingly remarkable. Since winning a gold medal at the Sixth World Swimming Championships in January 1991, she has been the first woman to cross the line on no less than eight occasions. The ninth occasion, yesterday, culminated in her defeating 21 of the world's best marathon swimmers, men and women, across 30 kilometres of Sydney Harbour. This success, in six hours 59 minutes and 38 seconds, was nearly four minutes ahead of her rival throughout in difficult, choppy conditions in addition to the pain of a jellyfish sting on her face along the way.</PARA></TALK.START>

I can do no better than incorporate her wins since 28 October 1990 when she won the Australian 25 kilometre long distance swim trial and was elected to represent Australia in the World Swimming Championships in January 1991.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Saturday just past, I had the great honour and privilege to launch a book which was the biography of a fine Australian pioneer by the name of William J. Liu, who incidentally had been awarded the OBE as well as a number of other distinctions by various governments. I speak about this book because I think the life of William J. Liu, who was known to the Chinese community as Uncle Bill or Uncle Billy, is very much the chronology and the history of Australia's Chinese contribution to the building of this nation. I suppose a point I ought to make at the beginning of my remarks is that I feel a certain affinity with William Liu, if only because he shares with me a clan name and a given name, and also that he was half Chinese, not fully Chinese. Being born in 1893, that was a rare event, because he was Chinese on his father's side as opposed to his mother's side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When his English mother married his father, she was ostracised from her family because at that stage mixed race marriages were frowned upon. But despite these setbacks, as the book makes very clear, Uncle Billy's contribution to the history of Australia and to the history of China was immense. I think that this is a remarkable story because it is so rare for any one person to become great in the history of their nation, but for a man to be great in the history of two nations is extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to take this opportunity to outline some of the significant events of this man's life. When the Senate sees these events in the context of history and of Australia's evolving relations with China, it will see that the contribution that he has made to our today is truly to be marvelled at. He was, as I said, half Chinese; he was sent back to China to receive an education in Chinese; he returned to Australia and studied at school in Sydney. He worked for some time in the Chinese consulate in Melbourne and became prominent in the formation of a shipping line between Australia and China in 1917. At that time the British and German merchant navies were no longer available to merchants between the two countries and the Japanese merchant fleet raised its prices. So William Liu organised for Chinese businessmen in Australia and Hong Kong to set up their own shipping line which operated on and off from 1917 to 1924. I say on and off because during the last year of the war the ships were requisitioned by the Australian Government, which made it very difficult for the line to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">William Liu was so important in relations between Australia and China that in 1921 he was awarded the rare honour of an audience with Dr Sun Yat-sen, who at that time was the president of southern China and who was responsible for the rise in Chinese nationalism following the overthrow of the emperors. William Liu spent much of his time involved in trade negotiations on behalf of Chinese merchants and also in improving the lot of the Chinese community. For example, he was one of the early members of the Society of Chinese Residents in Australia and was an active contributor to discussions of Sino-Australian relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the war came to China&mdash;I refer not to the Second World War but to the Japanese invasion of China&mdash;William Liu did not forget his past, his history or his ancestry and became actively involved in resistance against the Japanese. Something that perhaps we forget is that China's war with Japan began a long time before Australia's war with Japan. It is interesting that in 1931 William Liu warned the world of Japan's imperialism because he had obtained a copy of the Tanaka memorandum. This memorandum, written in 1927, outlined the Japanese plan for imperialism throughout South East Asia. He published 10,000 copies of this book. One has to wonder that perhaps if the world had paid more attention to the message he was giving in 1931 the events of 1941 would perhaps have been a little less surprising. He was involved with the Chinese 19th Route Army and spent much of his time ensuring that the story of the Chinese resistance against Japanese imperialism was spread around the world and that people could see the crimes that were being committed in China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the war William Liu threw himself wholeheartedly into the process of ensuring equal rights for Chinese people in Australia. In this regard, he had much to fight against, but his efforts were quite extraordinary. He spent much of his time writing to parliamentarians, presenting petitions, spreading articles and pamphlets and generally trying to ensure, as he put it, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . naturalised British passport persons of darker-skin parents should not be treated differently from European-descent passport holders.</PARA>
<PARA>At that time that was not the case. Long before it became common for people to advocate universal suffrage in this nation, long before people advocated equal rights for Aborigines, William Liu was way out in front of this society by advocating not just equal rights for Chinese Australians but also equal rights for Aboriginal Australians. His contribution spanned more than just the Chinese community in this country. It did something towards shaping the nation that we currently enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, he was very successful in his efforts to ensure equal rights of citizenship, as he was in many things. For example, he was active in improving the opportunities for farmers in New South Wales to sell their produce in Queensland, and he did much to improve the productivity and access of market gardeners in the northern part of New South Wales into the area of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in 1972 he was instrumental in setting up the Australia-China Chamber of Commerce and Industry of New South Wales. The role he played in improving our trade relations with China not only was recognised in an OBE in 1982 but also was recognised at the time of his death in a telegram of condolence from the then Premier of the People's Republic of China, Mr Zhao Zhiyang, who had previously expressed concern about William Liu's health at a time when he was quite ill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">William Liu died at the age of 90, which for the Chinese is the age of 91, though I will not go into the reasons why. He spanned 90 years of Australia's 200 years of history&mdash;a time from before Federation almost to our Bicentenary. He contributed to our trade relations with China, which these days well exceed a billion dollars a year. His contribution to this nation's trade, its export earnings and its standing in South East Asia has to be recognised and we have to recognise that this was a great man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very conscious that, in sharing the same name as Uncle Billy, I have a big task on my shoulders. I think that it would be invidious to even aspire to equal him. But in William Liu, Australia has a Chinese patriot, a Chinese pioneer and a man who was totally selfless in his life's work. I hope that this book which contains copies of some 26 scrolls that detail his life and works will be widely accepted in schools, libraries and in universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the final tribute to William Liu is the fact that these scrolls, having been exhibited in both Sydney and Melbourne, will now be exhibited in Beijing. It is a very rare tribute to somebody from outside China to have the story of their life in scrolls exhibited in that nation's capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by merely saying that I never knew William Liu because he was from several generations before me, but in him I and all my generation who are Australian-born Chinese can see a hero, a great man, a role model whom we can aspire to emulate. I hope that this community as a whole will recognise what a great man he was and that his contribution to this nation will be widely celebrated by all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to raise an issue in relation to Australia's export performance. For many years we have heard, and quite rightly so, of the need for Australia to export more. It is quite an easy concept to agree with. Most of our recent Treasurers have espoused that particular concept. We have heard the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) repeat the message. Ministers for Primary Industries and Energy have been particularly keen to emphasise it. We can easily agree with more exports, but there are two particular exports which should register as exceptions and they are our arms exports and our tobacco trade overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to address tobacco exports. It has been quite a week for tobacco and the problems associated with it. We notice, if we refer to today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, that there is quite a controversy boiling up about it, something which was emphasised by Dr Nigel Gray, who opened the sixth world conference on lung cancer. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in an article by Carmel Egan we are told that Dr Gray said at the opening of the conference in Melbourne that there should be a ban on smoking on international flights coming to and leaving Australia. Dr Gray said that the ban was necessary to protect the health of passengers and, in particular, crew who were exposed to cigarette smoke for regular long periods in a confined space. Further, he said that such a ban would be the logical extension of policies that are already in place in Australian air travel. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Gray further called on the Federal Government to negotiate agreements with foreign governments to ban smoking on flights to and from Australia with all airlines registered in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Gray informed the conference that his call had been supported by the International Cabin Crew Association and the Australian Flight Attendants Association, who are concerned that their members' health could be compromised by exposure to passive smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I continued that theme. I thought that the suggestion by Dr Gray was eminently sensible, and you may recall that today I gave notice of a motion calling for an end to smoking in Australian airline terminals. It seems to me to be quite silly that we have a ban which applies to our travel in the air but that at the termination or start of our travel we are subjected to quite a distorted exposure to intensive smoking by the people panicking while waiting for their luggage or before they get on a plane. They seem to seek solace in extra smoking at those times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that couple of contributions to the debate, we are told in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> newspaper that tobacco companies are about to target people in suburban streets in a desperate bid to win support against a proposed ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship in sport. We are told that this is a reaction to proposed legislation in New South Wales. All in all, it does not seem to be a very good time for the proponents of the use of tobacco. The campaign against them seems to be mounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, if we look at our export performance, which is where, normally, we would wish to support increased activity, taking the Australian Bureau of Statistics reports, we find that over the past eight years tobacco exports have varied from a low, at market prices, of about $15m per year in 1983-84, 1984-85 and 1985-86, to a high of about $25m in 1987-88. In 1990-91 the value of tobacco exports was about $20m. Conventional economic wisdom is that these exports, which over eight years totalled $146m, are a good thing, firstly, because they help Australia's balance of trade and, secondly, because they are useful to the country importing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out that quite obviously there can be another view of that. My view and the view of the Australian Democrats is that this amount of $146m is a disgrace. It is a disgrace because in totalling that amount we, as a nation, abrogate all sense of propriety and any claim of concern about the welfare of the importing nation and the health and well-being of its citizens by continuing these exports. The $146m which has been returned to Australia over the eight years involved represents drug addiction, ill health, disease and death to the importing nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many organisations, in particular, health organisations, cancer prevention groups&mdash;some of them voluntary but others government instrumentalities, especially overseas aid organisations&mdash;which are asking the rest of the world to help to deal with the problems brought about by such exports. Throughout the United States and Europe, and even in Australia, there are organisations which are fighting the attempts of tobacco manufacturers to push&mdash;and I use that word advisedly because cigarette manufacturers are merely up-market drug pushers&mdash;their products, particularly to Third World countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such an act is grossly irresponsible and in no way should be condoned by us as a nation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen evidence recently of Western drug pushers pushing their tobacco drugs in Eastern Europe and the USSR while the market is ripe for the plucking. I say: shame on those exporters for contributing to the ill health, the disease and the death which will result from their activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can do better. We should be doing better as a nation. We can export foodstuffs and manufactured products, which increase the well-being and longevity of people, not products which diminish their well-being or longevity. We can export goods which can contribute to these nations' gross domestic product and not diminish them by loading their health systems with the extra costs of medical attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the other political parties' inaction over many years on tobacco and the problems that it brings to our economy and the economies of other countries throughout the world; remembering that this tobacco substance and its consumption is one of the major causes of</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) At the time of World Heritage Listing, did the Government consider that no businesses, aside from those in the timber industry, would be affected by World Heritage Listing of the Wet Tropics; if so, does the Government now believe this to have been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) At the time of World Heritage Listing, was it the Government's intention that mining and grazing activities which involved some clearance of areas of rainforest would be forced to cease as a direct result of World Heritage Listing (as is indicated in the penultimate paragraph of the Minister's press release of 11 December 1987); if so, why was it decided not to provide any compensation to such businesses; if not, how does the Government reconcile this position with the Minister's press release which clearly states that `grazing of stock could continue, as could mining ... provided such activities do not involve clearance of areas of rainforest or other threats to World Heritage values'.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No provisions were made to compensate interests not directly involved with rainforest logging in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area because the Government was of the opinion that the nomination should have no effect on those interests.</PARA>

The proportion was lower for patients with 4 pathology services or less and for those with the highest use of over 24 services per year on average.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Heads of Government Agreement signed at the July Special Premiers' Conference specifically requires the Commission to consult with interested persons. This requirement will be reflected in the legislation establishing the NRTC. It is proposed to include a section requiring the Commission to consult with governments, industry, representatives of rural and remote Australians and any other relevant parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The NRTC Ministerial Council decided at its first meeting in October 1991 that the Commission be located in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The NRTC will be established under Commonwealth legislation and will be responsible to a Ministerial Council made of up a Minister representing each of the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Federal Government. Each Minister has equal representation (i.e. one in eight votes) on the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Heads of Government Agreement sets a tight timetable for the NRTC's recommendations. The Commission is to make its first recommendation on charges to the Ministerial Council by March 1992 and these charges must apply from no later than 1 January 1993. The Commission is to ensure that the road costs of all vehicles are fully recovered by no later than 1 July 1995, with the exception of road trains which are to achieve full cost recovery by 1 July 2000. The Commission is also required to establish a national heavy vehicle registration scheme by 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Brochures outlining the structure, functions and timetable of the Commission have been widely circulated to industry bodies and in industry publications, in order to keep industry members fully informed. The proposed NRTC legislation, however, merely establishes the Commission. The legislation of particular interest to road transport operators will be the Road Transport legislation which will be the actual vehicle for the implementation of uniform regulations and charging. This legislation will be developed over the next six months in close consultation with industry. It is expected to be introduced into Federal Parliament in the 1992 Autumn sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Under the arrangements agreed at the Special Premiers' Conference on 30 July 1991, the NRTC is to recommend for application until 1995, road use charges based on average distance travelled by each vehicle category. The principles on which these charges are to be based are set out in the Communique from that meeting and the Heads of Government Agreement signed at that meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of average distance per vehicle class avoids the need for mechanisms (such as hubodometers) to determine actual distance travelled by individual vehicles. It does, however, involve some loss efficiency and equity between individual operators as the averaging process inevitably means that some operators are overcharged (those who travel lower-than-average distances) and some are under-charged (those who travel longer-than-average distances).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRTC is to examine this issue in consultation with industry to determine whether it is feasible or desirable to refine the agreed charging arrangements further to move to a system which would more closely reflect individuals' actual use of the system. Such a system would not be introduced before July 1995, if at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Charges have not been endorsed by government leaders through the Special Premiers' Conference process. The NRTC will recommend charges to the Ministerial Council by March 1992 to apply no later than 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) No, but separate consideration of the incidence of sales tax on inputs to road transport is being undertaken by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The NRTC will recommend road use charges to fully recover those road costs attributable to the activities of the road transport industry, including construction costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) No, the charging arrangements agreed by Heads of Government address road track costs only and exclude externalities, such as air pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The NRTC has been directed to take into account the regional impact of varied charges during the phasing in process between 1 January 1993 and 1 July 1995. The extent of backloading will be taken into account in the determination of charges by the NRTC. The zonal, phasing-in and road-train charging arrangements all reflect awareness of the dependence of rural and remote Australia on transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) A clear distinction must be drawn between taxes for general revenue raising purposes, which are levied on all sectors of industry and the community, and charges for the use of roads infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim concerning the incidence of taxation on the road transport industry is based on the 1987 Inter-State Commission Report finding that the `levels of taxation on heavy vehicles are almost four times greater than the average for all industries. Although the taxes paid by the owners of these vehicles are high, road user charges are low; when added together, these taxes and charges do not fully cover their road costs' (ISC, 1987, p131).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent work which updates the ISC work, and takes into account a realistic level of road use charges, suggests that in 1986-87, the latest year for which data is available, the incidence of taxes on inputs to road transport was 5.5 per cent compared to 5.3 per cent for the average for all industries.</PARA>
