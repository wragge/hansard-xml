<TITLE>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth their deep concern that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:</PARA>
<PARA>1. (a) makes inadequate provision for a subjective judgement by parents as to what is in the best interests of their children,</PARA>
<PARA>(b) makes inadequate provision for parents to use their discretionary powers to act on such judgements.</PARA>
<PARA>2. creates the potential for conflict between parent and child (rather than the atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding mentioned as valuable in the preamble).</PARA>
<PARA>3. will produce closer monitoring by Government agencies of relationships between parents and children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in the Parliament assembled, should:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. By Act, ensure that all international treaties (excluding national security) are debated by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Take action to have the Convention amended in order to pay the highest regard to the importance of the family unit, and to the rights and responsibilities of parents.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Telecom is selling 0055 telephone networks to private contractors who provide offensive and sexually explicit recorded messages to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The providers of these services are advertising in the pages of Australian newspapers in a manner which is designed to titillate and attract calls from the whole community and thus play on the curiosity of children.</PARA>
<PARA>3. These services degrade and humiliate women and portray them as sex objects, and they destroy the innocence of children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, immediately call on Telecom to so regulate the conditions under which these services are made available, that women are no longer portrayed as sex objects, degraded or humiliated and that the innocence of children is protected.</PARA>

<TITLE>Higher Education in the ACT</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. We, the undersigned, wish to signify our strong opposition to the Chubb Report on Higher Education for the A.C.T. which proposes that the Institute of Advanced Studies be separated from the Faculties of the Australian National University and the Faculties be amalgamated with the University of Canberra. We believe that the implementation of these proposals would mean the destruction of the Australian National University's national and international high standing and firmly established reputation as a centre of excellence in research and scholarship. The dismemberment of the ANU would severely effect the ability of both the Institute and the Faculties to attract, or even retain, high quality academic staff, funding and support. It would also adversely affect the recruitment of top students. The maintenance of the Australian National University, as it is now constituted,-a national university with an international, national and local role-is of vital importance to the A.C.T. and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>2. We call on the Senate to reject the recommendations of the Chubb report and to support the integrity of the ANU and the existing relationship between the Institute and the Faculties.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides for the facilitation of the full privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. I bring this Bill before the Senate because it satisfies three objectives which were notably absent from the Commonwealth Bank's Restructuring Bill presented by the Government last year. That Bill was associated with the partial privatisation of the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>Why are we calling for full privatisation at all?</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is consistent with the general aims of the coalition's privatisation policy, which is to increase competition and hence improve the quality and cost of service provision to the community while maximising the range of choices available. </PARA>
<PARA>In considering the degree of privatisation which is appropriate for the Commonwealth Bank, the most important threshold question which must be addressed is whether the Government should be directly involved in the provision of bank services. </PARA>
<PARA>Given that there is a healthy private sector banking industry, the coalition sees no role for government in the banking industry at all, except in so far as the Reserve Bank is concerned, including its supervisory and regulatory role. Full private ownership will remove the dead hand of government from the Commonwealth Bank's operations and promote greater competition and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>With the aim of facilitating full privatisation of the Bank, this Bill has three objectives designed to put the Commonwealth Bank on a more even footing with its private sector counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA>The first objective of this Bill is to remove the prohibition limiting private shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>The second objective of the Bill is to make the shareholdings of the Bank subject to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, as is the case for all other companies.The third objective of the Bill is to make shareholdings of the Bank subject to the Banks (Shareholdings) Act, which applies to all other banks. </PARA>
<PARA>Through these objectives, the Bill will facilitate benefits to consumers. The additional competition will increase efficiency and enhance productivity, leading to lower prices and better services. It will provide for employee participation and a wide spread of ownership. There will be flow on benefits, with less government intervention, more effective capital markets and a lowering of debt from the proceeds of sales. </PARA>
<PARA>The advantages from private ownership of the Commonwealth Bank can only accrue if the Bank is fully privatised. The Government should be condemned for its half-baked partial privatisation of the Bank which had everything to do with boosting a flagging budgetary position, and nothing to do with the proper role for privatisation-to improve efficiency through increased competition. There is no logic in the option chosen by the Government. The decision is typical of a government that has lost its way. </PARA>
<PARA>We should be embarking on a wholesale program of privatisation of government business enterprises and micro-economic reform. Instead, the Government is dabbling at the edges with half measures designed to do no more than attempt to steer a political course through an array of groups with vested interests, including in particular sections of the trade union movement and the left wing of the Labor Party. The Government has lost the capacity to plot a firm course and stick to it. </PARA>
<PARA>In stark contrast, the coalition's program of privatisation will provide an important boost to Australia's productivity and commercial efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of that program, the proposals outlined in this Bill will lead to the full privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, with resultant benefits to bank consumers around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have my second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides for a revised system to elect the Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory, to be known as the `ACT Electoral System'. The system is designed to overcome the inadequacies of the existing heavily modified D'Hondt system which arose out of Parliamentary consideration of the Government's legislative proposals in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's decision to introduce a new ACT Electoral System arises out of its review of the Recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its 1989 Report entitled `Inquiry into the ACT Election and Electoral System'. The Joint Standing Committee's Inquiry was in large part initiated by the controversy surrounding that first election and the system used to decide it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's principal recommendation proposes that a referendum be held in the ACT to determine the preferred electoral system to be used at future ACT elections. The Government believes that the inability of the Joint Committee to reach agreement on a preferred system is of key significance and is witness to the disparate but firmly held views which exist. Further any referendum result is unlikely to identify clear electorate support for any single system. Accordingly, the Government rejects the Committee's referendum proposal on the grounds that such a course is not likely to provide a definitive outcome, may not be accepted by the parties concerned and may merely serve to regenerate earlier debates on the merits of self-government. The cost of a referendum is a further, but secondary factor in this decision. </PARA>
<PARA>The new ACT Electoral System is in large measure the system which this Government sought to establish when it introduced its electoral legislation in late 1988. The heavily modified D'Hondt system used at the first election in March 1989 including the arbitrary cut off threshold and the complex vote counting procedures, combined with the large number of candidates who chose to stand-many on anti-self government platforms-resulted in an election count that extended for over two months. Quite unfairly it has been the D'Hondt system itself which has drawn the resulting wide criticism rather than the modifications to the system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's continuing view is that the problems and the criticisms surrounding that first ACT election could have been avoided had the Government's original 1986 proposal for an electoral system based on single member electorates been accepted. To have proposed that the Territory elect its representatives from single member electorates in the same manner as other mainland Australian states should not have been novel or controversial. In fact it is this system-which has been used to elect members to many people's Houses in English speaking democracies-which was not supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The opposition parties' objections to a system of single member electorates persist. Accordingly in 1988 and again now, the Government in its commitment to effective self-government for the Territory, has been forced to compromise. Facing the rejection of a system based on single member electorates, as used in other people's Houses, the Government has decided on an ACT Electoral System which embodies some key elements of the D'Hondt system. This system has a high reputation. It is in common use to elect people's Houses in non-English speaking Western democracies including France, the Netherlands and Finland. The D'Hondt system is one of proportional representation, through which the electoral wishes of the people are directly reflected in the composition of their government. The system is highly regarded for its ability to deliver stable government. As I have said it is not the D'Hondt system itself which has resulted in the current unwieldy election process but the amendments which were made to it in the political context of a first self-government election. This Bill largely removes those amendments. Accordingly, there will be no threshold or Droop quota, no provisional election process, and no provision for voters to express preferences for party candidates other than those within the party of their choice. Indeed it is significant that the recommendations of the ACT Legislative Assembly Select Committee on Self-Government make it clear that demodification of the D'Hondt system along the lines of that now proposed would be an improvement. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the major shortcomings of the existing system particularly in the context of the first ACT election is the inordinate length of time needed to decide the election count. Even given that the 1989 election involved 117 candidates, the period of nine weeks required to complete the count is unacceptable. Under the new system a staged counting process will be used with the first stage comprising a count of the votes cast for each party and independent candidate. The staged process means that a guide to the state of the parties and independents should in most circumstances be available on election night and the full count completed within two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>To assist the early completion of the election count the cutoff time for the receipt of postal votes is to be set at the close of polling on election day. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has previously responded to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters Report `Inquiry into the ACT Election and Electoral System'. The Government will give effect to the commitments noted in that response, through provisions contained in this Bill. Specifically, to discourage other than serious candidates the candidate deposit is to be raised to $250. To discourage frivolous parties, all political parties other than parliamentary parties will be required to demonstrate a minimum membership of one hundred eligible ACT electors and individuals will be prevented from being the registered officer of more than one party. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes the passage of this Bill would discharge the Commonwealth's duty to the people of the ACT by providing them with an efficient and democratic electoral system. The Government believes that following the next ACT election the Assembly will be at a stage where it is able to conduct its own electoral affairs. Accordingly I am pleased to announce the intention of this Government to hand over to the territory the power to control the territory electoral system after the next election, scheduled for February 1992. I intend to bring forward legislation in the Budget sittings later this year to give effect to this commitment. Like other ACT legislation any electoral legislation of the ACT Assembly would be subject to the disallowance power of the Governor-General. No doubt those parties and independents contesting the second ACT election scheduled for 1992 will seek to declare their platform regarding the future territory electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA>To use the words of my predecessor in his second reading speech on the original Bill in 1988, this Parliament has a constitutional responsibility to ensure the good and stable government of this, the nation's capital. This Bill achieves this in providing for the people of the Territory a simplified, democratic and efficient ACT Electoral System. In presenting the Bill I note again the Government's intention to extend to the people of the Territory in 1992 the power to control their own electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Marine Navigation (Regulatory Functions) Levy Bill 1991 and the Marine Navigation (Regulatory Functions) Levy Collection Bill 1991, and the matters mentioned last night by Senator Parer. The levy Bill gives effect to changes announced last August by the Government which provide for the recovery of maritime safety and regulatory costs through the imposition of a levy on seagoing ships. The collection Bill sets out details which will apply to the administration of the levy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The maritime safety and regulatory functions were, of course, transferred to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority on 1 January this year, and the changes proposed in the legislation are ones which, as Senator Parer has mentioned, the Liberal and National parties support in line with our policy that, except where community service obligations are concerned, those who benefit from services provided by government business enterprises should contribute to the cost of those services rather than continually hitting taxpayers with the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We commend the Government on its decision to make safety and regulatory functions self-funding by way of a levy. We accept as reasonable the Government's timetable to achieve full cost recovery by 1993-94. The levies are designed on a sliding scale so that larger ships pay less. This is something that the industry at either end acknowledges as quite equitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation includes a provision which ensures that there is a ceiling of 15 per cent applied to any annual increase in the levy. Any increase over and above that limit will require this Parliament to amend the Act. By and large, the industry is happy with this safeguard on the cost increases, particularly since, through its representation on the Authority board, it has a say in determining the services and costs. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as Senator Kernot mentioned last night, this provision has come to the attention of the Senate through the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which dealt with this matter at some length. Contemporaneously with the drawing of that matter to our attention, the Opposition considered the matter and foreshadowed the amendment that Senator Parer has moved. Subclause 7(2) of the Marine Navigation (Regulatory Functions) Levy Bill 1991 sets out the various rates per tonne of levy which would apply to ships were the Bill enacted. In each case an amount of levy per tonne is specified, but there is also a proviso which says, `or such other amount as is from time to time prescribed'. Such prescription, of course, must be by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulation making power of the Bill is contained in clause 8, which explicitly empowers the Governor-General to make regulations for the purposes of subclause 7 (2). Subclause 8 (2) limits the extent to which the various rates of levy can be increased, providing that they cannot be increased by more than 15 per cent in any 12 consecutive months. So far that seems to be a reasonable provision. However, the Bill goes on to say that the prohibition does not come into force until after 30 June 1993. This means that up until that time there is no limit on the amount by which the levy can be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has consistently drawn attention to provisions which allow levies to be set in this way without any upper limit or a formula by which the upper limit can be determined. While accepting the view that such levies are often described as being simply a means of recovering costs, they may also be regarded as a form of taxation. Indeed, if the levy were to be increased from, say, 4c a tonne to, say, $4 a tonne-the example Senator Kernot referred to and the one which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee considered-the levy would then appear to be a tax rather than a levy. As such, that is a matter for Parliament to determine rather than being done by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> In making its observation, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee acknowledges that regulations by which such an increase would be made would, of course, be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and ultimately disallowance. However, the regulations would not be amenable to amendment as this option is not open to either House of Parliament when considering a regulation. If it is an impost such as this, it is more properly described as a tax. In the view of the Committee, it should be subject to debate in both Houses of Parliament and amendment by either House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is simply to remove from clause 8, page 3, line 4, the words `after 30 June 1993'. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) may have some explanation which he can tell us about during the committee stage. He indicates by nodding that he has, and so we will await that. If there is a good reason, I suspect that we would not proceed with the amendment and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee would be happy. But if there is no good reason, we would want to pursue the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Generally speaking, we have no opposition to the Bill. Furthermore, the amendment indicated by Senator Kernot seems to be reasonable. I doubt that we would have any opposition to that as well. I use this occasion to talk generally about the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and all of the mishmash that has gone on with its placement and the cost of funding it, a mishmash and mismanagement that I think typifies this Government's handling of the economy and certainly this Minister's handling of anything related to waterfront and shipping reform. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to read a press release from Mr Bob Brown, the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, as his portfolio then was, issued on 12 March 1990-exactly one year ago and, coincidentally, just a week or so before last year's Federal election, an election which to all intents and understandings at the time was going to be a very close election. Mr Bob Brown, as well as being the junior Minister in this area, also happens to represent a Newcastle seat. The press release states:</PARA>
<PARA>Work to set up the Australian Maritime Safety Authority headquarters in Newcastle is proceeding quickly, the member for Charlton and Federal Land Transport and Shipping Support Minister Bob Brown and the member for Newcastle Allan Morris said today. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Brown and Morris said the selection of building in Newcastle to house AMSA's operations was imminent. </PARA>
<PARA>They said AMSA's headquarters would be set up for operations to begin in December this year. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Brown said: ``In Canberra planning work for the move to Newcastle is proceeding quickly. </PARA>
<PARA>``Tenders have already been called for a Financial Management Information Package. </PARA>
<PARA>``This package will be purchased in time to begin staff training in October so that operations in Newcastle can get underway smoothly and efficiently at the end of the year.''</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Morris said: ``Advertisements have been placed in the Newcastle Herald for Marine Surveyors for AMSA. </PARA>
<PARA>``While the Surveyors initially worked from Canberra they are being clearly told that from early 1991 their jobs will move to Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA>``From these initial specialist recruitments it can be clearly seen that AMSA will provide a wide range of job opportunities for people in the Newcastle region. </PARA>
<PARA>``Under the Hawke Government AMSA is coming to Newcastle and jobs will be created in the region. </PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal and National Parties have given no such guarantee and have in fact threatened to cancel the move to Newcastle completely.''</PARA>
<PARA>That was just some days before the election: an election in which the Hawke Government was in severe trouble, and an election where it was in danger of losing seats, even in what would have been thought to be some of its safest territory in and around Newcastle. I will read some excerpts from Alan Ramsey in the Sydney Morning Herald relative to the same matter. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> AMSA is a story about 200 jobs and $10 million annual payroll that vanished from Newcastle in 10 months. It's also about a government which reneged on its word, local outrage, Labor MPs slagging their own kind unmercifully, and a pig that escaped from a pork barrel. If you believe politicians, it's about ``Yes Minister'', too. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Late last year, after Newcastle lost out to Melbourne for the major slice of the Navy's frigate contract, Newcastle's Labor lord mayor, John McNaughton, flew to Canberra to have a whinge to Bob Hawke. With him went one of the Lower Hunter's four Federal Labor MPs Bob Brown a junior Minister. Bob Brown was Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So, when John McNaughton was telling Bob Hawke that Newcastle was sick and tired of always finishing up the poor cousin whenever Government contracts were being handed out, Brown mentioned the headquarters of the new AMSA as a consolation prize. Newcastle had rated well in the site evaluation . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Hawke agreed. A few weeks later Cabinet endorsed the decision to locate the AMSA headquarters in Newcastle. It was announced the next day. It was not, however, announced by Willis, the senior Minister. Neither was it announced in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, Bob Brown, the junior minister, flew home to Newcastle from Canberra to make the announcement at a press conference for the local media in his Newcastle electorate office. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> When Cabinet first considered AMSA last November, the cost of moving-</PARA>
<PARA>this is, of course, November 1989-</PARA>
<PARA>the relevant departmental sections from Canberra to Newcastle and establishing the new headquarters there was $7.1 million. The establishment costs of keeping it in Canberra were less than $2 million. </PARA>
<PARA>It does not need a genius to work out that the Labor Party was prepared to spend $5.1m to move the Authority from Canberra to Newcastle simply to save a couple of electorates for the Government, simply to prop up some Labor members in that area who looked in danger of being defeated. I know that political parties have trouble raising money for election campaigns, but $5.1m of taxpayers' money to support the Labor campaign to regain government is simply a bit much even for the Australian taxpayer. That is simply what it was-a pork barrel to the ultimate degree. Alan Ramsey says:</PARA>
<PARA> The difference in cost alone suggested the Government was pork-barrelling Newcastle and its Labor members, particularly with a Federal election due. So did the curious circumstances of the announcement. </PARA>
<PARA>So the election was held and the result is now history and a new Minister was appointed. The current Minister was brought in from the wilderness by Mr Hawke for some reason. The fact that Mr Hawke has been so wrong in his judgments right the way through his prime ministership does not give us a great deal of comfort as to why Mr Hawke was so insistent that the Minister be appointed. Alan Ramsey continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The new minister, Bob Collins, ran smack bang into the problem on his first day in office. At his first briefing by departmental officers he was asked to review the AMSA. His first decision the next day was no, he wouldn't. He told his department the move to Newcastle was non-negotiable. </PARA>
<PARA>So here is a new Minister coming into the job, right on the ball. He was not going to be pushed around by the public servants. He told them that the decision was non-negotiable; it would go to Newcastle. Of course, the result of the Minister's firm decision making is now well known: the Authority stays in Canberra-where, I might say, it always should have been-but the election was over; the job, the pork barrel, the $5.1m that could have been spent had done its work and the Government was back in power. The people of Newcastle were not delighted; they were very angry. As Alan Ramsey says:</PARA>
<PARA>The shrieks from the Lower Hunter have been shrill indeed. Bob Brown, still a junior minister, called the reversal ``outrageous''. Allan Morris said it was ``appalling''. The Newcastle Trades Hall called for Collins to be sacked. So did the Newcastle Council. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Allan Morris is convinced Bob Collins has been ``Yes Ministered'' by ``mutinous'' bureaucrats who ``sabotaged'' the Newcastle move to protect their Canberra lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the Minister who is in charge of this Bill and in charge of waterfront reform generally. It shows how, according to those experts-Mr Morris and Mr Brown--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And Alan Ramsey; I will throw him in. Two of the Ministers' colleagues, the ones I was quoting, say that the Minister has been snowed by the public servants. It is interesting that as this matter went on the costs kept increasing. One can almost see Sir Humphrey there. The cost was originally $2m to leave it here; it was $7.1m to move it up to Newcastle-$5.1m to win an election using taxpayers' money is not bad; it could be done. But the public servants thought that this might well happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the $7.1m increased by increments. All the little extras kept coming in-the cost to remove the dogs and cats from Canberra to Newcastle was thrown in. As time went on, the cost escalated to something like $14m. Sir Humphrey certainly snowed the Minister. He said, in effect, `Throw in a few more figures. Increase the cost, and we'll convince him that it is not worth going on with'. The Minister is certainly embarrassed now. Admittedly, he had only been in office for a couple of days, but they threw him the figures and completely snowed him. That is fair enough. It should have always been left here. I suppose it was good for the taxpayers that he was snowed by the public servants. But the concern is that this Minister, who is so easily snowed by Sir Humphrey and his colleagues, is now in charge of waterfront reform. That causes concern to Australians right across this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The program which the Government wanted to implement with waterfront reform is moving at a snail's pace. At the end of September, the Government determined target was for 500 redundancies to have been processed. In that time, according to the Government's target, its score was a big, fat zero-none by September. Now we are halfway through it, there should have been 1,000 redundancies processed. All the Government can produce, if all the redundancies in the pipeline are realised by the end of March, is 451. That is not even enough to realise one year's target, due six months before. The Government's program, even by its own standards, is moving at half pace. </PARA>
<PARA> Those redundancies have occurred, but at the same time there have been another 213 recruits to the industry, and that process has been pursued with greater enthusiasm, compounding the manning problem. There might be some excuse if the targets set were too high. The target set was for a 30 per cent increase in productivity over three years, but it is nothing like the increase that we need if we are to regain our competitive edge in the marketplace. At that rate, the Government's redundancy package, a $300m package, will provide a very handsome $100,000 average payout, which will mean that for every one per cent increase in productivity on the waterfront, taxpayers and industry will pay $10m. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, the United Kingdom has obtained productivity increases of 65 per cent in one year-the same year that yielded us no productivity gains at all. </PARA>

I can understand why the Minister is so sensitive and keeps interjecting because he is embarrassed at being snowed by his public servants. Now he is embarrassed by the slow pace of reform that is not a patch on the nations that we compete with. Australia is being served up very modest gains only by a government and at a price of very generous payments to its mates. While we have been plodding along with unrealised goals of a 30 per cent improvement over three years, the rest of the world has moved ahead at a faster rate. So even if we achieve 30 per cent in that time, the rest of the world will have gone ahead at a much faster rate.

He keeps asking people to explain to him terms and initials that should be well known to him. It simply exemplifies the point I am making that this job is completely beyond the Minister. This is not only my sentiment; the Minister acknowledges his own shortcomings in the question of waterfront reform by having to call on Big Daddy-the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and senior Ministers-to help him get through. At least I give him credit for this: he did recognise that he was incapable of doing it by himself and so he brought in the heavies. The heavies have not helped him much either but at least they got something done for the economic statement yesterday. I might say that, for what was announced yesterday, he may as well not have bothered. But at least they had something to announce yesterday which, if the Minister had bumbled on by himself, he would not have had. So the heavies have come in to help him there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I continue by reporting that the Victorian Minister for ports has given evidence to a parliamentary committee that at the end of the targeted reform process Melbourne will still perform at only 20 per cent of the rate in Singapore. The Government's policy is fatally flawed when it looks inwards to formulate its standards and its competitors are on the outside. So it is targeting itself against past performances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister will get up, no doubt, and say, `What did you do in 20 years of government? Where was your reform?' I am not going to argue with that. I will admit that successive governments have not done the right thing. Our party looks to the future and, as a nation, we should be looking to the future, not arguing about what happened before and not comparing ourselves with ourselves and saying that we are 30 per cent better than we used to be. What we have to do is say that we are 30 per cent better than our trading partners and 30 per cent better than our competitors, not 30 per cent better than we were a few years ago. That is where this policy of the Government is fatally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> The standards that will determine the attractiveness of our produce in the international marketplace are those of our competitors. We have to be better than they are if we are to have the competitive edge. The Government has squibbed on this and so industry is having to move outside government to find the mainstream in order to get real benefits. This is exemplified by the Conaust Pty Ltd matter. Conaust responded to this situation by taking its case away from the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority process and into the established arbitration system. In doing so, its chief executive has described the Government as neutral at best in the reform process and, more recently, criticised the lack of purposeful government support which, in his words, left the ship floundering. By its own test the Government is failing in its waterfront reform program and unless this situation is remedied Australia will continue inevitably to languish in this recession that the Government has foisted upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say in conclusion that these matters I have been mentioning about waterfront reform are again typified by the Cairns example. The Government is comparing its progress with what happened yesteryear. It is saying that it has reduced the numbers of employees at the Cairns waterfront from 23 to 10 and is patting itself on the back and saying, `We used to have 23 and now we have got 10'. What the Government does not say and what its target should be is that we need four or five. And what have we got? We have 10, which is double that number. That is what is wrong with Australia and that is what is wrong with our port system. This Government compares its progress with an enormously ridiculous base. It cuts the employees by half but this is still double what it should be and that is why Australia is uncompetitive on the market. </PARA>
<PARA> All the way through this process has been inadequate. It has been propped up by a Minister who does not understand, who cannot manage it by himself and who has been snowed continually by his public servants. One would imagine that the snowing by the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia is immense; it must think it has been given a gift, dealing with this Minister on this alleged waterfront reform process. The Minister was easily snowed by the public servants in Canberra. The wharfies could teach them a thing or two about snowing Ministers; and this Minister has just fallen for it all the way through. </PARA>
<PARA> I think those matters are relevant and the people of Australia should know about them. The reform process is on the wrong basis, with the wrong targets; it is moving too slowly and it has to get better for Australia. We in the Liberal and National parties certainly encourage the Government to be a bit tougher, to get on with the job, to do it properly and not just to languish around with rhetoric as it has been doing. That is my plea. We support this Bill. I encourage senators to consider the amendments proposed by the Opposition and also to look favourably at one of the more sensible amendments to come from my friends on the left. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Macdonald is quite wrong to say that I had intended to canvass what happened in the past and the failure of the Opposition when it was in government to introduce any reform-and it did not-on the Australian waterfront for the entire 30 years it was in office. I will not do that; I will quote Senator Macdonald's words back to him: we are a party that looks to the future. That is what I was waiting to hear during this debate. There has been an enormous amount of non-stop criticism from the Opposition of the waterfront reform program of the Government over the past 12 months. That criticism started from day one and has not diminished since then. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the Government being criticised during that time, single-mindedly the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia has been singled out for non-stop attention, particularly by Senator Macdonald. According to the Opposition, the companies had nothing to do with this situation, despite the fact that the senior executive of one the major companies publicly acknowledged on national television that they had. As far as the Opposition is concerned, none of the unproductive work practices entrenched in the Australian waterfront over the past 50 years had anything to do with management; those practices were entirely a matter for the union. According to the Opposition, the people currently holding up the process are the unions. That is so far from reality that it is not true. </PARA>
<PARA> In the middle of this non-stop criticism, I have been waiting to hear-I am not asking for anything unreasonable-just one tiny detail about how the Opposition would approach this, not in the past, but in the future. I am not the only one waiting for this; the industry is waiting as well. </PARA>
<PARA> We finally got it. Two weeks ago we actually had the first public statement that I have heard from a frontbencher in a relevant portfolio as to what the Opposition's policy on waterfront reform is. Ian McLachlan, the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, addressing a shipping industry conference in Sydney a fortnight ago, was asked a question in question time-not unreasonably-by an industry representative, who said, `You have been criticising the Government's waterfront reform program for a year. We also are criticising it. What the industry would like to know is what the Opposition's policy is on the waterfront. If we voted for you instead of the Labor Party what could we expect to see happen on the waterfront with the coalition in government?'. </PARA>

In terms of the nonsense that has been delivered in this debate, both here and in the other place, some of that deserves some response. One of the other problems with the Opposition's performance on this issue is that it keeps on telling lies on the basis of the Dr Goebbels principle: if lies are told over and over again, eventually people will believe them, including no doubt the people who are uttering them but know they are nonsense in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That happened here again and in the House of Representatives during this debate. We heard comparisons about shipping rates across the Tasman repeated. We heard some extraordinary stuff in the House of Representatives from Mr Sharp about rates on sugar imports to Australia. Prior to 1989, we were not even allowed to import sugar to Australia. The embargo on absolute imports to Australia was lifted only in 1989. I have looked at the figures given and there is no indication as to whether the prices quoted-there is a $2 or $3 a tonne difference between them-are spot rates or long term rates; no indication of the ports where the sugar was going to or coming from; in fact, nothing in any of the statements that would indicate that we could give them any serious analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, Mr Sharp was talking about the comparative freight rates of shipping Queensland sugar around the coast of Australia to Western Australia and importing sugar from Mexico. I am not going to stand or fall on this because I have only had 24 hours to have a look at it. But for the life of me, I cannot find the slightest evidence that we imported enough sugar from Mexico to put in a cup of tea. In fact, my information in relation to the two sources quoted by Mr Sharp is that we imported 700 tonnes of sugar from the Philippines and none at all from Mexico. The Opposition keeps repeating this pretty astonishing nonsense and I have to say that that does not surprise me. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh no, Senator, have a look at Mr Sharp's speech. Senator Parer interjected and said, `Oh no, it was salt from Mexico'. It was indeed. Now, according to Mr Sharp's speech, it was sugar as well. I was about to say, before Senator Parer's helpful interjection, that we have not imported enough sugar from Mexico to put in a cup of tea and we have not imported enough salt from Mexico to sprinkle on a tomato. But it is perfectly okay for Senator Parer to run it in here again. We have been given all these figures about the thousands of tonnes of salt that we are importing from Mexico, and now the thousands of tonnes of sugar which, according to Mr Sharp, we are importing from Mexico. We are told how much cheaper it is. The Mexicans do not seem to know anything about it and I cannot find anybody in Australia who does either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All I am saying is that there are plenty of examples around that the Opposition can use. Why does it not use the real ones? There is plenty of good material that it can use to criticise the waterfront and the shipping industry. If they did not need to be criticised, we would not be engaged in the process of reform. The fact is that we acknowledge that there are reforms and improvements needed. Why does the Opposition keep running nonsense, instead of fact? The reason is-and it annoys me-that it is not even interested in making the slightest effort to concentrate its mind on how it would actually reform the waterfront. The Australian electorate deserves better than that. </PARA>
<PARA> I tell the Senate-and there is 15 years of Hansards to prove it-that I am not a person who has ever believed that all of the consolidated wisdom rests on one side of the Parliament. I am open to suggestions from the Australian Democrats, from the Opposition and from my own parliamentary colleagues, which is why I initiated the formation of that working group. If somebody can think of a better way of doing it than I have been able to do, let us hear it. But we are waiting in vain for suggestions from the Opposition. We still have not heard it yet. In the great waterfront debate in the Senate, we have had two speakers from the Opposition and neither of them said anything. I am still waiting. Perhaps they will have another run at it during Question Time today or will stick the debate on again in another three weeks. But I am open to suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> I know what all the hard options are. I know what the alternative options to a negotiated settlement on the waterfront are. Instead of hearing these meaningless cliches about getting tough and taking the gloves off, I would like to know, and the industry would also like to know, which one of those options-any of them or all of them-the Opposition would implement in government. We are still waiting. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the breathtaking nonsense that continues to be delivered on this matter by the shadow Minister, John Sharp-I say this again, and I am happy to demonstrate it-he has not yet put out a single public statement on shipping and waterfront reform that has not been factually wrong. The canards have been delivered again in here today and repeated by Senator Macdonald-the same nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote a whopper. We were told that the Conaust agreement was negotiated in principle outside the waterfront reform process. What a piece of arrant factual nonsense. The Opposition has no excuse for continuing to run this lie because I nailed it down in Question Time earlier in this sitting. In fact, I produced the document and quoted the section from it. The Opposition has no excuse because the role that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission plays within the process is contained on page 1 of the agreement. If members of the Opposition are too lazy to read the first page of the agreement, I refer them to the transcript of the Commission in which Commissioner Sweeney laid out very clearly in the Cairns decision, and indeed in the Conaust matter-in fact, I will send it to Senator Macdonald's office-the specific role that is required of both the Commission and the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority within the process of waterfront reform. </PARA>
<PARA> It was always acknowledged that there could come a time, amazingly enough, when there would be issues where an umpire was needed. Of course, the appropriate place to go is the Commission, the very organisation that the Opposition has a policy of dismantling and destroying and going outside of, so that the devil will take the hindmost and we will be back to the good old days of 30 per cent leaps in wages. The Commission is absolutely part of the process. I might also add-and the Opposition has ignored it-that it was the conciliation processes of the Commission that achieved the result-not arbitration. It was done by agreement between the parties, both Conaust and the unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said this before, in terms of industrial dynamics, and I point it out to Senator Macdonald-but because of his non-stop, 100 per cent union bashing attitude he is not interested in listening to it-it is a hell of a lot easier for the company to negotiate these reforms than it is for the union. Whether you agree or disagree with the work practices-and I disagree with many of them, and think that they should be removed-the fact is that they have been in place for a very long time; in respect of the rosters and work practices, at least 20 years or more. Whether or not we disagree with them, in the case of the union it has been a process of constantly giving up conditions that it has got. It is a lot easier for the company under those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is a very strong, long term benefit for the workers engaged in this process, and so does the union leadership. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute publicly to the work that has been done over the last 12 months by the leadership of the Waterside Workers Federation, in particular, Tas Bull and John Coombs. Over the last 12 months I have had enormous respect and admiration for Tas Bull because, for a union official--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a question of a club at all. It is something that Senator Parer and the Opposition refuse to acknowledge. It is a hell of a lot more difficult for the union officials to negotiate this process because on every occasion they are having to make concessions. As Tas Bull said to me, quite correctly, late last year, every time he goes into a port to negotiate-and he has done it-it costs him another 100 members who have not got jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I am saying is that the one thing I have refused to do in terms of advancing this process-and Senator Macdonald should have regard to it-is flatly refuse to criticise company actions on this. It has been criticised trenchantly by some people, particularly Conaust, and I have not engaged in that debate; nor have I taken this crazy position of singling out the unions for special attention. That would be a wonderful attitude to bring down to the waterside in terms of getting reform!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have pointed out before, getting the agreements is only half the battle, the real reform is delivered when those agreements are actually implemented in the workplace. That is why a negotiated process, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you will be well aware, is a far more effective way of actually getting reforms delivered than the process of provoking maximum resistance in forcing changes on people when they have the opportunity, scattered around the ports of Australia, to be as slow or as quick as they like about putting them into practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The coercive role that the Opposition has wanted to take from day one of taking off the gloves and getting tough-as it has said again in this debate, without specifying how to do it-would be guaranteed to produce industrial chaos in Australia and ensure that the real reform and the real results would not be produced for years. </PARA>
<PARA> I will tell the Senate what is the trouble with this country, and one of the problems, using a classic example from recent times. A certain organisation was making some radical changes. I was rung up by a journalist who said, `Would you like to be interviewed on this?'. I said, `Yes, I would, because the changes that are being brought in are significant for the country, for the national economy and for the national good; they involve a lot of money and some radical moves that are going to be very positive. I would be very happy to take the opportunity to be available'. </PARA>
<PARA> The same journalist rang me back on the same day-this is only a week ago-and said, `Look, we don't want to do that interview now'. I said, `Why not? What's the problem?'. The journalist said, `Our Sydney office contacted the unions, and the unions aren't going to put on a blue so we are not going to run the story'. That is a fact. That happened a week ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out one thing about this country that really irritates me in respect of this and, in fact, all other debates. Shipping reform achievements have been considerable. On an almost daily basis I get feedback from senior executives of the companies involved-and it happened again last night-telling me what direct and real benefits, in terms of the gypsum industry, their companies are achieving from the drastic reductions in crewing levels on their ships over the last three years, without one day lost in industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will tell the Senate what the problem is. If one goes into a negotiation without a stoush, without any publicity, fuss or fanfare, but just with a bit of commitment and achieves a 40 per cent increase in production, everyone says that is a failure, it is not enough. But if one goes into it and has a brawl-a big punch up with the unions-and gets hairy chested and says, `We are going to take on the unions', one gets the same 40 per cent productivity and that is claimed as a victory. It is a bit of a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the angst that I get from rank and file trade unionists-these are the guys down on the docks actually doing the work--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is obvious that Senator Parer has not been to the port of Melbourne to have a look at the work that is being done down there. There are some container terminals down there that he might like to have a look at. He did not get past 1950 in his speech yesterday, and I had a listen. He was still in the 1950s. Things have happened since then. He might like to go down and have a look because, with some justification, these guys down on the docks are saying, `Listen, why should we have any incentive or any motivation to produce an A-grade result when we are going to get bucketed whatever we do?'. There are grounds for saying that. They are saying, `We are being attacked every day'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a piece of correspondence from a user group saying, in respect of the reductions of 80 per cent in manning in grain terminals which we achieved, that that was inadequate. I have to tell the Senate that there is a view in the union movement that even if the WWF replaced every single wharfie in Australia with a robot, it would still be attacked, and it is right, because it would be by some. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the motivation for the union movement to have any real desire to implement an A-grade result and say, `Let's go for the top'? Tas Bull is doing that, but it is very frustrating from a union point of view because the rank and file is saying, `It does not matter what we deliver, the Opposition will get into us and say it is not good enough, so why should we bother delivering anything at all?'. There are some grounds for that, and in the real world one has to have regard to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will finish with Mr Sharp's nonsense and what he said about the Opposition's performance in government. Senator Macdonald and Senator Parer said that that is not relevant any more, and I agree. We should be looking to the future. I am still waiting to hear the future from the Opposition. Mr Sharp talked about the past. He delivered a whopper in the House of Representatives. He referred to when the coalition government was in office in the late 1960s and early 1970s during the introduction of containerisation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>A coalition government in control of the country at the time was able to negotiate and to reduce the numbers of waterside workers from 30,000-odd down to around 10,000-a cut of two-thirds in the number of waterside workers during the last years of the coalition Government prior to Whitlam coming to power. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at what really happened. When the coalition Government lost the 1972 election there were 14,600 waterside workers representing a reduction of 4,400 over a four-year period. This reduction had nothing whatever to do with the coalition Government. Quite the reverse. In fact, it was the heavy-handed approach of the coalition-the same one it wants to adopt now-in government in 1971 to reducing surplus labour which is still having an ongoing and damaging effect on the industry. It is all contained in the report of the Inter-State Commission (ISC). </PARA>
<PARA> At that time the Federal Government had direct regulatory control through the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, or ASIA, as it was known. It was a party to the national stevedoring industry conference agreement which covered the overall employment arrangements in the industry. In other words, the government was right in there, hands on. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote from page 42 of the Inter-State Commission report, the report commended by the Opposition and on which our program is based:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1971, the Government through Asia-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, this mob-</PARA>
<PARA>attempted to remove 500 surplus workers from the industry-</PARA>
<PARA>not 3,000 but 500-</PARA>
<PARA>if necessary through the compulsory retrenchment provisions of the National Stevedoring Industry Conference Agreement. The employers again resisted (apparently fearing industrial confrontation) and instead provided in their 1972 memorandum of agreement with the union that redundancy in future years would be on a voluntary basis only. Reductions were agreed at that time with the union, after additional incentives were provided for early retirement (particularly for workers aged 60 years and over). </PARA>
<PARA>I quote the final sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>In subsequent years reductions in registrations (of waterside workers) were negotiated solely by the AEWL and the WWF. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government was out of it completely. Consequently, it was the coalition Government's heavy-handed interference with the industry in 1971 that helped to bring about the non-compulsory redundancy agreement which it now so aggressively criticises. The Opposition gave it to us the last time it was in Government by taking the gloves off on the waterfront. The Government did not negotiate these labour reductions, as claimed in the House by Mr Sharp. In fact, the reductions were achieved by the industry through improved redundancy incentives as outlined in the ISC report. As the report said quite clearly the Government, because of its heavy-handed attitude, was cut out of it and the redundancies were negotiated entirely through the Association of Employers of Waterfront Labour (AEWL) and the WWF. The legacy of that heavy-handed nonsense-the coalition has not learned a thing in 30 years and wants to visit it on us again now-is that we now have in place the voluntary redundancy provisions-thanks to the Opposition-and that is what it is now complaining about. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take the opportunity, before I finish, to talk about the Bill that is before the Senate. I do, of course, have to respond to the nonsense that was delivered by the Opposition during this debate, but I have to give some credit to Senator Macdonald because he at least did talk about the Bill, and I thank him for that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to talk briefly about the Bill because I would like to give to Senator Macdonald something I have been able to give Senator Kernot in respect of the amendments. The Government will not be accepting either of the amendments, but I am encouraged by Senator Macdonald's comments on how firmly committed the Opposition is to the cost recovery principle and the support it is giving the Bills. He indicated that, if he can be persuaded that there is a good reason for not proceeding with these amendments, the Opposition will consider not proceeding with them, and there is good reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have, of course, read the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's report on the legislation and can understand the recommendations it has made and can therefore understand why these amendments are before the Senate. There are a couple of matters that the Committee probably was not in a position to take account of at the time it came down with these recommendations, which indicates that it would not be useful to proceed with the amendments. I will deal with them one at a time. </PARA>
<PARA> On the first one, the Committee determined, quite reasonably on the face of it, that the 15 per cent cap was quite reasonable in terms of being posted from 1993 on. As Senator Macdonald has correctly said, the industry has agreed with it. Senator Parer did, too, but Senator Macdonald said this morning that the industry has agreed to it and thinks it is reasonable. I point out that it is not an economic cap. It is not suggesting for a minute it will be 15 per cent. It is a legislative cap that has been put on and the industry is satisfied that that figure is reasonable to put on as a legislative cap. The reason we oppose the amendment to remove the starting date for the cap is very simple. We were faced with the situation where the $7m-and it is not a huge amount of money-that is currently spent in this area by the Government, which the industry is now going to pay, had to be cost recovered and there needed to be a cap and a mechanism put in. </PARA>
<PARA> We did not want to put the industry in a difficult situation. We could have, because it is only $7m, and that is not a huge amount from the whole industry. The Government still did not want to introduce it in one hit and say, `We will collect $7m'. I might add that, if we had, we would have had no problems with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. We could have said, `We will immediately begin to collect this at its full rate to recover the $7m'. Can I say, for the benefit of the Opposition and the Senate, that it is only proposed-and I state this quite clearly here-that the rates will be levied to collect that sum of $7m that is actually expended in providing these services. They are in fact all laid out and I am happy to enunciate them in the committee stages, if the Opposition wants me to. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry is well aware of where the money goes and it is not arguing with that either, but it does cost $7m to provide the services. That is all we are going to collect. I said, `No, we cannot do that. We have to phase it in over three years'. That is why there was not a cap put on. The Government has provided for a three-year phase-in and, at the end of that three years, that is the only money that will be collected. The difficulty for the Government in removing these words-and this is why we cannot accept the amendment-is that if a 15 per cent cap is put on the phase-in period, it will take eight years, not three, to move to full cost recovery. That is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand why the Opposition has moved the amendment because I have read the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's report and it is based entirely on the Opposition's recommendations. I am quite happy to explain to the Committee, at the first opportunity I get, why this has happened. The Government would have had no problem with the Committee if it had said, `We are going to collect $7m right now from day one and then put the 15 per cent cap on'. That would not have infringed the Committee's principles. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the second amendment, the same thing applies and that is why I have provided the Opposition with a copy of the regulations. I have pointed out to Senator Kernot that paying refunds back is not discretionary. There simply is no avenue to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), nor should there be. </PARA>
<PARA> What would happen if the amendment was accepted is that people would be going to the AAT saying, `I insist that I want to appeal about people giving me this cheque because I do not want it'. There is no discretion allowed to the Collector of Customs. He collects it in the first place and he knows when it has to be paid back, and the regulations quite clearly state that it must be refunded if the ship in fact is laid up or out of service or all of these other conditions. Can I say that my information is that it has never happened, so there never has been a problem with it. The problem would lie, of course, if there was an oversight or it was left out. When it was drawn to the attention of Customs, it would go to the small claims court or the magistrates court and get immediate judgment in their favour. It is not a discretionary payment. It must be paid to the shipper if the ship is out of service. The amendment, therefore, is simply not necessary. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, Mr Chairman. The proposed amendments relate to the levy increases and the percentage of increases prior to June 1993 in respect of various aids for shipping which uses Australian ports. For that reason I was reflecting on the waterfront reform which is so critical to those vessels which come into this country and which in fact will pay the levy. On that basis I would like to mention a few points. If more ships are going to use those ports and if those ships are going to pay the levy on a tonnage basis, we will need to improve the efficiency of the waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Minister did was come in and act as an apologist for probably the most militant and destructive union that this country has ever seen. It has destroyed industry within Australia, it has destroyed much of our export potential and it has increased the cost of our imports. The Minister should reflect on this, because one of the things that he did was give great praise to Mr Tas Bull. I have no objections to Mr Tas Bull representing as best he can the interests of those people who work on the waterfront. That is his job. But I would remind the Minister, if he would listen, that about a year ago I attended a luncheon where Mr Tas Bull quite categorically stated that he had been through umpteen numbers of these reforms. They had been subject to the same sort of pressure in the past as they would over this waterfront reform process and he could assure those on the waterfront that they would come out of it in much the same way as they had every other time in the past. All I can say is that, if the Minister has been sucked in by the comments of Mr Tas Bull, who is a very articulate person, he is just showing the naivety which reflects the comments made by users who tend to refer to this Minister on micro-economic reform-and I carefully choose these words; the only regret I have is that I did not say it-as the `phantom of the offerer'--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Chairman. I think I was referring to it, because I indicated that a levy was being charged and we were putting forward an amendment because of our concern about there being no ceiling on that levy until 1993, and the necessity for the waterfront reform to be gone through and done properly to enable a $7.1m figure, which was the cost of operating the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) to be paid for by the vessels visiting our ports. I indicated that one of the most important things is to increase the throughput of those ports; in other words, increase our exports and improve our current account deficit. To achieve that, we need proper waterfront reform-not phoney stuff. We need proper enterprise-based unions, not phoney enterprise-based unions. As I indicated when the Minister got up to make his point of order, he should go out and listen to the users and not just the user-friendly Tas Bull, which shows that the old bull is conquering the young bull. It shows a naivety that the reference being made to the Minister by users is the `phantom of the offerer'. I wish that I had dreamt up that term myself. It is a wonderful term.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. The Minister is obviously concerned about his lack of progress in achieving a result that the rest of Australia is demanding. I will move on to the amendment that I have foreshadowed. However, in view of the Minister's explanation in the second reading debate in respect of the date June 1993-as I understood it, that the ceiling of 15 per cent was to apply only after that date because it enabled the levy to be progressively increased over a three-year period up to the amount of the cost of operation of AMSA- and in view of the Minister's assurances, we will not proceed with that amendment. But one of the questions that relate to it, which I did ask the Minister and which he tended to gloss over in the second reading debate is this: what was the basis of the 15 per cent in the first place?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite right; it is a legislative cap, as it must be. It is not an economic cap. The Department simply looked at the annual rate of inflation. If I could just explain, there is a very strong mechanism for determining that these charges will be made only in line with the actual cost of delivering the services. AMSA has a board which has to set this cost. The board is obliged to have consultative mechanisms with the industry. That is one of the benefits, in my view, of doing this not just in the maritime area but also in the aviation area. Those in the industry are paying for it now; they have an absolute right-and that right is enshrined-to be consulted about the justification of the increased costs. They have simply said, `If you have an average inflation rate of 10 per cent, stick a bit on top of that so that there is some flexibility in case of a bad year so we don't have to bring it back to parliament every time there is a fluctuation--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. It is simply a procedural matter. As I explained-and I am right up front about it-it does not have any economic basis. It is a reasonable legislative cap. It has been accepted as being a reasonable legislative cap by the industry. The industry has indicated that it is a reasonable figure to put in. My own view is that it is highly unlikely that after 1993 that figure would ever need to be charged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basis on which the increases will be made is purely and simply-and it has to be justified to the industry-the actual cost of delivering the services. I do not want to delay the Committee any longer, but if the honourable senators want me to I can read out the long list of areas where these charges are made. Of course, the industry has these. I say again that it is not an economic cap; it is simply a legislative cap. That is the basis of it. I have to come clean with Senator Parer. The reason I was being such a nuisance in the committee stage and was trying to get it finished was that, as he may have noticed, my colleague Senator Richardson, whose duty was to start now, has taken the opportunity, because I am still stuck here, to clear off. I have to stay here now until 12 o'clock. I was hoping the debate could be finished. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my remarks by wishing aloud that as a result of the economic statement yesterday the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) is not prejudging that the inflation rate will get to 15 per cent in any one year. It is probably worth noting, the Minister having raised the question of inflation, that we have seen inflation gallop under this Government, but hopefully it will not get to 15 per cent in any one year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the amendment that Senator Parer foreshadowed. I accept the Minister's explanation, and Senator Parer has also explained it to me, but I want to clarify the Bill in my own mind. I am talking about the levy Bill, which says at subclause 8 (2):</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am referring to the Marine Navigation (Regulatory Functions) Levy Bill 1991: page 3, clause 8, line 3. Subclause 8 (2) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>After 30 June 1993, an amount applicable under paragraph 7 (2) (a), (b), (c) or (d) must not be increased by more than 15% in any 12 consecutive months. </PARA>
<PARA>Could the Minister explain the words `an amount applicable under paragraph 7 (2) (a), (b), (c) or (d)'. What is the amount applicable under paragraph 7 (2) (a), (b), (c) or (d)? For example, clause 7 (2) (a) states:</PARA>
<PARA>4 cents, or such other amount as is from time to time prescribed, for each of the first 5,000 tons of the ship's tonnage. </PARA>
<PARA>It is 4c, or such other amount as is prescribed. The Minister indicated to me during the break that that could increase to 30 per cent. I do not know what that means in dollars and cents, but if there is an amount in that up to June 1993-let us say it is $40 per tonne-does the 15 per cent then apply to the $40 per tonne or does it apply to the 4c? I hope I am making myself clear. Is the amount applicable the 4c, and can it be increased by 15 per cent, or is the amount whatever might be prescribed in those first three years, and then increased by 15 per cent?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did explain that to Senator Macdonald during the break. He is quite correct, I do understand the question; it was clear. The reason why we want the legislative flexibility to increase the charges is the very reason for which Senator Macdonald has raised his question. These figures contained in the existing legislation-just to put a rough figure on it; it would not be exact-will collect about a third of the total levy that will be charged in the final year.</PARA></TALK.START>

No doubt that amount will increase in line with the inflation rate over the next three years up to 1993. The 15 per cent cap that will then be levied will be on the final figure in that third year, so it will be on the $7m plus whatever the increases are.

To avoid any difficulties at all with the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills or anyone else we could have taken the decision, considering that the total amount is $7m a year industry wide, simply to impose that immediately from year one. We could have said, `We will collect the full $7m in year one and have a 15 per cent cap after that'. But we decided not to do that, and I think that is reasonable, even though the amount is only $7m. It is a new charge and it should be phased in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The industry wanted some degree of certainty. The reason those figures have been put into the Bill, so that they are in the Act, is to provide an absolute starting point for the industry so that it knows right now what the initial charges will be, and I think that is reasonable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask the Minister another question. He may not be prepared for it, but I notice that he does have his advisers with him. If my recollection is correct-I might not have the right terminology-regarding things such as lighthouses, navigational aids and so on, I understood that a charge had already been made on shipping and I think it was called light dues. Is it the intent that this will replace light dues? Will light dues continue?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not. The navigational aids are very significant expenditure. My advisers can correct me on the exact figure, and I will ask them in a minute, but, from memory, the total amount of money required to service all the navigational aids is in the vicinity of $42m a year. By comparison, the regulatory side of it-that is, the safety regulation side of it-which is designed to collect, is quite a small figure by comparison. To operate the massive lighthouses and navigational aids around Australia is around $42m a year, and that will still remain to be collected.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not think so. For convenience, I guess there would be no real problem in doing it, but there is no real need to do so. The legislation exists separately that provides for that. It is a very distinct service and a very distinct charge and the industry is well aware of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The specific answer to the honourable senator's question would be no. There is no intention to do so by this Government because it is well understood in the industry to incorporate both navigational and light dues charges in this kind of legislation which currently exists and is operating quite well, so we will leave it alone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond briefly to something Senator Collins raised. I make it clear that these opinions are entirely my own and I have not discussed them with members of my Party. Senator Collins has made quite a lot of the fact that I have only attacked the unions. My investigations and my discussions, particularly in the part of the world where I come from, suggest to me it is not only the unions. It is principally the unions because of the practices that have established themselves over the years, but those practices have been acquiesced in by certain employers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There would be many excuses why employers did cave in and did acquiesce. When one has a shotgun held at one's temple, one does not have much alternative but to acquiesce. But I do say there is some division amongst the employers on the attitudes that should have been adopted on the waterfront over the years. There are certain employers who do not agree with the way their peak bodies have handled the matter over the years. I am pleased that there are some employers who have gone outside what might be called a closed shop approach and taken different views and different attitudes because they realise at times that they, as a group of employers, have exacerbated the situation by agreeing to unreasonable demands and work practices that were not just scandalous but were fraudulent-fraudulent on the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that there are employers now who are prepared to stand up and to take the consequences. Hopefully, in doing that, they will achieve something for Australia as a whole. But I want to make Senator Collins aware that I do not say-and I never have said-that the fault is entirely with the unions. It starts with the unions because they want these practices implemented, but the employers have been equally as guilty over the years by acquiescing in them. I want to put that on record as my thoughts; it is a two-way street. The solution is for the employers to stand up and for the unions to be reasonable about it. If that can be achieved in the future then Australia will have been done a great service. My regret is that I do not think that has been achieved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I am grateful for the clarification Senator Macdonald has provided because, frankly, I agree with it. The difficulty has been caused by what he outlined, but we cannot blame the unions for that. Senator Macdonald is quite right: it initiated with the unions. Of course, if they are in a position-as any other person would in the same bargaining situation-such as entering into a contract with someone else, having to bargain with someone where one thinks the other party is going to cave in, fold and give up--</PARA></TALK.START>

I was interested to see that Richard Setchell-who has been one of the severest critics of the Government's reform program until recent times-in the final paragraph of his most recent statement commended the Government on its resolve and hoped we would continue it, and we will. He has been one of its severest critics and he acknowledged on national television-I think in April last year-precisely what Senator Macdonald has said, that the companies and management have to bear a lot of responsibility where, when they had the opportunities in the past on some work practices to stand up and be counted, they failed to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I generally support the remarks of both Senator Macdonald and Senator Collins on this matter because I think we are talking about something terribly important to this country and we should treat it that way. Cheap point scoring should not be the order of the day. However, I point out that there are a lot of people to blame for our present position. Having already had our burst on the unions, about which generally one could not refer to a level playing field by any stretch of the imagination, we must also consider the stevedores in the middle and, of course, the shippers, whom very few mention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But most of us recall the sorts of things that went on: a ship partly loaded, then probably a phoney dispute pulled-whether it be on safety or some political issue-and the shipper going to the stevedore and saying, `What do you have to pay these people? If it is $100,000, give them the cash and let's get the ship out of the port'. They were the sorts of things that went on. They became additive and cumulative because once a union has established that it has achieved an end, from that particular point of time it becomes entrenched. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the greatest difficulties I have when I talk to union people-I think Senator Collins and these people recognise that these things are ridiculous-about giving up these things is that they talk about these `hard won gains'. I think that is the most common phrase I hear within the trade union movement: `We are not about to give up hard won gains'. I think the only way to go down this track is to have more competition between ports. We must get genuine enterprise agreements. If we have an enterprise agreement which is the same for every port we do not have enterprise agreements; we still have the old pooling system with centralised control. </PARA>
<PARA> I make those points because Senator Collins indicated earlier in his second reading speech that he was not hearing anything from the Opposition about where we want to go. If he reads, as Senator Macdonald said, our industrial relations policy, he will see quite clearly that it deals with enterprise based unions, in getting rid of closed shops and introducing competition not only within the employer groups but also within the labour market itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 contains minor administrative amendments to: the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985 and consequential amendments; the Dairy Produce Act 1986; the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act 1986; and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the legislation is to change the names of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation to the Meat Research and Development Corporation and the Australian Dairy Industry Conference Inc. to the Australian Dairy Industry Council. This Bill also introduces equal opportunity amendments for the Australian Dairy Corporation in the same manner as were approved for the Australian Wheat Board. Other amendments in the Bill allow the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation to develop a more commercial role in research. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985, the amendments will change the name of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation to the Meat Research Corporation. The decision to change the name has come from the Corporation to prevent confusion with the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. Owing to the fact that the name occurs in 15 other Acts there are consequential amendments. Other amendments will permit the Government to match industry funding to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 will insert government equal opportunity clauses. This amendment falls into line with legislation relating to other statutory authorities. I take this opportunity to reflect on the debate in this chamber last week, initiated by Senator Newman and Senator Brownhill, with regard to the plight in the rural community of Australia at the moment and, in particular, for the 2 1/2 million women living in rural Australia where the current economic situation is very dire. Inflation, unemployment and high interest rates have hit hard. Pain and anguish stalk our farms and country towns. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well recognised that the hours worked by farm people, especially farm women, are considerably more than the national average and the return for effort in monetary terms is increasingly inadequate. Of a total Australian farm work force in 1989 of some 390,000, approximately 100,000 or 25 per cent were women. Of course, in many instances that probably does not recognise the considerable voluntary contribution by many owner workers, who are women, in this particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to note in a report tabled for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet a survey of rural women in Australia that goes under the title of Life has never been easy. There are a number of issues that have been identified as problems in this area but the factors that stand out as the biggest problems for rural women today are the financial and economic issues. Of course many other issues have to be addressed and it was interesting to note, in that report, issues such as income assistance for farmers in times of rural decline. </PARA>
<PARA> From the perspective of northern Australia, it is interesting to note that the taxation zone rebates for people in zone allowance areas have not been altered by the Labor Government since 1984. Whilst there have been a number of reviews by the country task force set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in recent years, the Government has not alluded to any changes in this area. It was not addressed yesterday in the industry statement. We need to really look very carefully at those zone rebates which have been described as `sufficient to pay the freight on a newspaper, a carton of milk and a loaf of bread'. Certainly the original aims were that the zone rebate particularly in northern Australia would compensate in so many of the other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the other issues that arise, whether they relate to the family allowance supplement, to Austudy or to other areas, we need to recognise that in rural Australia there are problems particularly in areas of entertainment and culture in the non-urban centres, such as access to libraries, arts, crafts, theatre and dance, which are often made on the farm and generated internally. Many people in rural areas have inadequate counselling services. They certainly do not get access to the more urbanely provided child-care facilities. There are just so many areas in which we do have to admire the changes. Therefore, we should note carefully the Government amendments with regard to equal opportunity in this particular Bill and the fact that they relate to a very important principle of merit. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments also change the name of the Australian Dairy Industry Conference to the Australian Dairy Industry Council and its executive council to be known as its executive. The changes require consequential amendments to the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Horticultural Research and Development Act 1987 provide for changes to the commercial role, administrative control and accountability of the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation, and are consistent with those contained within the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 which sets the framework for all rural research. These amendments will allow the Corporation power to commercialise research and development and to join in the formation of a company to acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property. Other amendments allow for meetings to be held by electronic means rather than by having face to face meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the intention of the Opposition to propose an amendment to this piece of legislation to be consistent with the stance that we took in the House of Representatives. Anyone who has studied this legislation will be aware that this amendment relates to the issue of remedying the inefficient and exorbitant costs associated with the current meat inspection system and ensuring that industrial action by meat-workers does not continue to cause serious disruption to the operation of abattoirs. Hidden behind the Government's own amendments to this legislation is the appalling economic situation confronting the rural sector today. It is a fact that our primary industries will be the ones that will see Australia's economy back on the track, and we need to be very careful in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not detain the Senate today because of the urgency of our program and the need to look at this, but it is important to reflect on many of the issues that were raised yesterday by the Prime Minister in his important industry statement. Unfortunately, there was a great paucity in that statement with regard to any reflection about exports or the rural economy. The fact that so many of the decisions seem to have been deferred to a further statement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, some time in April gives us great cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I formally move the amendment which has been distributed in my name:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that the renaming of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation to the Meat Research Corporation will be of minimal effect unless the Government undertakes:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) to remedy the inefficiency and exorbitant costs associated with the current meat inspection system; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to take up much time of the Senate either. I see no point in repeating the adequate description given by Senator Tambling of the purpose of this omnibus legislation. One thing that is noteworthy, as far as the Australian Democrats are concerned, is that we are told in the Bills Alert that the objects of the principal Act-which overrides the primary industries and energy legislation itself-are to increase the economic, environmental or social benefits to members of primary industries and to the community in general by improving the production, processing, storage, transport or marketing of the products of primary industries, to achieve the sustainable use and sustainable management of natural resources, and to improve accountability for expenditure upon research and development activities in relation to primary industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the light of that, we see these Bills, which are proposed to amend the principal legislation, as being entirely in accord with promoting those objectives and making them more achievable. In particular, I am, like Senator Tambling, pleased to see the insertion proposed to bring the equal employment opportunity program within the Dairy Produce Act. Apart from the insertion of the equal opportunity program and the description of how it will be implemented, it is pleasing to see in the schedule that under proposed new section 50a (2) of the Dairy Produce Act the Corporation will be required to `take whatever action is necessary to give effect to the program'. I interpolate here that `whatever action' could well include the opportunity to examine the attitudes of people towards employment of women on an equal basis within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to put into the Act provisions that require appropriate action to be taken to eliminate any discrimination and it is all very well to define terms and to include a list of words and phrases which need to be defined, but the attitudes of people towards each other need to be examined before equal opportunity in employment can be ensured. I think the phrase `whatever action' provides an opportunity for attitudes to be examined. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed by the coalition will not be supported by the Australian Democrats. They are transparently an attempt to put another agenda into this area. In fact, I hear echoes of much of what Senator Crane has been alluding to in his adjournment speeches recently. I believe there is a fault in part (b) of the amendment proposed by the coalition. It contains an assumption that meatworkers are disrupting the operation of abattoirs. The amendment seeks to ensure that industrial action by meatworkers does not continue to cause serious disruption and so contains an unfounded assumption and cannot be justified. We will not support the amendment. Rather than take a lot of time on this matter, I simply indicate that the Australian Democrats support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to join in this debate because I feel that any discussion about primary industries is now of vital importance to Australia's entire economic and social fabric. The Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, which we are now debating, is an omnibus Bill which seeks to make a number of minor amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Basically, it changes the name of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation to the Meat Research Corporation, and the Australian Dairy Industry Conference Inc. to the Australian Dairy Industry Council. It also introduces equal opportunity amendments for the Australian Dairy Corporation in the same manner as was approved for the Australian Wheat Board in past legislation. Other amendments in the Bill allow horticultural research and development to develop a more commercial role in research. These are minor matters as far as the Opposition is concerned, but they are important. Hidden behind these changes is the economic situation which confronts Australia today and the fact that our primary industries are the important industries which can get our economy back on track. </PARA>
<PARA> In its impact, this legislation is not of major significance. However, the circumstances in which it is being debated-the tragic social and economic implications of the rural depression-must be of great concern to this Parliament. Whilst the debate in recent weeks has focused on free and fair trade issues and on the question of protection and tariffs, the horrendous impact of domestic costs has not received the attention it warrants. Already some 60 per cent of the cause of reduced incomes to rural industries today relates directly to our internal structures on interest rates, inflation, outdated work practices and the sustained and continuing attack on the productive sector and its assets. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the Bill before the House refers to equal opportunity for females within these corporate bodies. I do not think anyone would oppose that in any way. It falls into line with legislation relating to other statutory authorities, but I take this opportunity to pay tribute to those women who work within the primary industries. I am speaking about the family farm, which is basically the backbone of agriculture today in Australia, as I trust it will be over the many years ahead. If one goes on the farm today, one finds that the wife of the farmer and even his children share the responsibility for running and working the property. There are certain radical groups who see the current phenomenon of an increasing number of women in the work force as important. I would like to put a slightly different view. In agriculture this is not a success story but the indication of the failure of our social and economic system. Women who have been a partner in farming activities and who have formed a very valuable part of agricultural pursuits are working not to achieve some new career aim but because the chosen career they took up with their partners is regrettably being destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act change the name of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation to the Meat Research Corporation. The decision to change the name came from the Corporation, to prevent its being confused with the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. Other amendments will confine the Government's commitment to match industry research funding to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. As a result of the name changes, 15 other Acts will need to have consequential amendments made to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year I had the opportunity to speak in the Senate on the tabling of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation annual report and I congratulated the Corporation on the research work it has done into major areas affecting the industry both in the on-farm and off-farm sectors. I noted that the Corporation commissioned a number of research programs to service urgent industry needs. A number of them were designed to maximise the benefits for Australian producers and processors from the expanding Asian beef markets, to increase the volume of land going into the higher value domestic and export market, to increase the demand and price for Australian sheepskins and to increase the productivity of cattle and sheep by genetic engineering or rumen microbes. </PARA>
<PARA> However fine and commendable these objectives are, I doubt there has been much success with them in the past year because, as all honourable senators know, there has been a dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of anyone associated with the Australian rural sector. Already honourable senators would know that the nation's greatest single export earner-the wool industry-has had its confidence shattered, and the wheat industry is in similar shape. It does not matter whether we produce the goods; factors outside the farm such as disastrous Government decisions on rural issues, in addition to the Government's economic policies, mean that being on the land is just not profitable. I certainly speak from experience as one who lives on the land and knows of the bills which have to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate: primary industry is not fully recognised as it should be in this country. It is no use sending a delegation of Ministers or even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the United States or the European Economic Community when these countries have no intention in the long term of reducing support for their producers and consumers. I believe this is an important fact to remember. We know that we are efficient upon the farm, but if there is a problem, as there is in the wheat and wool industries, the Government has to come to their support. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the other support that the Government gives to primary industry in this country. We get a rebate on diesel fuel, certainly, and there are other little forms of assistance. I hope that the wheat industry will receive a large form of assistance. But we should compare what is given in Australia with what is given in other countries against which our farmers have to compete. This is the important fact. Our farmer is working his family farm and has his money tied up in the capital of that property, in his stock and plant, and he has to compete with other countries. We ought to be a little more open-minded than we are with regard to the needs of our farmer and the important role that he plays so far as our national economy is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the leading farm organisations within Australia say that farmers want to stand upon their own feet. But can farmers stand upon their own feet when we find that overseas other countries are dumping and are supporting their farmers so much financially? The farmer does not want a handout, but he wants to know that he has friends in government and opposition who are prepared to come to his aid if needs be. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to compete fairly, assistance has to be there for farmers. The Chairman of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation said last year that the decade we have just entered will be a testing one for our sheepmeat and beef industries. He is certainly right about that. He also stated that our markets and consumers' needs are changing significantly and that both sectors must change with them. Producers will have to produce to market specifications which best suit their enterprise, and processors will have to reduce the cost of processing and lower the two to three times difference in costs which exist between Australia and its competitors. Failure to do so will relegate the Australian meat industry to producers of manufacturing meat only and will force us to forgo the premiums associated with quality. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to lower this difference in costs between Australia and its competitors, we should also be looking at the imposts placed on small rural businesses and farming families by bureaucracy and big business. An estimated 30,000 farmers are currently suffering a cost price squeeze which will force many from the industry in the 1990s to join the 30,000 farmers who have already left the industry over the past 30 years. That statistic will surely add weight to the Chairman's predictions for the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent report in my local newspaper, the Courier-Mail, stated that farm incomes are expected to crash by more than 50 per cent in most categories this financial year and continue to decline in 1991-92. The statistics show that wool farms will be hardest hit, as well as mixed farms and wheat farms. The article also reported that even beef farmers, who will fare the best in the next few years, will not do very well. They are still expected to sustain a loss in their cash operating surplus of 14 per cent this financial year from $30,000 last year to $25,700 this year and up to $26,500 next year. The situation for family farmers is even gloomier when depreciation of farm land and equipment is taken into account, with just over 50 per cent of farms expected to have positive incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that many Australians do not realise how bad the rural downturn has become. They do not understand the critical problems facing farmers and graziers. Most Australians live in urban communities where they expect, or these days hope, to receive a weekly wage packet, where all manner of services are readily available and where governments provide an infrastructure that for the most part is adequate to meet demands. Urban Australians are shielded from the most obvious effects of depressed commodity markets. They pay less for basic goods because they live within the reach of transport systems in which costs are moderated by the economies of scale. Droughts reduce them only to rationing the water with which they sprinkle their lawns. Other quirks of nature are largely insurable disasters. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrast this comfortable lifestyle with that of the people in the bush, whose efforts, ever since we became a nation and from well before that time, have produced the export income which underpins Australian society. Their products are subject to the fickleness of world commodity markets. Their hard-won and finely honed skills are rendered redundant by technology. They pay vastly more for petrol and all kinds of services and equipment because the national transport system cannot deliver goods to remote areas cost effectively. Droughts lead not to parched lawns but to ruination. Hailstorms and floods wipe out crops and stock. </PARA>
<PARA> Against all this, the very price of living and working in the bush keeps rising far beyond the cosily metropolitan confines of the consumer price index. The family farm is being driven out of business and the country is being flayed raw. Meanwhile, governments have decided to make the user pay. That is fine. There is no problem with that. But I want to remind senators that there are fewer and fewer people in the bush who can pay and who are there to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a golden opportunity to become the world's greatest agricultural exporter with its pollution free food. We are on the doorstep of rapidly emerging Asian markets, the demand from which is expected to lift commodity prices in real terms for the first time this century. However, we must work to ensure that government policies do not prevent us from servicing those markets. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not much use to so rationalise our rural sector that we eventually see the demise of the family farm. If in the process of achieving cost efficient industries we push the family farmer off the land, in the long run we are certainly serving no really good purpose for Australia. We should ever be vigilant that we do not allow ideology on economic issues and crass politics to misplace the needs of people. This is what is happening in many industries today, I regret to say, and it is at the expense of one of the most important sections of our community-the small family farmer, whose economic survival is at risk. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Loan Bill 1991 seeks to give the Government authority to borrow funds to meet the shortfall that is occurring between the moneys appropriated by the Parliament in the Budget last year and, subsequently, the funds that are available through the Consolidated Revenue Fund to meet those appropriations. To some extent, this Bill is a standard technical Bill to authorise the financing in situations such as this. To that extent, it is essentially identical with Loan Bills that have been required for similar purposes in the past. This is the first Loan Bill that we have had since 1987. In the years since then there has been a sufficient surplus in the Government's accounts to meet the requirements through the appropriations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, the Bill is a Bill that we were not going to have. It is a little like the recession of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that he was not going to let happen-the recession that a few months later he then said we had to have. We were not going to have a loan Bill in this financial year, 1990-91. It was not going to be required because the Government had budgeted for an $8.1 billion surplus only last August when the 1990-91 Budget was brought down. But because of the major unravelling of the whole of the Government's fiscal policy and, as a result of that, the massive deterioration in the budgetary situation, the Government is now going to be forced to go to the market for considerable funds to finance the gap that now exists between the funds in the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the appropriations that have been made. As I say, this is a bit like the recession that we were not going to have and then that we had to have. This is a Bill that we were not going to have but that we now have to have. </PARA>
<PARA> Had the Bill been programmed and planned properly at the start of the year, and had the Government read the political wind, it would surely have recognised that a loan Bill would have been required, because there was no way that the Government was ever going to reach its estimated surplus figures for this year. We said so on the very day the Budget was brought down, and everything that has happened since then has confirmed the accuracy of the coalition's predictions on that front. Had the Government planned for a loan Bill, as it should have done, this Bill would have been, along with normal practice, introduced into the Parliament shortly after the Appropriation Bills had been passed last year. So the normal time for the introduction of a loan Bill is somewhere around October each year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Loan Bill, which I say at the outset the coalition, of course, is not opposing, is needed simply because of quite massive financial mismanagement on the part of the Government and quite massive financial budgetary irresponsibility. It is those things that have led to the unravelling of the Budget; the deterioration in the Budget situation; and, therefore, the need for this Bill. It is for that reason that, whilst not opposing this Bill, on behalf of the coalition I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but that the Senate condemns the Government for its economic mismanagement and fiscal irresponsibility, which has resulted in a severe and protracted recession and lead to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a substantial shortfall in Commonwealth revenues for the year ending 30 June 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a major increase in Commonwealth expenditure for the year ending 30 June 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a reduction in the Budget forecast of an $8.1 billion surplus to a possible deficit for 1990-91;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) an increase in the public sector's call on national savings of up to 3% of Gross Domestic Product in 1990-91, compared with the Budget forecast of a zero requirement; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) an expected deficit starting point for the 1991-92 Budget based on existing forward estimates.''</PARA>
<PARA>Looking briefly at each of those points in the amendment, there has been a major erosion in Commonwealth revenues to date this financial year that will continue for the remainder of this financial year. That is essentially due to the recession-a recession which, according to Senator Button in his reply to me during debate last week, the Government apparently did not forecast at the time of bringing down the Budget last August. Yet it was only three months after that that the Treasurer admitted that we were in recession. He could not do anything else because the national accounts figures showed indisputably that this was the case. It was a recession that, in any case, everyone in Australia knew we were in the middle of but it took three months after the Budget for the Treasurer to admit that. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the Treasurer said, when admitting the recession, that it was a recession that we had to have, that it had been deliberately engineered and that he, the Treasurer, and the Government had actually pulled the levers to engineer it, Senator Button advised me last week in this place that none of that had been forecast at the time the Budget was brought down on 21 August and, therefore, there was no expectation on the Government's part that the revenue shortfall and the expenditure overrun, which I will come to in a second, was likely to occur. I find that absolutely amazing; it is quite extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also extraordinary that that issue was not addressed at all yesterday in the industry statement. There was no recognition or acknowledgment at all of any weakening of fiscal policy. Indeed, whilst announcements made yesterday in the industry statement will not have much fiscal impact in this current financial year, I believe that a time bomb has been built into the Budget in that over the next two or three years, commencing in 1991-92, the budgetary position is going to be made that much more difficult by yesterday's decisions. In 1993-94 the impact of yesterday's budgetary decisions through the industry statement will be no less than $1.2 billion and in 1992-93 it will not be much short of that figure either. It is extraordinary, though, that none of that was acknowledged in yesterday's industry statement. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a major shortfall in Commonwealth revenues in this current financial year because of the recession. Company tax payments are down enormously, pay as you earn payments are down very significantly and sales tax receipts and indirect tax receipts are down right across the board. Just a couple of weeks ago the Treasurer admitted to the Economic Planning Advisory Council that the shortfall in terms of some of those revenues was going to be of the order of $2.8 billion. On a realistic assessment, it is not difficult to get that figure up to $4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> This year the Government has had this major shortfall in revenues at the same time as it has had major increases in Commonwealth expenditure. The point that the Treasurer is trying to delude the Australian community into believing is that this massive increase in government spending has all been due just to the automatic impact of the recession on such things, in particular, as the payment of unemployment benefit. It is simply not true that the major part, or by any means all, of the expenditure blow-out has been due to that at all. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been major discretionary decisions taken by the Government since the Budget was brought down last August which have added to that increase in Commonwealth spending. Even if we had not had a recession and even if we had not had the additional spending decisions that have been taken since the Budget, we still would have had a major increase in the Commonwealth's own purpose spending during 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> Last August when the Government was talking about fiscal responsibility and the need for us all to pull in our belts and so on, the Treasurer was budgeting for an increase in the Government's own purpose spending of about 12 per cent-5 1/2 per cent in real terms and roughly 6 1/2 per cent for inflation. So, while the Treasurer was reading the Australian people a lecture about the need for financial discipline in their own households and businesses, in his own household and business he was going for a massive 12 per cent increase in Commonwealth Government spending. The Treasurer tried to dress that up by making it look not as bad as that by squeezing the Commonwealth payments to the States so that the increase in State spending was much less and therefore, the overall budgetary look from the Commonwealth was that much less. But let no-one be in any doubt that there was a major increase in Government spending planned at the time of the last Budget. That has been executed and executed plus because of all the other things that have happened since then, only one of which actually is the impact of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Taking that shortfall in revenues and the overrun in expenditures into account, the Government now has a totally discredited Budget surplus figure that was quoted at the time of the Budget. The Treasurer was so certain of it that he quoted it to three decimal points. The Treasurer said that the Budget for 1990-91 would come in at $8.107 billion. That figure now, even on the Treasurer's own admission, is down to $1.7 billion, at best. Indeed, in a television interview only 10 days ago the Treasurer said that the Budget for the year could go into deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> What makes that even more extraordinary, apart from the unbelievably bad economic management and financial planning to get such a turnaround-I think the largest turnaround that has occurred in postwar history-between what was planned at the time of the Budget and what the actual Budget outturn was, is the admission the other day by the Treasurer that the Budget could finish up with a deficit. He said, `But that would not be any great calamity; there would be no calamity in that'. This is despite the fact that one of the key planks of his Budget Speech in August was that the maintenance of fiscal discipline, which he described as the $8.1 billion surplus plan, was the principal weapon that the Government was going to use against the current account deficit, against the debt situation and, therefore, by implication, against inflation and all the other problems besetting the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> That principal weapon of the Government has gone absolutely out of the window. The Government has not put anything at all in its place; indeed, it is not even admitting now that it has lost the principal weapon, so one could not get a starker example of the lack of understanding by this Treasurer about the economy and the requirements of economic policy. I will come back in a moment to the implications of that, because that is what this Loan Bill is very much about. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this massive deterioration in the Budget, there will be an increase in the public sector's call on national savings. I estimate-various commentators have estimated different figures-that the call on national savings by the public sector in this financial year, that is, 1990-91, will be up to 3 per cent of gross domestic product. That is a figure of $10 to $12 billion, and that compares with the Treasurer's statement in the Budget last August that the public sector as a whole, as a result of his so-called fiscal responsibility and fiscal discipline, would be in balance for the year as a whole. That obviously is wildly out. Far from the Commonwealth and the public sector's accounts contributing to the national savings pool, what in fact is going to happen this year is that the public sector generally-the Commonwealth Government particularly, but also State and local government-has got its hands right in the cookie jar of the national savings, and that is going to be of great detriment to the private sector and is going to have some very significant implications for financial management and interest rate policy over the next couple of years. I will come back to that shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the fourth point in the coalition's condemnatory amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. The last one, and it follows automatically from the four I have just mentioned, is that, because of all those things that have happened this financial year-and when one looks at the Government's own Forward Estimates for the next financial year, 1991-92-it appears that there would be no way in which the Government, in starting the framing of next year's Budget, would be starting other than from a position of deficit, and quite a potentially significant deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many things that can and should be done to rectify that situation. I will not go into those today because they will be, very importantly, the subject for debate when we resume tomorrow to debate the Government's industry statement-the four statements by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer, Senator Button, and, to the extent that one can call it a statement, Senator Cook, so I will not go into those. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has had on the books for several years now a very clear set of policies in the areas of Budget policy, spending and taxing, wages policy, privatisation, and freeing up the economy through this so-called micro-economic reform to make our economy more competitive and more efficient. Those policies are very clearly set down. There is a whole integrated package of such policies. We will be debating those further tomorrow, as we have done on many occasions in the past, and as recently as yesterday. What I fail to understand is the Government's constant bleating to the Opposition that the Opposition does not have a set of policies. The Government knows perfectly well that that is absolute nonsense. I see that Senator Button is almost prepared to nod in acknowledgment of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been some criticism to that effect. On the other hand, by wide sections of the business community the cuts have been welcomed. If the Government were to proceed further with reduction in revenues from various items, the same people in the business community would say, as Senator Short was saying here this morning, that we were moving towards a greater degree of fiscal imbalance. So it is a matter of judgment about what can be done at any particular time. This is the Government's judgment and we stand by it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health. Will the Minister please inform the Senate whether administrative changes are being made to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS)? If so, at what point are discussions with the Privacy Commissioner in relation to those changes?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1779" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that the Government announced its intention to undertake a major restructuring of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and a rationalisation of retail pharmaceutical outlets. Important elements of both of those reforms are planned administrative changes which greatly improve the efficiency of the PBS administration and greatly enhance the integrity of that administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that Senator Patterson asked me a question two days ago concerning the use of Medicare cards and checking pharmaceutical benefit entitlements. The question was whether the Privacy Commissioner's concerns still applied to the direct compulsory computer link proposed between pharmacists and the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) and what she referred to as the compulsory transmission scheme. There is a fair amount of confusion in the community, and I believe it may have been reflected in Senator Patterson's question, as to what elements of the Government's initiatives are intended to be compulsory. For many years pharmacists have had the option of lodging their PBS claims electronically, using diskette, or by dial-up transmission to the department, now the HIC.</PARA>
<PARA> This scheme has been voluntary and was introduced with incentives by the Government. It now accounts for in excess of 60 per cent of the claims lodged by pharmacists. It is referred to as the claims transmission system (CTS). However, the nature and quality of data submitted by pharmacists under the PBS have been found to be inadequate by the Australian Audit Office. Specifically, it is insufficient to allow the HIC to check the eligibility of patients against pensioner and concessional entitlement information supplied by the Department of Social Security (DSS) and, hence, there are concerns about the accuracy and legitimacy of PBS payments.</PARA>
<PARA> Within the context of the 1990-91 Budget, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services decided that something had to be done to address the concerns of the Australian Audit Office about the PBS, which the Audit Office categorised as a simple bill paying service for pharmacists. He therefore announced that from June 1991 the HIC would no longer accept manual claims for processing and that all claims had to be submitted using the CTS. This is the only aspect of the Budget proposals for data interchange between pharmacists and the HIC that is intended to be compulsory. I emphasise that is data to verify claims only. The Privacy Commissioner is aware of this initiate, but has concentrated on other elements of the package centred upon eligibility checking.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister wrote to the Privacy Commissioner at the time of the Budget, outlining the Government's proposal for processing and the way it intended to address the issues raised by the Privacy Commissioner in February 1990. Specifically, the Government proposed to specify in legislation, or in a form that can be scrutinised by the Parliament, the precise nature of information that is to be supplied by DSS to the HIC for the purpose of eligibility checking and to introduce guidelines supervised by the Privacy Commissioner to reinforce the rights and obligations of various parties who will have access to eligibility data and to address the tensions that might arise between pharmacists and patients concerning eligibility issues. Legislation required to support these initiatives will be introduced into the Parliament later in this session. There has been close communication and discussion with the Privacy Commissioner on all steps of the Government's proposals and the Government is confident that the measures it is taking will address all the privacy issues concerned.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is a reasonable anticipation and estimate. It is reasonable to expect that this industry will not remain insulated from the effects of a general business downturn, but I think that has to be put into some perspective. A downturn in the computer industry is being experienced throughout the developed economies. The advice of industry analysts International Data Corporation is that the downturn in Australia is much less marked than in the major world markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Details of a survey by Price Waterhouse published in the Australian Financial Review last week confirmed that Australia is one of the few nations in the world to sustain spending on information technology. The publication in November last year of results for the top 100 companies in the Australian market showed revenue growth of 16 per cent over the previous year. Industry expectations are that in the coming year revenue growth will be only half that figure. However, that is still a healthy growth rate by most standards.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important not to lose a longer term perspective of this industry's very considerable strengths. There are a significant number of very capable firms in the software and services sector which can be expected to expand when market conditions improve. Already these firms have grown substantially since the announcement of the information industry strategy in 1987. In addition, there are substantial commitments by major transnational companies for research, development and exports. In 1987, the industry set itself a target of doubling the industry's output in 10 years and it is very likely that that result will be achieved in half the time. It is a very strong sector of the Australian economy and of course it is one which was referred to yesterday in the industry statement, and the strengths of that industry were recognised in that statement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received a brief from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and I am able to, I think, answer most of the points raised by Senator McLean. The Westpac Banking Corporation provides new loans under the scheme and owns and administers all defence service home mortgages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to questions two and three-how many other banks sought to operate this scheme and what criteria were used to select the bank?-I have had some information provided by the Department of Finance to this effect: following the calling of expressions of interest by the Department of Finance task force on asset sales for the sale of the business of the Defence Service Homes Corporation and the right to make new DSH loans, responses were received from 18 organisations. Of these, four banks and two building society groups proposed outright purchase. The others proposed various other options.</PARA>
<PARA> The task force on asset sales was responsible for assessing proposals and negotiating the sale. I understand that the main criteria were the return to the Commonwealth from the sale, the ongoing cost of running the scheme and the ability of the institution to undertake the business.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the fourth question, portfolio assets generally comprising outstanding loans worth $1.38 billion were acquired by Westpac in 1988-89. Of those loans remaining following borrower repayments, the face value at 1 March 1991 was $1.2 billion. In addition, the face value of DSH loans lent by Westpac since the sale at 5 March 1991 was $289.92m.</PARA>
<PARA> I am asked what was the amount of premium paid for these assets and to whom was it paid. The total amount paid by Westpac for the DSH business and new lending rights was $1.48 billion, comprising the face value of the assets and a premium of $100m.

The CAA had certainly taken steps to consult the unions, but it was done in such a short space of time that many of the far-flung employees of the organisation-there are some 7,000 spread across Australia-found out about it through the media.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to the AM program this morning, and to my astonishment this line was run again. If Dr Hewson keeps doing this, he will have to change his name to Dr Goebbels, because it is the same principle; the principle being, of course, that if one tells a lie often enough people will believe it. The significance of what happened this morning on AM is that waterfront reform has become a mantra for Dr Hewson. In every single interview he delivers he says, `Waterfront, waterfront, waterfront'. He knows nothing about it. The significance of this is that he continues to give it a very high priority and continues to demonstrate his complete ignorance of the processes. As I said in debate in the Senate this morning, I cannot understand why, because there are sufficient criticisms to make of the waterfront based on fact without needing to rely on fiction. This is what Dr Hewson said this morning:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Conaust went outside the WIRA agreement to get that deal.</PARA>
<PARA>He is just continuing to repeat the nonsense that has been delivered by Mr Sharp. As I said in the Senate the other day, the Opposition has no excuse for its ignorance because the provision for the involvement of the Industrial Relations Commission is contained on the first page of the agreement-page 1. But if Dr Hewson needs to go beyond that, I would refer him to the transcripts of Commissioner Sweeney in the Industrial Relations Commission both in the Cairns decision and in the Conaust decision, where Commissioner Sweeney laid out very clearly the relative responsibilities in this process of both the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) and the Commission. If he needs any further evidence, I would refer him to the most recent public statement of Captain Richard Setchell of Conaust Ltd, without question one of the severest public critics to this point of the Government's program. This is what Captain Setchell said:</PARA>
<PARA>Our on-going commitment and belief in the established system-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the waterfront reform process-</PARA>
<PARA>has been vindicated by the decisions made by the Commission yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission's direction was based, we believe, on a rational and logical evaluation of the issues put before it for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> We are further reassured by the fact that the Commission has had the courage to present a decision based on merit rather than industrial compromise.</PARA>
<PARA> Conaust and CTAL believe that the Commission's decision has created an atmosphere that will lead to an agreement that will address both the needs of the waterfront and the Australian economy in what has to be accepted to be particularly trying times.</PARA>
<PARA> We are also confident-</PARA>
<PARA>and I can assure the Senate that the confidence is well placed-</PARA>
<PARA>that the Government will maintain its fortitude shown so far and continue to push through not only these first steps of the waterfront reform process-</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat, `not only these first steps of the waterfront reform process'-</PARA>
<PARA>but other and resultant issues . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is, as I said in the Senate the other day, Dr Hewson has no excuse for continuing to push this nonsense. The Commission is part of the process and was recognised as such by the parties when they signed the in-principle agreement. Indeed, I was in the position of publicly defending Conaust when it took this to the Commission through WIRA and attacks that were being made by some people on the union side that they were doing no more than asserting their rights under the program. I add that in terms of the continuing nonsense-this was a beauty on AM this morning; I blinked a bit when I heard it-Dr Hewson shoved in another one of these great anecdotal stories. A few weeks ago he talked about the thousands of tonnes of salt we have to import from Mexico because of our inefficient waterfront when, in fact, we do not import enough salt to sprinkle on a tomato. This morning on AM he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We want to sell cars to New Zealand for example and we have to ship them via Japan.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where he got that one from, but that is another whopper; it is just absolute nonsense. In conclusion, as Captain Setchell says, the Conaust agreement was a vindication of the process, it was not outside the process. Members of the Opposition-if I could give them a piece of gratuitous political advice-would be doing themselves far more credit on this issue if they laid their criticism on facts, and there are plenty of them around, instead of on fiction as they do.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1785" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government very strongly supports the development of a mutually beneficial, unofficial, commercial relationship between Australia and Taiwan. We do, therefore, very much welcome the visit to Taiwan at the end of this month by a group of senior Australian business leaders led by Mr Dean Wills of Coca-Cola Amatil. Whether or not Dr Hewson and his parliamentary colleagues choose to be associated with this visit as seems likely to be the case is, so far as the Government is concerned, a matter for them to decide. An unofficial visit for commercial purposes does not imply any movement away from the Government's strict adherence to a one-China policy. I make that clear for the record because there has been some questioning about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that the shadow Minister for trade and trade negotiations, Mr Downer, has in the context of this proposed visit been reported in the media as saying that the group would promise Taiwan that a coalition government will increase Australia's representation in Taipei and allow Taiwan to open an office in Canberra. He has also reported that he has been, on a number of previous occasions, adversely comparing, as Senator Faulkner said, Australia's representation in Taiwan with that of Canada.</PARA>
<PARA> As I announced on 12 November in the statement on Australian policy towards Taiwan, the Government does support the strengthening of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office (ACIO) in Taiwan and, reciprocally, Taiwan's commercial offices in Australia. Since then, an additional Australian staff member has commenced duties at ACIO. Taiwan has indicated that it wishes to strengthen its commercial representation in Melbourne, as well as to establish an office in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> As I confirmed in Parliament, Taiwan's proposals in this respect have been the subject of active consideration by the Government. I am now able to say in relation to the proposal to establish a commercial office in Canberra that the Government has recently advised the Taiwan authorities, through ACIO, that we agree that such an office may be opened-the timing of that move is still under consideration by the two sides.</PARA>

He seems quite oblivious of the fact that there are more home-based staff serving in the Australian office in Taiwan than in the Canadian office, and that ACIO's functions are broader than those of the Canadian office. Even more importantly, and spectacularly, Mr Downer appears to have totally ignored the fact that in 1990 the value of Australian exports to Taiwan was $US1.6 billion, almost double the value of Canada's exports at $US840m, according to Taiwan's statistics. I see no point therefore in following Mr Downer's advice that we should use Canada as a model for Australia in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industrial Relations. It stems from some confusion in the wider community and obvious confusion in the ranks of the Opposition about the flexibility provisions resulting from the award restructuring process. Can the Minister advise honourable senators how the flexibility clauses in restructured awards operate? Will the Minister also advise what provisions exist in the flexibility clauses to protect the interests of workers, particularly those with weak bargaining power?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1786" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Sherry for his continuing keen and intelligent interest in industrial relations. Doubtless this question arises because in some of the post-industry statement comments that have been made there has been reference to the so-called inflexibility of the Australian labour market, which is really meant to be the inflexibility of the wage fixing system. I am struck on the one hand that spokespersons for the Opposition refer to the SPC dispute as an example of their ideal in flexibility. I remind the Senate that the SPC outcome occurred through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and demonstrated, therefore, the very flexibility that Opposition spokespeople pretend does not exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The award restructuring processes that have been referred to have resulted in many changes in reforms to the way workers and managers organise their work in the workplace. A particularly positive feature of award restructuring has been the incorporation into awards of some very important flexibility clauses.</PARA>
<PARA> Nearly all major awards now include enterprise flexibility clauses and/or facilitative clauses. Facilitative clauses enable managers and employees to reach agreement at the workplace level on specified conditions or issues consistent with the general less prescriptive award provision. For example, the ordinary hours of work as specified in an award may be extended from, say, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Friday, to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Saturday, and within this expanded range managers and employees can negotiate the range of hours which best suits their needs without having to go back to the Commission to do so. Most facilitative clauses state that the union must be consulted and/or a sizeable proportion of the workers, around 60 per cent, must agree with the changes that are being proposed.</PARA>
<PARA> Enterprise flexibility clauses are different clauses which incorporate negotiating frameworks into awards allowing agreements to be reached that enable award provisions to be altered at the enterprise level. The range of issues on which agreement can be reached is generally much wider than that available under facilitative clauses. These issues include: the provision for time off in lieu of overtime; the introduction of 12-hour shifts; increased flexibility in the taking of annual leave; expansion of the span of hours in which penalty rates do not apply; and the reduction of the minimum payment for weekend overtime. Enterprise flexibility clauses typically contain provisions to protect the interests of workers such as the requirement for consultation with unions and ratification of award variations by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has introduced even further scope for enterprise flexibility through the facility for employers to register section 115 certified agreements. This facility allows employers and unions, by agreement, to opt out of a formal award structure and register with the Industrial Relations Commission a set of arrangements tailored to the particular enterprise. However, such agreements must be judged by the Industrial Relations Commission to be in the interests of the parties involved and not against the public interest. At November last year, 45 certified agreements had been registered.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that, in the current national wage case, the hearing of which has been completed and we now await judgment, the Government has submitted that there should be greater flexibility devolved to the enterprise and to allow particular negotiation for achieved productivity and profitability gains. I note that last Saturday Mr Ian Spicer, the chief executive of the Confederation of Australian Industry, said of the flexibility in the current system, `The system is able to deliver extraordinary flexibility if that is what employers really want'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all honourable senators will appreciate, the situation throughout Yugoslavia is indeed tense at the moment. The events in recent days are the latest manifestation of the very considerable uncertainty which exists there about the country's future. As Senator Loosley said, a large demonstration was held in Belgrade just a few days ago, on 9 March, in which over 50,000 people protested against the policies of the Government of the Republic of Serbia and in particular government control over television. The Serbian authorities had not given permission for the demonstration to be held. They called on police, supported by the army, to disperse the crowd and two people were killed and some 70 injured in the ensuing violence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tension remains high in Belgrade, where demonstrations for and against the Serbian Government of President Milosevic are continuing to take place. It is the case that the Serbian Assembly has now agreed to set up a commission of inquiry into the violence, and reports this morning indicate that the Serbian authorities have now dismissed a number of senior officials in the broadcasting organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government certainly welcomes these decisions as first steps. We hope that as a result of the inquiry the violent scenes of the weekend will not be repeated. The circumstances of these disturbances are only part of a larger pattern of difficulty throughout Yugoslavia, where the non-communist governments of the republics of Croatia and Slovenia are calling for the creation of a loose confederation where sovereignty would reside in the individual republics, whereas the traditionalist communist Government of Serbia is wishing to maintain the present federal structure and centralised government. There have been several incidents in Croatia recently where confrontation between Croats and Serbs has occurred. Fortunately, they have not triggered wider ethnic unrest.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said in a statement on behalf of the Government on 1 February, the Australian Government urges all political forces in Yugoslavia to work together to find a peaceful solution to that country's problems. May I also take this opportunity to reassure the many thousands of Australians with relations in Yugoslavia that the Government is very conscious of their concerns. We will do what we can to encourage a peaceful solution to the problems in that country that respects the wishes of the people. We especially urge the Serbian authorities to exercise maximum restraint in dealing with protesters. We take the view and have communicated the view that mass protest of the kind currently under way in Belgrade should be met with dialogue, not strongarm tactics.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an extraordinary question, which has been prompted by a front organisation of the Church of Scientology, which has published a tremendous amount of material which I know has raised misgivings in the community about the role of Interpol. I am very proud of the fact that the South Pacific island states have requested the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in Canberra to provide a regional communications network for their Interpol communications. That will be set up in Canberra under the auspices of the Australian Federal Police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for Interpol, it is true that 154 countries are members; so it embraces a wide range of regimes, including several of the great democracies such as the United States, the United Kingdom and, of course, Australia. Indeed, the Secretary-General of Interpol, whom I had the pleasure of meeting a couple of weeks ago, is a distinguished law enforcement officer from Scotland Yard and he has a very high reputation in United Kingdom policing. He is now based in Lyons in France, which is the headquarters of Interpol.</PARA>
<PARA> The second question which Senator Spindler asked was about Manuel Noriega. Various assertions have been made about Manuel Noriega, including by this Church of Scientology front organisation, that he once headed Interpol's drug division, which is a ludicrous and absurd suggestion. All that the honourable senator asked in his question was whether Manuel Noriega had been given an Interpol award for his anti-drug activities. The answer is no. At a regional conference held in Panama, I think in 1987, Manuel Noriega was given a memento of the fact that the conference was held, as often happens when a visiting head of government or head of state attends the opening of a conference. It was no more than that.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked whether I am aware of claims by Nazi war criminal hunter, Simon Wiesenthal, that Interpol files were used by known Nazis before, during and after the war. The supposed Nazi past of Interpol has been thrown up from time to time. The facts are these: prior to the Second World War, the headquarters of Interpol were in Vienna and, of course, came under German control when Austria was annexed by Germany in 1938. In 1940, Interpol headquarters were moved to Berlin. The presidents of Interpol during that time were Nazi appointed senior officers of the Gestapo.</PARA>
<PARA> With the collapse of Germany in 1945, this Nazi dominated body ceased to exist; indeed, it had ceased to function normally during the war years when many members of Interpol were, of course, at war with Germany. In 1946, at an international conference in Brussels, it was decided to create a new Interpol based in France. Whilst, as I say, there was that unfortunate interregnum, if you like, during the war years, that is understandable. But the Nazi taint certainly did not affect the subsequent operations of Interpol.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the honourable senator's question about the procedures for information exchange between the Australian National Central Bureau of Interpol and the police forces of other Interpol members, they are fairly straightforward. If the United States, under some jurisdiction there, wishes to make an inquiry as to whether an alleged fugitive offender, for example on a murder charge, has fled the jurisdiction in the United States and is thought to be somewhere in Australia, that request for identification of the whereabouts of the person would be passed on to the AFP in Canberra, to its Interpol section, and the Victorian and New South Wales police forces would be asked to assist and, if they wished to, they would.</PARA>
<PARA> As for inspections by Australian citizens of any files Interpol may have on them, the operations of Interpol in Australia, conducted by the AFP, are strictly under the control of the Commissioner of the AFP and are subjected to all the normal safeguards of freedom of information. The Ombudsman has his normal role in relation to the handling of complaints about Interpol in so far as they have effect in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In short, the operations of Interpol, certainly in Australia, are conducted according to the laws of this country and are the responsibility of the Federal Police Commissioner. Everything that occurs here in Australia is subject, in particular, I emphasise, to the supervision of the Ombudsman's office, and the usual process for dealing with complaints is supervised by him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia and Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications. Is the Minister aware that the brunt of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) cutbacks in the last three years has been borne by outlying areas, and that these cutbacks have resulted in a policy of centralising production in Sydney and Melbourne? Is the Minister also aware that in those three years Queensland has lost production of Countrywide, and our input to radio's Country Hour has more than halved; that Queensland is now the only State in which neither ABC radio nor television broadcasts local sport; that Queensland's ABC education department has been reduced from a staff of six to just one, which has had a disastrous effect for children living in remote areas; and that Queensland has lost two regional television centres and now has the lowest number of projected production hours of any State? Finally, I ask: in view of the fact that Queensland is a highly decentralised State with many rural areas relying heavily on ABC broadcasts, what action can the Minister take to ensure that rural Queenslanders are not to be the only ones to bear the brunt of further ABC cutbacks?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts are that Queenslanders are not in the position of bearing the brunt of the cutbacks. The facts are that, despite the cutbacks that have been referred to by Senate Bjelke-Petersen in terms of programming, this Government continues to maintain a very high level of financial support for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The facts also are-and I can attest to this from personal experience, and Senator Bjelke-Petersen addressed the question to me in that role as well-that the ABC continues to provide a very high quality of service to rural Australians. As I listen to the ABC far more often than I do to any other news source, which I freely admit, I am aware that the quality is being well and truly maintained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as programming decisions made by the ABC are concerned, as I have reiterated in this place many times before, they are matters for the ABC and its board.

<PARA> So far as the rationalisation of the programs is concerned, I take on board what Senator Bjelke-Petersen is saying, but I might add that what the ABC is doing is no different from what Australian Airlines Ltd, Ansett Australia-I am talking about other issues in my own portfolio-the Civil Aviation Authority and, indeed, the waterfront are currently doing, that is, finally overhauling and rationalising the services provided within their budget.</PARA>

<PARA>That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the report of the inquiry into the death of Walter James Barney. I want to highlight some of the findings of this report because I think they are fairly significant. This report has been written by Commissioner Johnston. </PARA>
<PARA> Walter James Barney was 39 years old when he died in Townsville prison on 22 February 1981. The cause of death was haemorrhaging in the lungs precipitated by chronic lung disease from which Barney had suffered for many years. Barney was into the third day of a default sentence of seven days imprisonment after being convicted for drunkenness in a public place. Walter Barney lived with his friends as a homeless park dweller, a way of life, according to one of his sisters, which he preferred. As far back as 1964 Barney had been convicted of vagrancy. </PARA>
<PARA> To ascribe total blame to Barney for his inability to change his lifestyle in the intervening years is to misunderstand the significance of the historical and social realities that conditioned his life and the life of his parents and to underestimate the continuing effects of a history of paternalism and authoritarianism to which very many Aboriginal people in Queensland have been subjected. The life and death of Walter Barney stands as grim testimony to the inadequacy of the remedies utilised by the Queensland criminal justice system in dealing with homeless Aboriginal people addicted to alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA> On 20 February 1981, Barney appeared before Mr John Winmill, SM, in the Townsville Magistrates Court charged with drunkenness. He was convicted and fined $10, and in default seven days imprisonment. No time was allowed for him to pay the fine and Barney was taken to serve in Townsville prison his fifty-fourth sentence for public drunkenness. He was received at Townsville Prison at 3.35 p.m. on 20 February 1981. I think this is where we need to look at the sequence of events from then on. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the usual practice on arrival at the prison in the absence of a visiting medical officer, Barney was examined by the prisoner who acted as a medical orderly. The prisoner medical or derly had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1973 and shortly thereafter had been made medical orderly. His only qualification for the position was a first aid certificate he obtained when working on the Snowy Mountains scheme many years previously. Following the prisoner medical orderly's examination of Barney, he recorded the following on Barney's prison medical record:</PARA>
<PARA>Drunk</PARA>
<PARA>Reception</PARA>
<PARA> . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Shake from grog</PARA>
<PARA>Melerill . . . </PARA>
<PARA>seen by P.M.O. </PARA>
<PARA>No specific instruction or direction existed in 1981 as to the inspection of the inmates in the observation cells. The frequency of such inspections was, it seems, a matter for the discretion of the individual prison officers, who themselves had no medical training which would enable them to determine the necessary frequency of such inspections. </PARA>
<PARA> On 22 February 1981, the day Barney died, prison officer William Keith Lakos was rostered on duty from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in A Wing. At 11.15 a.m. on 22 February 1981, Lakos and prison officer Gary William McClintock locked up the A Wing prisoners and went to lunch. In a statement made to the superintendent the same day, Lakos said that `the four OBS prisoners were all okay'. </PARA>
<PARA> Lakos has since left the prison service and cannot now be located. McClintock told the Commission that he now had `only a vague recollection of the events surrounding' Barney's death. No log of duty or occurrence record was kept by the prison in relation to A Wing and no witnesses can now recall the presence or activities of prison officers or prisoners in the vicinity of A Wing that day. </PARA>
<PARA> The report concluded that, whilst Barney's death was not preventable, his care and management whilst in Townsville Prison can be described only as deplorable. That the facilities were inadequate is now recognised and, following the Commission of Review into Corrective Services in Queensland by Commissioner Jim Kennedy, it is planned to make significant changes in the provision of health services to all correctional services in Queensland. What those changes will be and when they will be implemented remains to be seen. </PARA>

<PARA>This particular young Aboriginal man died in a cell at the Alice Springs Prison on 16 June 1980. He was aged 24, and a Warlpiri man. He had been locked up in his cell at about 5 p.m. on the previous day. He was then found suspended at a little after 8 a.m. when the day-shift officers, who had just come on duty, unlocked the doors to the cells. These are the facts, and I quote from the report by Commissioner Elliott Johnston, QC, who has the following to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It would be difficult to imagine a less satisfactory policy investigation into a death in custody than occurred in this case. The incompetence, disinterest and prejudgment of the investigators may be gauged by even a limited listing of some of the deficiencies of the investigation:</PARA>
<PARA>* No item was seized as an exhibit . . .</PARA>
<PARA>* No journal, book, record or diary of any description was seized. </PARA>
<PARA>The sheet which had been used to form the noose has not been produced. The identities of the other prisoners in that particular wing of the prison and their location were not ascertained. No effort was made to discover from friends or family whether the deceased had a motive for suicide. No measurements were taken or diagrams made of the cell. The clothing of the deceased was neither seized nor subjected to any investigation. No interest was taken in the checking process, which should have happened at 6 a.m.-two hours before he was actually found. Police did not take photographs at the autopsy and police attached no significance to the autopsy finding of a contusion to the back of the head of the person who was found hanged. That particular contusion was found by Dr Perera at the post-mortem examination. </PARA>
<PARA> At the coronial inquest the next of kin were in no way represented. I again quote Commissioner Elliott Johnston:</PARA>
<PARA>This was a hearing which clearly called for the attendance of competent counsel representing the interests of the family of the deceased. I am quite confident that had the family been represented at the hearing a great deal of the anxiety, doubt and suspicion which characterised so much of the evidence that I heard during my own inquiry would have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner concludes as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Without positively finding that he-</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring to a police photographer named Cox-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . is not telling the truth, I am not prepared to accept any part of this evidence as reliable. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues later:</PARA>
<PARA>But I cannot draw a positive conclusion from this aspect of the evidence that the detectives put pressure on the deceased which led him to do harm to himself. </PARA>
<PARA>Whatever the ultimate truth of this matter is, the comments made by the Commissioner after a very thorough investigation would have once again to give us cause for great concern. I do not think that our society can call itself a civilised society if we are prepared to accept a judicial process and a judicial system where these sorts of occurrences can happen and, when they do happen, are treated in the lackadaisical manner in which the police obviously treated this case. I want to put this on the record as a matter of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish also to direct a line of thinking to the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill, which is before the Senate, and the limits that it seeks to impose on police as to the time during which they may interrogate prisoners, and the lower limit of two hours which should apply to Aboriginal people. To those people who feel that these times are perhaps too short, I say again that while we have these sorts of--</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>This report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training relates to strengthening careers education in schools. At the present time there is something like 26 per cent youth unemployment in Australia and about 25.8 per cent of young Australians seeking full time jobs cannot find them. This is getting back to the levels of the early 1980s. I think the peak was in 1985 or so-of course, under the Labor Government. I think we all recognise that there is a great need for anything that can assist young people in getting jobs. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA> Careers education in schools should, in the Board's view, involve a K-12 approach which begins in primary schools with the development of general skills, attitudes and awareness about the world of work. Throughout junior secondary school, students should develop a gradual understanding of the place of work in Australian culture and a general awareness of the various occupations and careers available to them. The Board envisages that this process culminates in Years 9 to 12 with the acquisition of more specific knowledge about the world of work, including an understanding of further education and training options and their relationship to occupations and careers, and the development and awareness of the generic knowledge, skills and competencies required to participate in the workforce and to contribute to and participate in society generally. </PARA>
<PARA>Naturally, I think all honourable senators would say amen to all that. At the moment there is a special need for it because we have in the Australian education system at the moment an enormous number of people in the years 10, 11 and 12 segment who are, in fact, still at school because they cannot get jobs. In other words, there is a massive disappearance of young people off the dole queues, out of the unemployment figures, into the schools and one can ask the reasons for that. </PARA>
<PARA> The statistics are dramatic. I think that in the last 10 years there has been something like a doubling in the retention rates in secondary schools of people staying on at least into year 12. The Government may well claim that one of the reasons for this is that it spends something like $300m a year on extending Austudy to secondary school students. I think that covers about 150,000 young people under the age of 20. </PARA>
<PARA> If that enormous expenditure is increasing the capacity of some students to be able to get skills training, to get the benefit of careers education, then there is a net benefit, but I regret to say that there is the greater prospect that a large amount of that money is being spent simply to get young people out of the Government's unemployment figures which are already enormous and up round the levels at which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had said in 1984 no government should be forgiven for generating. </PARA>
<PARA> This Prime Minister should be reminded of the fact that under his deliberate policies, under the recession we had to have, we are now apparently getting the youth unemployment we had to have, and we are having, if you like, Austudy at secondary school level being used to an extent to hide the real impact of the inability of so many young people to get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this puts an added burden on the need for careers education in schools. That burden, I believe, having been put on the State systems by the Federal Government, should be at least partly met by the resources of the Federal Government which has created the problem in the first place. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In the brief time that we have to look at these reports, I note the very diplomatic but stringent criticism that the Remuneration Tribunal makes of the way the Government has handled its decisions over the period in question. I think it is instructive just to make reference to some aspects of the report. The Tribunal states:</PARA>
<PARA> The rates of remuneration specified in Determination No 11 of 1990 were disallowed by Parliament and new rates established under the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The important changes which have taken place include the following:</PARA>
<PARA> A large number of offices at the most senior level are now outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The remuneration of the senior executives of the Government Business Enterprises and other Statutory Authorities are now fixed by the boards of those enterprises which have been given substantial degrees of autonomous operation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal also reports-and I agree with this-that it is necessary for reasons of wage justice and equity and proper administration to maintain appropriate relativity between the remuneration of various offices. Further, the Tribunal says that the result of what the Government has done has been that offices outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal are receiving remuneration significantly in excess of offices which are within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. This is unacceptable on proper wage fixing principles and, in cases, has caused injustice as between offices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal then goes on diplomatically to say that this is not meant to be a criticism, and it acknowledges the Government has power to look after things that it thinks it has a greater expertise with. But it does make these reservations and diplomatic criticisms. The Tribunal says that it is proper to refer to these matters to the extent of the intervention by the Government in respect of determinations of the Tribunal and the effects of that intervention, and that the objective sought to be achieved by the creation of the Tribunal to fix remuneration is essentially to ensure that the remuneration of persons in public office will be determined not by those in whose interests the remuneration is fixed, but by a body which, because it is independent, is not the subject of interest or influence. That is a very wise noting. It seems unfortunate that the Government has chosen to go outside that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal lists the advantages of that process of independent fixing and sets those out in item 44. It goes on to say that if these advantages are to be derived, it is necessary that-exceptional cases apart-the decisions of the Tribunal be accepted. There are circumstances in which it may be essential that a decision is interfered with, but if this is done or done frequently then the Government takes, and is seen publicly to take, the responsibility for what has been done; it has the burden of justifying its interference with the decisions of an independent body set up to make those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal further comments that during the year-the subject of the report-the intervention took the form of setting aside determinations made in accordance with submissions which the Government had itself made to the Tribunal. The report finishes by again acknowledging that this is not to be a criticism of the Government but is simply commenting on the actions the Government has taken. But diplomatic though that denial is, the report is quite obviously a stringent criticism of the way the Government has handled the decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal. With all the pious righteousness that Senator Cook goes on about accepting the umpire's decisions and not interfering with the umpire, and all this sort of thing, he then goes along and interferes with this very independent tribunal which looks into things closely. </PARA>

<PARA> For the duration of this Tribunal there has been nothing but political interference, and salaries, conditions and allowances have become political footballs. As my colleague Senator Macdonald observed in a very polite, diplomatic way, the Tribunal has castigated the Government for its conduct. I understand that. I find it offensive. I find it obnoxious. I find it debasing. I find it totally irrelevant to have a trade union, which is in no way involved, dictating to the Government and to the Parliament the salary it will tolerate the Government granting, quite separate and irrespective of the values and virtues of the arguments and findings of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> We now find, because all else failed, that the salaries of members of parliament are linked to the officers of band 1 of the Senior Executive Service (SES) of the Public Service. Now what their work, responsibilities and duties have got to with my duties or those of my colleagues, what their worth has got to do with the contribution of a member of parliament and what their conditions have got to do with a member of parliament, I do not know. But I guess it seemed like a good idea at the time and that is why Senator Peter Cook, the Minister for Industrial Relations, gave us what we have got. There has been very considerable restraint by parliamentarians over the last two decades. It is interesting that the Tribunal observed in its report:</PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal appreciates that the maintenance of a consensus in relation to wages has been central to Government economic policy and that the Wage Guidelines enunciated by the Industrial Relations Commission . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is very good from them, but it went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . when Government or the Members have, in an endeavour to achieve worthy collateral purposes, reduced the salaries which Members otherwise would receive, the result has been confusion and injustice to ordinary Members. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal said, when referring to this obscene linkage:</PARA>
<PARA>A simple linkage is wrong in principle. The salary of Members, like the salary of other employees whose wages are fixed by tribunals, should be fixed according to the proper assessment of what Members have to do. To fix a Member's salary, or to award an increase of it, because the work assessment of someone else has warranted an increase in salary for that person, would be wrong. And so with a rise in Members' salary. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that there are two criteria as a rule, and these are the criteria that apply to the SES officers. One is that they get an increase because of national wage increases. The other one is because of a change in the duties of the office and the assessment of its work value makes it appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> How for the future does one change either the salaries or conditions of a member of parliament on the basis of a change in the work-value of an SES band 1? How in the future does one make a judgment about the value and worth of the contribution, the endeavours and responsibilities of a member of parliament, when seeking to tie them with those of an SES officer? Because there is a national wage increase for an SES officer band 1, how does that in any way relate to a member of parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal is clearly frustrated. For years it has brought down findings and had them ignored, set aside or changed for political purposes. The object in setting the Tribunal up in the first place was to depoliticise them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I would like to just add these points. Senator Crichton-Browne mentioned that, as a result of a political deal, politicians' salaries are now taken out of the hands of the Remuneration Tribunal. The Tribunal in this annual report does say that the Tribunal may now not determine the base salary of members or Ministers. It goes on to say this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There is now no means of reviewing the appropriateness of the level of the salaries of members or ministers or providing for any necessary changes in their status, duties or responsibilities. The quantum of members' salaries, to take account of inflation or other matters, cannot be changed: it will vary only if and in so far as changes are made to the salary of officers of the Senior Executive Service Band one. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crichton-Browne outlined that problem. However, the Remuneration Tribunal in its annual report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no body to which members-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, members of parliament-</PARA>
<PARA>may make representation as to the level of their salary: the level is effectively determined by the Industrial Relations Commission but that is a body to which members may not make representations. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely it is a most extraordinary situation when a group of people are bound by award decisions and are prevented from making representations about those award decisions themselves or even indirectly. There can be no-one representing them; they have no capacity to take part in this process. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Crichton-Browne said, the whole point of having a tribunal was to try to depoliticise the salaries of politicians. It is interesting to note that in the States, where the salaries and conditions now tend to exceed those in the Federal Parliament, it is done, I think, almost automatically over the Christmas break with a minimum of fuss. I am not debating whether politicians' salaries are too high or too low. My view is that, in terms of the 90 hours a week I work, I would rather be paid average weekly earnings plus penalty rates and overtime because I would probably get two or three times the salary I now get. However, the disgraceful situation has emerged where not one member of this Parliament has the opportunity to appear to put a case about his own remuneration. I know of no other Australians who are precluded from negotiating their own salaries and conditions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's audit report No. 20, which is a report on ministerial portfolios, generally sums up the results of the 140-odd organisations that the Auditor-General has reported on over the past year. The Auditor-General notes that there has been a considerable improvement in reporting procedures by governmental bodies. One can only hope that that is to a large extent due to the pressures put on these bodies within this chamber-not in the other place but in this chamber specifically-where requirements have been imposed on governmental bodies to improve the quality and particularly the  timeliness of their annual reports. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is pleasing to note that for around 90% of the accounts reported upon in this Report the ANAO provided an unqualified audit opinion and reported that financial systems and internal controls were operating satisfactorily. This is a substantial improvement on last year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In some of the remaining cases, there were accounting deficiencies which were sufficiently significant to justify report. In the other breaches of legislation or divergence from standards set by the professional accounting bodies or the Minister for Finance which required an audit qualification to the financial statements . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The financial statements of the Explosives Factory Maribyrnong, Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd and various Repatriation Hospitals were qualified because of inadequacies in the treatment of assets. Following the incorporation of other former Office of Defence Production factories under the Australian Defence Industries organisation there was a very creditable improvement in the quality of the accounting. </PARA>
<PARA> The audit report for the financial statements of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission was again qualified because it included a provision for sick leave which was considered contrary to Australian Accounting Standards. It is disappointing to note the continuing qualification. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year's Report showed the most frequent area of substantial deficiency in the audits of organisations' accounts and records arose in respect of fixed assets and stocks. Problems also arose in several organisations in accounting for the payment of wages and salaries and in properly recovering debts due. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General is pleased to note that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . following audit criticism last year,-</PARA>
<PARA>which was reinforced in this chamber-</PARA>
<PARA>substantial improvements in accounting systems have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular, the report mentions the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the Australian Sports Commission and the Edward River Crocodile Farm. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a particular requirement on the Senate to ensure that financial accounting by the Government is done properly. That is why so many honourable senators are so involved in the Senate Estimates procedure. However, an increasing number of governmental bodies are avoiding the scrutiny of the Senate Estimates procedure by being converted into incorporated bodies which do not receive government grants as such. They may well receive enormous loan guarantees but are nonetheless removed from our scrutiny in the way the rest of the Government's activities is subject to scrutiny. That is why it is so important to us that the Auditor-General should make these detailed reports, which he has been doing, and why at times it causes us some concern that the Auditor-General may well not have access and, therefore, the capacity to report to this chamber in the case of some of these bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention very briefly the fact that the Parliament House Construction Authority has now gone out of being. Honourable senators will not be surprised to know that I have at times been a critic of that body. I notice that the Auditor-General kisses the Authority goodbye with another slap over the wrist, if I can mix those metaphors. The Auditor-General had a very detailed inquiry, an efficiency audit, into the Parliament House Construction Authority which involved enormous amounts of correspondence and disagreement between the Authority and the Auditor-General. In the latest report the Auditor-General has found a whole range of problems. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> During a review of the system of accounting and physical control of assets-</PARA>
<PARA>this was, of course, as the Parliament House Construction Authority was being wound down-</PARA>
<PARA>a number of unsatisfactory matters were noted:</PARA>
<PARA>* the Internal Auditor had found that the identification numbers on some assets had been deliberately altered by persons unknown, resulting in difficulty with reconciling assets recorded in the Assets Register and items physically on hand. </PARA>
<PARA>One just wonders how many people have been walking out of this building at various times carrying various assets. When one sees that the identification numbers of some assets have been deliberately altered by persons unknown, one wonders what has gone on and how much Government money has basically gone out through the back door-or perhaps through the side doors. The Auditor-General went on:</PARA>
<PARA>* a comprehensive stocktaking by the Authority of all assets costing more than $500 disclosed a large discrepancy between assets recorded in the Asset Register and those sighted during the stocktake</PARA>
<PARA>* in writing-off these items, a number of reasons for the discrepancies was given in the Authority's record including-dismantled or destroyed during retraction; believed transferred-</PARA>
<PARA>not transferred, believed transferred-</PARA>
<PARA> to other bodies without proper documentation, description not adequate to permit identification on the Asset Register and believed sold or scrapped, believed to have been scrapped as unserviceable or obsolete, believed integrated into other assets as enhancement or repairs, and lost or stolen . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We have no idea in which of that range of extraordinary categories the bulk of these losses took place. The AuditorGeneral went on:</PARA>
<PARA>* a reconciliation between assets costing under $500 recorded in the Asset Register and items physically on hand at 30 June 1990 had not been undertaken and the extent of any discrepancies could not be ascertained. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, that would not be of any substance. The Auditor-General concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> While ANAO considered that write-off procedures had been properly followed, the size of the discrepancies indicated that there was insufficient physical control over assets during the wind-down of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority advised that a lack of staff had contributed to the deficiencies in asset management during the wind-down of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know the substance or the size of these problems, but I am grateful that the Auditor-General has brought them to our attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also glad that the Auditor-General undertook a survey of internal audit of 142 Commonwealth organisations. The survey clearly indicates that there is strong support for better internal auditing. The Auditor recommends that the proposed new financial administration legislation should require all Commonwealth organisations to have an internal audit function and appropriate standards based on the internationally accepted Institute of Internal Auditors standards and that these should be promulgated, to which the Opposition says `Hear, hear!'. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Auditor-General for his hard and consistent work. I assure him of the Opposition's support in his endeavours to make certain that as much government money is saved, or as little government money as possible is wasted as a result of inadequate procedures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to address some remarks to the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 20 entitled Ministerial Portfolios-Autumn Sittings 1991. My remarks relate to the way in which this report is treated-the way in which honourable senators have access to the report and the opportunity to speak to it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, as Senator Baume points out, it covers 140 organisations. That means that there are many honourable senators on this side of the House who either have a direct responsibility, or an indirect responsibility via committee work, in relation to the material which is in this report. At no time are we given access to it. I am a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Section 8 of its enabling legislation-that is, the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951-states, among other things, that the Public Accounts Committee is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>to examine all reports of the Auditor-General (including reports of the results of efficiency audits) copies of which have been laid before the Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also required:</PARA>
<PARA>to examine the accounts of the receipts and expenditure of the Commonwealth including the financial statements transmitted to the Auditor-General under sub-section (4) of section 50 of the Audit Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, I am required, by my membership of that Committee, to pay attention to this report, yet I am not entitled to get a copy of it until such time as it is tabled in this place. We then have minutes, if that, to give it scant attention. It is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee has brought into this Parliament a most important report entitled The AuditorGeneral: Ally of the People and Parliament. I played a large part in putting together that report, along with other colleagues. Very simply, the Auditor-General is the linchpin in accountability. It is the Auditor-General and his reports that enable the Parliament to scrutinise the actions of the executive. If that breaks down, the parliamentary system breaks down. To be treated in a way where a single copy is given to the Leader of the Opposition, over which everybody is supposed to skirmish to get a glimpse, makes a nonsense of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, members of the Senate, and people who are charged with the responsibility which pertains to this report, ought to be allowed the same courtesy, and be allowed to have that report with the same two-hour period of grace as happens with that of the sole, lone copy which goes to the office of the Leader of the Opposition. I will look at a specific example as to why I believe this is an important alteration to be made in the way we deal with this report. I turn to the section of the Auditor-General's report, in his overview, dealing with breaches of legislation. I refer to item 16 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditures or investments were made or contracts approved in excess of amounts approved in advance by relevant Ministers or were made without previously gaining Ministerial approval by the-</PARA>
<PARA>Then among the organisations listed is the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). </PARA>
<PARA>Item 17 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Legislative restraints on borrowings (through over-drawing) were breached by the-</PARA>
<PARA>Again the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is listed. On today's red sheet, in the section dealing with papers tabled today, is listed a paper relating to the purchase by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation of two private companies for $800,000. A glib note in this particular paper states that the purchase was made `to facilitate and enhance the commercialisation of existing skills and expertise held by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation'. It goes on to say that the $800,000 purchase price was provided from the existing budget. Immediately, I want to know where because it goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>In this respect the purchase is largely a reallocation of resources-</PARA>
<PARA>by whose authority; from what appropriation?-</PARA>
<PARA>to meet the same priorities in a more cost- effective manner. </PARA>
<PARA>According to whose judgment? It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, ANSTO is ahead of targets for commercial revenue earning, currently by around $1.6 million, and a portion of this can appropriately be directed to meeting the costs of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>But, when we read on, we see that ANSTO is not making a profit yet. If one reads the Auditor-General's report, one will see that the Auditor-General has drawn attention to the fact that this organisation has simply spent money without proper authorisation and borrowed money without proper authorisation. How is one then to properly appraise this document, which was available prior to the tabling of the Auditor-General's report, and have some sort of sensible argument? That example can be repeated again and again throughout the area and the whole spectrum of portfolios and government business enterprises?</PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Michael Baume drew attention to the fact that, by the process of corporatisation, the Government, the Executive, has managed to push parts of government expenditure away from the proper supervision and scrutiny of the Parliament. In the last sittings of Estimates committees, we were informed-and I put the accent on the word `informed'-that, unless government organisations, agencies or instrumentalities are either the subject of an appropriation or had a community service obligation, they were not obliged to appear before the Estimates committees. Furthermore, they are not obliged to table annual reports in this place. </PARA>

<PARA> I rose to speak to this report to complain about the way members of this chamber are treated in dealing with a report which is vital to the duty that we have to carry out. I think it is vital that serious consideration be given by the President to the manner in which he deals with this report. If it were the case that the Auditor-General made a request that people with specific responsibilities, such as members of the Public Accounts Committee, be allowed to get this report two hours in advance, under the same terms and conditions as apply to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, and if the President perhaps saw fit not to accede to that request, I sincerely ask that he reconsider his judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know that that is the case, but if I were to postulate that it could be the case, I would ask him to reconsider the position and make that document available. Then we would not get this ridiculous situation again where debate is stifled because we do not have the documentation early enough to give it proper consideration to put forward correct debate to let the people of the nation know what is going on with the expenditure of public money, and we would be able to carry out our duty pertaining to that expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was directed to inquire into certain aspects of the proposal for a very fast train in August 1989. Since then, several major studies and decisions relevant to the project have been released. While the Committee received nearly 400 submissions, it is unfortunate that virtually all of the contributors provided their evidence before that material was available and before the preferred route option for the train was announced in October 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> In its report the Committee has incorporated what data was available at the point at which the report was finalised. It is important to recognise that at this stage more studies are being undertaken by the proponents of the VFT, the joint venturers. They also have proposals before the four governments through whose jurisdictions the route of the train would pass, and those governments have yet to give their formal approval for the project. There is, of course, the most important consideration, namely, a decision by the joint venturers on the feasibility of the project. The target date currently set for this decision is December 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Committee was not asked to examine the financial viability of the VFT proposal, it recognises that the project's proponents emphasise that the VFT is to be a private enterprise undertaking. In its report the Committee supports the project in general terms, but confines its assessment and recommendations to the matters specified in its terms of reference. In doing so, the Committee directs its recommendations to Government involvement with the project, matters such as environmental impact statements, implications for the Commonwealth at the VFT's construction stage, the possibilities for fast rail freight and safety and noise standards for the VFT. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the VFT proposal is a private enterprise initiative, the four governments it involves have vital and continuing roles in evaluating and approving aspects of it as it evolves, and if the decisions are made that it should proceed. The Committee endorses the role of governments in the proposal to date and encourages them to continue their assessments of it with a positive approach, on a basis of cooperation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure that looked into the very fast train (VFT) proposal and I, too, would like to make some remarks on the report which we have tabled today. I want to remind honourable senators that the terms of reference, in many respects, were quite limited, and I wish to state them as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . accepting that the Very Fast Train (VFT) proposal represents a major privately financed venture in transport and land development, the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure investigate and report to the Senate, on or before the last sitting day in May 1990, on the following issues central to government consideration of the project:</PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the rest of the terms of reference at this point. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the effects which such a project could have on existing and future land use patterns and transport and communications infrastructure in south-eastern Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) other possible environmental impacts of such a project including possible noise and atmospheric effects;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) transit time, route and technology options;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) safety aspects, both in terms of protection of passengers and in terms of effect on the road toll; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) effect on energy use. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) That, in conducting this inquiry, the Committee have regard to the scope and coverage of any other concurrent review or inquiry, including environmental impact study processes, into the VFT, and seek to consult and liaise as necessary, to avoid unnecessary duplication. </PARA>
<PARA>We had many submissions, as Senator Foreman has indicated, the majority of which related, I believe, to the proposed route that would have taken the train nearer the eastern coast of Australia than, in fact, was the route finally decided upon. At the time the inquiry started there were two routes from Sydney to Melbourne, one the coastal route and one the inland route. It was not until quite late in the proceedings when the report of November 1990, called the VFT Project Evaluation, determined it was the inland route that should be followed. I wish to quote from page 15 of that report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The decision announced in October 1990 in favour of the inland route was predicated essentially on the higher cost of civil engineering on the coastal route. Market studies predicted higher demand on the coastal route and thus higher revenue, but the margin was not nearly sufficient to overcome the differential in capital costs. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate will see from the terms of reference, it was not our place to make recommendations about which route should be followed. It is a private sector venture and it is for the private sector to decide which is the route that should be followed. Inevitably, I think, many of the submissions dealt with that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> We also saw people who had an interest in the inland route-some of those quite near to Sydney. I recall vividly Alderman Lamarra and the group that came to us from Goulburn. One could only be impressed by the enthusiasm of their support for the train and the benefit that they saw it to be not just for their particular area but for the whole of Australia. I, too, feel the same enthusiasm for it to be a project that I believe should go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to see it envisaged as a national project; I would like to see it embraced as something like the Snowy Mountains scheme, of long term benefit to Australia. I had the opportunity to tour the Snowy Mountains scheme about three weeks ago-some 40 years or so after it started. The excitement is as great now as I believe it was at the time-although I did not see it at its opening-as is the enthusiasm of those who are working in it for what it means to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise with the VFT that there are still a lot of questions unanswered and, of course, the consortium is still working on it. It is not until 1992 that it expects to present the feasibility report. I hope, as I say, that Australians will come to see it as something of an incredible benefit to this country 40 years down the track, when it really is providing. I hope it will run from Brisbane to Adelaide in time, but that is clearly in the future and there are questions still to be answered. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations that we have made, which appear at the back of the report on page 169, are seven in number. They deal specifically with the matters within the terms of reference. We also heard from the Shire of Gunning, a shire quite close to Canberra. The people from the Shire of Gunning have considerable reservations about the train going through their shire, and raised questions which clearly need to be answered. I believe that they can be answered. I certainly see a place for the train passing through the national capital and on, but not too far west, to Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> We talked with people from Albury who indicated that they hoped that the train would pass closer to Albury than they believe it will at present. I certainly would support that contention, as I believe it would be of great benefit to Albury if it were reasonably close to the suburban settlement in that area. Again, the actual detail of the route is something that is being worked out in the feasibility study and not yet available to us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition recognises that there have been some difficulties with the four in the consortium, but I do not believe that that in any way indicates that the project is likely not to be viable or not capable of going ahead with other partners in the future. That is something that was not again within our terms of reference. The mere fact that a couple of the partners either want to sell out their interest in it or make different arrangements I do not think in any way should be regarded as fatal to the project at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> There had been talk of a large cargo airport near to the national capital. It would be my view that the international airport, the additional one for Sydney, would be better placed in the Canberra-Goulburn area, with the Very Fast Train providing the transport for passengers, some to Melbourne perhaps but more likely to Sydney. That is a project that I wish was going ahead in place of the Badgerys Creek one, which seems to be going ahead at present. That is not to say that the third runway should not be in or should not have been in long before this. </PARA>
<PARA> There are concerns about land acquisition. I reiterate that the proposal that land should be acquired and developed by the consortium was a proposal which was not put to the committee and was not proceeded with by the consortium. Those who will lose land to the train route are concerned to know that they will be properly compensated. Witnesses raised questions of adequate compensation so that, in the event of a farm being virtually made unworkable by the train passing straight through it, they would get compensation not just for the value of the land which is taken away but also for the loss of viability of the property itself. These are all matters that can be worked out. For the national capital, I see it as a great project and one that I hope will happen quite soon. We will be very much at the forefront of the development when it takes place. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that the maintenance of the train could be in the Goulburn or perhaps even the Junee area and that financially it will be feasible for the workshops, on that side of the train proposal, to be run out of the major city areas. I would urge the consortium to look very closely indeed at the headquarters of the train being in the national capital. There are still matters to be determined about the construction, and there are still answers to be provided about the running of the train once the line has been constructed, who will run it and who will be responsible for it. These answers will, of course, emerge as the feasibility study continues. </PARA>
<PARA> For Canberra, it is something that I think has been taken into account. With the inland route, it would undoubtedly pass through the national capital in the area of Gungahlin, which is a new area being developed. We have had the opportunity, on another committee of which I am a member, to ask questions about the route through which the train would pass in the national capital and the planners have taken into account the land that would be needed at the north of the Australian Capital Territory to ensure that that land would be available in the future if the project goes ahead. As I say, it is still in the feasibility stage and we will hear more of it in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The significant thing that needs to happen now, which the committee has referred to, is the fact that there are four governments involved in the area through which the train will pass. It is essential that those governments take a much greater interest than at present in facilitating the feasibility study. There is a committee of officials from each of the four governments, but I would like to urge upon them a much more positive attitude to the project than it seems to me exists at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular portion of the report which I wish to refer to the Senate is that entitled in chapter 7 `Committee Overview', where we have commented on some of the matters which we think need to happen but which were outside the terms of reference. As I say, the recommendations are specifically included but the Committee overview contained four paragraphs in which we deal with the matters that we think need to happen. The question of financing of the project came before us, from the point of view of the consortium saying that it is a private project and it is not looking for Government funding, and the issue of incentive by way of tax arrangements which would make it a more attractive project from the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government ought to look at that side of it as a national project to see whether or not there are tax incentives or tax arrangements which ought to be put in place to ensure that this goes ahead, not specifically favouring a particular national project. Perhaps there are tax arrangements that ought to be considered for any project of this kind, which is clearly in the national interest. I hope that that will happen. The Committee overview refers to the fact that the project is to be `without government financial assistance'. It says, `The project has the capacity to bring major changes to south-eastern Australia', and reiterates that we have dealt only with those matters which have been put before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I do come back to the question of the four governments concerned in the project and ask them to give a higher priority to looking at the issues that they have to make decisions about in assisting to see that this project goes ahead. We say in the Committee overview in paragraph 7.3:</PARA>
<PARA>The project should not be allowed to fail simply because the four governments involved cannot devise a process to evaluate it that is fair to its proponents, those who would be adversely affected by it, and the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe it would be a tragedy if the project did not go ahead for that reason. I quote the final paragraph in this section:</PARA>
<PARA>Whatever the final decisions on whether the VFT project goes ahead, the Committee considers it important that the process by which governments and the community consider projects of this kind should be such as to encourage other project proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>Do not let us be ostriches and put our heads in the sand and say that something is too difficult. Let us make sure we give it every opportunity to succeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only just received a copy of the report, so I was very interested to hear both Senators Foreman and Reid give their comments about it. Obviously the Committee supports the idea in principle but only within the limited terms of reference, which of course exclude financial viability, but which is one of the key areas that I think should be looked at. The real financial interests behind the very fast train (VFT) consortium now seem to be coming to light, with the consortium's request for special tax concessions. I am glad that, despite lobbying, Ministers, at this moment anyway, seem not to be prepared to go along with that proposal. Recommendation 2, which has just come to my notice, is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Commonwealth ensure that wide publicity is given to its position that there be no Commonwealth Government subsidy to, or rescue of, the project if it runs into financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>I am glad that that is there and I think it is very important that that is emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA> The environment movement is opposed to this project because although it is in favour of upgrading our railway system, we believe that this can be done by building up the present system rather than by this VFT proposal. This country does not need a $6.6 billion super train project; nor is there any real evidence that there will be enough passengers to fill 40 trains a day between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. As the interim report last May pointed out, one cannot compare the potential Australian market demand for the VFT with France or Japan where successful trains of this kind operate. The TGV corridor in France has a market of 14 million people, while in Japan the Tokyo-Osaka route alone contains a market of 32 million people. Both these routes are much shorter as well and they connect to general railway systems, which is not necessarily the case here. </PARA>
<PARA> The French and Japanese are also more used to going long distances by train, while Australians on long journeys tend to go by air. Doubts have been cast on the assertion that the train could get between Sydney and Melbourne in three hours, which is one of the claims that the consortium makes which, from a passenger point of view, would be a big bonus. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed technology is complex and largely untested. As the New South Wales Treasury and Department of State Development study on the VFT pointed out last year, the consortium's claim that the VFT rolling stock would have a 30-year life appears to be unrealistic. The French high speed train, the TGV, has only an eight-year life span for its rolling stock. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Throsby told the other House last year, the hidden agenda of the proposal is a great real estate scheme. He pointed out that the consortium has admitted that it will not get its money back from its passengers. What they are after is getting money back from land sales and, as the member for Throsby reminded the other House, there is no guarantee that the consortium would go ahead with the VFT once it had made a profit from the land sales along the proposed route. Nor is it surprising that, according to a Roy Morgan poll last November, 65 per cent of those polled in the south-east of this country were in favour of the VFT project. At first glance, it looks like a great idea. </PARA>
<PARA> Last April there was a well-designed and glossy road show about the VFT which toured around this part of the country, and I went to have a look at it when it was parked outside Parliament House here. It was very convincing if one did not have access to any critique, and of course those opposed to the project do not have access to so much money or the same kinds of resources as Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and Kumagai Gumi Co. Ltd to mount such an extravagant display. </PARA>
<PARA> Yes, most Australians would appreciate a faster, more efficient train service. Australians like trains and they realise that the current system in Australia is a disgrace when compared to the kind of train service found in Europe and other countries. It has always been quite ludicrous that the train from Canberra to Sydney should take longer and cost more than going by bus, and it has always been difficult to get from Canberra to Melbourne by train because of the need for a bus link to either Yass or Wodonga. But the answer to these particular problems for Canberrans is not a very fast train. </PARA>
<PARA> As the conservation councils of the south-east region and Canberra have argued, the very fast train should be incorporated into a Federal land transport strategy for consideration-an overall plan fitting into a national scheme for upgrading railways. </PARA>
<PARA> While agreeing that the inland route was preferable to the coastal route which has now been decided upon, the conservation councils said that there were still environmental problems with the proposal. Their concerns were echoed by the interim report on aspects of the proposal for a very fast train, which came out last May. Other criticisms were raised in a publication of the VFT Awareness Groups Coalition entitled VFT: Need or Greed?</PARA>
<PARA> At the economic level there are major questions about the real costs of the project with large cost overruns likely. There is also the concern about overseas borrowings, which could eventually result in foreign ownership of the project, and we have already seen the membership of the consortium whittled down to two, one of which is Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons I believe that the sooner we ditch this project the better. But I do make a plea for speedy implementation of proposals to integrate a national rail system and an efficient one for both freight and passenger service, instead of the run-down of the service by States bent on following Tasmania's example, where there are no passenger trains left at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which conducted this inquiry into the very fast train, I welcome the publication and presentation today of our report by the Chairman, Senator Foreman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inquiry was somewhat limited in scope and it is perhaps worth repeating the particular limitations on the inquiry. The particular questions that were investigated by the Committee in its inquiry on the very fast train were: firstly, the effects which such a project could have on existing and future land use patterns and transport and communications infrastructure in south-eastern Australia; secondly, other possible environmental impacts of such a project, including possible noise and atmospheric effects; thirdly, transit time, route and technology options; fourthly, safety aspects both in terms of protection of passengers and effect on road toll; and, finally, the effect on energy usage. </PARA>
<PARA> Within those terms of reference, after very lengthy and detailed investigation and a number of hearings and consideration of a number of detailed submissions, the Committee generally adopted a favourable attitude towards the project. The Committee, as honourable senators would be aware from the terms of reference to which I referred, was not asked to assess the overall costs and benefits to Australia of the project. Nor was it asked to investigate the financial viability of the project. So those matters remain for further consideration by others. </PARA>
<PARA> But certainly we did investigate in great detail those aspects relating to the terms of reference. In relation to what Senator Vallentine said, we looked in particular in some detail at the environmental impact of this project. All of the evidence that we could garner led us to the conclusion that there were no detrimental environmental consequences sufficient for us to conclude that the project should not go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine referred to the conservation movement's opposition to the project. The evidence that was put to us by the conservation movement, in particular the Australian Conservation Foundation, was grossly inadequate in supporting any arguments against the development of this project. As one of the members of the Committee said at the time, they were an embarrassment to the conservation movement in what they had to say to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be remembered that this Committee consisted of all parties represented in the Senate, including the Australian Democrats. They have supported the conclusions which the Committee reached in favour of the project on environmental grounds. The evidence presented by the conservation movement simply did not come to grips with the issues at all. The arguments that it put to us were simply unconvincing against the very fast train going ahead. So there can be no serious opposition to this project on environmental grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, within the terms of reference, we reached a favourable conclusion on the project. Of course, the question mark remains with regard to its financial viability. It is a private enterprise project and, therefore, the funds raised for it must come from the private sector, which in turn must initially provide investors with the incentive to invest in the project. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulties of the financial viability of the project obviously weigh heavily on the minds of its proponents because initially they proposed the concept of land value capture as a means of supplementing the financing of the project. In simple terms, that meant they were seeking government intervention to ensure that any increase in the value of land along the route of the very fast train would be garnered for the joint venture project proponents through a government grant of the right to capture the increased value of that land. This is generally known as a betterment tax proposal, with that betterment tax going to the proponents of the project rather than, as it does in some situations of local government and so on, to government revenue itself. That was the basis on which they sought to close the gap between the avenue required for financial viability of the project and passenger numbers and revenue that it might generate. That was rejected after consideration in particular by the New South Wales Government. It was also rejected by this Committee as a valid means of financing the project. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, the joint venturers have proposed that certain tax concessions be given to the joint venture as a means of ensuring the financial viability of the project. In general, these tax concessions which are sought relate to deferring tax for which the project might be liable, rather than it not being liable for tax at all, by changing the nature of taxation applicable to such a project whereby investors in the project would be given tax deductibility for the funds which they put into the project as equity. In return, the project would forgo the tax benefits it would obtain from depreciation and other measures later in the life of the project. In other words, there would be no net loss of revenue for the Government overall but simply a deferral of certain tax liabilities on the part of the project. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that that concept is worthy of further consideration. I was disappointed, therefore, to see a report in yesterday's newspaper that the Federal Government had rejected that proposition from the joint venturers. I believe that the project has sufficient merit that some tax concessions could be considered favourably by the Federal Government to encourage it to get off the ground, if that would make the difference between its being viable or not viable financially. Therefore, I would encourage the present Government to reconsider its attitude to those proposals from the joint venturers. I hope that the coalition parties, if the Government has not reconsidered by the time of the next election, as they develop transport policy in the lead-up to the next election, will consider reactivating those proposals and give them favourable consideration. There is a real question hanging over the project as regards its viability in terms of our present population. </PARA>
<PARA> One point which Senator Vallentine made which in the present circumstances certainly has some validity is that there is a real doubt as to whether Australia has sufficient population at present to generate sufficient passenger traffic to provide sufficient revenue to make the project profitable for investors. I have no doubt that in the future, as our population grows, particularly in the south-eastern corner of Australia, we will have sufficient population to make this project profitable. Therefore, in terms of national infrastructure, it may well be worth getting the project off the ground now so that it is in place as that population develops. As I said, that may require some initial up-front tax concessions. I believe that certainly is an area that ought to be given consideration favourably by the Government: to have the project under way now, even though the population does not exist now, so that it is in place as the population develops and can take advantage of the service. </PARA>
<PARA> One area of concern which the Committee had, given the issues of financial viability which I have raised, was the dangers of the project failing in the construction phase; in other words, the project getting under way, construction commencing and the joint venturers then finding that they do not have adequate capital to finish the project-to get it up and running. The Committee and, obviously, I as a member of that Committee strongly share the view that it should be made patently clear to the joint venturers that, in the event of the project failing, the Government would not come in and pick up the tab-would not take over the project and complete its development or be liable in any other way for the costs of the project. </PARA>
<PARA> We investigated various ways in which that could be made definite. There were certain recommendations from the Department of Transport and Communications and from other parties, but there is certainly no definite way in which one can set in concrete the fact that a government would not in the future pick up the cost of completing the project if the joint venturers were unable to finish the building of it. Simply, as the Committee recommends, there must be strong statements made by Government and Opposition that no present or future government would pick up the costs of that project should it fail. We believe that that is a very important factor. Those statements ought to be clear-cut so that the joint venturers are left in no doubt that this project would not become the responsibility of government. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a different issue from making some assessment of the financial viability of the project at the outset and providing, as I have urged, some further consideration of specific tax concessions to encourage equity investment in the project. I make a clear distinction between the issue of the government being required to come in and pick up the whole completion of the project, should it fail in its construction phase, and a very specific tax concession which might be offered to the joint venturers and equity investors in an effort to get the project off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I support the project. I believe that it has the potential to provide an exciting alternative means of transport in south-eastern Australia-a means of transport which will be viable in the longer term in this country. Therefore, if there are means of getting the project off the ground sooner rather than later, then I believe they ought to be explored, provided that they do not provide a cost to revenue as such but, rather, simply a deferral of revenue on the part of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When my comments were terminated before the suspension of the sitting for lunch, I was about to refer, in relation to the Loan Bill 1991 which we are now debating, to the financial implications of the situation which has now developed as a result of the massive deterioration in the Government's Budget this year, and to look also at the extremely worrying financial outlook for next year even if the Government were able-which seems unlikely-advantageously to turn around its Budget prospects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, because of the deterioration that has occurred in its budgetary position, has now announced that it will conduct two bond tenders in the remaining months of this financial year. These will be the first normal-type bond tenders for this financial year. There was no requirement for one at all last financial year. The first of the two bond tenders will be on 16 April; the second one will probably be in May on a date yet to be announced. </PARA>
<PARA> The financial institutions in the marketplace are estimating that each tender will bring in some $800m to $1 billion; a combined total of close to $2 billion. How much does the Government need? To work that out we need to go back to the Budget figures and work forward from there. The Government budgeted for a surplus of $8.1 billion, but of that it spent $1 billion on making payments to Commonwealth superannuation funds. Prima facie, that left $7.1 billion as a contribution to domestic savings. That figure also is too high because it includes an amount close to $2 billion as a result of the proceeds of asset sales which, of course, are simply a switch of debt between the public and the private sectors and do nothing in net terms to the domestic situation. We also had the switch of responsibility for State debt from the Commonwealth back to the States. That totalled almost $1 billion in asset sales. So almost $2 billion has to come off the $7.1 billion to give the figure that was going to constitute the Government's contribution to domestic savings in the financial year 1990-91. Therefore, that brings the figure down to, say, $5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, that was on the basis of an $8 billion Budget surplus, but it now appears that that surplus will all but disappear and could, according to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), even finish up as a deficit. Let us say for the purposes of this analysis that the 1990-91 Budget outturn will be balanced; that is, there will be no surplus or deficit. That is probably a reasonable assumption. On that basis, the $5 billion of Commonwealth contributions to domestic savings estimated at Budget time will turn out to be a $3 billion call on domestic savings. The question then is: how will the Commonwealth fund this $3 billion call on savings? It is not just $3 billion that it has to find. The Government has, or will have this year, redeemed a total of about $2 billion in foreign currency debt and some $300m through negative borrowing via the redemption of Australian savings bonds. </PARA>
<PARA> If we bring all that together, it means that on the basis of a balanced Budget outturn the Government this financial year-that is 1990-91-will be required to go to the market for a total amount of some $4.7 billion. This is a little complicated, so let me just spell it out again in a slightly different form: the Government this year had to raise $1 billion for the superannuation fund payments, $2 billion to repay maturing overseas debt-that makes a figure of $3 billion-another $300m through the negative borrowing as a result of the redemption of Australian saving bonds, which gives $3.3 billion, plus, because of the massive deterioration in the Government's budgetary position, another $3.4 billion for scheduled redemptions of maturing treasury bonds. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of a balanced Budget, the Government has to find $6.7 billion this year-1991. It has announced that there will be two treasury bond tenders. As I mentioned before, those two bond tenders are expected to raise up to $2 billion by the market. That leaves $4.7 billion to be raised by other means. The practicalities are that if it is not raised by further treasury bond tenders, then the full $4.7 billion would be required to be raised by the issue of treasury notes. That is a very large treasury note amount. It would significantly reduce the average maturity age of government debt and, therefore, increase the Government's risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations in the financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Depending on movements in interest rates next financial year-and I will come back later to why I think those movements will be upwards rather than downwards-the public debt interest bill could rise steeply and would rise steeply if rates rose. It would be more prudent, therefore, for the Government not to look to treasury notes for all its financing requirements this year over and above the already announced treasury bond tenders. I think that the Government should be giving consideration to at least a third bond tender. </PARA>
<PARA> My understanding from speaking with various financial institutions is that the market will be able to absorb these bond issues without difficulty this year-that is, 1990-91-but the problem for the market, and this stems directly from the Government's financial mismanagement and budgetary looseness, will come next year in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just have a look at the years 1991 and 1992. There are $5 1/2 billion of domestic bond maturities in 1991-92 and there are $1 billion of offshore redemptions, which will be financed domestically as I understand it because of the Treasurer's obsession about overseas borrowing. He is concerned with his Moody's Investor Services rating because Moody's rates on the basis of the level of offshore debt, not domestic debt. So that gives $6.5 billion to be financed in 1991-92, plus another $1 billion in further payments into Commonwealth superannuation funds, plus another $2 billion to offload some of the treasury note financing built up this year, 1991. That gives a total of $9.5 billion to be found, and that is on the basis of a balanced Budget next year-no surplus, no deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, it now seems almost certain that on the basis of the existing Hawke Government policies, the 1991-92 Budget will be heavily in deficit and, therefore, make an even greater call on our domestic monetary markets; that is, on our national savings. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if we discount this Budget deficit probability completely, there will still be a heavy Commonwealth Government call on the longer end of the market next year. The $5 1/2 billion bonds maturing this year are now one year or less stock, whereas the new issues to replace this maturing debt will have three year or longer maturity dates. Therefore, it is clear that the Government will be competing fiercely with the private sector for funds and, in turn, there will be government induced upward pressure on bond rates and, therefore, the whole interest rates structure next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Continuing lax fiscal policy resulting in the re-emergence of Commonwealth Budget deficits will simply compound this problem. We have seen in the Loan Bill today the result of the massive deterioration in the Government's Budget. If there had not been this deterioration, then there would have been no need for the Government to be seeking the authority to borrow, which this Bill authorises. Until recent weeks it did not foresee the need to do such a borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely essential that the Government gets the wheels back on to its Budget cart; all four wheels have fallen off at this stage. If it does not get those wheels back on to the Budget cart, then the pressures of inflation, renewed interest rates, undesirable exchange rate movements, and all the things that flow from that, will sweep away completely even the very limited advances made in yesterday's industry statement. There was no reference at all to macro-economic policy in yesterday's industry statement. I believe that it was a major deficiency in that statement. Unless the Government gets its macro-economic policy back into shape, nothing it will do in other areas will count one iota. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate today is discussing the Loan Bill 1991. This is the first Loan Bill to be debated since the 1987-88 financial year. The absence of a loan Bill during the intervening years reflects the fact that the Commonwealth has been running substantial surpluses. However, the technical necessity for this Bill is not strictly related to whether the Budget is in surplus or deficit, rather it is necessary to balance a projected deficit in the Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue Fund. That fund is created by the Australian Constitution under section 81 and all revenues raised or received by the Government must be deposited in that account, which is part of the public account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other funds in the public account are the Loan Fund, to which this Bill is addressed, and the Trust Fund. In any one year, it is possible that the Consolidated Revenue Fund can be in deficit at the end of a particular year even though a Budget surplus is forecast. Such is the case this year due to the recession, but since this is not allowed to occur as the fund must always balance at the end of the financial year, this Bill provides for certain payments, which would have been made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be made instead from the Loan Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 of the Bill specifies that the expenditure to be made from the Loan Fund is defence expenditure; that is, any defence expenditure otherwise authorised by parliament which is incurred after the Bill receives royal assent may be made from the Loan Fund rather than the Consolidated Revenue Fund thereby reducing or eliminating any deficit which may otherwise occur in that account. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason defence expenditure is used to effect the appropriation is twofold: firstly, the defence budget is always large-the Australian Democrats believe that it is too large-and, secondly, and most importantly, clause 4, which grants the Treasurer the right to borrow money necessary to finance the expenditure authorised by clause 5, avoids the necessity for obtaining the approval of the Loan Council for the borrowings for defence purposes, which could be politically embarrassing. It should be noted that the expense of borrowing is also authorised to be defrayed by the funds so raised. This is a standard provision and not opposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of the Bill-clauses 6 and 7- authorises the Treasurer to borrow money to supplement any deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund which may arise. It is not yet certain whether this authority will be necessary. All such moneys are to be applied to the Consolidated Revenue Fund except for that amount relating to the expense of borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA> As with the borrowing for defence purposes, the borrowings may be raised either by the issuing of securities to the public or to the Reserve Bank or by the investment of trust fund balances in such securities. The Minister may be in a position to tell the Senate which of these options is to be used-if this has been determined. Any borrowings under part 3 must be authorised by the Loan Council. I now turn to the reason for the Bill's presence before the Senate; it is simple. The Government's fiscal position has been eroded because of the recession it has engineered. The Opposition's second reading amendment addresses this issue, and I will deal with our response to it later. </PARA>
<PARA> The surplus was estimated by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) at Budget time last year at $8.1 billion. The Democrats policy was that the surplus should have been at least 1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) higher, that is, an additional $3 billion to allow an immediate 3 per cent cut in interest rates in an attempt to avoid our current recession. The Democrats have certainly constantly opposed the use of monetary policy to curb demand because of the obvious disadvantages and inequity of targeting borrowers, which does not involve any capacity to pay; the destructive effects on business, which we have all witnessed in the past year or so; and the resulting appreciation of the currency, which tends to favour imports relative to exports. Unfortunately we were right. </PARA>
<PARA> On 22 February, the Treasurer announced that the projected surplus for 1990-91 would be only $1.7 billion. This is far below the prior rough estimates by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) of a surplus of about $4 billion. The $6.4 billion erosion is made up of an estimated $3,870m decrease in projected receipts and increased spending of $2,535m. The details are as follows: amongst the revenue losses are $2,800m less taxes and other receipts which will be collected because of declining employment and reduced spending; $640m because of higher than expected tax refunds, emanating from lower incomes and financial losses; and $430m from the November wage tax trade-off, which all members of this Parliament supported. Clearly, paragraph (a) of the Opposition's second reading amendment is correct. The second paragraph identifies the extra spending which will be undertaken this year as a result of the Government's economic mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA> The extra spending or deficit not budgeted for is, firstly, $750m because the Senate would not accept the Government's proposals to privatise the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline, and rightly so; secondly, the Senate's refusal to allow the Government to push through its legislation on the assets test on family allowances, and again rightly so; $400m in extra unemployment benefits; $280m caused by the Gulf war in defence expenditure increases and wheat industry compensation payments; and $275m which relates to the wool industry assistance. Farmers have been abandoned by both the Government and the Opposition, but that much at least is due to them. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $750m relates to expenditure for natural disaster relief-for example, the Newcastle earthquake, the disastrous floods in eastern Australia, and the large number of bushfires-and pensions. Clearly, the expenditure items as such could not justifiably be opposed, but in the strategic overall sense the need for most of these was indeed created by the Government's mistaken economic strategy and, as a result, the Australian Democrats will be supporting the Opposition's second reading amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats propose that the Government should increase outlays now to alleviate some of the unemployment it has caused. Australia is in desperate need of improved public infrastructure in such areas as water, sewerage, railways, ports, public transport and public housing. We also need a much greater retraining program to avoid large increases and long term unemployment--</PARA>

We have identified the additional taxes that could be raised if this Government had the political will and if the Opposition were in support of them-taxes which would raise, for instance, some $600m from incomes above $100,000 per annum. But unfortunately neither the Government nor the Opposition has the political will or the guts to attack their wealthy friends. There is little point in continuing this debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Loan Bill 1991 which is before the chamber. I was pleased to hear the comments from Senator Spindler of the Australian Democrats; they are proposing to support the amendment that Senator Short has moved to this Bill and which, amongst other things, condemns the gross financial mismanagement of this Government. I was sorry to hear Senator Spindler say that the Australian Democrats will be continuing to pursue the policies they have put forward before this chamber which, frankly, is basically more government spending and more government taxes. I would have to say, given the financial disaster which this country is now facing, the last thing we need, Senator Spindler, is billions of dollars more in spending. Given the struggles of individual families and people who are running the business enterprises of this country, and the struggles that our farmers are having --</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last thing they need is more of the Democrats taxes. I think it is bold of Senator Spindler to come out and say he would like to have wealth taxes; that he wants to have capital gains taxes; that he believes the marginal rates of taxes are too low. It is a bold policy, one I would have to say which would be accepted by a minuscule number of people in this country. I think when he talks in general terms about the sorts of taxes he wants to raise in this community, the Australian Democrats should be very specific and inform people that what they are talking about is significantly higher taxes on Australian families and businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a great pity, given the concerns that Senator Spindler raised about tax avoidance, that the one proposal which we would have hoped the Australian Democrats would have supported is the proposal of Dr Hewson for a goods and services tax which would have the effect of picking up the `black' economy in this country and cutting down on the very high levels of tax avoidance which can occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The fiscal policy of this Government has collapsed. There is no greater evidence of it than the Bill we currently have before the chamber. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) are now forced to borrow funds to cover the Budget shortfall which is now emerging at a frightening level. </PARA>
<PARA> We can recall in this chamber that the Budget surplus for 1990-91 was forecast by Mr Keating at $8.1 billion. Just seven months later, his surplus has virtually disappeared. The latest estimate we have from the Government is that over $6 billion has been lost from the surplus and that the current surplus is now forecast at only $1.7 billion. Mr Keating, in a rare display of frankness and honesty, has said that the Budget may even go into deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason we have this Bill before us is that the Government's collapse in Budget revenues has forced the Government to return to the money markets to seek further borrowings. It has to be said that this Government, under Mr Keating's management of the economy, has a notorious record for failing to meet key Budget targets. Time and time again we have seen in the Budgets that Mr Keating has brought down failures to meet his targets on inflation, failures to meet targets on productivity and failures to meet targets on balance of payments. I am afraid that it has to be said that despite this incredible record of budgetary failure under Mr Keating, the 1990-91 Budget is really the mother of all Budget failures. </PARA>
<PARA> Just look at the statements which were made by Mr Keating just seven months ago when he brought down his eighth and hopefully last Budget. Senator McMullan is at the table and it is quite possible that he is trying to block out of his memory the truly incredible Budget Speech that Mr Keating brought down just seven months ago. It makes very bad reading today. I will just refresh the memory of the chamber about some of the statements that Mr Keating made in August last year about his Budget. This is what he said last August:</PARA>
<PARA> The faith the Australian people exhibited in the Government at the election is now being repaid as the economy adjusts to a sustainable rate of growth without a catastrophic collapse. </PARA>
<PARA> This year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the kind of outcome the Government was seeking, delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession. </PARA>
<PARA>Does Senator McMullan remember those comments that were made just seven short months ago? Now we have this statement before us and the previous comments by the Treasurer that we are in the midst of probably the heaviest and most savage recession since the 1930s. There is no comment in this Budget statement about the planned recession that we had to have. Remember that statement that Mr Keating then told us? There was no hint to the Australian public just seven months ago. Mr Keating went on to say in his Budget Speech last year that this Budget:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . builds on the fiscal achievements secured to date and maintains fiscal policy as the Government's principal weapon in the fight against the current account deficit and our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA>What happened to the principal fight against the mounting foreign debt in this country, because the fiscal policy outlined in this Budget has collapsed catastrophically? Then Mr Keating went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> With a surplus of over $8 billion-</PARA>
<PARA>what a vain boast that appears to be today-</PARA>
<PARA>the fourth successive Budget surplus-it provides Australia with a period of sustained budgetary discipline unprecedented in its history. </PARA>
<PARA> It adds this further $8 billion to national savings to cut the call on overseas savings and hence overseas debt.</PARA>
<PARA>If that gross overstatement was not sufficient, Mr Keating then continued:</PARA>
<PARA> But not only does its rectitude provide an advantageous bottom line,-</PARA>
<PARA>that was the $8 billion which has now gone west-</PARA>
<PARA>it also underpins the fairest array of Commonwealth spending policies in the history of the Federation. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the Budget brought down in August last year which has now totally collapsed. The sad thing is that the Australian people-at least a sufficient number of them-believed Mr Keating, Mr Hawke, maybe Senator McMullan and maybe the Ministers in this chamber when they went around in the last election assuring people that there would be no recession. How many Labor people went around and gave assurances in their electorates? We certainly heard Mr Hawke and Mr Keating almost day by day during the election period assuring people that Dr Hewson was wrong in saying that the Australian economy was facing a severe recession. They said Dr Hewson was wrong in saying that the fundamental issues in the economy were not being addressed. So our Labor colleagues remember all that?</PARA>
<PARA> Well, what happened was that the Labor Government squeaked back into office on the basis of that big lie. It was a big lie because there was enough evidence around at that time-certainly available to the Liberal Party and there was no reason to believe that it would not have been available to the Australian Labor Party-that Australia was heading rapidly downhill. </PARA>
<PARA> I have read the bold boasts by Mr Keating in the last Budget about the financial rectitude of the Budget and being the fairest Budget since Federation, but there was not a hint about engineering a recession or the recession that we had to have. One would have to say on reflection, and I think Senator McMullan at the table would probably agree with this: how foolish and arrogant Mr Keating's Budget Speech now seems. </PARA>
<PARA> Just last night, Mr Hawke decided to eat some humble pie. One can remember, and perhaps this is a fair analogy, that it took Mr Hawke some years to admit that his promise that no Australian child would live in poverty was not kept. That was the big lie of the 1987 election. The big lie of the 1990 election was that there would be no recession. Mr Hawke maintained that position until it was no longer sustainable even for a man with a hide as thick as our Prime Minister has. So last night Mr Hawke-I quote from his statement-said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the recession has hurt many people and cost many jobs, and that is something I regret deeply. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy is currently at or near the bottom of a downturn that has been sharper, deeper and more prolonged than we anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether it should be `we anticipated' or `we were not prepared to admit'. I suspect that the real truth of the matter is that the Government was well aware of the catastrophe which was befalling Australia, but it simply was not prepared to admit it. </PARA>
<PARA> The apology of Mr Hawke last night is probably but little consolation to those Australians who are now losing their businesses, losing their homes and losing their jobs as a result of Mr Hawke's and Mr Keating's gross misjudgments on the economy. It was these people who undoubtedly remember more clearly than most the central promise of Mr Hawke in the last election that there would be no recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Hewson, in his reply to the Budget Speech given last August by Mr Keating, said that the Prime Minister and his Treasurer were clearly out of touch with the state of the Australian economy. Dr Hewson said this:</PARA>
<PARA>The Hawke-Keating Government has no idea of the extent of the recession in the private sector in Australia nor of the hardship being experienced by the great bulk of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hewson warned that the high interest rate policy of the Government was pushing the private sector into recession. Seven months down the track Mr Keating, Mr Hawke and Senator Button have all had to admit that Dr Hewson was correct and that they were wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, you may recall that on Monday in this chamber Senator Button conceded that interest rates had been kept too high for too long. It was a great pity that Mr Hawke and Mr Keating did not listen to the advice given by Dr Hewson and Peter Reith many months ago. It would have saved many Australians great pain and suffering. The main reason this Budget has collapsed and the Government now has to return to the money market for funds is the recession-the recession, I remind my colleagues, which Mr Keating initially said that we would not have, then said that we had to have it; and then he said that it was unfortunate this disaster had occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button has conceded, as has Mr Hawke, that the recession was a dreadful mistake. Had Mr Keating a thread of decency, he would accept responsibility for the disaster which has befallen the Australian economy-the most savage recession since the 1930s-and he would resign. We know, as we have seen from the behaviour of Mr Keating over a long period of time, that he does not seem to possess that sense of responsibility and decency that marks a strong leader. He does not seem to feel any remorse at all for the untruths he has told the Australian public. In my mind, he is devoid of the principles which should guide our leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances, Mr Hawke really has no option but to sack Mr Keating. I think we can recall the visit of Mr Keating to the Ford factory in Geelong before Christmas. Mr Keating spoke to some workers there who were not very pleased with him. One of these workers had the temerity to come up to our Treasurer and complain about the effects his policies were having on his home and his job prospects. What did Mr Keating say? Do honourable senators remember that famous statement? He said, `Disappear, pal.' That is what Mr Keating said to the Ford worker-`Disappear, pal.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, regrettably, as a result of this Government's policies and as a result of Mr Keating's mismanagement of the Australian economy, many Ford workers and indeed many workers in many factories around the country will see their jobs go. To pick up that theme, the Australian public want Mr Hawke to say to Mr Keating, `Disappear, pal'. That is what they want but, Mr President, you know, I know and Senator McMullan and all the other senators over there know that that will not happen. Senator Walsh occasionally gives us great insight into the workings of the Labor Party, and he described the Prime Minister as-remember this?-Old Jellyback. Old Jellyback will not have the guts to stand up for proper principles and to sack the man whose economic mismanagement of this country is causing such suffering and distress. I have to say, and I think many Australians would agree with me, that Mr Hawke's apology for the recession last night would have sounded more sincere had Mr Keating, the man who has caused the loss of so many jobs of other people, finally lost his job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to conclude by making this prediction: if the Government does not change its Treasurer and does not change its economic policies, we will have many Bills brought before this chamber, as we have today the Loan Bill 1991, requiring further borrowings. I urge the Government to reflect again on the collapse of its fiscal policy, admit responsibility for the economic failure which has so devastated this country, and start to take the fundamental decisions which will address the real issues in this economy, which the Government so notably failed to address last night. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I thank you and honourable senators for this opportunity to address the Senate. I am honoured to be here today, replacing Senator Peter Baume. I will begin my first speech by paying tribute to him and to his 16-year contribution to this chamber, this Parliament and this nation. Professor Baume, as he is now, was a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, a former Minister for Health and a former Minister for Education, serving in all portfolios with great distinction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before coming to this place, Peter Baume was a leading consulting physician and the high esteem in which he is still held in the medical profession has recently been confirmed by his appointment to the Chair of Community Medicine at the University of New South Wales. The measure of his contribution to this chamber was shown on his final day here in December when honourable senators from a majority of political parties paid tribute to his service. Among them was his cousin, Senator Michael Baume, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>If I have one objective in this place, it is to gain the word `honourable' both in capital letters, as Peter has done, and in lower case, as Peter has done. </PARA>
<PARA>Peter Baume was a model as to how we should conduct ourselves as senators and human beings. On my first day here I approached the desk of the Parliamentary Dining Room and introduced myself. When it was discovered that I was replacing Senator Peter Baume, I was asked to show my feet; `You have big shoes to fill', I was told. </PARA>
<PARA> One of Senator Peter Baume's most enduring achievements was his contribution to the development and articulation of Liberal philosophy. In the book Australian Liberalism: The Continuing Vision, which sets out the evolution of liberalism in this country from Alfred Deakin at the time of federalism through to the present, Peter Baume reaffirms the importance of the individual when he writes:</PARA>
<PARA>Our problems are best solved by a redistribution of power-``away from the Government and back to individuals, and this can only be achieved by stating and restating our fundamental liberal commitment to the maximum liberty of each person''. </PARA>
<PARA>This philosophy is very much in line with that of Sir Robert Menzies, who, at the founding of the Liberal Party in 1944, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I see the individual and his encouragement and recognition as the prime motivating force for building of a better world. </PARA>
<PARA>It was such a speech that first attracted me to the Liberal Party. Turning on the radio one evening in 1958, I heard Robert Menzies deliver a speech at the opening of a poultry farmers' conference. The occasion was very ordinary, but the speech was extraordinary. This eloquent man outlined with such grace his vision for Australia and there was I, a boy with a bad stutter recovering from the effects of polio, totally intrigued, listening and drawn to the Liberal vision of an Australia built on a deep respect for the dignity and the freedom of the individual, of an Australia where one could be rewarded for effort and where enterprise would be encouraged, and of an Australia where there is real equality of opportunity and choice. </PARA>
<PARA> If one were to try to encapsulate this philosophy in one phrase it would be that the success of the community depends upon the success of the individual. The Australia in which I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s seemed to be the manifestation of this philosophy. When I look back, these seem to have been the golden years of Australia. Then we had the third highest standard of living in the world. Australia Felix was the slogan; Australia unlimited. And why not? Then, unemployment stood at between one and 2 per cent; inflation fluctuated between 3 and 4 per cent; and interest rates were at 6 1/2 per cent. Do honourable senators remember those figures? As for overseas debt, we tended to have a surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot recall any Liberal Treasurer in Australia's golden age claiming to be the world's greatest, although the Liberals' records stand high in stark contrast to what has happened to our economy during the past eight years. Australia in the 1980s and 1990s has become enmeshed in a deadly thicket of high overseas debt, inflation, interest rates, unemployment and now recession-the one that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) claims to have masterminded but which he really generated because of a completely inappropriate economic policy mix. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past eight years the Hawke Government has made a number of fundamental errors in the direction of economic policy. What it should have been doing was getting the economic policy settings right to solve our underlying economic problem, which is our failure to produce sufficient goods and services. The top priority of the Hawke Government should have been to boost productivity. Instead, we have been focusing mainly on demand management and discouraging expenditure through a regime of high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the effects of that. Last week Senator Button in one of his refreshing bursts of candour admitted that we were heading towards our third quarter of negative growth. Australia is going backwards, and out in the suburbs and down on the farm people are suffering. Living standards in this country are about to decline dramatically. The ones who will be most affected are the most defenceless: the young and the unskilled. </PARA>
<PARA> The December unemployment figures reveal that 25 per cent, one-quarter, of our youth are without jobs. In my home city of Newcastle this figure is 30 per cent-one in three. Apart from the human misery that this creates, it is also a waste of a resource that is vital to the recovery of this country. Perhaps the Treasurer should come to Newcastle and explain to the scores of families without breadwinners and the legion of unemployed youth why we had to have this recession. Of course, he will not, because he realises that he has made a major policy error: interest rates were too high for too long. </PARA>
<PARA> In its fourth term, the Hawke Government has finally stumbled upon the correct economic path-micro-economic reform. At last it is starting to focus upon the supply side of the economic equation and is belatedly trying to boost productivity. This begs the question: why did the Government not do this during its first term? The so-called micro-economic reform agenda is a half-hearted attempt to get the country back on the right economic track. The tragedy for Australia is that here we have a country rich in resources but without a proper economic structure to take care of it. </PARA>
<PARA> On Australia Day we sing, `This land abounds in nature's gifts of beauty rich and rare'. One would be forgiven for wondering how a nation which started out with such hope and with so much natural wealth and, at the time of Federation, had the highest per capita income in the world could reach a point in the last quarter of the twentieth century where it could no longer pay its way in the world. We cannot allow our national debt to continue to climb at $1 billion to $2 billion a month. The Labor Government now breathes a sigh of relief if the debt goes up by only $1 billion a month. Our total net foreign debt at the end of 1990 stood at $130 billion; that is, $7,500 for each man, woman and child. This cannot be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> To understand how we got ourselves in this economic mire, I want to look closely at a region in my State of New South Wales which in a concrete way is indicative of what is wrong with the Australian economy. Like Australia as a whole, the Hunter Valley is rich in resources. In fact, it is the richest valley in Australia. I know it well because I have lived there for the past 19 years. I am very proud to be the first Liberal senator from that region. </PARA>
<PARA> To put the magnitude of the wealth of the area in some sort of perspective, let me provide the Senate with some relative comparisons between the Hunter region and the nation as a whole. The economic resource base of the Hunter is massive. With only 3 per cent of the population, the Hunter produces almost 5 per cent of the gross domestic product of this nation. It produces one-third of the nation's coal and half of that is exported; one-third of the aluminium; one-third of the electricity; and one-quarter of the crude steel production. The Hunter's port handles more cargo than any other in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the Hunter's massive contribution to rural and secondary industry, over 70 per cent of the population is employed in the tertiary sector. The area serves as the northern administrative headquarters for private and public sector organisations. The Hunter has one of the finest universities in the nation, with over 12,000 students in a very wide range of faculties. I had the privilege of serving on its faculty of education. </PARA>
<PARA> I first moved to the Hunter region 19 years ago, and with my family I have explored this wonderfully diverse region. We have hiked through the subtropical rainforest below Barrington Tops. We have gone white-water rafting on the Chichester River. We have camped on the beautiful broadwater at Mungo Brush. We have fished-somewhat unsuccessfully-at Fishing Point on beautiful Lake Macquarie, the third largest salt water lake in Australia. We have strolled along the redeveloped foreshores of Newcastle Harbour listening to the jazz bands with the local people on a Sunday afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> Over half a million people live in the Hunter. It is an area rich in human resources as well as natural resources. The strength and character of its people were demonstrated 15 months ago when it was hit by the worst natural disaster in our history: an earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale ripped through the city-our sixth largest-killing 14 people and creating billions of dollars worth of damage. The destruction cost was greater than that wrought by Cyclone Tracy in 1974 when it flattened Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own home the building whipped around; the children screamed and were flung to the floor. In the city, the huge Newcastle Workers Club collapsed, killing people; in the suburb of Hamilton the shop facades crashed to the ground, creating more loss of life. Historic buildings were fractured and later had to be torn down. Within five seconds that morning, lives were lost and billions of dollars worth of damage occurred. The response of the people of Newcastle was magnificent. In the true spirit of Aussie mateship people really helped each other to put their lives and their properties back together. Fifteen months after the quake, the work still goes on as the city is rebuilt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hunter is a magnificent region with magnificent people and, more than any other, it pulls its economic weight in this country. We generate 50 per cent more gross domestic product per capita and 90 per cent more exports per capita than the Australian average. But just as the 1980s and 1990s have seen a slide from the golden era for Australia, so too in the Hunter. Like Australia, the Hunter could have done far better, especially if governments over the past 90 years had not neglected the area. </PARA>
<PARA> A report released three weeks ago by the Hunter Economic Development Council outlined the New South Wales Liberal Government's economic strategy for the region over the next 20 years. This excellent document targets 30 key industries in the Hunter where there are private business opportunities, including defence and aerospace, bio-related technology, energy related enterprises, education exports, leisure and sports, recycling, the wine industry and tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> The document also highlights what the Government needs to do in terms of upgrading infrastructure to provide the base on which industry can build. What is greatly hampering the enormous economic potential of the Hunter is that these facilities are not in place now. Government neglect here is really an analogy of what is wrong with Australia as a whole and why we are constantly struggling as we produce less than we consume. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategy document highlights the need to develop the Williamtown air base as a proper international tourist destination, with upgraded access to places such as the vineyards and Port Stephens. But, instead of going forward with vision over the last 10 years in terms of services, the area has gone backwards. Ten years ago one could fly from Newcastle to Canberra by jet. Now, when I fly from here on Friday, I leave on a small propeller-driven plane in the middle of the day-most senators will know the flight-and when I get into Sydney I wait for an hour and a half at the airport. I then catch an even smaller plane, with even smaller propellers, to fly to Newcastle. This neglect is not confined to Newcastle. The airport facilities around Australia need enormous extra expenditure to upgrade them. Sydney is waiting on the third runway. The annual cost of that in lost tourism and economic potential is $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if we upgraded the facilities of Williamtown, there would still be major problems because of the lack of adequate road links. The main highway that runs north of Newcastle, the so-called Newcastle-Sydney expressway, ends 15 kilometres west of the city at the moment in a confused tangle of substandard roads. This main road was started 30 years ago and it was to be the link to Newcastle, the Hunter, northern New South Wales and Queensland. But we are still waiting for it to be finished. It is still 15 kilometres short of linking up with the rest of the road system. It would be a very game overseas tourist who would try to find his way to the airport, Port Stephens or the vineyards through this road maze. It has been like this for three years; it will be like it for at least another three. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the Government takes half of our money at the petrol pump in the form of taxes, it really has not spent the money on roads. We really have a Third World road system in this country. Four years ago I drove on the roads in the United States-what a contrast! One American actually abused me about the state of our roads. He had actually tried to drive around Australia. He was an extremely brave man. The poor state of our roads, apart from killing thousands of Australians each year, adds between 10 to 20 per cent to the costs of our transport, making us even less competitive in the world marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> When a driver with a semitrailer load of exports eventually reaches port, after tackling the substandard roads, to unload it on to ships, he faces a whole new range of problems on our waterfront. Australian ports are considered by the rest of the world to be a joke-the epitome of inefficiency. Reform is moving at a snail's pace. Overseas, our major trading partners are reforming their waterfronts at a much faster pace. We continue to slip further behind. Of course, when our semitrailer driver arrives at the port of Newcastle, which in terms of tonnage of cargo is the largest in Australia, he probably will not be able to send his load anywhere because of the lack of general cargo handling facilities. The Hunter region economic development strategy has targeted the upgrading of the port to enable it to handle container terminals for the Asia-Pacific trade as the second highest priority after upgrading Williamtown. </PARA>
<PARA> I have outlined only three of the many ways in which a region of proven economic performance, and even greater economic potential, has been stunted in its growth by government neglect over many years. Even when the Government has had an opportunity to direct resources to the city, it has not done so, taking its very traditional Australian Labor Party vote for granted. Until 1988 and the advent of the Greiner Government in New South Wales, the people of the Hunter sent to Canberra and to Sydney, Labor members of parliament for most of the century. This bred political complacency and the results were disastrous for the Hunter. The Royal Australian Navy submarine contract, worth $4.6 billion, went to Adelaide, not to Newcastle. Perth pinched a $99m offshore gas platform from Newcastle. The frigate contract worth $4.3 billion went to Melbourne, not to Newcastle, despite a promise to the Hunter yards that they would get a quarter of the work; as yet, not one dollar has actually come into the region. One of our most productive and innovative shipyards, Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd, has just gone into receivership because of a lack of work. This is a matter I intend to pursue in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Not giving the region its fair share of contracts is one thing, but deliberately denying contracts to the Hunter is quite another. Having missed the opportunity for decentralisation by not sending the lucrative submarine and frigate projects to a regional city, the Hawke Government generated outrage in the city and in its own Labor Party when it decided to keep the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in Canberra, instead of doing what it promised before the election-to send it to Newcastle. It was Labor's own Minister for Land Transport, Bob Brown, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that the decision to locate the Authority in Newcastle was based on objective reasons. Newcastle was the best location. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the decision was reversed by a new and inexperienced Minister who was hoodwinked by the people in his department. The snow job blew out the costs of the move from Canberra to Newcastle, originally estimated at $6.7m, to $14.7m, which included a four-day visit to Newcastle for all 211 staff and their families, whether they intended to move to Newcastle or not, and an item of $19,200 for moving family pets. It was an episode worthy of Yes, Prime Minister. In fact, I think the Department based its stratagem on the `Man Overboard' series in which Jim Hacker PM tries to relocate some of the armed forces to the north of England. Do honourable senators remember the story? The field marshal made it very clear that one could not ask senior officers to live permanently in the north. When Jim Hacker asked why, he was given the following reasons: `Their wives would not stand for it', `Wimbledon is not in the north; nor is Harrods, nor is Ascot, not to mention the Army and Navy Club'. In the end, the inexperienced Minister lost, Jim Hacker lost and the armed forces stayed in the south of England-and England hypothetically, lost economic gain. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, our Australian Maritime Safety Authority stayed in Canberra-on Lake Burley Griffin, 200 kilometres from the sea. Imagine how well the Hunter region might be doing now if it had received its fair share of government expenditure and contracts. The billions of dollars that might have been ours would have created a major boom. I am sure that they would have been ours if we had had more political vision in this nation, or if we had been fortunate enough to have been an island like Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I hasten to assure all Tasmanians that I am in no way denigrating Tasmania. I simply want to illustrate to this chamber, especially the 12 honourable senators from Tasmania, how location and government neglect stretching back over 90 years has stunted the economic development of the Hunter and, because of its economic importance to Australia, stunted the development of the whole nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Imagine, if you will, that the Hunter valley was an offshore island, approximately 240 kilometres off the coast-the same distance as Tasmania is from the mainland. If we now consider a comparison between `Hunterland', as we might call the island, and Tasmania, we would find that Hunterland has a population of over half a million compared to Tasmania's 450,000. The Hunterland capital of Newcastle is twice the size of Tasmania's capital of Hobart. In addition, Hunterland's gross domestic product and its contribution to export income in Australia are greater than those of Tasmania. Yet Tasmania is a State in control of its own affairs, with a State Parliament and Tasmania is fully represented in this chamber with 12 senators. The Hunter now has one.</PARA>
<PARA> During my term in this Parliament I pledge myself to fight for the Hunter, a region which, if treated properly, could reach its full potential as an economic powerhouse for New South Wales and for the whole of Australia. With its vast wealth and contribution to export income, it could play a major role in leading our nation out of its economic morass. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I represent all of the people of New South Wales, I will be focussing much of my work in the north, in its largest population centre where half a million people have been under-represented in this Parliament. In doing so, I am following in a great tradition established before my arrival by my two New South Wales colleagues: Senator Bronwyn Bishop, who has set up her office in the west of Sydney which has a population bigger than the city of Adelaide, and Senator Michael Baume, who has set up his office in the twin steel city of Wollongong. Together we will help redress the balance of representation in this Parliament and provide a fair go for three major regions which, over the years, have been victims of Government neglect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Returning to the second reading debate on the Loan Bill 1991, any intelligent person, assuming the integrity of the August Budget, could never have envisaged the speed at which the economy would deteriorate and, at the same time, the speed at which the surplus would evaporate. The speed at which the surplus is evaporating is the reason we have this Loan Bill before us today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that Budget we had a projected surplus of $8.1 billion. The Bill before us today seeks to give the Government funds to meet the present budgetary shortfall, and perhaps a lot more. This shortfall is occurring between the moneys appropriated by Parliament in the Budget and the funds available through the Consolidated Revenue Fund to meet those appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> Usually, a Bill of this nature would be introduced into Parliament shortly after the Budget Appropriations Bills, if it was anticipated in the Budget that the Consolidated Revenue Fund would be in deficit. As we all know, the Government did not expect the Consolidated Revenue Fund to go into deficit this year. The hype at the time was about a soft landing. How wrong that hype was. We now have a very severe recession. As I mentioned, the only reason for having this Bill before us today is that the Budget in August failed to address our economically disastrous situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, we have before us a situation where in August last year the Government had a surplus of $8.1 billion. A few weeks ago the Treasurer (Mr Keating) estimated a surplus of $1.7 billion. Furthermore, since then, the Treasurer has indicated that there may be a deficit. As my colleague Senator Short said earlier, this decrease in the expected surplus has made a mockery of one of the central achievements forecast in the Budget-a Commonwealth surplus which the Treasurer said would ensure that Australia's public sector as a whole would be in balance. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are many reasons for this decrease in the surplus, the Gulf war being but one. The Government's outlays have increased beyond expectations. On the other hand, receipts have come in well below Budget forecasts. For example, in the months from July to December there is now an estimated gross shortfall of $2.4 billion. The worrying part of this shortfall is the large proportion of it which is due, or expected, from pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a $93m decrease in sales tax. It is quite obvious that the strategy of the luxury car tax, which was a Budget gimmick-an accord, arrangement or carrot-was successful at the time for getting votes, but in the long term, as we predicted, was disastrously wrong. We do not want to say it, but at the time we told you so. If only this Government would listen a little more closely to what the Opposition has to say!</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people have been deceived time and time again. I remind honourable senators of a statement made by the Hon. John Howard in the other place. He reminded that House of Ministers in the Australian Labor Party who have distorted and lied about the past, misrepresented the present and given false hopes about the future. That Budget document was widely acclaimed across Australia. How falsely that portrayed the real situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of questions that I think really need answering. That $2.4 billion deficit to date allegedly nets down, because of a number of factors, to perhaps $1,100m, about which there can be absolutely no dispute. Will this be recovered in subsequent months of the year? I think it is unfortunate that we do not have a Minister representing the Treasurer or his Parliamentary Secretary to answer these questions. I hope that they will be taken on board and answered later. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of a question that I asked yesterday, and the response from Senator Button was that he would endeavour to get the answer as quickly as possible. We are still awaiting that reply. On 20 August we asked similar questions on taxation. We have been promised replies. They are still not forthcoming. What has the Government to hide in relation to taxation and its tax collections? Will this $1.1 billion adjusted shortfall wipe out the remaining vestiges of the proclaimed surplus? The Australian people need to know. What will be the estimated impact on the projected Budget surplus for 1990-91? It is indeed worrying. </PARA>
<PARA> The collection performances against the Budget goals have been so uneven in taxation offices across Australia. In fact, only three of the 16 offices have exceeded their Budget goals. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my hobbyhorses in this place has been the treatment of taxpayers by the Australian Taxation Office in what I have referred to as the slow gradation of their rights in the past five years. I have advocated, and still advocate, the need for a taxpayers' Bill of rights, and statements that continually come out of the Taxation Office reinforce, certainly on a regular basis, the need for that taxpayers' Bill of rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The uneven collection performance against Budget goals causes me to ask the Government a further question. Given the differences in approach-and the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) does not even have the decency to listen when I am posing these questions; he is talking on the telephone-can this Minister assure the Senate that all taxpayers are being treated with the same degree of fairness in implementing the laws? The minutes coming from the Taxation Office indicate that there is a wide variety in terms of implementation strategy and policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Could the Minister also outline the procedures that are being followed by the Australian Taxation Office to collect this shortfall from individual taxpayers who are indebted to the Australian Taxation Office? There needs to be a consistent policy from State to State and from office to office and that is not the case at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should taxpayers facing prosecution be treated differently in Sydney than in Melbourne? It is a Commonwealth-wide office. There are further questions that I think need to be asked. Is it correct that instructions have been given to the Australian Taxation Office to place even further pressure on PAYE collections? The uneven treatment is, indeed, worrying. </PARA>
<PARA> After the Government's Budget last August, Paddy McGuinness made the comment, `The Commonwealth Budget was the product of a treasurer and a government that have run out of ideas and no longer have the courage of their convictions'. The statement before us today reflects that run-down. In August, Mr Keating announced to Australians a Budget that would improve our balance of payments and result in an export driven economic recovery. In the press two weeks ago we were informed that the Treasurer's emphasis had now shifted from balance of payments to inflation. According to the Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA>the extent (to which) we achieve and maintain a low inflation path we can diminish . . . our concern with the current account deficit because we will have more confidence that investments and savings decisions are rational and efficient. </PARA>
<PARA>In itself, that statement is quite okay. But it is interesting to note the change of emphasis and the change of trend to meet the problems that Mr Keating is meeting, changes for the purposes of expediency and convenience. The run-down of the original Budget surplus forecast of $8.1 billion to this announced $1.7 billion is again, according to Mr Keating, the key lever in his inflation first and then balance of payments strategy. Who is going to accept that as a sop, given the problems that we are facing at present? The only problem is that the probable run-down of the Budget surplus also has the possibility of becoming a Budget deficit, in which case the Commonwealth will return to the bond markets as a borrower for the first time since July 1989. It is interesting that the Government is of the opinion that this course of action is what is now needed to provide the stimulus to get investment and, subsequently, the economy growing again. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to note because previously one of the Hawke Government's economic objectives was to remove the Government as a competitor in the financial markets. The Government's logic then was that if it ran a surplus there would be more domestic money available for domestic investors so that they would not have to borrow funds from overseas. This action would not add to the current account deficit. If the Government now diminishes the surplus through this `recession we had to have' and becomes a borrower, the Government will have to go back to competing with industry for funds, thereby pushing up the price of those funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's previous policy also included keeping wages down to get profit share growing so that companies could invest in and expand their businesses. Both policies were geared toward increased investment, which was supposed to lead to a higher standard of living. The Government actually did achieve its investment objective. It was a bit later than first predicted, but there was a boom. The labour market experienced strong employment growth, with the number of people in the work force at record levels. This positive economic situation, which the Government fostered with its policies, resulted in a surge in aggregate demand and often the demand could not be met by domestically produced goods, so the quantity of imports increased. </PARA>
<PARA> This increased demand for foreign funds to cover the investment plus the increase in imports led to a sharp rise in the current account deficit. The demand for products being as high as it was increased the inflation rate. The increased current account deficit, combined with the inflation increase, led the Government to slam on the brakes and the brakes were applied unilaterally in the form of monetary policy. The Government increased the interest rate rapidly over a short period as a disincentive to spending and investing. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to lecture the Government on its policies because I think the Senate is pretty familiar with the outcome. I think it is important to understand where we have come from in order to realise the mess into which this Government has now got the economy and that is reflected in the need to go out into the market and borrow and introduce today's Loan Bill. The Government's economic thinking has somehow come to the situation of a loan fund Bill to try and finance our economic ills. A further concern is whether we are in a recession at all or rather whether we are in a long term decline, as Geoffrey Lehmann recently pointed out in the Australian Business Magazine. That is perhaps of even greater concern. In Mr Lehmann's words, the:</PARA>
<PARA>word recession . . . implies that our problems are just the result of a cyclic downturn. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the notion that has been perpetrated by the Treasurer. We have heard all this before. Years ago it was called the J curve scenario. I remind this Senate that there is nothing cyclic about Australia's worsening current account deficit; there is nothing cyclic about this deterioration in the Budget surplus; and there is nothing cyclic in the deterioration that is occurring right across Australia in terms of lower standards of living, in terms of lost jobs and in terms of failed policies that this 12 March statement made such a pathetic attempt to rectify. Therefore, the Government really does need to address much more significantly our long term relative decline and not merely the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policies have led us to a situation where we need this Loan Bill before us now. The extent of the borrowing is the sixty-four dollar question that this Government has to answer. The Government has mismanaged the economy. Our Government Ministers and their advisers need to think much more clearly about measures to reverse the trends started in last year's Budget and giving rise to situations that demand a further borrowing, a borrowing that is manifest and needed through this loan fund. I ask the Government to reconsider its policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak to the Loan Bill, I too seek to use it to further condemn the Government, as my colleagues have done. A loan Bill has been in the past a normal mechanism to allow for the balancing of the consolidated fund and it has been something which has been used in an ordinary and regular fashion as part of the bureaucracy. On this occasion, it is somewhat different. Since 1987, the Government has crowed from the top of its favourite hill that it has been a superb manager producing surpluses, which has meant that it has not needed the mechanism of a loan Bill in order to go out and raise further funds to keep that consolidated fund in balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we had the Budget last year and we had the Treasurer (Mr Keating) tell us how we were looking forward to a wonderful anticipated surplus of $8.1 billion, many of us thought that it was an illusory figure and many of the people in the business community and the ordinary Australian population thought it was an illusory figure, but the Government proceeded to continue to skite that it was a real figure and that it, the Government, was in charge of the economy and the economy was in good shape. Already we had had the invasion of Kuwait, already we had had people starting to lose their jobs and already we had started to see small businesses go into bankruptcy and individuals go into bankruptcy. The signs were there that what the Treasurer finally came to acknowledge as an engineered recession, with all the levers pulled by him, was to fall upon us. We had already seen a decline in that surplus-indeed not a decline but ultimately almost its disappearance. </PARA>
<PARA> So we come to the Loan Bill, which is perhaps best described as yet another contrivance to be used by the Treasurer to get his hands on a bit more of the taxpayers' money. In this case he is going to go out and borrow money or get the authority to borrow money to enable the Commonwealth to be run in accordance with the law. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last couple of months we have seen the use of another mechanism, the Advance to the Minister for Finance; and we have seen in the last two months large applications for drawings against that fund, particularly with regard to payments to United Nations organisations, where, in the figures for January, there was a blow-out of some $3.3m of fees that were due and payable, due to currency fluctuations. But more particularly we had the large figure of some $45m concerning the blow-out in the Export Finance Insurance Corporation (EFIC) and that advance was sought pending the passage of Appropriation Bill (No. 3). </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriation Bill (No. 3) was brought forward in this place on the basis that the war had incurred additional expenditure and that it was necessary to deal with that Bill in the month of February. However, in the February applications for an advance from the Minister for Finance we saw yet another application for a further $22m worth for EFIC relating to wheat default payments, not subsequent or contingent upon being met from Appropriation Bill (No. 3) but simply a further drawing. In other words, when the Government put together the figures for Appropriation Bill (No. 3), it made a further error or omission or was simply incompetent in working out the necessary figures. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was particularly concerned at the way in which the Advance to the Minister for Finance fund was used. Just to remind senators, this is an amount of money appropriated under the Appropriation Bills to enable provisions to be made for contingency amounts to be paid which in the parlance of the day were `urgent and unforeseen', and it was necessary that they meet both criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee was concerned that the way in which the fund was used was simply illegal because there were good examples of applications being made where somebody had simply made an error and left out of the estimates and out of the provision for appropriation certain sums of money which were obviously going to be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Public Accounts Committee made three recommendations, which were subsequently accepted by the Department of Finance, to make the fund be used in a more seen way and in accordance with the law. What happened was that there was virtually a new category created which dealt with erroneous or understated figures from the appropriation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the way in which the supporting documentation for a drawing on the Advance to the Minister for Finance is used-and, indeed, another recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee was that the supporting applications be made public so that the Senate can see exactly the grounds upon which the additional moneys are sought-one will find that the excuse or the reason still most often given, if not universally given, is `urgent and unforeseen'. </PARA>
<PARA> As one goes through, looking at the sorts of amounts required, in no way could one really say that they are perhaps truly meeting the Finance guidelines. I would suggest that the Department of Finance and indeed the Secretary and the Minister need to look more earnestly at the way some of those applications are coming forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The Loan Bill is simply a mechanism for allowing the law to be met. In normal times when proper administration of the economy takes place, it is of no particular moment and normally would not have any particular attention drawn to it. But it is particularly important in the context of the Budget that came down last August, which simply gave us a promise to impose substantial and sustained hardship for millions of Australians and their families. In the Budget we saw that there was an illusion of fiscal restraint but that in fact the expenditure cuts that were made were only about one-tenth of the expenditure cuts outlined in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, which was the economic document that the Opposition used prior to the last election and which in fact would have been the basis of its first Budget, and we saw that we have a prognosis where the touted $8.1 billion surplus will undoubtedly fall as the private sector economy continues to slide and the revenue base is further eroded and activity related expenditure increases. The Opposition was able to see that the Budget was an illusory document, and in my own contribution to the debate on that Budget which I made on 8 November, I would perhaps remind the Senate, I used these words:</PARA>
<PARA>The Budget has already been totally discredited by unrealistic Budget assumptions. Saddam Hussein may have blown the Treasurer's prediction on oil prices out of the water, but he can blame no-one when his own figures on growth, unemployment and inflation have been inaccurate. The Treasurer's failure on the assumption has torn apart the Government's strategy on wages, interest rates and foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet at that time the Government was still saying that the economy had not gone into a recession. The Treasurer was still claiming that he had got all the sums right. We had to progress further along until we finally got the admission that not only had the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) got it wrong but that the Treasurer had got it wrong; that the dole queues were lengthening at a frightening rate; that businesses were closing like never before; that ordinary Australian families were hurting badly; and that statistics were starting to reveal the true damage that the mismanagement of this Government had foisted upon the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last year we have seen the following: capital expenditure down 3.4 per cent; motor vehicle registrations down 10.6 per cent; dwelling approvals down 12.1 per cent; commercial finance commitments down 12.1 per cent; and job vacancies down 28 per cent. And it hits very hard in the west of Sydney, where ordinary Australian families are forced to struggle with the reality and the fallout of mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA> But still we were hearing the ridiculous denials, and only the continued expressions of pain finally seemed to permeate the circle or the wall which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer had built around themselves. But when they finally admitted that they had got it wrong, did they apologise? Did they explain? Did they show remorse? No. There was simply an acknowledgment that they had failed. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) highlighted the plight they were facing. It was intended to appropriate funds significantly exceeding the resources appropriated by the Advance to the Minister for Finance which I mentioned previously-$234m, including $52m for equipment and stores on expenditure associated with deployment of the forces in the Gulf and $181m to meet the claims by the Australian Wheat Board associated with Iraqi defaults on credit sales. But the overwhelming bulk of the expenditure should have been considered and included at the time of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague in the other place Mr Alexander Downer, the shadow Minister for trade, in his response to the Budget said:</PARA>
<PARA>No provision was made in the Budget under the national export insurance scheme to cover this considerable debt, which could be claimed by the Australian Wheat Board if Iraq fails to meet its payments on time. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Opposition was quite able to detect and to publish the fact that there were matters that simply had not been considered and ought to have been considered and included in the Budget and that the Budget itself was a farcical document and indeed in no way showed an accurate or indeed even an honest attempt to portray the economic reality of this nation. But the Government, of course, has not listened to the Opposition on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA> (ii) the fact that these documents suggest that Westpac, Australia's largest private bank, through its subsidiary, Partnership Pacific Ltd. (PPL), in relation to its handling of foreign currency loans:</PARA>

<PARA> (v) further, in this regard, that a strong prima facie case exists that the author of the Allen Allen &amp;Hemsley letters has committed a transgression of the criminal law relating to aiding and abetting a criminal offence and/or being an accessory after the fact of a criminal offence and being guilty of a conspiracy relating to these activities, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) believes that these and other allegations concerning bank malpractice are of such gravity as to warrant a full judicial inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving this motion I draw attention to the fact that this is the first opportunity that the Parliament has had to discuss the infamous Westpac letters, which have attracted such widespread attention throughout the nation. I expect that the nation at large will be waiting to see how the Parliament reacts to this opportunity. I describe them as the infamous Westpac letters because I believe that the wording of my motion, which I will turn to in detail shortly, aptly describes them as exactly that. </PARA>
<PARA> I did a radio interview with Don Chipp not long ago. I said that I had a very large bone to pick with him because at the time that I came into this place as an Australian Democrats senator he told me what my role was-to keep the bastards honest-but he did not tell me how many there were. They are everywhere. Indeed, I found out not long after arriving in here as a Democrat senator, in joining my other colleagues, that we have a duty not to resile from the hard issues. This banking issue has proven to be a hard issue. We have not resiled from it. We do not do so now. We have put before the Senate in this motion the realities of what the Westpac letters actually mean, and we are calling upon the Senate to take its position in relation to those realities. </PARA>
<PARA> From the very beginning when these letters surfaced, Westpac went into panic mode in the extreme. There were a series of efforts made to deprive the public of knowledge of the contents of the documents. That involved claiming legal privilege. I have argued in this place that the documents do not attract legal privilege. I am not detracting from the importance of legal privilege as a process-namely, the right of individuals to present themselves to lawyers, to declare all and then to get confidential advice back-but if the lawyers go beyond the step of giving confidential advice about whether the law has or has not been broken and extend to the stage of actually saying how to avoid the outcomes of that breach of law, legal privilege, we would argue, does not apply. </PARA>
<PARA> There were widespread injunctions in an attempt to contain the publishing of these documents and even comment about the documents in the press. I have said at public gatherings recently that, if somebody had asked me five weeks ago to name a country where there was widespread corruption in the most powerful financial institutions in the land, where key witnesses before parliamentary inquiries found themselves intimidated before appearing before those inquiries, where the press was muzzled by processes of injunctions before the court and the threat of litigation emanating from those injunctions, and where the parliaments of the land were not able to or reluctant to debate significant documents revealing that corruption, I think that I would have said Chile or Nicaragua. Sadly, the answer today, on 13 March 1991, is Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to overestimate the significance of these documents. For that reason, they have rightly attracted enormous public attention. I believe that it has emerged that subsequent to the discovery and disclosure of these documents, in a variety of ways, there are two dimensions to the issue before the Senate today. The first is the obvious one of the disclosure and revelation of corruption in our most powerful financial institutions. That in itself should be sufficient to arrest the attention of the nation; in fact, it has done so. The second, and in some respects the most important, dimension to emerge is the one which relates to questions of the privacy of the Parliament: the very foundations and nature of our Constitution and the rights of individuals, and elected representatives especially, to come into parliaments with privilege, and the rights of those people to use those privileges in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald three or four days ago got it right when it said that we must not let the parliamentary dimension of this issue rest; that in fact there have been profound implications to flow from the revelations contained in these documents and how our parliaments and our courts have reacted to those revelations. But in the final analysis the Westpac documents are not about Mr Stuart Fowler, Managing Director of Westpac, on his salary package in excess of $2m per annum. They are not about senators like McLean, who have been pursuing the bank issue for 2 1/2 years-and the coincidental arrival of these documents which have allowed that issue to emerge in the true light of day is one which should attract the attention of the nation. They are not about those things; they are about the plight of ordinary, everyday Australians in the hands of the most powerful financial institutions in the land. They are about the plight of those people trying to take their circumstances into the courts of the land and get justice. It is those dimensions of these documents which make them of such primary importance and make it so vital that the Australian Parliament address them for what they are. </PARA>
<PARA> But there has been an extraordinary reluctance on the part of the Parliament to undertake that responsibility. We reluctantly have here tonight the opportunity of 1 1/2 hours of debate; half an hour of that is mine. I am wondering what the Government and the Opposition will do with their opportunity to debate these documents in the remaining hour. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised today that the documents have not yet been tabled in the other place. I have been advised today that as yet there will have been no opportunity for representatives elected to the other place to discuss those documents. I hope that this will not be the final outcome after all of the trauma that the nation has gone through, the courts have gone through and, indeed, this chamber has gone through. With those documents now before us, I hope that the final outcome will not be that the Federal Parliament of this land gives them an hour and a half of debate. That would be to lie down in front of the banks. That would be to confirm the statement made by Ansely Rothschild in 1801 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Allow me to control the credit of the land and I care not who makes the laws. </PARA>
<PARA>Ansely Rothschild in 1801 got the relative powers right. He acknowledged the fact that the banks are the most powerful institutions in the land; he acknowledged the relative powers between the banks and the law makers. It will be interesting to see what happens in our Parliament in response to what is revealed in these documents tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not resile from the fact that I have brought before this chamber what I consider to be an extremely important motion. The motion is essentially in three parts. It is about abuse and corruption of a privileged position by Australia's most powerful private bank; it is about collusion, aiding and abetting of that process by Australia's most powerful law firm; and it is about what the Australian community should do in relation to those matters. I would like to take each aspect of the motion in turn. It states:</PARA>

<PARA> (d) breached its obligation to the Reserve Bank by exceeding its limited entitlements to foreign currency holdings,</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to address some comments to that aspect of the motion. These documents were suppressed for as long as they were because they are, in their own words, devastating in their condemnation of the behaviour of Australia's largest private bank-Westpac. `The bank you can bank on', is its slogan. These documents are incredible in their condemnation of the behaviour of that bank. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take the concept of the fiduciary obligation. The fiduciary obligation is not a difficult concept; it is simple. It says that the bank has the obligation of considering the interests of its clients equal to those of itself. That is its obligation in law. In the processes which are known as the so-called managed foreign currency loans, Westpac-and I would venture to suggest other major banks too; and I will suggest this to the bank inquiry on Friday-threw that to one side and ruthlessly, aggressively and effectively pursued profit-massive profit. </PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable senators know that one person, with one phone, in one day made $0.76m profit for Westpac? I will put the documents to verify that before the bank inquiry on Friday. One person, with one phone, in one day, made $750,000 which went into the coffers of Westpac. Do honourable senators know what money was used to make that profit-the money of people who innocently walked in the door and wanted to borrow from `The bank that you can bank on'. They just wanted to borrow money to buy a header to take wheat, to expand their business, or to do ordinary, normal things, and they were convinced by this bank that they should enter along a path which fundamentally is revealed in the documents known as the Westpac letters, the Belgium letters and subsequently the French letters. Subsequently, in hundreds of other documents that I will table before the bank inquiry on Friday, it was revealed that Westpac went about its own selfish business, exploited opportunity and en route actually did other things, but avoided paying taxes that it should have paid. It passed those taxes on to the poor, innocent victims who walked through the door. It deliberately exceeded its obligations to the Reserve Bank. It did all of these things in the pursuit of what has been described by another banker as super profits. </PARA>
<PARA> That bank and those who managed it in that stage should stand condemned for this behaviour which I argue, prima facie, on legal advice, was illegal, criminal behaviour. There are obligations upon the Treasurer and the Attorney-General to acknowledge the nature of that behaviour and to take the appropriate steps. </PARA>
<PARA> With the aid of the law firm Allen Allen and Hemsley, Westpac went further to devise ways and means of ensuring that those who had been victimised, if they could get into the courts and when they got into the courts, would not get justice. Westpac put in place a strategy, and that is the heading that is used in these letters to describe the steps that `The bank that you could bank on' would take to ensure that justice would not eventually be done. And justice has not been done. That is why these documents are devastating. They not only condemn the bank involved, but also condemn the law firm involved. I would like to move on to the second part of my motion. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that the law firm, Allen Allen &amp;Hemsley, conspired with PPL-</PARA>
<PARA>which I have earlier said was a subsidiary of Westpac-</PARA>
<PARA> to obstruct just outcomes to clients disadvantaged by the above actions,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that on legal advice strong prima facie cases exist that Westpac through its subsidiary PPL:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) obtained financial advantage by deception as contained in Section 82 of the Victorian Crimes Act 1958, as amended, and which has been duplicated in the NSW Crimes Act 1990, as amended, and other relevant Acts, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) committed related offences dealing with false accounting,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) further, in this regard, that a strong prima facie case exists that the author of the Allen Allen &amp;Hemsley letters has committed a transgression of the criminal law relating to aiding and abetting a criminal offence and/or being an accessory after the fact of a criminal offence and being guilty of a conspiracy relating to these activities, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) believes that these and other allegations concerning bank malpractice are of such gravity as to warrant a full judicial inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>I will come to the question of a royal commission in a moment. Let us look at the behaviour of the law firm. There are two Westpac letters: the first one essentially describes the management debacle or the mismanagement debacle that was known as the foreign loans or Swiss loans fiasco. It describes its magnitude in detail, but it then goes on to acknowledge the fact that the people who were victims of this process-it almost boasts that the victims of this process-will not be able to get just outcomes because they will not know, first of all, what a treasure-trove of information is available to them if they can get their hands on them; that is what they will not know. The second letter actually acknowledges that they will be so devastated by the outcomes of this experience, so destroyed financially, emotionally, maritally and domestically, that it is highly unlikely that many of them will respond anyway and, if they do, the costs of responding will be so massive that it is unlikely they will push right through to the High Court-the final court of appeal. They will not have the strength to do it. These documents actually say that. </PARA>
<PARA> They say to Westpac, `Don't panic. All will be well. These poor, weakened individuals will not be able to pursue a course of justice'. But they go further than that and say, `If they do, or if they show signs of doing so, or before they do, let's do certain things to them. Let's call them in and sweeten them with concessions'-that is what they are called; I would use the term `bribes' but in the letters they are referred to as concessions-`and in exchange for these concessions, let's extract from them exemptions from legal action, releases from legal action'. In some cases they actually extracted from them non-disclosure clauses-in other words, `We won't tell people what is happening. If we do, we will be breaking our agreement or our contract not to disclose what has happened to us'. This is actually suggested as a strategy by the law firm Allen Allen and Hemsley. That is aiding and abetting; that is being an accessory after the fact; that is a crime in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Senate is not prepared to acknowledge it as a crime, if this Parliament is not prepared to accept it as a crime, if the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is not prepared to accept it as a crime and if the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is not prepared to acknowledge it for what it is, we have got problems. Not only have we got a sick banking system but also we have a gutless parliament, and that means problems of enormous dimensions. I am waiting to hear what the Government and the Opposition in this place have to say about these problems. I would anticipate that they are likely to say that there is a bank inquiry in progress and to leave it in the hands of the bank inquiry. It has taken us 2 1/2 years to get a bank inquiry. </PARA>

I would argue that that bank inquiry is under-resourced; it has the wrong terms of reference; and it does not have the expertise to render adequate analysis of the problem that is all of a sudden before it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not doubt the efficacy of the inquiry at all; that is not the point. But only a royal commission will put before the Australian people in a non-politicised way the realities of this mess. The inquiry will eventually deliver to the Parliament a report which will be politicised in the same way as the evidence that I have brought into this chamber for 2 1/2 years has been politicised. Now it cannot be politicised any more because I do not believe the Australian people will allow that to happen. I think they will demand that this Parliament react to it objectively. I think they will be absolutely staggered if this Parliament does not give it any more than an hour and a half's debate. Frankly, I believe that they should be disgusted, they should be frightened, if this Parliament does not give it more than an hour and a half's debate eventually, but I might be premature in judging that. The words of Ansely Rothschild ring in my ears, `Give me the power to create credit and I care not who makes the laws of the land'. That should be ringing in the ears of every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to spend a couple of moments on Mr Fowler's response to all this. He responded in two ways. He went before the bank inquiry in a special sitting last Thursday, withdrew all the injunctions and declared that Westpac was in a mood of cooperation, and that it had always been. He actually put together a statement which essentially was directed at me and said certain things that suggested that people like me were involved in a campaign timed to correspond with the commencement of the inquiry. What a stupid comment to make! Of course it was timed to correspond with the inquiry. He said that it had been conducted by certain journalists. Thank heavens for them-the brave journalists like the Ann Lampes of this world who were prepared to confront injunctions week after week, and who believe in a free press. Those people came together in the best interests of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fowler talked about interest groups. Do honourable senators know the interest group he is describing? It is the Foreign Borrowers Association, the people who were decimated by this process of greed. Of course they are an interest group. It would be impossible to imagine anybody who should have a more profound interest. </PARA>
<PARA> He said that others were prepared to traffic in stolen documents. `Traffic in stolen documents'-what an emotive phrase. I say to Mr Fowler: I do not know whether the documents are stolen or not. I could not care less whether they are stolen or not. I know they are authentic because the authenticity has never been challenged. I know what they say. They say what is in the motion before this chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that I have an obligation to bring those documents into this place. What am I supposed to do-shred them, eat them? What are elected representatives supposed to do with documents like this? Trafficking in stolen documents! Do honourable senators know what these documents are about? They are about stolen money; moneys stolen from ordinary Australians and trafficked in foreign currencies in the most sophisticated and effective way. What hypocrisy!</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fowler goes on to make equally empty observations but the gem is at the end. I do not know whether honourable senators saw him on the television and heard his closing line when he said, `The figures speak for themselves'. He highlighted the fact that there had been no bankruptcy notices issued and only 10 matters where action had been taken in respect of security, only three of which have resulted in the sale of secure properties. All he was citing there was the effectiveness of the strategy put together by Allen Allen and Hemsley, conspiring with Australia's bank which we are supposed to be able to bank on-Westpac-to destroy the interests of ordinary Australians. He argues that it was less than 100. I could not give a damn, Mr Fowler, if it was one or a hundred or a thousand; it is irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> The realities are that he was citing there the effectiveness of this conspiracy against ordinary Australians; he was citing there the impotence of ordinary Australians to get justice before the courts; he was citing there the fact that their sweeteners, their concessions, their exemptions from legal action and their non-disclosure clauses had worked. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Sunday, he had the most unmitigated gall, when being interviewed about all this on the Business Sunday program to quote me as a referee. He said, `If you want to see how clean Westpac is, you hear what McLean had to say about Westpac'. He said that in the last two years, in all the material I have tabled in this place, Westpac is the cleanest bank. He quoted me as his referee. How about that for hypocrisy!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the motion that Senator McLean gave notice of two days ago. I indicate that I will not be supporting the motion because of paragraph (b) which calls for a full judicial inquiry. I believe it is the Government's view that such an inquiry at this stage is unnecessary, because we do have a full inquiry into the banking industry being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. We also have, in view of some of the matters arising from the Westpac documents dealing with the cost of justice, an inquiry being conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. So in the inquiries of two committees of this Parliament there is plenty of scope with the evidence before us for those matters to be dealt with. At this stage I am not willing to support the resolution because of paragraph (b).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I concede that if people are dissatisfied with the recommendations that come from those two inquiries they can then quite legitimately come back into this place-and I am sure Senator McLean would-and ask for a full judicial or some other sort of inquiry if they believe that the material relating to the Westpac documents has not been properly dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to spend some time on the aspect that I am most interested in, which is the cost of justice. I believe these documents, the Westpac documents, give irrefutable evidence. As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I must say that we have been very keen on our inquiry into the cost of justice. This is the first time that we have had before us irrefutable evidence from a senior legal source stating that one way in which one can defeat people in this country in their proper rights for justice is to use the high cost of the legal system. </PARA>
<PARA> In all the evidence that we have had so far there have been assertions and speculation that that is the case. But here it is in these documents; that one of the defence mechanisms that Westpac has been advised to use by its legal advisers-from one of the most senior firms in the land-is to rely on the high cost of justice, the high cost of court proceedings, to scare people out of their proper rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that when the Senate Committee inquiry started, I had a suspicion-a gut feeling-that the legal system in this country was being perverted by a high cost; that people were being denied justice. But now we have got before us clear evidence that this is a tactic of the system. I hope that our Committee in its deliberations and final conclusions can bring forward recommendations that deal with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already raised with the Chairman of our Committee and other members of the Committee that I believe it would be very proper for our Committee to ask Mr Jones, who wrote the Westpac documents, to come before the Committee and give evidence to the content of them. The Committee would also ask representatives of the various law societies, the Law Council of Australia and the Bar Council to come before us and give evidence about the lack of ethics contained in these documents. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Westpac documents that have now been incorporated in the Hansard after some debate for some days and are now publicly available I want to draw attention to the evidence that I am most interested in at the moment. On pages 6 and 7 Mr Jones prepares conclusions, which I just quote to give the flavour:</PARA>
<PARA>1. According to PPL's own documents, PPL:</PARA>
<PARA> told clients it would do a professional management job;</PARA>
<PARA> told clients that it would adopt a conservative, `when in doubt, hedge' approach to risk management. </PARA>
<PARA>2. PPL's own documents acknowledge that:</PARA>
<PARA> PPL did neither of these things; and</PARA>
<PARA>this failure caused loss which would not otherwise have been incurred. </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on with clear-cut evidence and admission by Mr Jones, on behalf of Westpac, that PPL did not carry out its responsibilities, as it said it would. It then says on page 7:</PARA>
<PARA>9.  Clients will be slow to commence action because of:</PARA>
<PARA> The breadth of the exclusion clause in the Power of Attorney will deter clients (who don't know of the deal switching and point taking and the damaging PPL documents) from commencing action;</PARA>
<PARA> their lack of knowledge of how damaging PPL's documents are; the lack of success of OCL actions to date;-</PARA>
<PARA>and the final point-</PARA>
<PARA> the high costs involved. </PARA>
<PARA>10. Given 9 and given full-time hands-on management by a suitable executive having total responsibility, suitably supported by state managers, it should be possible to keep liability at a manageable level. </PARA>
<PARA>Just to emphasise the point in these documents, on page 12 in conclusions 9 and 10, Mr Jones again goes through in more detail the defence mechanisms and the defence strategy that should be adopted. In conclusion 9 the fourth point titled `The High Costs Involved' reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Many borrowers (particularly in these troubled times) are not flush with cash and they would doubtlessly perceive that PPL would defend proceedings grimly. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, no doubt that is correct; that the borrowers, the ordinary citizens of Australia-and some of them may be quite wealthy-would realise that with their experience or understanding of the law that a Westpac-run organisation, with its unlimited resources compared to theirs, would be able to take them to every form of court and legal action to defend the position and wear them down because of the costs. </PARA>
<PARA> That is justice denied. It means that our system where everybody is supposed to be equal before the law does not apply. If one is rich in this country, one gets away with it; but if one is poor then one either goes broke or goes to gaol. I believe that these documents expose the legal profession in this country, because this is not some grubby little country solicitor at the back of Oonagallaby; this is a document written by a senior member of one of Australia's leading legal firms. This is the practice that we all have had an assumption on but now we have the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Today when I was asked to speak in this debate I decided that I would try to find out just what are the ethics of the legal profession. I asked my office in Adelaide to contact the Law Society of South Australia to give us the details of what are the ethics for solicitors to act on in Australia or in South Australia. My secretary reports that the conversation went something like this:</PARA>
<PARA>Can you tell me whether the Law Society has a codified set of ethics for lawyers?</PARA>
<PARA>The Law Society has copies of rules of conduct for the profession-they cost $5. What exactly are you wanting to know about?</PARA>
<PARA>We are just interested in seeing a copy, how can we get one?</PARA>
<PARA>I can't sell you one because they're only for qualified solicitors. </PARA>
<PARA>Why is that?</PARA>
<PARA>I can't answer that, I'll have to put you through to someone else.</PARA>
<PARA>So my research officer went through to somebody else and the conversation went something like this:</PARA>
<PARA>I'm wondering how we can obtain a copy of the Law Society's rules of conduct?</PARA>
<PARA>We sell them for $5 but they are only available to members of the profession. </PARA>
<PARA>Why is that?</PARA>
<PARA>I can't tell you that. </PARA>
<PARA>Why not?</PARA>
<PARA>It's just the way it's always been. </PARA>
<PARA>Do you know why?</PARA>
<PARA>No. I'll have to get someone else to call you back. </PARA>
<PARA> At the last count there had not been a call back. I find it astonishing that the profession which claims to be one of the pre-eminent professions in this country, which claims that in every sense it is the custodian of justice for people, refuses to give a copy of its own ethics to members of the public, even if they are willing to pay $5. If there is a case to end so-called self-regulation of the legal profession in this country, that little snippet proves it beyond doubt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that if we get into jokes about lawyers we will be here all night because those jokes are endless and reflect the cynicism of the Australian public about the way this profession has acted in a high-handed manner without any feeling that it was responsible to the community. I suppose the other side of it is that it is often said that doctors bury their mistakes and lawyers gaol theirs. We have all heard those sorts of comments. They are jokes within the community; they may be unfair but they reflect the feelings of ordinary citizens that they do not get a fair go in the way the law is structured and operated in this country. That was the reaction of the Law Society of South Australia to a query about the ethics of lawyers so that I could check whether Mr Jones, the lawyer who wrote the Westpac documents, was acting ethically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Through the Department of The Parliamentary Library I was finally able to get a copy of the New South Wales solicitors manual. After reading this in a cursory way, and not being a lawyer and not understanding every legal concept, I must say that, if this manual is fair dinkum, the Law Society should now be acting to take Mr Jones before its disciplinary body because on so many accounts I believe there is a prima facie case that he has acted contrary to the ethics of the Law Society of New South Wales as laid out in its manual. I will quote some of the sections of that manual. Firstly, under the heading `Acceptance of Instructions-The Solicitor's Retainer':</PARA>
<PARA>The lawyer is not the mere ``mouthpiece'' of his or her client, nor the champion of the client's cause at all costs. There must be found, in the blending of professional independence and professional responsibility, a balance between unqualified loyalty to the legitimate service of a client's interest and the unreserved adoption of a client's cause in defiance of the law or its just administration . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is the start of the acceptance that no lawyer has the right to act utterly on behalf of a client no matter what. Further on, under the heading `The solicitor's paramount duty to the court':</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst the solicitor's duty is to avoid any circumstances in which the solicitor might serve any other interest (including his own) which might conflict with that of the client, the solicitor's duty is limited by boarder principles of policy in the public interest. The solicitor's duty, as a officer of the court, to avoid any action which might mislead the court is a primary limitation on the duty owed to the client. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a quotation from Lord Reid in Rondel v. Worsley in 1969. Further on:</PARA>
<PARA>Counsel must not mislead the court, he must not lend himself to casting aspersions on the other party or witnesses for which there is no sufficient basis in the information in his possession, he must not withhold authorities or documents which may tell against his clients but which the law or the standards of his profession require him to produce. </PARA>
<PARA>It is all there. What was Mr Jones doing when he was preparing these documents? Did he ever think to read this, or even have it in the back of his mind? Further in this section about the solicitor's paramount duty to the court, Mr Justice McTiernan, a distinguished judge of the High Court of Australia in years gone by, said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that it was a proposition which admitted of no debate that a solicitor for a party in an action was not at liberty to employ whatever tactics he thought might contribute to his client's success. A solicitor like anybody else was liable to be prosecuted if with the object of winning the case he did anything which was a criminal offence. As a solicitor he had an additional and particular responsibility. His professional status, which he derived from being accredited by the court as a fit and proper person to practise, laid upon him the strict obligation not to interfere or attempt to interfere with the course of justice under any pretext. If he violated that duty he was guilty of professional misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a clear prima facie case in these documents that this solicitor, Mr Jones, broke that particular professional ethic. Further on in this same section:</PARA>
<PARA>Fabrication of evidence, coaching to induce false evidence, hinting at the results which certain evidence will induce with the expectation that it will be altered, interviewing witnesses together, so as to induce agreement must be a departure from the solicitor's duty as an officer of the court. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether this evidence has been fabricated, but clearly an attempt was made to produce evidence to scare customers of Westpac from proceeding because of the documents that had been produced. Another section of the same document is headed `Acting honestly in the service of a client':</PARA>
<PARA>Solicitors are not entitled, in the service of their client's interests, to ignore their other responsibilities imposed by the law and the ethics and conventions of their profession. The fairness and honesty which should mark solicitors' dealings with the courts, should also characterise solicitors' dealings with one another. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, this was absolutely thrown out of the window if the Westpac documents are true. The section goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>A solicitor should not assist a client in the commission of an illegal act. </PARA>
<PARA>Reading this I have to say there is a prima facie case that Mr Jones was guilty of assisting a client, namely, Westpac, in the commission of an illegal act. The section goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>It is consistent with a solicitor's duty to his or her client that a solicitor should thoroughly advise the client on questions of law and their interpretation which are relevant to the client's business and on which the client seeks advice. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that the advice Mr Jones was giving was not about the ethics of the responsibilities of Westpac within the legal system; it was how to avoid being caught and having to pay damages to people who had been misled in their business dealings with Westpac. Where were Mr Jones's thoughts as a senior lawyer in consideration of this section which, as I say, is about acting honestly in the service of a client? Further in the same document under the heading `The professional adviser and criminal complicity' Mr Justice McHugh is quoted:</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to point out that a person charged as an aider and abetter will be guilty if that person has knowledge of the ``factual matters which constitute the breach of the law''.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say, reading these documents, that a prima facie case exists. The section goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>A professional adviser whose advise aids the commission of an offence may be guilty of aiding and abetting . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What was Mr Jones doing other than advising? It is all here in this document about the ethics of how the profession should act. Further on:</PARA>
<PARA>On the question of participation in the commission of an offence, McHugh J noted that a person may be liable as an aider and abetter if that person's conduct is ``knowingly directed to the purpose which the principal has pursued and is likely to bring about or render more likely the attainment of that purpose''. </PARA>
<PARA>We know what the purpose was; it is in the document. It was to cheat people of their legal rights. I draw the attention of the Senate to this document which, as I said before, is the New South Wales solicitors manual. </PARA>
<PARA> If the legal profession which, in appearing before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, has argued the high cost of justice, is fair dinkum in its view that there is no need for government regulation of the ethics of its profession and its activities-leave it all to them-in the very near future the disciplinary committee of the New South Wales Law Society, in line with that society's manual, should take on Mr Jones and ask him to explain the action that he has taken in advising Westpac how to avoid justice for the ordinary people who dealt with that bank. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the days in which this community can say that the legal profession is entitled to unfettered self-regulation have come to an end following what has occurred in Australia in recent years in the legal profession, which has been hand in glove with commercial organisations to ensure that corporate Australia avoids as much tax as possible and avoids normal and commonsense responsibilities to the community. I am delighted that one of the measures mentioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his statement yesterday, which I do not think has received as much recognition as it should, is that he is writing to every State Premier asking that the existing exemptions of the Trade Practices Act come to an end and that the professions, which, under the Constitution of Australia, are regulated overwhelmingly by State laws, come under the powers of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the legal profession should be the one to be first considered in this regard. That would be a major step forward for justice in this community because at long last we may be able to begin the road back to showing the ordinary citizens of Australia that the legal system works for them and not for the lawyers. That is a very important issue that our community, our Parliament and the State parliaments will have to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the Senate that, whenever I have made public statements or I have been interviewed on radio or television about the high cost of justice, I have been astonished at the number of letters and telephone calls that I have received in my office from people from all over Australia who have some of the most dreadful tales to tell of how they have been robbed of their rights by the law, and incompetent legal operations and who find that they have no redress. When they try to get redress through the legal profession because a particular lawyer has not acted properly or has not conducted a case properly, they find it is almost impossible to get action taken to do so. On no issue since I have been in public life have I come across such a response from the public of Australia as I have whenever I have raised the issue of the high cost of justice or the way the system is working. </PARA>

<PARA> Micro-economic reform is a fashionable phrase used by those on all sides in this Parliament. We all support it. During the past few years blue collar workers, semi-skilled workers and white collar workers in industry have been taking the pain and making industry more efficient. Some have lost their jobs; some have been retrained; and some have had to go to other jobs. They have suffered the pain. But when we raise issues about getting a more efficient legal system in this country by changing it, we immediately get attacked by the legal profession, which says that we are trying to fiddle with the system of justice and that they and only they know what justice is about. It is an absolute fallacy. It must be met head on. </PARA>
<PARA> We must insist, if we are fair dinkum about micro-economic reform, that the legal profession can no longer be left unfettered to go about its business in the way it is at the moment. If we want an efficient economy, the legal profession must contribute. Legal costs represent a big cost for any business. If we want to reduce the cost for a business, we should reduce its legal costs. One way to reduce those legal costs is to reorganise the legal system and open up the restrictive practices in that system. The restrictive practices that applied to the Waterside Workers Federation and to the Seamen's Union of Australia for 30 or 40 years are kindergarten stuff by comparison with those in the legal profession. The most restrictive practices in any area of commercial activity and industrial activity in this country are in the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA> When I suggest to lawyers that this is unfair, they accuse me or others of attacking the whole system of justice. That is wrong. I think that the citizens of this country, not just the lawyers, have a right to demand a better legal system where they know they will get a fair go and not be taken down by a legal system that is structured to ensure that lawyers' incomes are maintained at a high level. </PARA>
<PARA> A survey conducted in February last year by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that lawyers have the highest salaries of any profession. Of any profession surveyed, the salaries of those in the legal profession were shown to be 50 per cent higher those in the next profession. Why? Because they have restrictive trade. People have limited access to it. The profession does not allow advertising of fees, and so on. Every effort is made to ensure that that profession does not have to be responsible or to justify its charges. </PARA>
<PARA> When we asked the Chairman of the Victorian Law Society how the charging of legal fees was arrived at, he said that a committee consisting of eight people, seven of whom were legal practitioners, set them. That committee recommended to a subcommittee of the State Supreme Court. Three Supreme Court justices then looked at their recommendations, considered them and brought down a determination. When I asked how widely the costs were published and what that meant, he said, `Most of us couldn't understand it anyway'. When I asked him whether he thought it was reasonable for reasons to be given for the setting of legal fees at certain levels, he said, `Of course that is not given. It is a document of a couple of pages'. No justification is given, as is the case with other workers. Even politicians have to give reasons to the Remuneration Tribunal as to why our wages should be set at certain levels. The legal profession does not have to do that. It sets the fees in-house, and that is it. If the legal profession believes that that will go on in Australia without the community becoming extremely cynical about the operation of the profession, both the profession and Senator Macdonald are sadly mistaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I do not support this motion because at this stage, with two committees of inquiry of this Parliament, I do not believe that a judicial committee is needed, but I have to say that the evidence in the Westpac documents proves that, irrespective of what Westpac as a banking organisation is about, the legal profession is aiding and abetting the robbing of ordinary citizens; and it has to come to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is the responsibility of this Parliament and the State parliaments to deal with these issues and to bring major reforms to the way the profession operates so that Mr Jones and his ilk are forced to carry out the ethics of their own profession which they themselves have documented but which they themselves now ignore to the great cost of ordinary citizens of Australia. I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and look forward to the deliberations of the two parliamentary committees and their recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean's motion for a royal commission into banking is a disturbing one to have before this chamber. Among other things, it asks us to note that a bank abandoned its fiduciary obligation to its clients; advantaged itself at the expense of its clients; and was involved in false accounting and deception. It also asks us to note that one of Australia's significant law firms conspired to obstruct just outcomes to the bank's clients; aided and abetted a criminal offence; and is guilty of a conspiracy. They are the assertions and the quite clear allegations that have been put down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the type of motion that one would expect to uncover in Baghdad, not in Canberra. Just as disturbing is the Government's decision to set this time aside for the motion to be debated here this evening. There is another agenda for that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are devious. You dig your own political grave, my friend.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DU4">Senator OLSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I allowed Senator McLean to give his contribution uninterrupted and I ask for the same courtesy in response. The Government has its own agenda-something to which I will refer in a moment. I speak, obviously, to oppose the motion, which we consider both substantially out of order and ill-timed. Ill-timed is the point I want to make. Banks may not be the flavour of the month or the year or even the decade. There is in many areas substantive reason to take that view. But Senator McLean has set himself up, I believe, as judge and jury and has designs on widening that to include the role of the Senate to be judge and jury. We will have no part of that. No one on this side of the chamber-certainly I will not-will ever champion the actions of a bank when that bank has been proved through due judicial process to have been guilty of financial mismanagement or fraudulent decisions. But nor will we ever become part of an emotional lynch mob taking justice into our own hands. That, unfortunately, is what I believe the motion seeks to make senators of Australia do. This is an attempt this evening to force a judicial inquiry with assertions as have been included in the motion to which I have already referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We were against the tabling in the Senate of the Westpac Banking Corporation documents, not because of any view that Westpac should be protected from public disclosure of its actions, but because the case against Westpac was sub judice and a court had decreed that the documents were not to be released at this point in the course of justice. The documents were and are the central issue in a number of legal cases, both recent and longstanding, before the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a time-honoured tradition, a principle, of Parliament that, while it has the right to consider any material it wishes, it does not raise sub judice matters. What Senator McLean wished us to do was to usurp the course of justice in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not be swayed from the point of view that determination of the truth of allegations against a bank or anyone is a matter for the courts, not the Senate. Taking the point further, we are against the release of the documents because it is imperative that the separation of powers be upheld in Australia. We have seen some recent instances in this country in some States where that has broken down. Once that system of the separation of powers breaks down, once Parliament begins to interfere with and negate the due processes of the courts, democracy, as we know it, is at risk in the long term because, once the gates are opened, once the principle is broken, it is difficult to contain. It is a dangerous and damaging precedent for which no-one, I hope, on this side of the chamber would wish to be responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, throughout what is now known to everyone as the Westpac affair, Senator McLean has shown no regard at all for the upholding of the separation of powers or the upholding of either the judicial or parliamentary processes. This motion indicates that he has no trust in how the parliamentary process operates. That is what his actions today and in past weeks have shown. It is, without exaggeration, an almost daily public thrust of mistrust from the Senator. Otherwise, why would we have this motion before us this evening as yet another example? After all, why does Senator McLean seek to jump the gun with this motion for a full judicial inquiry-in other words, a royal commission-before he gives his three hours of evidence to the banking inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration-evidence that will be heard on Friday, a mere two days away? What does he really seek to achieve with this motion except to display no confidence in the parliamentary process of which he is part? He shows no confidence in the committee system and no confidence in our banking inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DU4">Senator OLSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to Senator Powell that we have a committee of this Parliament investigating this very matter and Senator McLean will appear before it. I understand that three hours have been allocated to him this Friday to put all this evidence before that Committee. That being the case, why are we debating this motion here and now? The Senate has absolutely no specifics, no judicial decisions, against Westpac or any other bank before us today to indicate that a royal commission is warranted at this time. The time for such motions, if somewhat less emotionally framed, I might add, from anyone is after the banking inquiry reports to the Parliament; after a committee of this Parliament has done its job thoroughly, effectively and efficiently, has taken evidence from all witnesses, of which Senator McLean will be one, and has reported to the Parliament-not when the inquiry is in its infancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not at all meant to indicate that I want to whitewash the reported actions of Westpac; far from it. But it is up to the courts to make the determination that the bank has failed in its responsibilities and to administer justice for any failure of those responsibilities. That is what they are there for. It is not what we are here for. </PARA>
<PARA> To pass Senator McLean's motion would be to say to all Australians that this Parliament has lost not only its respect, but its trust, for the country's legal system. That is quite clearly wrong and, I think, an outrageous assumption to make and to enjoin others to make. That is what the motion seeks to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there has been some confusion in the Senator's role and responsibilities with regard to the law. It is not up to the Senator to decide and to declare that Westpac's lawyers have broken the law and conspired to obstruct outcomes to clients. In my view, that is an abuse of parliamentary privilege and it does little in the community to enhance the already somewhat tattered reputation of politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> We live in a civilised society. We do not condemn without trial and without evidence being put before an appropriate court. It saddens me that Senator McLean has become so overwhelmed with the Westpac affair that he has forgotten what I believe is such a basic principle of justice. But it must not be forgotten that it is similarly regrettable that some former employees of Westpac appear to have forgotten the principles of banking. But surely all banks and all those employed by banking organisations do not summarily stand condemned for the alleged actions of some. However, that conclusion seems to be the tenor of the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> There will always be rotten apples in every basket, be it of politicians, lawyers, businessmen, policemen, bankers or whatever. But do we brand all as unclean in retaliation for the reported actions of a few? I hope not. I hope we never get to that position in this country. I hope that all senators hope not. This sweeping and damaging motion tells me that I am mistaken. </PARA>
<PARA> This takes me to the Government's decision to allow the motion to be debated. The Government's agenda is to make banks look bad in the public eye at every opportunity. This evening is just another opportunity. Absolutely anything that is anti-banking is all right with the Government, so it is quite happy to allow a motion to be debated which furthers that aim. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has over the past few years taken bank bashing to an art form. Aided by his colleagues, he has used every media opportunity to attempt to convey the impression that the financial woes of Australia and Australians should be laid at the doors of the banks, not at the feet of the Federal Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> When his bankrupting, single-minded, tunnel visioned, high interest rate policy ripped through Australia's small business community he said it was the greedy banks' fault for not dropping interest rates fast enough, just as it was the uncaring banks' fault when they moved in to foreclose on collapsed businesses. When mortgagee sales festooned the suburbs it was again the banks' fault for not taking interest rates down when they could, or as much as they could, and for lending too much to their big customers at the expense of the small. Treasurer Keating's ongoing battle of words with the National Australia Bank's Nobby Clark, now Chairman of the State Bank of South Australia, laid bare this Government's determination that the banks must be painted all that is bad in a vain attempt to shift economic blame. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the last Federal election in my home State of South Australia, Labor's Peter Duncan in the very marginal mortgage belt seat of Makin ran a masterly anti-bank strategy. On the face of it, it was on behalf of his struggling constituents, but actually it was on behalf of his struggling Government. That strategy was repeated across Australia in similar problem marginal seats. It is what we have come to expect from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I am no apologist for banks. Their failure to react in 1987 to the implications of the share market crash has contributed enormously to their present problems, but the failure of Treasurer Keating in 1985 to recognise the difficulties and the temptations that deregulation would create for our banks in competition with foreign banks is really when the seeds of today's troubles were sown. The credit explosion that grew from deregulation and the fear that our trading banks had of losing their market share to foreign banks was largely translated into consumption. Enormous risks were taken to stay competitive, not just by our trading banks but also by our State banks chasing the deregulation pot of gold. We have all seen what happened to State banks when they tried to compete in the deregulation big league. It was a monumental blunder that with deregulation did not come a far more comprehensive system of prudential supervision for State banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Compulsory guidelines for reporting to the Reserve Bank of Australia were a necessary major step; not voluntary ones, as have failed so miserably with Victoria and South Australia. Treasurer Keating changed the game, but in his mode of self-congratulation he did not pay attention to changing the small print in the rules, and the banks and the taxpayers of Australia are now suffering as a result. As a South Australian concerned for more than two years about reported losses of the State Bank, I have had difficulty coming to terms with the Reserve Bank's assertion that it had known of problems with the bank through its voluntary reporting, but that it was under no obligation to inform the Treasurer or the bank's owner-the Premier of South Australia-or, in fact, to do anything about it. That may have been the simple, uncomplicated way things happened in the simple, uncomplicated days before deregulation, but the fact that a Treasurer and the Reserve Bank continued to allow it to happen after deregulation must be called into question. </PARA>
<PARA> Since deregulation, Australia should have implemented prudential requirements similar to those overseas where the Reserve Bank could make direct inspections and examinations of individual institutions. This would have allowed accurate information to be gathered on whether prudential standards, including a minimum capital ratio and a minimum liquidity ratio, were being observed, and whether management control systems were being followed and were operated efficiently. Still it seems that we do not learn from mistakes. While the Reserve Bank, through changes to the Banking Act, now has the power to make regular examinations of banks' books, it has indicated that it does not intend to use it except in special and exceptional circumstances. How special do State bank failures have to be to warrant change, warrant inspection and warrant action?</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, the blame for some reaction and action since deregulation can be apportioned to banks and big business, but the blame for the prudential standards failure, for Australia's economic policy and economic ills, and the pain of the high interest rate policy, belongs solely to Canberra and Treasurer Keating. In relation to the prudential requirements, what we ought to be seeing put in place is a very comprehensive range of standards, properly and effectively followed through. The prudential standards as we know them cover the provision of information and regular discussion with management boards and management systems being put in place, but the specific aspects of those prudential standards, guidelines and requirements ought to be capital adequacy and adequate liquidity in those banks, lending investment policies, subsidiaries and the raising of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, some State banks, in their rush to be part of the big league banking industry of this country, have got it wrong in taking on risk areas that were beyond their capacity and ability to manage effectively and efficiently. As a result, we have seen in Victoria, for example, the taxpayers of Australia-through the Commonwealth Bank of Australia-becoming involved in a privatisation move to bale out the State Bank of Victoria. In the State Bank of South Australia, through an interchange of funds-creative accounting, I think one would call it-$1 billion has been invested at an annual cost of over $100m a year to the taxpayers of that State. It will further erode the competitiveness of South Australia vis-a-vis the other States. For a small State depending on its manufacturing base for its economy and its job opportunities, it is a sad blow because it removes and pegs back any gains of the past in terms of seeking to get into a position where it can compete in manufacturing with other States. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the drift to the eastern seaboard of Australia away from South Australia. We want to halt that drift and get it back so that South Australia as a State can continue to grow and prosper with its outstanding standard of living, and maintain within it a good manufacturing base for job opportunities for South Australians of the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return specifically to the proposal before the Senate. It is a motion clearly stating that the Senate should be judge and jury of the actions of another when, in fact, those matters are currently before the courts and when, in fact, that subject is before a committee of this Parliament. I repeat that Senator McLean has the opportunity only this Friday to appear for three hours before the banking inquiry, to put all the evidence he has at his disposal-and it would appear that he has significant and substantial evidence-before the House of House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for that Committee to make a judgment on it and report to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The bank bashing that we have seen by the Government may deflect a few blows in the short term, but it is an underhand strategy and it is wearing thin. In my view, that strategy is the reason the Government allowed Senator McLean's motion to be debated this evening. It does the Government no credit. I do not believe that it is timely for this chamber to be debating a motion of this nature when, as I have said, the matter is before the courts and before a committee of this Parliament. When that Committee has completed its deliberations and reported will be the appropriate time for further consideration along the lines proposed by Senator McLean's motion. At this stage this side of the chamber will not support the motion. </PARA>

<TITLE>Australian Democrats: Industrial Relations</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.32)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some concern that I bring to the attention of the Senate this evening a report of the forthcoming appearance by the Australian Democrats before the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). It was reported in the Australian last week that Senator McLean will be appearing before the ACTU executive tomorrow. He confirmed with me this evening that this meeting is taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apparently, Senator McLean, the Australian Democrats' spokesman on industrial relations, will be briefing Mr Bill Kelty and Mr Martin Ferguson and others about the Democrats' industrial relations policies. Let me say at the outset that there is nothing wrong with the Democrats briefing special interest lobby groups. Let us face it, there are few lobbies as powerful as the ACTU. As Martin Ferguson has said in his inimitable phrase, `The ACTU is part and parcel of the Hawke Government'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats, as I will indicate, have already been of great assistance to this Government with its industrial relations policies. I wonder whether the Australian Democrats are not about to make the same mistake on industrial relations as they made in relation to their policies on foreign relations. Are we going to see a sell-out of the real interests of the Australian people once again?</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling that the Australian Democrats paid a heavy price for their opposition to the United Nations (UN) endorsed forces in the Gulf. The voter support for the Democrats has virtually collapsed since the last election, falling from around 17 per cent to around 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell's statements on the Gulf-which by and large were more noted for their unthinking anti-Americanism-did not provide any assurances to Democrat voters wanting a more reasoned and carefully considered response. Potential Australian Democrats voters, like all Australians, resiled in horror from the statement made by former Democrat Leader, Janine Haines, that she was prepared to `grovel' if necessary on her self-initiated mission to the bloody dictator, Saddam Hussein. I hope we are not going to see another example of grovelling tomorrow at ACTU headquarters. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the industrial relations approach taken by Senator Powell and Senator McLean, the interests of workers and the men and women who run small businesses have been sacrificed to the ambitions of union bosses. As I have pointed out in this chamber before on a number of occasions, some two-thirds of Australian Democrats voters supported Australia being part of the United States (US) led forces in the Gulf. The leadership of the Australian Democrats was out of touch not only with the Australian people but also with its own voters. Similarly, in the area of industrial relations the Democrats do not seem to understand that over 60 per cent of people who describe themselves as Australian Democrat supporters believe trade unions have too much power. Similarly, Australian Democrats should remember that over 85 per cent of Australians believe employers should have the right to take legal action against unions which indulge in intimidatory tactics. Yet Senator Powell and Senator McLean consistently support policies which reinforce the power and privilege of trade union bosses. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not cause me great distress to witness the decline of the Australian Democrats. It would be hypocritical of me to suggest otherwise. But I do see great dangers in the attitude of the Australian Democrats to industrial relations and their willingness to support the interests of the trade union bosses against trade union members and the interests of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no secret that members of the trade union movement are now contemplating in their eyes the unthinkable-a coalition government. Every attempt will be made to frustrate the resounding mandate that John Hewson led coalition forces will receive at the next election. In the dying days of this Government do not be surprised if we see legislation designed to buttress the power and privileges of the trade union bosses before a coalition government comes into office. Already there are rumours of the establishment of a labour court, which may restrict common law actions against unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The support of the Australian Democrats will be vital if this type of legislation is to go through the Parliament-absolutely vital. It is equally well known that the trade union bosses see the Democrats after the next election as playing a vital role in blocking industrial relations reforms which will be introduced by a coalition government should the Australian Democrats hold the balance of power in this chamber; legislation, it might be added, which will have the resounding mandate of the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are clearly not the same party that they were under the leadership of their founder, Don Chipp. In those days the Democrats were known as vigorous supporters of small business. That is why the Democrats opposed the repeal of section 45d of the Trade Practices Act, which outlawed secondary boycotts. The Government attempted to remove this fundamental right in the Trade Practices Amendment Bill of 1984. Section 45d has been of enormous importance in containing the excesses of union power. It is a section which has afforded great protection to small business and forced the trade union movement to submit to the rule of law in Federal courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may recall that in December 1989 Senator McLean introduced a private member's Bill purporting to provide for the right to strike. What did this Bill really seek to achieve? Under the guise of proposing ballots before strikes, a policy which we in the coalition support, the Bill aimed to remove the common law liability of unions and trade union officials. Not even the Commonwealth Government in recent years has been prepared to support such radical proposals which would have the effect of putting trade unions above the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the Australian Democrats have parted company with Don Chipp, who is on record supporting the common law right to sue trade union officials who encourage employees to break work contracts. Don Chipp, a former senator, wrote in July 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>Legal contracts are enforced in every other activity in our society and appropriate damages sought and won for any significant breaches of them. Why not in the area of industrial relations?</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that that question has ever been properly answered by the Australian Democrats under the leadership of Senator Powell. It has always been a strong principle of the Australian Democrats to oppose compulsory unionism. On a reading of the Australian Democrats platform, it is true that this principle still remains. It has to be said that their commitment to this principle is, to say the least, very suspect. In effect, it has been often ignored when the Democrats have supported Government legislation which has virtually forced individuals to join unions. </PARA>
<PARA> We recall how willingly the Democrats supported the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (1990), which is aimed at facilitating forced trade union amalgamations. This Bill also forces preference in employment to be given to union members. So much for the Australian Democrats' commitment to voluntary unionism. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, former Democrat leader Senator Chipp vigorously opposed this Bill which sought to achieve the ACTU goal of forcing amalgamations of trade unions so that only 20 mega-unions remained. This Bill required that trade unions have a minimum of 10,000 members. Just two years previously the Democrats believed that the minimum number of members of a trade union should be 1,000. What was apparently correct in 1988 did not apply in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> In fairness, it has to be said that some Democrats have remained true to their policies. Senator Lees and Senator Kernot earned the gratitude of students around Australia by joining with the coalition to defeat the Government's attempt to further entrench compulsory student unionism in its Higher Education Amendment Funding Bill (No.1) last year. Regrettably, the other Democrats, Senators Bourne, Coulter and McLean, decided to follow Senator Powell and support the Government on this oppressive legislation designed to entrench compulsory student unionism. Knowing Senator Bell's recognition of the importance of civil rights of students, I have to say that it was surprising that he voted with the Government on that particular piece of oppressive legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have shown how the Australian Democrats, by their efforts to remove common law actions against unions, by their support for union preference in employment and by their total about-turn on mega-unionism, have shown themselves to be friends not of union members but of union bosses. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other area which I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate where the Australian Democrats under Senator Powell appear to have already been unduly influenced by the ACTU. Time and time again in this chamber we have seen the irrational opposition of the Democrats to privatisation policies. This is a stance which has undoubtedly further endeared the Australian Democrats to the ACTU. The Australian Democrats probably hold the notable record of being virtually one of the only parties in government in the Western world and, undoubtedly, in the Eastern world which are vigorously opposed to any privatisation--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Brownhill" NAMEID="RD4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Brownhill for that correction. I have, before now, made that statement challenging the Australian Democrats to indicate whether there is any area of privatisation-perhaps a little bit of contracting out-which the Australia Democrats could find it in their policies to support. Not one iota of privatisation fits into the Australian Democrats platform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my mind-and frankly I am supported by the aspirations of most Australian people in their attitude to trade unions-the Australian Democrats in recent years, under the influence of Senators Powell and McLean, have a very poor record in industrial relations. When Senator McLean emerges from his visit to the ACTU headquarters tomorrow, I hope that the media will press him on this particular question. Before I state the question, remember the great Democrats slogan about `keeping the bastards honest', that is, forcing the government of the day to keep its promises. This is a great slogan by Don Chipp which has gone down in Australian history. In other words, anyone who goes to an election on a certain policy or on a certain promise keeps that promise. That was a central principle of the Don Chipp-led Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> With that background, this is the question which Senator McLean must answer: if the electorate gives a clear mandate to a coalition government, including the right to introduce comprehensive industrial relations reforms, will the Australian Democrats guarantee to allow this policy to pass in the Senate if, by some mischance, they hold the balance of power? That is right in line with the old Democrat principle of going to an election on, for example, major industrial reforms and keeping that promise. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be very interesting when Senator McLean emerges tomorrow from his meeting with Mr Kelty and Mr Ferguson and is asked by the press to give a guarantee that a Hewson-led coalition government will be allowed to keep its promise on industrial relations. If Senator McLean refuses to answer this question, clearly the electorate will know that the Democrats have sold out to ACTU bosses. I guarantee that every voter in every electorate will learn of this treachery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Normally I do not speak on parochial questions and I do not take up parish pump subjects in this place. I have been elected as a national representative, one who would speak on national questions, look at national legislation and subjects of interest around this nation. Tonight I am forced to speak on a very local question, which I find regrettable. It is with great regret that I must criticise a recent report that has been brought out by Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC). In criticising this report, I do so more in sorrow than in anger because I suppose I, among other people, can take blame for organisations such as EPAC being established. In the 1970s and early 1980s I was a member of the National Economics Platform Committee of the Australian Labor Party when proposals for organisations such as this were being examined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to comment tonight on a report recently released by EPAC which concluded that South Australia is the worst place in Australia in which to live. The report is titled Urban and Regional Trends and Issues, January 1991, Council Paper No. 46. I am sure that Senator Foreman is as interested in this subject as I am. Having lived in South Australia and elsewhere, I cannot agree with EPAC's findings and I think I am fairly well placed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In my experience, the findings of EPAC that Adelaide is the worst capital city in which to live, or South Australia is the worst State in which to live, are wrong, ridiculous and ill-informed. I think I should set the record straight tonight. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did it actually say that?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It had an index which suggested that South Australia ranked worst of the six States in terms of quality of life. For people on low to middle incomes, I believe that the report is patently wrong. Maybe EPAC's focus was on the lifestyle of the upper middle class. It is very hard to tell, because clearly quality of life has to be looked at in terms of specific groups in the community. I have no doubt in my own mind that the cities of Adelaide and Perth, and the States of South Australia, Western Australia and other smaller populated areas are probably areas where people have a much higher quality of life, despite the findings of EPAC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things that is concerning about this EPAC report is that it bases its findings mainly on statistics. One of the problems with it is that many aspects of quality of life cannot be quantified or measured and certainly cannot be expressed directly in statistics. Mr Deputy President, I am sure that you would be aware of the difficulties in trying to quantify things in terms of quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> The report points out that while Queensland, along with South Australia, similarly did not fare well in the survey, people are leaving other States to go to Queensland. On the one hand EPAC is saying that Queensland ranks very lowly in terms of quality of life, but many tens of thousands of Australians are going to make their homes in the State of Queensland. I simply put that forward as one piece of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I also suggest that people look at the weekend arrangements that Adelaidians look forward to. They do not have to sit in a car for over an hour to visit friends on another side of the city, the beach, or the Adelaide Hills; they are mere minutes away. They certainly do not have to drive for long distances to get to key recreation facilities in the Adelaide parklands. </PARA>
<PARA> Adelaide, of course, is a very well-planned city, one of the first totally planned cities in the world in terms of the central business district, nestled between the hills and the sea. It does ensure that residents do not have to spend up to half their day getting to a pleasant destination. In fact, Adelaide can be typified as the `20-minute city'. Access to most facilities is available within 20 minutes, despite the fact that it is the only city in Australia with over a million people that has no freeways. I think that is a very big achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> Adelaide, of course, has a far milder climate than some of the other southern cities in Australia. I think that can be quantified in terms of one specific factor: one does not need to own an overcoat in Adelaide. To buy a decent quality overcoat in Canberra costs many hundreds of dollars and that is a particular quality of life factor, a household budget factor, if you like, that EPAC has not quantified in comparing Adelaide, say, with Melbourne or Tasmania, which have far colder climates. Mr Deputy President, I am sure on that particular measure your State of Queensland would look even better, and certainly Western Australia as well. That is a specific factor. </PARA>
<PARA> EPAC in its analysis has not given enough weight to the cost of housing. Basically, it has looked at a number of statistical indicators and given each of them equal weighting. For example, when we look at the rate for armed robbery, it is given the same weighting as access to housing. I think that is a somewhat distorted view of quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> Most Australians still aspire to have their own home and this is a very important factor in the quality of life in this country. It is very clear from all the evidence that Adelaide has among the cheapest housing in Australia. For example, a good three-bedroom home 15 minutes from the centre of the city can still be purchased for under $90,000. That certainly would not buy anything of the same quality in Sydney or Melbourne. Adequate shelter is absolutely essential to quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who cannot afford their own home, I am sure that South Australia is the best place in which to live. It has the lowest rents by far and the highest level of public housing per capita anywhere in Australia. In fact, on the latest figures, there are 43.8 public rental dwellings per 1,000 people in South Australia compared with only 13.7 in Victoria and 19.6 in New South Wales. On one particular indicator, not really quantified by EPAC, South Australia has multiples of what is available to people in comparable circumstances in New South Wales and Victoria. For people who do not have high disposable incomes, I believe that Adelaide provides by far and away the best quality of life because it gives them the cheapest housing, either rented or owned, in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to put on the record some figures about the South Australian Housing Trust. While South Australia has the fifth largest population of the Australian States, it has the second largest number of public rental dwellings. Only New South Wales has more public rental dwellings than South Australia. In Victoria, which is the State that came out of this EPAC study ranked No. 1 with the highest alleged quality of life, the Housing Commission owns some 59,000 of the total stock of rental dwellings. In South Australia, which has a third of the population of Victoria, the Housing Trust owns 62,000 rental dwellings. As I say, Victoria was the State that EPAC mistakenly ranked as having the highest quality of life in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to look at the subject of food. Along with housing, food is absolutely essential to life. For example, in South Australia fruit is cheap and plentiful. If one looks at the prices paid for fruit in other parts of the world, it is a real luxury. The thing that is striking about South Australia is that it is still completely fruit-fly free. It is very hard to say those three words in a row, but it is still completely fruit-fly free. I know of many people who have shifted to work in Adelaide to take professional positions and so forth. They are absolutely amazed. They can sit on their veranda, pick fruit off their tree and find no fruit-flies. In South Australia we take for granted that we can grow our own fruit. We do not have any problems with fruit-fly as distinct from a number of places along the eastern seaboard. That is one of the quality of life indicators which is important to family budgets and to diet, which EPAC did not measure and probably does not even know about, for that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the subject of travel to work because this is one of the clear indicators where the smaller capital cities are offering quality of life. EPAC really did not look at this subject. Adelaidians generally travel to work for some 20 minutes, maybe 30, unlike their eastern State cousins who often have to travel for over an hour in very slow traffic or in crowded public transport to arrive at work. That is the reality in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, I am proud to say that Adelaide has no freeways-I believe that is a quality of life indicator itself-compared with other capital cities such as Melbourne which is usually in the process of building another freeway each time I visit the city. Having travelled on one particular freeway in Melbourne during peak hour traffic, I felt that the word `freeway' was not quite accurate. Bumper to bumper crawl I think would be more apt. Getting to Melbourne airport is quite an experience compared to getting to Adelaide airport. One is advised to leave the central business district an hour before departure time. In Adelaide one can do it in a fraction of the time living on the other side of the central business district from the airport. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that 20 years ago Adelaide explicitly vetoed having freeways. It was one of the far-sighted decisions made 20 years ago. We scrapped the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study, which was authored by somebody in the United States who thought we should have freeways in Adelaide. We recognised 20 years ago that cars must not be allowed to dominate the city. To this day, Adelaide remains the only city in Australia with over a million people and no freeways. We have no cloverleaves; we have no flyovers; we have no freeways spoiling river systems in metropolitan areas; and we do not have any urban scars due to freeways. I can certainly point to those in a couple of cities. Yet, despite all of that, it is still a 20-minute city. People can travel to work in 20 minutes and they can travel to recreation centres in 20 minutes-all due to very good urban planning over 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to focus specifically tonight on the health indicators in this EPAC report in terms of life quality. It looks at a range of indicators, gives them equal points, adds them up and gets an index number. One that it looks at is doctor consultations. It seems to imply that South Australia has the highest measure on this indicator called `doctor consultations'. Presumably that means that South Australia has the most consultations with general practitioners per head of population. I will take it at face value; I presume that is what it means. Some people in the community will say that it is a good thing-I might not be among them-if there is a high number of doctor consultations so that people get access to the health services they need. </PARA>
<PARA> Some others would point out that South Australia, which seems to be the highest on this index according to EPAC, has a relatively elderly population. I think one association that people would make is that South Australia has the highest average population age in Australia. They would make that sort of link. I would like to explore this EPAC analysis by referring to the report released, I think, by the Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Brian Howe, titled Medical Services Through Medicare, tabled in this place late in February. That has a very interesting analysis of access to health services. It shows the use of health services and it exposes some of the flaws in this EPAC report. On page 72 of this background paper No. 2 there is a table, No. 4, titled `Average Use of Medical Services per Person by State'. It is very contemporary. It has a summary of all Medicare services-many tens of millions of Medicare services-for 1989-1990. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting for members of parliament because it works out per capita services in every Federal electorate in Australia, which is very illuminating. For 1989-90, the Australian average for medical services per person was 8.8. South Australia, despite EPAC saying that it had the highest number, was below the national average. In this particular study by Medicare, which includes every medical service in Australia charged to Medicare, South Australia had 8.37 services per person; it did not come out on top of the index. New South Wales was by far and away the highest, with 9.8 services per person, followed by Queensland with 9.01. So two States in this very thoroughgoing and comprehensive analysis of medical services-New South Wales and Queensland-were well ahead of South Australia, despite the EPAC suggestion that South Australia was the worst. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I am doing this more in sorrow than in anger. But there I think we have exposed very tangibly a clear example put forward by EPAC. It is a fact that South Australia does have the highest average age population. Despite that, and there is a very clear association between the age of the population and use of medical services, South Australia still comes in at number three. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the Labor Government, Senator Collins. Table 5 on page 73 examines the medical services according to age group. This really demonstrates this very clear link between age and the use of medical services. For example, nationally-I have only national figures-adults aged 20 to 59 years used medical services 8.7 times on average; they had 8.7 consultations on average. For people aged 60 years and over, the average was 15.1 consultations per person. So there is quite a clear link between people's ages and the use of medical services. We all know that that is true anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Here we have a State which has clearly the highest average age in the community and, therefore, one would expect it to have the highest use of medical services per head of population. But in fact it comes in with a lower usage of services per head of population than New South Wales and Queensland. So I think, according to this particular indicator, it is very much back to the drawing board for EPAC. I think that it-or the consultants it hired-should go back and look at this analysis, because in just 10 minutes this evening I have been able to prove, and demonstrate very clearly, that one of its indicators is totally and comprehensively wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I could go on this evening about the advantages of living in South Australia. For example, I could simply refer to the lack of polluted beaches in South Australia. But I will not take up any more time of the Senate. I will simply conclude my remarks, for fear of starting a stampede south and jeopardising the best quality of life in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to delay the Senate for very long. I notice that Senator Collins is over there devouring his tie. I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate something which could be termed a parochial issue, but it is something which has affected me. In this day and age we talk about the rural recession and the droughts and floods which are affecting rural people. But there has always been one inherent danger facing rural people, and that is the danger of tractor accidents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A short while ago I was talking to Senator Brownhill, who told me that in the last week or two three tragic tractor accidents had occurred in northern New South Wales. But I wish to refer briefly to a very tragic tractor accident which occurred last Friday in my own State of Tasmania in the historic village of Oatlands. A very old friend of mine whom I went to school with, Colin Lester, was killed in that accident. This has certainly been a cause of sadness for me, but it has been a great tragedy for that small township. </PARA>
<PARA> Oatlands is situated in the centre of Tasmania. It is the centre of a great wool growing area. Naturally, Col Lester was a member of a farming family that had been in that area for quite a few years. Col had always lived on the farm and farmed his property. He was a great community man and he was the current President of the Returned Services League and Citizens Club, which included a bowls club which was almost the hub of social life in Oatlands. He had a long-time association with the parents and friends association of the Oatlands High School and he gave a lot of genuine time to the school. He was a member of the Wool Advisory Council of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association and was a very well-respected and loved person in that small community. </PARA>
<PARA> What made his death even more tragic was the fact that his son was going to be married the next day in Launceston. I must say that it was typical of the family and their spirit that that wedding went ahead on Saturday. I must say I think Col would have been proud of that. I am sure that he would also have been there in spirit. I know that his spirit and his memory will remain in that small community of Oatlands for many years to come. He was a great community man and he had great love for his family. He also had a great love for golf-it was one of his great loves in life. His wife, Helen, was a member of the State golf team at one stage. I would like to put on the record my sincere sympathy for his wife, Helen, their family and all of their friends in Oatlands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly will not detain the Senate long on the issues that have been canvassed tonight. I thought Senator Maguire's defence, despite his sadness, of his home State was admirable. The only thing I must say I have had difficulty with in his home city of Adelaide is the water supply there. I really do not know how Senator Maguire could defend that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I was not aware that there had been a further tragic tractor accident in Tasmania. I certainly feel for Senator Calvert and the friend that he has lost from that accident, and for the family. But the reason it struck a chord with me is that I have noted the quite extraordinary run of tractor fatalities in the very recent past. It struck a chord with me because in my time I have driven I think every tractor ever manufactured and known to man. I have certainly operated every Caterpillar bulldozer ever manufactured, from a D9 down to a D4, and I have driven combine harvesters, cotton pickers and every piece of agricultural equipment known to man as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked my staff the other day, and they are doing it, to find out just for my own interest whether any of those fatalities had occurred on tractors without roll bars. When I was farming we never even thought about things like that, and there were many tractor fatalities in those days. In fact, in my cotton growing days we drove very dangerous tractors indeed. I still remember the Inters, the three-wheeled variety, with just one wheel at the front instead of two. They were constantly rearing up and rolling over backwards on operators. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply note my own concern at the recent very sad rash of deaths on tractors. It did cross my mind at the time that, in terms of the rural families involved in all of those tragedies, things are very difficult on the land at the moment. Of course, the very last thing that a rural family needs at the moment on top of very difficult financial circumstances is the tragedy of losing a husband, a brother or a father unnecessarily in a tractor accident. I will be very interested to find out, in relation to what I now find out are four deaths in recent times from tractors, whether any of those tractors were fitted with roll bars, because I know from my own days that they would have saved many a life had they been fitted to the tractors concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The basis of the agreement is that DSTO and DRET have agreed, where collaboration is believed to provide mutual benefit and is within the limits of existing security agreements, to exchange information on defence research, including information on test facilities. They will also consider sharing of resources in basic research and possible collaboration in joint research programs having regard to each country's intellectual property rights.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Savings are expected to result from the pooling of resources and the sharing of benefits from joint defence research programs. The magnitude of the savings will depend on the number and scope of any programs undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The agreement imposes no commitment on Australia other than to participate in a balanced exchange of information on defence research programs and to consider proposals for research collaboration.</PARA>
