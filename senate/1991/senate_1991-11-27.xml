<PARA>The motion, which I believe should be discussed as a matter of urgency by the Senate, is the same motion that was passed, in the terms of a resolution, at well attended public meetings in Melbourne and Sydney. That motion stated:</PARA>

<PARA>It is a matter of regret that honourable senators on both sides of the House do not feel that this matter is urgent enough to be discussed. I believe that many honourable senators actually share the sentiments expressed in the motion. They have signified that by signing petitions, by supporting previous motions and by expressing their feelings about it; although I must say that I have been told by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) that some senators on his side are not as concerned about foreign ownership of Australian media as are the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be useful, in support of my motion that this is indeed an urgent matter that should be discussed by the Senate today, to look at the concentration of media ownership. The metropolitan press is now owned&mdash;to the tune of 69.59 per cent&mdash;by one person, who is an American, not an Australian, citizen. If we add the Fairfax press ownership of 19.82 per cent to that we finish up with a concentration of 89.41 per cent of the metropolitan press and media being either controlled or owned by people who are not Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the Sunday newspapers, on the basis of the same formula the final figure would be 98.8 per cent. Perhaps one should consider the regional newspapers. They would reach only 27.31 per cent if we add the Fairfax media organisation share to that currently owned by the Packer press. However, it should be noted that a much higher percentage would be arrived at if the holdings of the O'Reilly group, which currently owns 50 per cent of regional newspapers, were added. In the weeks to come, particularly with the ABT at long last holding an inquiry, attention might well focus on that aspect and on that bid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to suburban papers we find that 66.1 per cent would be held by those interests. Major magazines would finish up being 86.8 per cent under the control of foreign interests. We might also add to that the fact that there is a 58 per cent potential coverage of television audiences by television stations controlled by Mr Packer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we need to pay some attention to the fact that, although we now have an inquiry by the ABT, it does not absolve this Parliament from assessing whether our media should be concentrated to that extent in the hands of two people and, in particular, in the hands of people who are foreign citizens. I draw the attention of the Senate to Mr Packer in particular and to the utter contempt that he has demonstrated for the democratic institutions of this country by his behaviour before the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Print Media. It is fortunate that on that occasion the people of Australia were able to watch Mr Packer's behaviour on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is also the fact that Mr Packer has not shrunk from suing four journalists in Sydney who are members of the Fairfax Free Press Committee&mdash;one way of shutting up journalists who express a divergent view. But he has put it on the record in another way as well. He has refused to support the Charter of Editorial Independence. I believe that we in this Parliament have a duty, as representatives of the Australian people, to look at these matters and to make our wishes known. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly indicate the reason why the Government will not be supporting this motion for suspension of the Standing Orders. Senator Spindler first of all referred to the issue of concentration of media ownership and said that it was a matter of urgency that the Parliament and the Senate give consideration to and express its views on the issue of concentration&mdash;which, of course, we did on 14 November. I think that the urgency to do so on 27 November is a bit hard to fathom, because a motion on the matter was carried by this chamber on that day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion calls for the Senate to support two resolutions which are not outlined and the contents of which I do not know. I have to say that I have never yet endorsed resolutions that other people have carried, however worthy those other people might have been, when I have not known the wording of the resolutions or the full range of their implications. So I certainly do not agree today to making some special arrangement so that we can leap in and endorse resolutions that nobody has seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We then go to the question of whether we ought to tag foreign ownership onto this matter of concentration. I would be happy to support the previous motion that was moved. I share the concern that appeared to be unanimous in the chamber because of the way in which the motion was carried that concentration of ownership in the media and in other areas&mdash;but we are talking today in the context of the media&mdash;is a very important issue in terms of diversity of information sources. I think we would all wish to see ways in which that diversity might be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To put the issue of foreign ownership on an equal plane is verging on the xenophobic. There are Australians who own media outlets in other countries without crisis. The United Kingdom has had a very high level of foreign ownership of its media for many years without its newspaper system collapsing, without there being a crisis in its democracy. There is a healthy diversity in the United Kingdom. I do not like the standards of some of its newspapers&mdash;some of which were previously owned by Australians and did not exactly run to the highest tone of media. But we are not talking now about whether we agree with the photographs somebody has on page 3 of a newspaper; we are talking about what view we should express as a parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I make two points in conclusion as to why I think it is entirely inappropriate to be charging in and endorsing this motion in this way. Firstly, it is primarily the responsibility of the Parliament to express its views on issues&mdash;particularly about ownership of private assets&mdash;through legislation. We should set a legislative framework and say, `That is the manner in which this should be dealt with. If you conform with the law, you are entitled to so proceed; if you do not conform with the law, you are not; and, if we do not like the law, we are the people whose obligation it is to change it'. Secondly, we now have the ABT inquiry, announced just yesterday, and I am not sure that it is entirely appropriate for us to be thundering in in this manner this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a good thing that the Senate previously carried the motion about concentration of ownership because it is not a question of interfering with things that ought properly to be dealt with by legislation. But I think this is not a matter that we ought to be charging in to endorse today. We have the resolution on concentration on the books. I suspect that 75 out of 76 senators, if not 76 out of 76, cannot recall the text of the resolutions we are being called upon to endorse. It is entirely inappropriate that we be called upon to do so. Therefore, I reject the motion. </PARA>

He is perfectly right in saying that there is a very heavy onus on those who would wish us to support the resolutions in due course. Indeed, they may already have done themselves a disservice by not spelling out the detail of those resolutions at this stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose this motion and I think that the points put forward by Senator McMullan were right. Senator Alston has said, `Why shouldn't we debate a motion even though we do not know the terms of it?'. What concerns me a bit about that is this: the person proposing this motion&mdash;a person for whom I have great respect, Senator Spindler&mdash;has in the course of his arguments in support of the suspension of the Standing Orders to bring on this debate as a matter of great importance made an attack on Mr Packer. We might or might not like Mr Packer, but it seems to me undesirable for us to go into a debate in which one of the propositions put forward may be that Mr Packer is somebody who is less than desirable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston knows about proper processes and knows from his long experience what an appropriate approach to things is. I say to him that it is a very bad thing that we come in here of a morning and go into a debate which I agree is very important but which contains in the introduction an attack on a citizen, namely Mr Packer, who, as far as I know, has committed no crime&mdash;none which anybody can point to, in any event. He is entitled to nothing but the best of reputations. Nobody has shown him to have in any way disobeyed the law of this country or any other, and for that sort of debate to be brought on without proper notice, without the terms of the debate being expressed precisely so that people's characters are protected&mdash;whether they are the most powerful and the richest in the land or whether they are the weakest and the poorest of the land&mdash;seems to me to be a most undesirable thing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on record here publicly that I am distressed that from time to time recently, and now in this Parliament today, attempts have been made to affect what is a competition between commercial entities bidding for the Fairfax empire. At this stage, Mr Packer is perfectly entitled to put together a proposition, which in no way breaches the law. Neither Mr Packer nor anybody else who may be in the commercial race should be subjected to attacks in this Parliament whilst they are bidders in competition for the Fairfax empire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not make any value judgments about Mr Packer's bid or any other bid. I have my own personal views about those other bids, but I do not think that I am entitled&mdash;and nor is any other member of Parliament in this place&mdash;to come in here and make statements under parliamentary privilege which would affect the capacity of any of these commercial entities to bid fairly on the open market for the Fairfax empire. Therefore, Senator Cooney is absolutely correct in asking that justice be done to both the rich and the poor in this land in the sense that they should never have to be involved in a parliamentary debate to have their names or their organisations dragged around at the very time when what is said in this place can affect the capacity of those commercial entities&mdash;Mr Packer and others included&mdash;to make a successful bid for the Fairfax empire or, for that matter, any other empire they may wish to buy. </PARA>

None of them should be subjected to examination in this place which could affect their capacity to make a genuine bid.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)urges the Government to take all necessary steps to prevent further concentration of media ownership, and to make sure that planned and future sales of Australian media do not increase foreign ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to look at the words, `further concentration' because Senator Aulich said that he knows about concentration. It is to the shame of this Government that its media policy has, in the course of its term of office, led to a situation where such a motion before this chamber is so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has surrounded this motion has been a specific exercise in the commercial world. We would challenge that framework in which all of that is being dealt with, particularly in the context of foreign ownership. We do not accept that the buying and selling of empires is something which ought to be outside the interests and action of this Parliament. Indeed, these very empires, especially in the media area, have been built up and been able to be built up in large measure by virtue of the media policy of this Government. That policy says `Fling it all out on the marketplace' and rejects any notion that there are very high principles at risk&mdash;questions of our own cultural integrity and questions of free and open access to full information via our various media outlets in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the contribution made by Senator Aulich, he referred to his membership of the committee that examined television equalisation, of which I was also a member. That was really the beginning of the end of the television industry. I note that this motion talks about `media ownership'. Although the issue that is before this country at the moment relates to print media ownership, this motion does not limit that. This motion calls for action in the whole area of media ownership. During the term of office of this Government it has been disgraceful to see the concentration of ownership that has occurred&mdash;with, at this stage anyway, the exception of the radio industry. That concentration is what we have to look at in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA>I thank the Senate for giving the opportunity to discuss this topic, which I believe is of national importance. I rebut the suggestion made by Senator Aulich that this is purely a commercial matter. I should have thought that the flow and control of information in a democracy is anything but purely a commercial matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have also thought that this is very much a matter that this chamber should address. On that point, I am rather concerned that the fact that I have put certain factual matters relating to Mr Packer's actions in the past on the public record has been taken as a personal attack on Mr Packer. I have not made, nor do I intend to make, a personal attack on Mr Packer. I have merely drawn to the attention of the Senate certain facts that are already on the public record but which this chamber has not yet considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this chamber has a duty to look at these matters and then to take some action, or at least call upon the Government to take some action. Reference has been made to resolutions on this subject. It has been pointed out that the resolutions passed at public meetings are not before the chamber. I inform the chamber that the substance of those resolutions is contained in subsection (b) of my notice of motion No. 486, which urges the Government to take all necessary steps to prevent further concentration of media ownership and to make sure that planned and future sales of Australian media do not increase foreign ownership. That is the substance of the resolutions and that is what the Australian Democrats would like this Senate to adopt as a resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a political, not a commercial, question. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has a discretion, in a case where the equity investment of a foreign owner is 15 per cent or more, of recommending to the Government that this process should be stopped or that it should go ahead in the national interest. I would have thought that the level of foreign ownership of our media, which is a supportive element of our democratic system, is very much the responsibility of this chamber and of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). I believe that we would be charged with negligence as a chamber if we did not address ourselves to that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that, when decisions are made about what sort of information goes to our voters and the community via the media and when these media are controlled to the tune of 90 per cent by people who have sworn their allegiance to other nations, one must raise the question: can we really be certain that these interests will always control the flow of information in the interests of this country? It is a legitimate question. Senators on either side of the chamber may come to the view that they do not care if our means of communication are owned by people who have no personal interest as citizens of this country. I strongly disagree. I believe that Australia should control the media process which governs what information and the shape in which this information reaches members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another question to be looked at, and that is whether Mr Packer's 14.9 per cent controlling interest is a controlling interest in the terms of the Broadcasting Act. I would suggest that the wording of section 89KA of the Broadcasting Act 1942 provides that if two or more parties acting together are in a position to exercise control of a television licence or newspaper, each of them should be taken to be in that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that, in the case of this bid, Mr Packer and Mr Black are acting in concert. The facts of that bid to that extent are on the public record. I believe that it is incumbent upon this chamber to take note of that. I believe that it is incumbent upon this chamber to take note of the fact that Mr Packer, by the actions that I have outlined, has, in my view, indicated that he intends to be anything but a passive owner, as on some occasions he has claimed. I believe that these matters need to be debated and have a right to be debated in the public arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we must take account of the fact that media concentration of the type we currently have and of the type that would be brought about if this bid proceeds is unacceptable to a civilised, democratic nation. I know of no other nation which is prepared to countenance this degree of media ownership concentration and foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other piece of legislation to which we can turn if we wish to seek some protection, and that is the Trade Practices Act. Unfortunately, we know that section 50 of that Act was amended under Mr Fraser's Government to change the criterion of prohibiting mergers which would lessen competition to the much more lenient test of preventing mergers only if they achieve dominance in the market. That amendment made it possible for Mr Murdoch to take over the Herald and Weekly Times group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is time that the Senate and the Government took note of the effects that have flowed from that amendment and returned to the tougher test of prohibiting mergers which lessen competition. This applies even to normal commercial products&mdash;to take Senator Aulich's point&mdash;but it should apply much more so to what are sometimes termed `sensitive industries', to which the media industry certainly belongs. However, it is unlikely that we would support a differential test. I believe that the test of preventing mergers reaching near monopoly proportions simply through individual steps of lessening competition should be used in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the Senate should address the question of the concentration of media ownership; it should address the question of concentration of foreign media ownership; it should be aware of the dangers to our democratic process that such concentration implies; and it should say loudly and clearly that it is unacceptable to the Parliament of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should indicate at the outset that the Opposition will not be supporting the substance of this motion. However, I have made it clear that I thought it was legitimate for the Australian Democrats, and indeed the Senate, to discuss what is clearly a matter of great public concern. We have constantly reiterated our concerns in that area and we recognise the right of persons to come into this chamber and express their concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his speech I think Senator Spindler reflected on Rupert Murdoch being an American citizen. In one sense, that is an example of how easy it is to get carried away with technical notions and end up being in a situation of mindless xenophobia. It is quite clear to us that we ought to judge these things on their merits. We ought to look at whether there is an excess of concentration. That does not necessarily reflect on a person's place of birth or citizenship. Indeed, the home grown product can be as oppressive as he likes or a foreigner can be very hands-off&mdash;indeed, in many instances that is more likely to be the case because foreigners will not be involved here on a day to day basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also say that I think the Government has selective amnesia on this matter. Whilst it does now seem to take a more relaxed attitude as to foreign ownership and adjudge these matters to a certain extent on the merits, I can well remember two years ago when Bond media changed hands and Channel 7 went into receivership largely because the Government was prepared to ram through amendments which reduced the level of ownership of a licence from 49 per cent to 20 per cent. There was no particular need to do that. The rules had been in place since 1981. It was simply a decision taken on the run in the context of current changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is precisely the vice of all these current shenanigans. The rules ought to have been in place long ago. The Government's attitude on foreign ownership ought to have been as it seems to be now and we would not have had this constant preoccupation and speculation about bending the rules to suit the colour of the applicant of the day. I think it is unfortunate in that sense that any proposed changes will be seen in that light and people will quite often read into them motives that may not be accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From our point of view, we do express our concern. Senator Spindler has yet again not gone through the text of the resolutions passed at the public meetings in Melbourne and Sydney in the course of this debate. I suppose they are all so well-known to him that he does not need to. Nonetheless, to conduct a sensible debate in this place, it is highly desirable for people to be specific in what they expect the Senate to be supporting. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not particularly relevant to a debate about the level of concentration of print media ownership. We certainly support the retention of the cross-media ownership rules. If that is all that Senator Spindler is talking about, I do not think that is at issue. As I read paragraph (b), the Australian Democrats are concerned about increases in foreign ownership in all aspects of the media. That is perfectly consistent with the stance the Democrats have taken over a considerable time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a much wider debate than one about print media. It is in that context that we depart most significantly from the thrust of this motion. We do think that there is a sufficient level of discretion under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act to make judgments on the merits. As I have said, there may well be occasions when it is quite desirable to get access to foreign technology, foreign expertise and to those who have a great deal of experience in the industry, in terms of not only technical efficiency but also cultural perspectives. I would not want to rule someone out simply because that person was regarded technically as an American citizen, but I would be very much concerned to make the judgment in this country in terms of any further concentration of ownership. In this respect, that is where the debate ought to start and finish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly think a case can be argued that further foreign ownership of substantial interests should not be supported unless there is compelling evidence that the outcome of any prohibition of foreign investment would be to increase market concentration and to decrease competition. At the end of the day the debate ought to centre on the extent to which the Trade Practices Commission is able to use its power properly. I would have thought that it would not have any difficulty, in the context of the high levels of concentration that already exist, in saying that any further increase would constitute a dominance, not just a lessening of competition. In that sense, I think the Trade Practices Commission's current powers are adequate to deal with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly think that it ought to be monitoring developments relating to anticompetitive behaviour in the industry. Successive chairmen have not been backward in expressing their views on the matter. Short of conducting formal inquiries, they have made their views known. We think they ought to continue to do that. At the end of the day we will then have a sensible debate about a level of ownership that is appropriate and to what extent we ought to be tightening up the system. But that sort of debate should not be conducted against the background of bids that are on the table. One of the most fundamental notions of justice is that the rules ought not be changed halfway through a case. </PARA>

That is one of the difficulties&mdash;I do not want to go over the previous motion&mdash;in bringing on a matter in the way in which this has been. The debate between Senator Alston and Senator Spindler as to exactly what has been put forward illustrates what I am saying. Knowing Senator Spindler, I am sure he has a very clear idea of what he means by the motion he has put forward, and, no doubt, other Australian Democrat senators do as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a matter is to be debated in the Senate, I suggest that it be made clear what is being proposed so that the people who are asked to exercise their minds on it and to support it one way or the other know what they are doing. If they do not, the only consequence will probably be that it will be voted down. People will not, and should not, support something that they are not clear about. I was pleased that the debate, conducted by Senator Spindler and Senator Alston, addressed the issues rather than personalities which has perhaps become an unhappy part of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler spoke about the Trade Practices Act. It seemed to me that he wanted this motion to be dealt with in that context. He realised the difficulty with that as he developed the argument. The Trade Practices Act deals very much with commercial issues. He berated Senator Aulich when Senator Aulich spoke in those terms. I do not think this is a matter that should be looked at within the confines of the Trade Practices Act but, rather, as a separate issue with dimensions other than the commercial ones. The other issue is that the media&mdash;the fourth arm of government, as it has been called&mdash;has ramifications not only of a commercial nature but also of a social, religious, political and cultural  nature within society. It is in that context, rather than being a matter of commercial consideration, that the issue is so important. If it were simply a matter of a commercial deal, it would not raise the passions that it has now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In my view, the principles that should guide the decision on whether a person or a group should be able to purchase a paper or a piece of the electronic media are as follows: firstly, the media should not be concentrated, and everybody seems to be agreed on that. Secondly, if there is an undue degree of concentration, certainly foreign ownership should be very closely looked at. Thirdly, there should be editorial independence. That cannot be legislated for, but we should have that. In my view, there should also be journalistic independence. Journalists should not be unduly controlled by the editor or the owner. Fourthly, people or bodies that own media of any size should not own other industries of any size. There is a temptation to perhaps not turn as much attention as should be turned to the other industries that are owned, and there is a temptation to promote those industries more than they should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there should not be excessive borrowing overseas. Problems have arisen in the Fairfax press because of excessive borrowing. Those problems could be worsened if all the borrowings were from overseas. If anything were to go wrong, the control of the media outlet would be put into the hands of overseas bankers. So those are the principles that I think ought to guide this issue as to who should own and control the media. The aim of this debate was most noble, but perhaps it has been miscarried in its execution because people do not quite know what they are being asked to vote for. </PARA>

I also heard Senator Spindler tell them that what they are being asked to vote for is contained in part (b) of the motion before us. In any event, it appears that Senator Spindler's word has not been accepted. Therefore I will read to the Senate from the program for the public meeting held at 5.30 p.m. in the Treasury Gardens on Friday, 25 October. The speakers there included Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser and me, all former leaders of political parties. At that meeting the following resolution was passed:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We call on the Federal Government and the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To take all necessary steps to prevent further concentration of media ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To make sure that planned and future sales of Australian media do not increase foreign ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate can see that it is quite clear that what is being asked for is a vote on that resolution which is embodied in part (b) of Senator Spindler's motion. As I said, I spoke at that public meeting. There was a subsequent public meeting in Sydney on the following Sunday which passed the same resolution. When I spoke at the meeting in Melbourne I made the commitment that that resolution would come into this Parliament. As a former leader who is still in fact a parliamentarian, I was able to make that commitment. Senator Spindler, in my absence, moved that motion here, and that is why we are debating it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my contribution to the debate on whether we should suspend the Standing Orders and have this debate in the Senate, it is very important that we address the question on the basis of what the motion actually puts, that is, further concentration of media ownership. To do that we have to acknowledge the high level of concentration of media ownership that we already have in this country. We should be attempting to pass a resolution to divest some of that concentrated ownership, particularly in the print media. It is the case that a particular crisis in print media in this country has brought this question to much more heightened public attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly believe that the contributions of Malcolm Fraser and Gough Whitlam, as former politicians and high profile public figures in this country, have been very significant. I have welcomed their contributions because they have come on board together in a quite extraordinary way on a question which is of vital importance. However, it is a question which many of us have been concerned about and have been speaking about for a very long time. I have done so, having had the responsibility for that portfolio since I have been here in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore I want to briefly put on the record some of the facts. In doing so I will mention the names of some people. I do not want to be portrayed as making any scurrilous attack on those people. I am simply putting facts on the agenda. I will share with the Senate some of the comments of Eric Beecher, a former editor of two major metropolitan daily newspapers. He raised this issue last year in a major article in the Melbourne publication, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age.</EMPHASIS> This was at the time when Rupert Murdoch rationalised four of his major metropolitan daily newspapers. On that occasion, Eric Beecher said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This week, Australia had 12 daily metropolitan newspapers. Tomorrow it will have 10.</PARA>
<PARA>That is courtesy of Rupert Murdoch's rationalisation. Beecher went on to point out that the scoresheet for Australian national dailies is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Murdoch 15, others (insolvent) 6.</PARA>
<PARA>Beecher made the comment in his article that the most interesting thing about that scoresheet is how little interest it arouses in the general public in Australia. That was very much to his dismay. He is actually inaccurate when he goes on to say that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other than on the left fringe of the Labor Party, it has never been an issue on the national agenda.</PARA>
<PARA>He neglected to note the longstanding concern of the Democrats on this question. Nevertheless, I certainly share his dismay on that issue. However, I welcome the fact that this question is now much more on the public agenda. Beecher went on to pick up a theme that has appeared here in the chamber today&mdash;although I think by way of misrepresentation&mdash;that when the issue is raised, it is usually raised `in strident anti-Murdoch, anti-foreigner terms which not only debases its importance but detracts from the fundamental issue at stake'. That is the point that Senator Spindler and I have striven to make. When putting items of fact on the record, one has to mention people's names. Nevertheless, those facts cannot be avoided and should not be avoided. I further quote from Beecher who makes the point that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason that newspaper ownership is not an issue in Australia is that most people do not understand the nature of the power that resides in newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very salient point. We must never underestimate the power of newspapers. I am acknowledging here that the genesis of this debate is the crisis in the newspaper industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving aside the Fairfax bid, the crisis arises from a situation already in place. Let us extend our view of the Murdoch scoresheet in this case. One organisation in Australia now owns or sponsors seven out of 10 daily metropolitan papers; seven out of nine Sunday metropolitan newspapers; one out of two national daily newspapers; all suburban newspapers in Adelaide and Brisbane; around half the suburban newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne; and most newspaper and magazine printing presses in Australia. That is some concentration. Subsequent to that concentration, is it any wonder that, when the Fairfax empire&mdash;small by comparison&mdash;is up for grabs, some of us are concerned that we should not allow a further concentration, which is the subject of this motion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My contribution to this debate has never been necessarily to oppose simply one bid or another bid, but to put facts on the record which demonstrate that should one or other bid be successful certain principles will be breached and certain major issues of concern will have been ignored, such as those of foreign ownership and breadth of ownership. Let us look at some of the statistics which would arise if the Packer-Black bid for the Fairfax operation were successful. Capital city and national newspaper ownership shares would show Murdoch with 61.7 per cent and Packer with 19.8 per cent. The total share held by the two media operators of capital city and national newspaper ownership shares</PARA>
<PARA>would be 81.5 per cent. If this Packer-Black bid were successful, the total concentration of control in metropolitan press would be 89.41 per cent and the Sunday newspaper ownership share would be 98.8 per cent. Also, between the two, regional daily ownership shares would be 27.3 per cent; suburban newspaper ownership shares would be 66.1 per cent; and major magazine ownership shares would be 86.88 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those statistics in the first instance demonstrate an already existing concentration. We must remember that the Murdoch case, which is the first I quoted, is also foreign owned concentration because it relates to an American citizen. I simply put the second set of statistics on the record to demonstrate the consequences in the broad print media context of a successful Packer-Black bid. It is those facts which we want to bring before the Senate today and which should exercise the minds of honourable senators on both sides when they vote on this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The print media is a medium of extraordinary power; newspapers set up the agenda for discussion on politics, social issues, economics and a wide range of other areas. Perhaps newspapers are now being read by increasingly fewer people because of the impingement of the electronic media, but they are still very much amongst opinion leaders and opinion makers. As Eric Beecher says in the article I have referred to, `Where newspapers lead, TV, radio and the politicians follow'. Of course, the editorial opinions of the newspapers are very influential in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Newspapers are a powerful medium and, as I say, print media concentration is already unacceptable in this country. We should be debating whether or not we divest because let us not forget that divestment is a practice used in media policy and action in the United States&mdash;the great home of free enterprise. Why should we flinch from it?  We are not even anywhere near that yet. We appear not even able to persuade the Senate to pass a motion, jointly put forward by former leaders of both the old parties in this place, which simply exhorts the Government to take necessary steps through the powers of the Parliament to ensure that there is no further concentration of media ownership and that we are protected against predatory overseas ownership which puts at risk our entire culture and our democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While honourable senators are making up their minds on how they vote on this motion, let us first be clear that what we are not doing here is pillorying any particular individual; what we are doing is challenging a system which has been market driven, and we disagree with the views Senator Aulich outlined on that point. We believe there is a responsibility on the Government and Parliament, on behalf of the Australian nation as a whole, to take action in this area. Indeed, we should have taken action in the past. At this crucial time this Parliament needs to send all the right signals to the proper authorities to stand up for the rights and interests of all Australian people against the commercial empires that have been built up in this deregulated free market system and into the very important and crucial area of media ownership. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to this debate will be brief in some sort of forlorn hope that we may get out of here this side of Christmas, although I think that hope is fading fast. The speakers on the Government side have already explained quite comprehensively why the Government will not be supporting this motion. Again, I simply reiterate the support we did give for the previous motion moved by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Coulter, as distinct from this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with all the comments made by Senator Alston in his contribution to this debate. I also say that Senator Spindler must be suffering some short term memory loss in his statement that he was not setting up this debate for any personal attack on Mr Packer. I tuned into this debate just in time to hear him launch this debate with what I would have thought was a fairly vicious personal attack on Mr Packer where he accused him of outrageous and undemocratic behaviour in front of the House of Representatives Select Committee into the Print Media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention this because, like a lot of other people in this Parliament, I watched as much of the exchange between Mr Packer and the Committee as I could. I thought it was compulsive viewing. From where I was sitting, I would have scored that particular exchange as Packer 10, Committee zip; but I guess beauty is very much in the eye of the beholder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of people being able to carry out their business in compliance with the law has been made previously by a number of speakers on the Government side, particularly by Senator McMullan. I take on board Senator Powell's comments about her desire to have that law changed. I accept that, but that really is the appropriate context in which this debate should proceed: providing people do obey the law, in my view they are entitled to proceed with the commercial arrangements they are making. I make that point because, as everyone now knows, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal took a decision last night to establish an inquiry into this matter. I read part of the statement made yesterday by the Chairman of the ABT, Mr Peter Westerway, on this point:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final point. There is widespread misunderstanding of the respective roles of the Tribunal, the Trade Practices Commission and the Foreign Investment Review Board. I do not speak for the other two bodies, but I am concerned that so many media and even political observers seem to see our role as `stopping Packer'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not our role. Nor has it ever been. As an independent statutory authority, we have a responsibility to address potential breaches of the Broadcasting Act; in particular, breaches of cross media ownership and control. And we will carry out those responsibilities with all the ability we can bring to the task. But in doing this we have a duty not to discriminate either for or against persons who remain within the law.</PARA>
<PARA>That point has been made by Government speakers earlier in this debate but it is worth reiterating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by concurring with the statements made by Senator Alston earlier in this debate. In a perfect world, we would all obviously want all of our businesses&mdash;not just the media, although I concede there is particular sensitivity attached to this industry, and rightly so&mdash;to be controlled totally by Australian nationals and to be financed entirely by Australian investment. We know we cannot achieve that perfect state of affairs and that, quite often, a balance has to be struck, not just in this industry but also in many others, between those two desirable ends; both of which are contained in the resolutions referred to by Senator Spindler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I happen to agree with Senator Alston: the concentration question, in terms of any pernicious influence that the media might want to exercise through its control, is necessarily a far more crucial issue than the question of foreign ownership. Quite often, judgments might have to be made as to which is the lesser or the greater of two evils. We are talking about an industry that does require huge amounts of capital, firstly, to get into and, secondly, to survive in once one is there. We are talking about the link of excluding both the question of concentration of ownership&mdash;which all of us have publicly expressed our concern about in here and outside this Parliament, and I think Senator Powell has graphically indicated why we should be concerned about it&mdash;and the question of what is simply accepted as being the evil of foreign ownership. I simply point out that in this country we are not in a position very often of being permitted the indulgence of being able to exercise, by simply passing laws, the possibility of embracing both of those highly desirable ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Government, for all of the reasons given by the previous speakers and me&mdash;although we were happy to support the motion of the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Coulter, on the same issue&mdash;will not be supporting the subsequent motion moved by Senator Spindler. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In my concluding remarks, I, first of all, put on the record my appreciation to Senator Powell for demonstrating that the second part of notice of motion No. 486 does in fact contain, word for word, the resolutions passed at the Fairfax meetings in Melbourne and Sydney. I think that will lay to rest the somewhat pathetic attempt to rely on a technical point and to not give support to the motion which I moved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also indebted to Senator Alston for putting on the record his concern about the concentration of media ownership. I regret that he does not go so far as being concerned about foreign media ownership but maybe that is a start. I am also indebted to Senator Cooney for making it quite clear that the considerations that this House should look at concern matters which are quite separate from the commercial considerations that might apply. We all know that newspapers are different from soap. I think it is quite clear that different considerations must apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I welcome Senator Cooney's insistence that there must be editorial and journalistic independence. It is quite clear that when we have the sort of concentration of ownership that we are now facing, the market for journalists is very limited. When people are not certain that they will have a job next year, that must to some extent, whether they wish it or not, affect their independence. The move to draw up a charter of editorial and journalistic independence is an attempt to redress that balance. It is an attempt which should be supported strongly&mdash;it is certainly supported strongly by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, I would like to say this: sure, we cannot have perfection; but that does not mean to say that we should not try to get as close as possible to a desirable level of diversity of media ownership and as low a level as possible of foreign ownership. I am indebted to Senator Collins for saying that in a perfect world we would indeed have all media owned and controlled by Australians. Let us see whether we can get a little closer to that than we are now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I would like to refer the Minister again to the provisions governing foreign ownership which do give the Treasurer discretion to intervene. I believe, in terms of this motion, that the Government should intervene to ensure that the public interest of the Australian community is guarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to reiterate that I did not make a personal attack on Mr Packer; I simply put on record his actions, which I think are relevant in the current situation. I conclude by commending to the Senate notice of motion No. 486, which calls on the Government:</PARA>

<PARA>In a few minutes, because of the time available to me, I will seek leave to incorporate my speech in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Before Senator Tierney speaks, I will mention one or two matters relating to the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was referred to the Committee in November of last year. It is the first time in 50 years that we have actually had a comprehensive national view of what is happening to adult and community education; the last one being in 1944. During the inquiry we received more than 300 written submissions and talked to 150 witnesses at public hearings held in all capital cities and in a range of small towns and isolated communities across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated in the foreword of the report, we actually began the hearings in Merredin, which is a small town in the middle of the wheat fields halfway between Kalgoorlie and Perth. Mr Acting Deputy President nods his head; he would be very familiar with that town. There would be a few Liberal voters there and many Australian Labor Party voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting that we started the hearings in that town. We were given an indication of the types of services that were being provided by the adult and community education providers throughout this nation. We visited neighbourhood houses, farms, colleges and prisons. We looked at the incredible variety of adult and community education services that are being provided throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech that I will incorporate summarises the findings of the report. The report is unanimous. Although the report deals with a very important and wide ranging subject, every member of the Committee has agreed on its recommendations and the format. I also thank the Committee staff&mdash;Brenton Holmes, Mary Lindsay, Rosemary Brissenden, and Ros Franklin, who was the executive assistant for some time&mdash;for the work that they did on this report. It was an enormous amount of work in terms of the number of threads that had to be drawn together. It provides a pen picture of how adult and community education is provided in every State. That, in itself, is a very complicated exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report then looks at all of those other adult and community education providers, ranging from those who provide prison education to those who are running neighbourhood houses. If honourable senators are under the impression, as are many Australians, that adult and community education is about hobbies and recreation, with a few night classes here and there, they should look very closely at some of the figures that we provide in this report. For example, at some time in their lives, six out of 10 Australians will be involved in adult and community education; 1.7 million people went through neighbourhood houses in the last year or so; 300,000 people went through community colleges in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a veritable explosion of educational demand in this country over the last three or four years. The adult and community education providers have had to deal with that explosion. As we show in our report, the formal education system has been quite unable to cope with that demand. For example, 30,000 university students will not find places in the formal university system next year; about 100,000 people will not find places in the formal TAFE system next year. They have to go somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the migrant population, for example, we indicated that 360,000 migrants who were born overseas have great difficulty in speaking English; 170,000 of them are already in the work force. Yet our migrant education program deals only with those people who have arrived in the last five years. So the majority of those who are already in the work force will not be able to enjoy the advantages of learning English in a formal situation. The adult and community education providers will have to go out and reach those target groups. That illustrates some of the issues that are raised in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going into detail, this report will be in as much demand as the Committee's report on priorities and reform in higher education which, believe it or not, actually sold out in government bookshops. Perhaps the response of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) helped that. I believe that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella</EMPHASIS> will be just as popular because it is the first report since 1944 to cover the whole of this area on a nationwide basis. Its recommendations are a fair summation of the submissions given to us by groups around the country. It gives me great pleasure to table the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella</EMPHASIS>. I seek leave to incorporate my speech in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I present the Report of the Senate Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled "Come in Cinderella&mdash;the emergence of Adult and Community Education."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This matter was referred to the Committee in November of last year, the first time in fifty years that adult and community education has been the subject of a national inquiry. Our findings have justified the Senate's interest in the subject. Since we began our Inquiry my Committee has received more than 300 written submissions and talked to 150 witnesses at public hearings held in all capital cities and in a range of small towns and isolated communities across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until we began our investigation into adult and community education we had little idea either of the scope of the sector or of the significance of its contribution to the educational, economic and social well being of the nation and to individual participants. Committee members have been both surprised and impressed by the efforts of tutors, coordinators and local management committees all over the country who, with minimal resources and little official recognition or support, have successfully reached out to the many people in our community whom the `formal' sectors of education&mdash;schools, TAFE and the tertiary sector&mdash;have been unable to assist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adult and community education has already touched the lives of six out of ten adult Australians and it is growing faster than any other area of education. It operates throughout the length and breadth of the country&mdash;from the central business districts of our capital cities to isolated mining settlements; amongst urban migrant communities and in remote Aboriginal groups. Diversity is the key to its success. It runs courses on every conceivable subject at all levels from primary school to post doctoral. Its approaches are equally varied, ranging from formal, highly structured courses to discussions over a cup of tea. The subjects taught and the approaches adopted are, like everything else in adult and community education, a response to the varied needs of the students. This responsiveness is another key to the sector's success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People unfamiliar with its operations have tended to devalue the contribution of the sector, or belittle its efforts. The Committee hopes, through this Report, to raise the profile of the sector by informing the public in general and policy makers in particular of the valuable work which it is undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of recent and future developments are likely to increase demands upon the sector. In the workplace these include award restructuring, increased participation of women in the workforce and the introduction of the Training Guarantee Act. More generally, social and demographic changes such as the movement into the community of people with disabilities and the general ageing of the population are likely to have an effect both upon the demand for education and upon the type of education required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The adult and community education sector is already responding to these challenges. It is providing basic literacy and numeracy to workers through courses conducted in the workplace, in TAFE classes or in community settings and private homes. It is assisting professional and other members of the workforce to upgrade their skills. It is helping those who would like to join the workforce by increasing their confidence&mdash;an intangible but significant benefit which this sector has been particularly successful in achieving&mdash;and providing for many people the first step towards further study or paid employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its community based, non threatening settings are especially valuable in assisting groups likely to be intimidated by large institutions and formal approaches, such as people with disabilities needing to acquire basic living skills and migrants needing to learn English. The dramatic growth in enrolments in those fourth sector organisations catering to the needs of older people such as the Universities of the Third Age and the Schools for Seniors are sufficient testimony to the sector's ability to respond to demands as they emerge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Report po<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>ints out that the impressive achievements of the sector have taken place despite its minimal resources, variable levels of official recognition and a lack of overall policy direction. It shows, for example, that government financial support to the sector has actually decreased in some States despite the steady growth in enrolments and the increasing demands upon the sector. It is the only sector of education in which participants are expected to bear most of the costs, and in which the majority of educators and administrators are volunteers. It is grossly inefficient for governments to ignore or neglect the sector's remarkable education and training capacity, particularly as relatively small additions of guaranteed funding to the sector will reap significant additional benefits in terms of overall levels of skills formation, to say nothing of the abundant personal and community benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that the sector will be unable to maintain its extraordinary performance, let alone increase it, without greater administrative, financial and policy support, the absence of which now threaten the viability of the whole operation. To afford the sector the recognition which it has long been denied, and to avert the very real threat of its disintegration the Committee has recommended the immediate establishment of a high level Working Party charged with responsibility for developing national policy and funding guidelines for the sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also recommends that the Commonwealth's views on policy and funding should be developed and refined by an Advisory Committee consisting of representatives of all major provider types and reporting to the Minister </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">through the National Board on Employment, Education and Training and that implementation of Commonwealth policy should be the responsibility of a designated office within DEET.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important and most urgent task for the Working Party will be the development of a national policy on adult and community education. The need for such a policy, and for greater recognition, was stressed repeatedly to the Committee throughout its Inquiry. Possible components of such a policy were also widely discussed. The Committee has formed the view that there is broad agreement in the sector on the essential elements of a national policy. These are encapsulated in the Recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, adult and community education is a large and complex topic and my Committee Report covers a wider range of issues than it has been possible to address here today. The Committee expects this Report to play an important part in alerting policy makers to the need for urgent action. It is time for adult and community education to emerge from its Cinderella status and to assume its rightful place alongside the formal education sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Report and its Recommendations to the Senate, to education policy makers and advisers in the Commonwealth and State Governments and to all those involved in adult and community education, whether as administrators, tutors or students.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has been presented with a report from the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella&mdash;the Emergence of Adult and Community Education</EMPHASIS>. The title is very apt because adult and community education has been largely ignored by government and other education policy makers. While being ignored, however, the sector has gone quietly about its business, making an immeasurable contribution to our society&mdash;educationally, economically and socially.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been stated by Senator Aulich that it is remarkable that this is the first time in 50 years that any investigation has been made of this vibrant but largely forgotten sector in our education system. This review is long overdue. What we have discovered is a versatile, diverse and responsive area of education that is growing faster than any other area. That has been done with almost no government support, minimal resources and no official recognition. It is a tribute to the dedication and efficiency of the many people involved in adult and community education who have reached out to those people so desperately in need of these programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the fact that the sector is very responsive to the diverse range of demands from the community that has made it so successful and has led to such dramatic growth over recent years. Sixty per cent of Australians have participated in adult and community education. In New South Wales in the last 10 years the participation rate has trebled from 100,000 a year to 300,000 a year; in Queensland the demand has increased by almost 10 per cent each year for the last 15 years. These extraordinary demands will continue in the future with more and more people wishing to enter the work force who were never able to do so previously. As our economy undergoes structural redevelopment, it creates new need for retraining of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits that are currently being derived from this sector are social and economic in nature. Job related adult education courses often lead to increased income for the individuals and, therefore, to more government revenue. Also, one-third of unemployed people who are participating in adult education will subsequently gain employment. In addition, social benefits occur through increased confidence that individuals develop through adult education. This fourth sector of our education system is catering specifically for the needs of the disadvantaged in our society who tend to be ignored, if not shunned, by the mainstream education system; it encompasses teaching non-English speaking migrants to adopt English; it is helping the disabled to learn life skills; it is helping women who wish to re-enter the work force to retrain; and it is helping the unskilled worker regain a place in the work force. This assistance to adult and community education is enabling the disadvantaged to overcome specific obstacles and to take their rightful place in society, making valuable contributions that would otherwise have been lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our formal education system that role has largely been undertaken by the TAFE system. This sector is grossly overburdened with excessive numbers and is not capable of meeting the demands made on it. Similarly, the higher education sector is not able to cope with community demands for its educational services. In 1992 there will be at least 140,000 students denied access to TAFE and probably around 30,000 denied access to university places. It is reasonable to expect that many of these people will try to find some sort of educational opportunity in the adult and community education sector. It is telling that, in looking at putting extra billions into the formal education system, no thought has been given to extra funding for the diverse, efficient and largely user-pays adult and community education sector. This fourth sector has a comprehensive range of providers. They should be assisted to respond to the dramatically increased demand being placed upon them as the formal education system groans under the weight of numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disparity in funding gives an insight into how productive this sector is and how much potential it has. Yet, at the same time, we see that it needs urgent help from the Commonwealth. In New South Wales, for the financial year 1990-91, TAFE got 200 times the funding of the adult and community education sector for less than double the number of students. Adult and community education is 90 per cent self-funding while other sectors are overwhelmingly funded by government. In 1991 the Commonwealth spent $209m on TAFE infrastructure while adult and community education received no funding at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this lack of funding, it is expected that adult and community education will act as a safety net for those people in need of education, especially workplace training, that are not assisted by the TAFE system at present. Many adult education agencies other than TAFE have had substantial experience in such matters. Large metropolitan based providers such as the Workers Education Association and the Council of Adult Education have developed considerable expertise and won substantial contracts from industry for the design and implementation of training programs. Rural adult education providers are often the key resource for training for local enterprises. Such a role for the sector should be recognised and supported by government keen to see the enhancement of training commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An excellent example of this is the Council of Adult Education's involvement with the development of the clerks training model project, which links the training system with workplace and industry needs. The primary task has been the identification and description of clerical skills, the development of competence statements related to those skills and the establishment of assessment systems. The result is that clerical workers now have a career path through identified levels of competency. Similar examples of the sector's close links with industry include the Victorian Council of Adult Education's involvement in basic education settings ranging from heavy industry to clothing and service industries. Unions and management were involved in all aspects of developing and implementing these policies and all acknowledged the benefits that accrued from these programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These examples, found among others in the Senate Committee report, show that adult education providers generally have the experience, and importantly the flexibility, to devise programs in the workplace relevant to the needs of workers. Community providers are well placed to understand the operations, needs and aspirations of local industries and their employees. It is therefore imperative that policy makers and funding agencies do not overlook the adult and community education sector as a source of developing workplace training expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amazing success of this sector has also been reflected in the way in which it deals with other disadvantaged people in our community who desperately need the education services that the fourth sector alone seems able to provide. The single most important program targeted to migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds is the adult migrant English program&mdash;or AMEP&mdash;which has been operating since 1947. The program is designed to assist recent migrants to acquire sufficient English to obtain appropriate employment or access to mainstream education and training and to function effectively within society. However, this is due to suffer large funding cuts. It is a great pity that it is not being funded at a sufficient level at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During our inquiry in Adelaide a Turkish lady came before us who was a qualified accountant in Turkey; she had no English skills. When she came out here she received priority for an English program, but because of lack of funds she was entitled to only 300 hours of training, enough to get a person up to conversational English level. To get to a normal standard of English she would have needed another 300 hours. To become a functioning accountant she would have needed a further 300 hours. However, this was not available. Therefore, instead of the lady becoming a productive member of our society and being an accountant, she went on to social welfare. Instead of being a benefit to our country economically, she became an economic drain on the country. It would have been so much more cost effective to spend the money to increase her language skills so that she could contribute to society and take her proper place in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds are in a similar position. They do not receive training from the formal sector and are turning more and more to adult and community education to provide for their needs. Many prefer this sort of education; they prefer to be in neighbourhood houses and similar community settings which they consider more convenient and less intimidating than the more formal approach of the AMEP classes. In rural areas where AMEP has had a low profile, community providers were in any case the only accessible source of education for migrants who lacked the language skills to attend TAFE courses. Their numbers are likely to increase substantially without any commensurate increase in government funding to the adult and community education sector, despite the fact that in effect it will be undertaking some of the work previously done through AMEP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among those who are, or could be, even greater beneficiaries of adult and community education are people with disabilities. The proportion of Australians suffering from a disability is high and is expected to reach 24 per cent by the end of the century. People with disabilities face the common problem of gaining access to the established sectors of education. These constraints, thankfully, do not apply to the same extent to those in the fourth sector, enabling a significant contribution to be made to their continuing education. Encouragement and resourcing of the sector, therefore, would be consistent with the desire to actively promote integration of people with disabilities into the community. But often the resources are just not available on a long term basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During a visit by the Committee to the Hunter we saw a group of psychiatric patients going through a basic literacy course. The program obviously was of great benefit to the patients and they were making considerable progress. However, it was a pilot program and future funding was in doubt. The health department saw it as the responsibility of the education department, and education saw it as the responsibility of the health department. Such courses fill a real need. Adult and community education has many programs that do not fit into traditional funding mechanisms. This sector tends to be demand driven and client centred and is therefore better able to respond to the needs of individual participants than the formal education system. It is flexible enough, for example, to increase the time allowed for mastery of a particular skill if this will facilitate its attainment by slow learners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These specific examples show why this forgotten sector is important to the development and future of Australia. Yet the sector is still ignored in any major reviews into education, and Australia is the only OECD country without a national policy on adult education. This report draws attention to the lack of funding to the sector, particularly in relation to the other more conventional sectors of education which are increasingly overburdened and expect the fourth sector to take up the slack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these considerations in mind, the Committee made several recommendations. An aspect that came across very clearly from almost all submissions to the Committee was the need for a national policy. Without the necessary support from the Commonwealth, the fourth sector is in great danger of disintegration. Recognition and immediate action are necessary in developing a national policy to act as a directional and cohesive force in this area of education. To this end the Committee has recommended that a working party be established to formulate this policy. This development will need great input from the adult and community educators so that the needs of users and the special flexibility and responsiveness of the sector is maintained and so that it does not become fettered with bureaucracy and government directives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Official recognition at the Federal level will lead to increased funding and the adult and community education sector will be better equipped to meet the challenges that lie ahead, to expand and to contribute even further towards a more productive, educated and confident Australia. I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to address a few brief remarks to the tabling of the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on the emergence of adult and community education. The compilation of this report is the first I have been able to observe from start to finish since I entered this Parliament. The very process of information gathering which has resulted in this report has been important because, as has been previously said, this sector of education is very different from the other education sectors which are given much more formal recognition and which have attached to them a greater degree of government and bureaucratic control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elements of this sector are often unable to communicate with each other. They do not often have the opportunity to meet, to share information and to provide information to the Government or its representatives. In the course of the public hearings that were conducted in the process of compiling the report, information sharing was taking place. I suppose that it could be argued that community education was taking place at those public hearings. I suggest that there was certainly a considerable amount of education of Committee members taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions, witnesses at our hearings presented information which we would have been unable to glean in any other forum. Some 305 submissions on this particular topic were presented to the Committee. A considerable number of those 305 submissions were not just from individuals but from groups representing considerable numbers of people from other interest groups. It really was a very wide net that was cast in order to gather information to present to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Chairman was hinting that he would like to see the report become another best-seller for the Committee. There was some reaction to that suggestion. I think that the report does deserve to enter the best-seller stakes because it is unique in the field of adult and community education. In the past, it has been very difficult for researchers to describe fully the extent of the provision of adult and community education. The Committee used the phrase `to map the provision of adult and community education'. The Committee found that that mapping process was very expensive and that it has not been successfully achieved in this field. The reasons for this failure are soon evident and very obvious. For instance, we have the geographical limitations of this country. Also, what is included in the definition of adult and community education is very wide. In fact, the definition gives some trouble to people who are trying to map what is provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that process we very soon realised that there was a unique opportunity available to the Senate Committee because of the resources that are provided to committees in general. I think that is something that ought to be noted. I think that the resources which are available to a committee&mdash;to investigate, to travel, to invite submissions and to facilitate the provision of information&mdash;are unique. They have resulted in a description of what is provided which is not easily obtainable in any other way. That would justify this report becoming a best-seller because those people who are interested in adult and community education would have difficulty in finding a similar compilation of information to that presented in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report, as well as being comprehensive, is also a little provocative&mdash;as it should be; as it deserves to be; and as the providers of adult and community education would want it to be. They would expect a description of their sector of education to provoke the decision makers into recognising the tremendous benefits provided to Australia by this sector. They would also expect it to provoke the decision makers into not only recognising the sector but also increasing the provision of government resources to this sector. This report does that. It is just provocative enough to engender further discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairman said on our behalf at most of the hearings that he would like&mdash;we supported him in this request; I know that I speak on behalf of my colleagues who sat on the Committee&mdash;those people who made submissions to the Committee to regard the report as an opportunity to engage in further debate, to make comments and to follow the report through. He did not want people just to consider this report as the end point in the process. It certainly is not, and it was not intended to be. In being provocative and asking for further debate, I am sure that the report will not be left on the shelf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report explores recent developments which are likely to increase demands on the adult and community education sector. Although those developments may be self-evident to some people, the report at least spells out the reasons why adult and community education will be expanding in the near future. The report teases out developments such as workplace restructuring and the need for regular upgrading of workers' skills which will increase the demands on this sector. Senator Tierney mentioned the dramatic changes occurring in the status of people with disabilities in the community. There is an increase in the number of people who are moving from institutions into the community. Such a move will increase the demand for the provision of courses and support from the adult and community education sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also likely to be increased demands on this sector as a result of changes in community attitudes to training as labour market reforms become increasingly evident&mdash;especially with the labour market itself becoming competitive. Also, an increasing number of elderly people in our community will require intellectual stimulation, company and new interests. These are all vital changes in the community that will bring about an increased demand for the provision of services within the adult and community education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes recommendations which are connected with those changes. As Senator Tierney mentioned and as was mentioned in the Chairman's tabling speech, an important recommendation was that a working party be established for the development of national policy on adult and community education. That recommendation may seem a little glib or superficial, but the Committee did not make that recommendation in that manner. It was a very carefully considered recommendation which is central to the thrust of the report. Highlighted on page 161 of the report is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for government recognition was the most consistently stated requirement of all who contributed to the Inquiry. . . </PARA>
<PARA>To be able to distil that requirement from the 305 submissions and those who presented themselves as witnesses was not a difficult task because it was a consistent and loudly stated recommendation from those who contributed. The Committee followed that through with a recommendation not that a national policy just emerge from somewhere within the bowels of bureaucracy but rather that a working party be established to develop that. Senator Tierney mentioned the possible structure of that working party. The function of the development of a national policy would also serve to afford the sector the recognition which it has long been denied. That development, a central one which has been consistently argued for, would be most welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not just stand here and read out a bunch of recommendations, but there are a couple that deserve highlighting. I want to mention one in particular. The Committee recommends on page 130 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the Commonwealth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)extend its support for existing projects directed towards the establishment of national schemes for competency standards, recognition of prior learning, credit transfer and related matters;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It goes on to recommend that the Commonwealth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)specifically require that such projects take into account the needs of, and recognise the skills formation role of, the adult and community education sector.</PARA>
<PARA>A recommendation such as that recognises that the adult and community education sector is a fundamental and integral part of the whole of our education provision in this nation; that it cannot be separated out from the other sectors. The integral role that it performs should be recognised by the growing trend towards demands for accrediting and recognising educational opportunities that people have taken throughout their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the whole concept of lifelong learning is that  people undertake some formal education and gain some accreditation for that, then go to work and acquire different skills. They then involve themselves in some form of education such as that provided by the so-called fourth sector&mdash;the Adult and Community Education Centre&mdash;to integrate all of those undertakings and skills that have been acquired and perhaps then to gain a further accreditation, a further certificate or a further award. That is the process which in reality should take place and should be encouraged to take place. That final step of pulling all those skills and education opportunities together is begging to take place in the near future. To put that into effect is to recognise the role that adult and community education plays and the contribution that it could make in the future. So that recommendation on page 130 is very important to the process of adding to the recognition and the formal inclusion of adult and community education in our entire educational spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other recommendation that I want to draw attention to briefly appears on page 121 of the report and reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that whenever government agencies provide a grant to adult and community education providers for the delivery of a particular program that grant shall include, as a matter of course, a component specifically to provide for child care.</PARA>
<PARA>That is because of a lack of child-care facilities, and it has been identified to our Committee by a number of witnesses as a significant deterrent to participation. I know that there is some controversy about child-care legislation which may be proposed and which may reach this place in the near future, but the controversy was well foretold by witnesses appearing before our Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem self-evident again that participation would be limited to people who had a need for child-care but where child-care was not provided. It seems that the demarcation between education and other social provisions has enabled the situation to continue to the detriment of the people who could well benefit from development of their skills, a development which would benefit the community as a whole as much as them personally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to draw attention to another recommendation that the Committee came to, which appears at page 115 of the report. After some considerable discussion as to how we would word this recommendation, I am pleased to see that we resolved in the end to state the recommendation in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that State and Territory governments establish a grant aid scheme for prisoners to meet the costs of fees and materials incurred during further education and training while in prison.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, in our travels in compiling information for this report, we were fortunate enough to be able to visit several penal establishments. Some of those were much more enlightened than others in their provision of education as part of the rehabilitation process, which we should all now agree is the function of a prison rather than the retribution process which prisons seemed to be identified with the past. If we are to provide for the rehabilitation of prisoners and education or retraining is what is deemed most appropriate for them, then surely there should be no extra disadvantages placed in their way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a barrier in many situations where, of course, State governments and other providers of education are seeking the application of the user pays principle. It is impossible for prisoners to meet that principle when course fees and materials charges are being made. This recommendation came forward after our inspections and after we saw that it was evident that such a provision should be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I conclude on the other subject that I thought was particularly important in compiling the information; that is, that Australia has the opportunity, especially in this area, to expand its understanding and be at the forefront of the world's understanding of how modern technology can be used to improve the provision of education for our citizens. There have been many experiments and many opportunities taken in Australia to use technology to surmount the difficulties that are posed by our geography. We are aware of the School of the Air and the use of radio in a pioneering sense to deliver educational opportunities to our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of challenges that have been met by Australian communities in the past are still being met. We heard that the effective use of the simple technology of fax machines is providing people who are otherwise isolated from educational provision with opportunities that would otherwise be denied to them. We have also heard of trial projects that are taking place throughout Australia in using other technologies to further the provision of education to our citizens. I hope that we are imaginative and are able to use the funding that the Commonwealth might provide to expand these opportunities further. They are opportunities not only to expand our own educational provision, but also to export technologies to elsewhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a sunrise industry from which Australia could derive great benefit; it is the development of technology in providing education to people who are at a distance from other educational providers. We know that there is a booming opportunity in the use of interactive computer-based learning. We know that there is the possibility of using the satellite transfer of electronic signals. We know that the distances can be reduced in an immediate sense throughout Australia, but we know that these technologies are not being used sufficiently in that way to ensure that all people who are isolated are able to take part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that lack of provision which is the real handicap to the expansion of community and adult education throughout Australia. But we should see it as an opportunity rather than a handicap because if we develop that technology sufficiently in Australia we can export it throughout the world. We should be exporting it because it is a significant advantage to us and it has the potential to be a really significant income earner. I hope that this report will provoke not only government-based enterprises to explore that but will also be a means for private providers, investors and entrepreneurs to see the opportunities offered by entering the adult and community education sphere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From our point of view, very little needs to be said about the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) and related Bills, largely because my colleague Warwick Smith in the other place has given a very extensive analysis of the implications of the Bills and our intention to support them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Reforms in this area are long overdue, particularly in radio. As in many areas of micro-economic reform, the Government has been moving slowly and this is no exception. The measures for the faster delivery of new FM commercial and supplementary radio services to regional listeners under the regional radio program are to be welcomed. The replacement of the current establishment in AM-FM conversion fees with an FM access fee to be paid by all commercial and supplementary non-metropolitan radio licensees before they commence service on the FM band is an improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to permit a supplementary radio licence to serve an area smaller than that served by the related commercial radio licences would also seem to be a step in the right direction. Although one can argue that there is no good reason why an existing AM operator should not be entitled to automatically apply for an FM licence, one would hope that, as part of the evolution, that will be seriously addressed in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of matters of some significance, although they do not warrant amendments, let alone opposition. One is the watering down of the term `commercial viability' which has long been an article of faith in the radio industry. Those of us who have been close to it on occasions have always received representations from FARB and others about how terribly important that concept is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst one can understand their concern, if one genuinely wants to encourage new players into the market by adhering to a strict definition of commercial viability in requiring the ABT to take it into account each time a licence is granted, one is effectively putting in place an important barrier to entry. Therefore, we welcome the winding back of that concept. It probably could go further and, as Mr Smith pointed out, there are a number of areas that also warrant overhaul in conjunction with the change in emphasis on commercial viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to go much more towards a deregulated industry, and we think that now is an appropriate time to do that, we need to look at some of these other concepts which can clog up the system inordinately. I recall some of those licence hearings were sometimes two and three years out-of-date because of the backlog. In most instances they were pro-forma exercises but they required the applicants to put in an enormous amount of preparation on the off-chance that someone might want to come along and object. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is, I am sure, scope for even more deregulation and freeing up of the system. At the end of the day, this is a mature industry and one in which most of the major players are professionals. Those who are not have probably gone broke by now. There are some very experienced and capable people; they are the ones who will survive under any regime and they are the ones in many respects who have the most to gain from a more deregulated approach in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we welcome the thrust of these changes. In many respects they will make life a lot easier and, hopefully, cheaper in compliance costs for the bulk of the industry. But there are still some unnecessary restrictions, for example, on the level of Australian music content and certainly the labour market limitations that riddle this and most other areas at present because this Government somehow regards labour market deregulation as not part and parcel of micro-economic reform. We all understand why that is; it will pay the penalty in due course. But if those areas can be properly addressed and we can free up the system then we are well on the way to getting a more viable and enduring radio industry. For those reasons we support the package of Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill now before the Senate, which is the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill 1991, is one of the most interesting Bills we have had before the Parliament for quite a while, and it is one that I have enjoyed spending some time examining. The Bill seeks to amend the parent Act of 1959. As Senator Powell just said, this Bill has been very heavily amended by the Government since its presentation to the House of Representatives when the Opposition voted against it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the greatest respect to the Government, this Bill represents some very muddled thinking. It could well be argued that the Bill ought to be defeated and that we will not be any worse off. If it was defeated, the Government could take time to think its position through and come up with something that is more appropriate for the Australian travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government is trying to do is not clear. I think I know what it is trying to get at, but one simply could not be certain, given the changes we have had to this Bill. If we pass this Bill, not only will some of the problems we presently have still exist but also we will create a number of new ones, which I will refer to later in my address. As I said a few minutes ago, the best thing for the Parliament and the country would be if the Bill was withdrawn and thought through properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is pushing ahead with the Bill as a matter of urgency and with an air of haste which is quite clear when you talk to the Government about it. The reason for the Government's panic is that it is arguing that, if the Bill does not go through, the United States is likely to sign Montreal Amendment Protocols Nos 3 and 4 and Australian carriers would then be exposed to unlimited liability with respect to the United States. The Government is saying that an Australian airline could be taken to court and there would be no upper limit on the liability that it would bear towards passengers or cargo in the event of injury or death to those passengers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make two points about the proposition that there is urgency. One is an opinion and the other is fact. The Government says that it is acting on advice from the Australian foreign affairs department in Washington that the United States is very close to signing Montreal Protocols Nos 3 and 4 in the Congress. I have a very great respect for the Australian foreign affairs officers in Washington and for their professional judgment. I probably know the people involved and know them quite well. But the advice I am getting is to the contrary. My advice is that the United States will not in the near future, and probably never will, sign the Montreal agreements. After all, it has had nearly 16 years to do so. The matter is simply bogged down in the Congress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States has lifted the liability of carriers from the present Warsaw-Hague conventions up to a minimum of $75,000 for carriers operating into and out of the United States. But whether the United States signs is a matter of opinion and it is something we will not resolve here this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is a matter of fact. If the United States Congress does sign the Montreal Amendment Protocols or becomes a signatory to that convention, it follows that the United States will have to give a six-month period before it moves away from the existing protocols. In other words, if the United States goes ahead with MAP Nos 3 and 4 and its supplemental compensation plan and decides to denounce the existing Warsaw conventions, there will be six months for the Australian Government to come in with legislation to cover Australian carriers for any anomaly that might arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another fact in relation to that matter also has to be considered: for Montreal Protocols Nos. 3 and 4 to take effect there have to be 30 signatories. I am told that at the moment only 19 countries have signed up. If the Americans sign, that makes only 20 countries&mdash;or 21 including Australia. It is a long way short of the threshold required to pass the convention into law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put what we are talking about into perspective. We are talking about passengers and cargo that are carried by an airline and the responsibility that the airline bears for compensation in the event of death or injury to those passengers or to loss or damage of that cargo. The first protocol that was introduced to cover this was the Warsaw Convention of 1929 when aviation, as honourable senators would recall, was very much in its infancy. It was several magnitudes less in volume, both with respect to passengers and freight, to that which it is today. An interesting sideline to that is that the first Warsaw Convention was introduced in 1929 as an interim measure, yet here we are nearly 61 years later and one of those protocols is still in place. In 1955 it was amended with the Hague-Warsaw amendments. They virtually doubled the liability that the carriers bore in the event of an accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today about 130 states are signatories to the either the original Warsaw Convention or the Warsaw Convention as modified by the Hague Protocol. Those conventions have some very important characteristics, and I would like to mention a couple of them. First of all, there is the principle of strict liability. Strict liability means that the carrier has an obligation to pay in the event of a claim, without the claimant having to go through all the business of taking out a court action against the airline. We can imagine the great cost involved to a person who is fighting an airline, which has very much greater funds than a private citizen. Of course, when there is an argument about an operational matter, the airline can call on enormous technical resources as compared to those available to a private individual. That is the strict liability. To get an action against a company, someone can claim without having to go through a great court procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing is that the Warsaw Convention provides what is known as a breakable liability. In other words, if someone does feel that there has been gross negligence by the carrier, that person can resort to legal action and the liability limit, therefore, is not fixed. If, say, the limit is set at $100,000 in the event of a loss of life, and if a person can show that the reason for the accident was gross negligence on behalf of the airline, that person can go to court and that $100,000 is not the upper limit to compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third great thing about the present conventions is that signatories&mdash;by that I mean airlines&mdash;can set higher limits than are provided as a minimum. If the airlines feel that their cover is not adequate, is not reasonable with respect to current costs, they can lift them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally these liabilities were defined in terms of gold. The great change that the Government has made in the amending legislation that is now before us is to resolve the great uncertainty that has bedevilled these conventions since 1929 as to the level of compensation the airlines had to meet. Originally, the levels were defined in terms of gold and the gold standard. Since gold now operates in a free market and the price of gold fluctuates, the industry is devoid of a realistic benchmark. One of the difficulties with the existing legislation has been the problem of equating a value under standards which are no longer applicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been resolved by the Government agreeing to delete a series of clauses in the Bill that it presented in the House of Representatives, setting values for compensation and now using exclusively the International Monetary Fund special drawing rights provisions. The special drawing right is an arbitrary unit based on five international currencies&mdash;a basket of currencies&mdash;which in itself is a floating value, but at least it provides some benchmark for setting compensation limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1971, seeing shortcomings that principally arose from the gold standard and setting a value on liability, there was a conference which led to the Additional Protocol No. 3 of Montreal, which I referred to earlier, which basically relates to passengers, and the Montreal Protocol No. 4 which basically relates to cargo. Those new conventions were placed on the table in 1975. As I said earlier, since 1975 so far only 19 countries have signed up as signatories to them. In the interim, most airlines have raised their limits above the original limits of the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol. Under those conventions the facility exists for airlines unilaterally to raise their limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Still, 30 per cent of international carriers coming into and leaving Australia are operating under the original Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol. The Government is proposing here that we sign the Montreal Convention. There are some difficulties with that, in my opinion. The first problem is that it does set an unbreakable limit. In other words, in the case of gross negligence there is no way that a claimant on the airlines can exceed the limit of 100,000 SRD units which is the liability of the carrier who is a signatory to the Montreal Convention. There is no opportunity for the carriers, unilaterally, to lift their limit if they feel that it is inadequate. Very clearly, the limit set at the present time of 100,000 SRD units is far too low. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I would like Senator Baume to listen to the answer instead of performing all the time. The rate of 10.75 per cent was the highest projected figure under the Budget predictions of August 1991. It was also projected in the Budget that that figure would decline in the second half of the financial year. I see no reason for anticipating that that will not happen. If one looks at employment projections for a longer period of time, under the Opposition's scenario or ours, unemployment will be higher than we were traditionally used to in the 1960s and in parts of the 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is very well aware of the massive trade opportunities for efficient coal producers like Australia if the protected markets of certain European countries, particularly Germany, were to be opened. Protected coal production in the EC equates to roughly 65 per cent of total world trade in coal. The implications of that for us are obvious. It is for this reason that Australia has taken a leadership role in seeking to highlight these issues and to have coal protectionism addressed for the first time in the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations. Bilateral negotiations on commitments with the European Community are well advanced. We are seeking the early elimination of remaining border protection, including tariffs and quotas, and firm commitments on phased reductions in subsidised production. For its part, Australia would give certain commitments on supply side issues of concern to importing countries. These would address security of supply aspects, including encouraging foreign investment in the Australian industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are encouraged by the recent announcement in Germany of phased cuts in subsidised coal production.

I know that is an allegation that has been constantly made and repeated over the years about Mr Whitlam's attitudes on that issue. I believe it is the case that Mr Whitlam does not accept the accuracy of those sorts of assertions that are constantly made and I would accordingly not premise any answer on an acceptance of the accuracy of what the honourable senator says.

Further wage increases are linked to the achievement of further reductions in hours taken to produce each water heater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, as a consequence of this workplace agreement, we have seen increased productivity and a reduction in unit labour costs, achieved without the trade-off of any award conditions at all. We have seen the beginnings of an important cultural change in this workplace, for which both management and unions should be congratulated. Rheem Australia in the 1970s and in the early 1980s had a history of turbulent and dispute ridden industrial relations. That seems now to have changed. Because of the stability engendered in the industrial relations climate by the accord between the Government and the ACTU, the reforms that we have made to industrial relations, and the promotion by the Government of benchmarking for world best practice, we now see the possibility of the emergence of a new cultural shift in the Australian workplace. That is an important cultural shift to create productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to be, as Senator Aulich has drawn attention to in the second part of his question, contrasted with the divisive nature of industrial relations in this country in the Fraser years. If one looks at the `Frightpack'&mdash;the proposals of Dr Hewson&mdash;one can see that our policy is in direct contradistinction to the return of conflict, confrontation, division and disputation that the Opposition's industrial relations scenario invites. I detect among workers and employers around Australia no desire to go back down the old road that they have rejected from the Fraser years.</PARA>

Is it a fact that the Government will derive $28m this year from excise imposed on avgas? Is it not a fact that the abolition of excise on avgas has been warmly welcomed by general aviation commuter operators and charter operators alike? If this move is of no use to the tourist industry, as the Minister would claim, why is a Whitsunday charter airline proudly announcing a saving of $67,500 on an annual avgas bill of $217,500?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason for that is very simple: it was done at the request of the GA industry itself. Those opposite might like to ask Senator MacGibbon for confirmation of that. It is designed to cover partially the cost of regulating the GA light aircraft sector in Australia. The industry itself decided that the most efficient and cheapest way of doing that was to charge an excise on fuel. Avgas is in fact a cost recovery exercise for the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department of Transport and Communications. As I have said, 90 per cent of the excise is paid directly to the CAA and the remainder is attributed to the Department's aerodrome cost recovery program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already announced the phasing out of that sector of the excise; we are already in the process of removing it.

That is where the money actually goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators would have noted from the annual report of the Civil Aviation Authority, which was tabled in the Senate yesterday, that the excise on avgas paid $24m directly to the Civil Aviation Authority.

According to the Opposition's document, it is committed fully to cost recovery for air safety activities.

The only other explanation is that the Opposition plans to use the GST to fund the services provided by the Civil Aviation Authority to those few Australians who plan to own a plane.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that this sector of Australian aviation probably requires&mdash;the accident statistics demonstrate why&mdash;more regulation and supervision than any other sector in Australia. For obvious reasons, the capacity of that part of the industry to pay the full costs is far more limited than commercial operators. The aviation industry told the Government it preferred to pay that part of the excise as a means of cost recovery. It is simpler and cheaper than any other direct recovery of costs as the CAA recovers it from commercial airliners. It is the industry's choice to do it that way. The Opposition plans to abolish that excise but has not demonstrated how it will cover the costs of the Civil Aviation Authority in providing that much needed regulation for civil aviation. I ask the Opposition: is it going to do it by subsidising the CAA to regulate general aviation from Consolidated Revenue?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it does. The Affirmative Action Agency's report was tabled in the Senate yesterday. The Affirmative Action Agency is set up under the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment for Women) Act 1986. It is an important Act of the Parliament. It aims to reduce inbuilt discrimination that women suffer in the workplace as a matter of course. It requires medium to large employers to examine their business practices to see that merit, not gender, is the basis for employment and promotion. The Act works by declaring those as the goals for employers and promotes them through the Agency as good employment standards. It also requires companies to file an annual report to show what they are doing about achieving those standards.</PARA></TALK.START>

The point I am making to Government members, if they would listen, is that if they will persist in talking for eight minutes in response to a 30-second question they will be interrupted by points of order. We had quite a few of those answers. If we had not had those sorts of answers, we would not have got through only five Opposition questions with a supplementary at one stage on which the President pointed out, `Will you now please answer the question about what is the cost? What is the cost?'. The Leader of the Government in the Senate did not answer the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Ministry sets out on a deliberate policy of taking eight minutes to answer a question and then does not in fact answer it, it is natural that there will be points of order and objections from the Opposition, because that is a deliberate and determined policy by the Government of disrupting Question Time.

We are the victims because we are not able to ask enough questions and this is the result of deliberate Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can see why. One could hear the silence on the Government side when we revealed that we had one of its interesting internal documents which embarrassed it for the first time during Question Time. That actually silenced Senator Collins for a while. When Government senators were aware we had that document they did what they could to make certain we could not continue our questioning on that issue. I am not revealing a dead secret: we have more questions about that, which clearly the Government does not want to answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an extraordinary statement that this was in our best interests. Why was it in the Opposition's best interests to limit the number of questions? That is the point the Government is trying to get across. What an absurd and nonsensical point! As for Senator Button's bold statement, `You wanted to debate it, so let us debate it', it is all very well to have a fair debate where people get equal amounts of time. But Senator Button's version of a fair debate is a 30-second question and an eight-minute answer. </PARA>

In other words, there has not been any decline in the number of questions asked and the number of answers given. However, having said that, I repeat that I believe that more questions could be asked and that it is an appropriate matter to be debated by the Senate, but not at this time.

I agree with Senator McKiernan to the extent that there have been a higher number of points of order, but that is because the answers are not going to the questions that are being asked. As a result, there has been a heightening of interjection across the chamber. But the root cause of it is that this is a failing government that is not giving the answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government has attempted to face only five Opposition questions, with all the evasion and extra pressure that comes when there is an attempt to misrepresent what the Opposition is saying, it is no wonder that the Opposition is seeking that the Government live up to its duty to the Parliament and to the people of Australia and answer questions&mdash;the same number of questions that we would normally expect the government of the day to answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the point of order that I took about Senator Button's misrepresentation of the Opposition, I draw attention to standing order 72, which allows questions without notice to be asked of senators who are responsible in this chamber for any matter that is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. In this case, when a Democrat senator sincerely wants to know about the inflation rate as calculated in the Opposition's policies, it is appropriate that she be not given a misrepresentation of the Opposition's calculations by someone who has not read the document sufficiently to know or who is misrepresenting the Opposition in this matter. Rather, it should be addressed to anyone in the Opposition who is able to give that answer. I believe that it is appropriate that we suspend Standing Orders so that this failing Government is brought into a position where it is seen by the Senate and the public to have been required to answer the questions and give its account for its failures. </PARA>

We can only persist by the means that are available to us in the Senate, whenever we meet, on whatever matter of business, to try to bring this Government to account. Where the Government is evasive, we expect that there will be points of order to try to bring this Government to account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to make a short personal explanation as I claim to have been misrepresented during Question Time. Senator Button, almost in a throwaway line when answering&mdash;or not answering&mdash;Senator Short's question about how much it has cost to set up the model and the cost of the wages of public servants involved in party political work, said that during Estimates hearings nobody had asked a question about this improper behaviour. I want to place it on the record that on 23 September, as recorded at page A366 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I asked a whole series of questions relating to that model. I will quote some of those questions and the answers which were given. I asked whether a model had been set up. Mr Smith of Treasury answered:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We. . . have now developed a micro-economic modelling unit which we hope to be able to use for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>It was dealing with testing various forms of taxes. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For which purpose?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Smith said:</PARA>

<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And any possible ones?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Smith said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And any possible ones.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that this model was being established at the direct request of the Treasurer, Mr Kerin, and that not only would it be able to test indirect taxes but also, as Mr Smith said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it can test a variety of things such as indirect taxes, tariffs and possibly payroll taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>I added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And it would also include a goods and services tax?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Smith replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>A thorough reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 23 September 1991 would be advisable so that people can see that the impropriety of the Government using public servants to do party political work&mdash;which the ALP ought to pay for, not the taxpayer&mdash;was very much on the record on that date and it has been consistently raised. I wanted to get the record clear. </PARA>

It was not set up to look at their loopy proposal at all; it was set up to look at a range of economic factors relating to a range of issues. The fact that the Opposition's proposal happens to fall within that category is something which Senator Bishop, out of her own mouth, has just confirmed. Senator Bishop sought to intrude suggestions about the morality of the Government using a model, which is designed for a variety of purposes, to look at goods and services taxes.

The point is that, having used the Tax Office to get taxpayers to dial their tax cuts, when those opposite were elected to government they did not deliver the tax cuts. That is the message and the moral for anybody who might be misled by this glossy package on Senator Hill's desk.

<PARA>I welcome the opportunity to remind the Senate of a few of the points contained in the Opposition's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document, which contains 600 pages of substance, a framework for returning Australia to prosperity. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), who is at the table, commences by giggling, as is his wont in these situations. This document provides a blueprint that can rebuild and reward Australia. It is to be compared with the ruinous years of Labor. Sadly, that will be the way that this Government will be recorded by so many Australians, so many who have suffered, who have had their dreams shattered, who have lost jobs, who have gone through the agony of seeing children unable to find employment&mdash;the so-called workers of the workers' party who have had their aspirations crushed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our package, the 600 pages of substance that the Minister wishes to dismiss so lightly, can now be answered by him. It has been on the table for a week and this Government has been unable to mount any attack whatsoever against it. This will be an opportunity for the Government to put down a considered counterposition. We will await with interest what the Minister puts today as the Government's answer to this substance. This substance must be contrasted with that which the Government now offers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, of the pitiful answer the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) put just over a week ago in this Parliament, which he referred to as his jobs statement. It was his answer to what he said was the nation's jobs crisis. It was an answer which was much more concerned with his own job crisis; an answer which offered no structural reform for this country, which is so desperately needed; an answer that gave no incentive for business to increase investment and to increase job opportunities; and an answer that did not deal with the major issues that have been so difficult for this Government, such as Coronation Hill, Wesley Vale and the uranium policy&mdash;the illogical aspects of the Government's policies which it is happy to acknowledge are illogical but which it cannot correct because of the difficulties within its own show. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The jobs statement was a package that offered no chance of sustainable jobs and no genuine job opportunities whatsoever. It certainly put a little bit more money back into training. Training people is worth while but they are going to need jobs at the end of it and the Government offered no hope for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That miserable contribution has to be contrasted with what the Opposition put down last week which, for the first time, offers hope, offers vision and offers two million jobs before the end of this decade. It is the substance of this package that we want debated. We have said to the Government that we are prepared to debate it. We will debate it over and over again for the next 12 or 18 months until the Government is prepared to go to the people&mdash;and the people will pass their judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the background to the Government's non-answer to our alternative, which offers hope for the future?  What is the scene in contemporary Australia at the moment?  What will be the legacy that Labor leaves?  There are one million people presently unemployed. That excludes all those who have become so dispirited that they have left the job market and all those who are working just a few hours a week, which many estimate to include up to another half a million. So 1 1/2 million Australians are either unemployed or underemployed&mdash;the legacy of Labor. What does it mean for young people in this country, 30 per cent of whom are unemployed?  That is excluding this year's school leavers joining that sorry list. How is this described by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe)?  In typical Labor terms of the class struggle, he defines it as the `class of the new poor'&mdash;the unemployed, the underemployed and the young people who now have no hope under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the worst job insecurity situation in 60 years. That will be the legacy of the Hawke Labor Government, an important part of which is the Minister who is going to respond here today and put his Government's answer to this substantial package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The picture gets worse: it gets worse in terms of the length of time that these people are unemployed. Whilst a year ago 13 weeks was the mean average time of unemployment, it is now 26 weeks. The picture continues to deteriorate. What of those people who have managed to maintain employment, who have been able to cling to jobs through this period of Labor Government? Their position is pretty miserable as well, because they are now taking home $20 a week less than when Labour came to government. Their standard of living has dropped under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who are out of work have obviously suffered most, but those who are in work have also suffered due to falling standards of living. That is the Labor legacy. That is what Labor has given to ordinary working Australians. That is what Mr Hawke refers to as sharing the burden, sharing the price for something that one day will be better. But the one day when it will be better has not come about and the position has further deteriorated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look very briefly at the position of the nation as a whole. By 1989 foreign debt had exploded to a massive 61 per cent of GDP. That is well ahead of Brazil, Mexico and these other countries with enormous debt. It is higher in terms of total debt, debt per capita and even debt as a percentage of GDP. That is where the nation stands at the moment. That will be another part of the legacy of Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, of course, is the achievement of the precious accord, which has principally had the effect of restraining productivity. It is no surprise that under Labor productivity in this country has been near the bottom of the OECD table and well behind that of our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region. Why has it got so bad?  Is it just the accord?  No, it is not just the accord; it is the Government's approach to taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrast is so vivid between our package and the Government's approach to taxation. I remind the Senate that the total tax take under Labor has risen some 34 per cent since 1983. This package will turn that around and give back to Australians the tax that they would have had to pay under Labor. It will provide them with some incentive to do better for themselves and for their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just a matter of total tax take but what has happened to the total tax rate as it applies to ordinary Australians. We now find that the top marginal rate comes into effect when only 1.25 times average male earnings is reached. So, under Labor, ordinary Australian workers on average male earnings are now just under the level at which they will attract the top marginal rate. That has been Labor's legacy. That has been the disincentive that has crushed people and has put them out of work by putting their employers out of work. The people will not forget it. They also will not forget because we will not let them. Bracket creep&mdash;the hidden tax&mdash;has ripped $22 billion off Australian taxpayers since the Hawke Government came to power. Of course, the contrast is again as stark as ever with the package put down by Dr Hewson. Those things will not happen under the next coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate of what has happened to fuel taxes. I suppose Senator Button is going to refer to fuel taxes. We thought those opposite would yesterday but they backed off. In 1983 Federal petrol tax was just 9c a litre; now under Labor it is 26c a litre. The alternative is in the Liberal-National coalition's Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the achievement of Labor? There must have been an achievement. The greatest achievement, which Senator Alston will remind the Senate about, is in the expansion of welfare. It is the fastest growing area of Budget outlays under the Labor Government; the Government has had the gall to boast about this growth in welfare. In this country of opportunity, $30 billion a year is now spent on welfare, largely because people are out of jobs&mdash;and more of them are being pushed into the position where they have no choice but to turn to the state for help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tragic situation, and it has driven us to provide a real and substantial alternative&mdash;a total package that can give people hope and opportunity for the future. I refer to people in those businesses that have been driven out of operation by Labor's record real interest rates, who have suffered from the recession that we had to have&mdash;the legacy of the former Treasurer, who no doubt will soon be back as head of the Labor Party&mdash;who have been driven out of business under the record number of bankruptcies in this miserable period of Labor government. I refer to people&mdash;not only young people&mdash;who have wanted the opportunity to better themselves. Everyone knows that the higher the qualifications the better chance of getting a job. We find that some 30,000 people last year were turned away from tertiary study in this country. Again, Labor's policies have failed to provide opportunities for young people to better themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why in our package we refer to this as Labor's human misery because so much misery has resulted from failed policies and a Government that has not been able to get it right and has had too long to get it right. It has led to so many Australians feeling helpless; so much despair in our community, which is demonstrated in all the opinion polls that are taken; and so many Australians who are concerned for their children and their grandchildren. For the first time, an Australian generation has the prospect of leaving to its successors a depressing legacy of a lower standard of living than it inherited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the background. That is Labor's record of so-called achievement. It is against that background that we have put our alternative, which we submit is a radical alternative; we do not shy away from that. It is a challenging alternative for the Australian people. It is a massive alternative in that it encompasses so many areas of responsibility of government and gives Australians a real opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, above all, a strategy for jobs and growth&mdash;the two big areas of failure by this Government. It is a strategy that has been designed and independently assessed to provide two million jobs by the end of the decade and to give people a chance again. It is a strategy that will give us the opportunity to commence the massive task of retiring government debt. It is calculated to retire some $13 billion of government debt. Even there one sees the contrast. When this Government sells assets it puts the money straight into general revenue, which is expended on its programs. Under our package, when we sell assets the money will be used to retire debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will we stimulate Australia to embrace these new opportunities?  We will do it with the largest personal income tax cuts in Australia's history: a 30 per cent reduction in income tax&mdash;round about $13 billion that Australian taxpayers will not have to pay in the form of income tax. Nothing could be done by a government to lift incentive more dramatically and to encourage Australians to work that extra hour, stay for that extra hour of overtime and do that bit more, because they will gain a benefit with which they can benefit their families in turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will abolish seven taxes: the whole of the wholesale sales tax, $9.4 billion; and the whole of the payroll tax, which Senator Button yesterday tried to dismiss as being simply a subject that we were talking about, $5.8 billion. That money will be paid to the States, provided the States abolish payroll tax. The petroleum products excise&mdash;another $6.6 billion&mdash;will go. I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that 55 per cent of that excise falls on business and this package has a lot to do with giving business the opportunity to grow and employ people. The superannuation lump sum tax will go; the customs duties will be phased out by the year 2000; and Labor's training guarantee levy will go&mdash;the typical way of Labor which is to compel rather than encourage an outcome. The coal export duty will go as well. Seven of Labor's taxes will go. </PARA>

It provides a brand new health policy which can remedy so many of the faults contained in Labor's health policy. It will get rid of the queues and get people transferred out of the public system where they cannot get a bed and put them into the private system where beds are available.

A lot of Liberals who were part of the Fraser years are still with us. Mr Howard, Mr Peacock, Dr Hewson, who was then an adviser, and Senator Michael Baume are still here.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to implement the coalition's Fightback program offering vision, hope and jobs to the millions of Australians who have suffered under the ruinous years of Labor.</PARA>
<PARA>I support the urgency motion because the Fightback package gives hope to many Australians. It gives hope to families, farmers, businessmen, unemployed and our youth. It even has the support of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) because he endorsed a consumption tax in 1985. He said that he believed that Mr and Mrs Australia wanted a fairer tax system and a more efficient system and that they would respond positively to the proposal. Even Wayne Goss, the Premier of Queensland, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I supported the consumption tax at the tax summit because it is so efficient. The sort of tax that could sweep away a number of inefficient and expensive ways to collect taxes . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And so he went on. I say to the Australian Democrats that they will be among the few people in Australia who do not support the package. The package has had wide endorsement from all sections of the community. I warn the Australian Democrats that if they stand in the way of this package it will be like standing in front of an avalanche. They will be swept out of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to Senator Button. I think it is one of the few times that Senator Button has come into a debate in this Parliament over the last three years. Normally he handballs the problems to Senator McMullan and Senator McMullan gives the Government's position. After listening to Senator Button, that is probably the way to go because all Senator Button did was to take us on a trip down memory lane. His speech had no substance. He gave no alternatives. In fact, even his opposition to the proposal was very ineffective. There is no doubt that over the last 12 months this Government has made three attempts to stimulate some sort of support for itself. Every attempt has failed. The currency has been devalued, as the Government goes further on. I refer to the March industry statement <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building a Competitive Australia</EMPHASIS>. Then there was the Budget. Twelve days ago we had the employment statement.

We have to see against what background we are putting forward this new Fightback proposition. For goodness sake, there is not one person in Australia of any intelligence at all who would say that the Government's policies are working. We have a gross foreign debt of $166 billion. That debt has increased from $36 billion since 1982-83. The current account deficit of $15.5 billion was $7 billion in 1982-83. Bankruptcies have increased by 72 per cent&mdash;from 5,151 in 1982-83 to 13,849 in 1990-91. Unemployment has now increased to 867,200.

I have gone out into rural Australia, as have my colleagues Senator Bjelke-Petersen and Senator O'Chee. We have gone to many meetings since the tax package was launched.

The Labor Party's unionists and workers are the people who have been the worst hit. There are now fewer and fewer people paying for more and more people as they go onto unemployment benefit. Those are the indisputable facts that face Australia at the moment. Thirty-four per cent of people are now placed on some sort of government assistance. That is what Australia faces at the moment. </PARA>

It gives a 26c reduction in diesel and petrol prices; that is a saving of $6.6 billion. That is going to reduce freight costs by around $2 billion. There will be no sales tax and no payroll tax. The payroll tax is an iniquitous tax, the very worst tax that has ever been thrust on Australians&mdash;a tax on employment. Let me just examine that in the context of primary industry. In an abattoir it costs $120 to bone out a beast. The payroll tax on that $120 is about 6 per cent. For every beast that is boned out in an abattoir, there will be a saving for primary industry and farmers of $6 per beast. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, Mr Howard said that he had tried to persuade Mr Malcolm Fraser to introduce a VAT in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in Mr Howard's statement to Parliament he went on to talk about the difficulties of broadening taxes on commodities, and asked the very basic question as to `whether there should be any exemptions' from such a tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After making some changes to the tax system, Mr Howard in fact chose not to do so; he did not go ahead with a tax on basic foodstuffs.

This proposal is tougher than the value added tax in the United Kingdom. It is tougher than the value added tax operated under Mrs Thatcher, who was extremely right wing in her views.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the plan of the Liberals in some detail&mdash;this GST, as they call it in their sanitised language, which is really a VAT, a consumption tax. It wants a tax on goods and services at a 15 per cent rate basically at each stage of production in the production process in this country. This tax represents the first proposal for a comprehensive tax on services sold in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes beyond taxing physical commodities to taxing services sold in the Australian economy. It will be a tax on electricity bills.

A whole range of services will be taxed in this proposal. Virtually everything sold in this country will be taxed at 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a much more draconian proposal than that operated in the United Kingdom by that ultra conservative, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, because her tax was selective and flexible. Her tax allowed exemptions for foodstuffs. Her tax did not include a tax on gas bills. It did not include a tax on electricity bills. Dr Hewson wants a tax on those things. Her tax in the United Kingdom did not involve a tax on public transport fares. She did not tax bus fares or train fares. This proposal will do that. Mrs Thatcher also did not tax children's clothes. This proposal will tax children's clothes. I have already pointed out the impact of this proposal on the prices of books and publications sold in this country. In the United Kingdom they were not taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Canada, where the tax was brought in this year, there is no VAT on basic foodstuffs. But in Australia, under Dr Hewson, under the Liberals and under the National Party, which claims to represent the great food producing industries of Australia, there will be a tax on foodstuffs. There will be no exemptions for foodstuffs consumed in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some other countries where a VAT operates, such as France and Germany. They do not rely, as Dr Hewson would have us do, on a single, inflexible, non-selective tax rate of 15 per cent. Those countries make a policy decision that people should pay a higher rate of tax on luxury goods than on the basic necessities&mdash;the staple goods consumed by their citizens. They have a selective tax system with multiple tax rates. People in those countries pay a higher rate of tax for luxury goods than for the basic necessities. But under Dr Hewson, under the Liberals and Nationals, there would be a 15 per cent non-selective, non-targeted tax on virtually everything consumed in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great weaknesses of the proposal put up by the Liberals is its impact on inflation and price rises in the Australian community. They claim that somehow we would have an amazingly low 4.4 per cent rise in inflation as a result of their tax. Last year the Federal Treasury did an analysis of a 15 per cent consumption tax. Its figure showed a 7 per cent rise in inflation, although I admit that that was before any proposal came forward for a reduction in petrol prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can also certainly say that since that time the Liberals have come out with a policy that would involve a rise in health charges for average Australian households. People would have to pay private health insurance. We know the impact of private health insurance on the consumer price index and inflation because we saw what happened in the mid-1980s when we encouraged Australians to go into Medicare, which had just been created. It resulted in a massive reduction in the consumer price index because health insurance costs were a major element of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing we have to bear in mind is that the Liberals somehow believe their rhetoric that a 15 per cent consumption tax collected at the retail level would have a lower effect on prices than the present 20 per cent wholesale sales tax. In many circumstances, that is a fallacious view. All we have to do is look at the profit mark-ups and the margins charged by businesses to see that, in many circumstances, the 15 per cent retail tax would lead to higher prices than the 20 per cent wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the really heroic assumptions made by the Liberals in this document&mdash;and we must really scrutinise these assumptions&mdash;is that somehow there is so much competition in the Australian economy that, if and when sales tax is abolished from goods sold in Australia, firms will automatically go out and lower their prices accordingly. The Liberals assume that somehow firms will do the right thing by the community and in every case lower their prices when sales tax is reduced. That is an heroic assumption and one that will not come true if such a proposal is introduced into this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the dreadful things about this proposal is how regressive it would be. The Liberals talked today about giving Australians vision and hope for the future. But this proposal is a tax on lower and middle income households. It is a very regressive tax and it will hit those households that spend all their incomes, because it is a tax on spending. The thing that is striking about lower income households is that they spend a disproportionately high amount of total income on food, clothing and footwear&mdash;32 per cent of all their income goes on food, clothing and footwear&mdash;and those areas are totally untaxed at the moment under the present wholesale sales tax. So food, clothing and footwear will see some of the biggest price rises in the Australian community if this crazy proposal is ever implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, those on the highest incomes in the community spend only 9 per cent of their total income on food, clothing and footwear, so they will be affected less by the price rises under this type of proposal. It is absolutely unfair that, as a result of this proposal, staple goods&mdash;the basic household necessities of food, clothing and footwear&mdash;would go up in price while luxury goods would be reduced in price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the Liberals justify massive falls in the price of luxury cars, gold watches, diamond tiaras or furs, which are the luxury goods consumed by the rich in our community? We tax them at a 30 per cent sales tax rate at present, but under the Liberals the tax would be reduced to a 15 per cent retail tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to support the matter of urgency moved by Senator Hill, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to implement the Coalition's Fightback Program offering vision, hope and jobs to the millions of Australians who have suffered under the ruinous years of Labor.</PARA>
<PARA>When this debate was being foreshadowed today and when it started, I thought we might hear a serious attempt by the Government to address the issues facing Australia and to look seriously at the Fightback proposals that have been released in the last week by the coalition through our Leader, John Hewson, to fight back for Australia, on behalf of all Australians, to help restore jobs, growth, vision, hope and opportunity to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have read dire things about what the Government was going to do to this most comprehensive and integrated package of reform proposals ever introduced into Australia by any political party either in government or in opposition. I have been surprised that, until today, the Government had not laid a glove on this set of proposals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Knowles says and pre-empts me by saying, the Government still has not laid a glove on this package. Indeed, the considered response from the Government today via the Leader of the Government in the Senate&mdash;and I am very surprised that he has not been supported in this debate by any other members of the Ministry&mdash;turned out to be a total non-response. Senator Button did not question one figure in the entire 660 pages of the package of proposals and he did not point to one hole in the package. But worse, and the saddest thing about it all, is that not only did he not address the package of proposals that have been put up by the next government of this country but he did not offer any alternative options.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pick up a few things that have been said, particularly by Senator Button. I thought I might have to pick up a couple of points made by Senator Maguire, but his speech was appallingly thin on substance. He trotted out the same rhetoric on the price effects of a goods and services tax that he has been trotting out for years. He has not changed his rhetoric by one word since seeing the package of proposals last week, which take account of many offsets to the 15 per cent goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The offsets that Senator Maguire just happened to conveniently omit include the abolition of almost $10 billion of wholesale sales tax, the Government's hidden consumption tax which has been applied in a totally discriminatory, arbitrary, unfair and inequitable form and which has increased the tax take from about $3 billion when the Government came into office in 1983 to almost $10 billion now. Senator Maguire did not mention the $22 billion of bracket creep that has occurred through this Government's failure to index the income tax rates during that period. We have given a commitment&mdash;and we will implement it as soon as we get into government&mdash;to give back bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Maguire did not mention the automatic indexation of tax takes through excises that this Government has imposed for many years without those increases even having to come through the Parliament. He did not mention that we would abolish not only the automatic indexation on the remaining excises on alcohol but also the excise on fuel at a saving to consumers, and particularly to business, of about $6.6 billion a year. He did not mention that we would negotiate with the States for the abolition of payroll tax which will save businesses costs of about $5.8 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Maguire did not mention one of those things. He did not mention that when all of those factors are netted out, the most sophisticated economic modelling in this country shows that the price effect of the goods and services tax and associated offsets is about 4.4 per cent, or 4.7 per cent if honourable senators want to include the effect of the increase in excise on tobacco. He did not mention any of those things. Senator Maguire's rhetoric has not changed in the two or three years he has been peddling this line. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The overall costs of health, if Senator Maguire cares to look at the exercise, are estimated to fall. They are estimated to fall because of the offsets as a result of the payroll tax and other taxation deductions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button also grossly mislead the Senate in the debate today. He did not say much at all. The one thing that he did say was that the assumption behind the coalition's proposals was that if we changed the tax mix everything else would follow. That just shows how Senator Button and the Government have failed even to comprehend what the coalition is about with these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have failed to comprehend that this is not just a matter of tax reform;  this is an integrated package of proposals that range through tax reform, through reform of our health financing industry, through superannuation, through micro-economic reform, through the development of a new savings strategy and through an unashamedly pro-business approach to economic policy. Only by having a pro-business approach, only by removing the burdens and the costs that have so inhibited business in this country and have made it so uncompetitive with the rest of the world are we to provide hope, vision and opportunity and, most importantly of all, jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a crisis in Australia of unprecedented magnitude, at least unprecedented in the past 60 years. We have seen progressively a major erosion in the living standards of all Australians. We have seen, and we are now seeing, nearly 1 1/2 million Australians unable to find the work they seek, and the level of employment amongst our young people is around 30 per cent. We have seen Australian families subjected to increasing pressures as a result of economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen Australia's foreign debt escalate from a figure of about $23 billion to a figure in excess of $130 billion in the eight years since this Government came to office. We have seen progressive undermining of our national productivity growth as a result of Labor's accord, which has kept wages down and in the end has resulted in record high unemployment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the tax burden on virtually all Australians rising over recent years to the stage where a person on only 15 to 20 per cent in excess of average weekly earnings is now hitting the top marginal tax rate. We have seen Australian business weighed down by increasing government regulation, high taxes, high real interest rates and a centralised wage system which have resulted in record bankruptcies, falling investment and fewer jobs. We have seen our education system, our training opportunities, failing to keep pace with the standards of the world's best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to tackle that in this country if we are to hope ever to raise our living standards and our position in the internationally competitive stakes. If we do not do that we will continue down the progressive slide which has seen relative living standards in Australia&mdash;that is, relative to the standards in other industrialised and industrialising countries in the world&mdash;falling progressively for the past couple of decades. That is what we are about in this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are about trying to turn Australia around so that the despair, the job loss, the lack of hope, the lack of vision and the lack of opportunity throughout the Australian community today&mdash;all summed up, perhaps, in one line:  total lack of leadership&mdash;is reversed. That is why the Australian public has reacted so positively to this package. Honourable senators can look at individual bits and pieces or at one piece or another contained in the package&mdash;in my opinion, they are all universally good&mdash;and can say things about this, that and the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason our proposals have really appealed to the Australian electorate is that they are an attempt, and a very successful attempt, by a political party for the first time in memory in this country to say to the people of Australia:  we have a party with leadership;  we have a party with vision;  we have a party with ideas;  we have a party with policies;  we have a party that is prepared to put all those things together to show the people of Australia that there is a better life ahead for ourselves but, more particularly, for our kids and our grandchildren, and that we do not have to continue to slide down the slippery slope of ever more foreign debt, which is a millstone around our neck with which we will have to grapple for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying to the Australian people:  unless we make an urgent start to tackling the fundamental structural problems and weaknesses in our society and our economy, the prospect of returning Australia to the growth path, to the sort of society with the values that most of us grew up with and believed in, and still do, will become increasingly intractable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time available in the debate there are many additional things one would want to say. I repeat that I am amazed, absolutely amazed, that in this debate today&mdash;Senator Walsh, who is speaking after me, may correct the record a little by saying something of substance&mdash;we have heard so little from the Government of any serious content. I will just quickly mention two things in the time remaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button totally mislead the Senate when he referred to the so-called scenarios on page 342 of the coalition's main taxation and expenditure reform document. He should have been comparing the information in the base case, which is the growth prospects for Australia with the continuation of the present policies, with what is called the high road scenario. The comparison of that with the high road scenario encompasses the policies that are essentially contained in the Fightback proposal. There honourable senators will find an enormous  difference  in  productivity growth, gross domestic product growth, investment growth, and so on between the two situations. The document is saying that, if we continue in the way in which we are going now, we will never get out of our present problems. Indeed, we will just worsen them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to mention briefly relates to the confidential letter from the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) to the chairman of the Caucus economic and industrial relations committee, Dr Charlesworth, that I tabled earlier in the Senate. I make the point that in that letter the Treasurer has made it clear that he acknowledges the inequity, inefficiency and misallocation of resources that apply through having just a wholesale sales tax because it does not relate to services. One of the fundamental reasons that we are trying to change the tax system is to get more fairness, efficiency and equity into the taxation system. </PARA>

Following on from what Senator Short has said, there has initially been a popular response to the Opposition's package as it has been portrayed. One of the reasons for this is the disastrous unemployment situation that Australia is facing, and the people are grasping for answers. Frankly, we need to study the fine print of the package. I have not had the opportunity as yet to do that, but I will do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give one example. Clearly, the GST will result in an increase in the cost to families of food and clothing&mdash;normal day-to-day costs, including essential costs. It is my view that the offsetting provisions, including the increases in family allowances, will not cover those costs. In fact, I believe that they are applied to an existing low base and that existing low base will be built into the whole system for ever and a day. That is one of the things that we need to look at. Unfortunately, this proposal will also entrench into the system the concept that family allowances are in the nature of welfare rather than a tax transfer system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of the reasons I have outlined, if I were going to be present for the vote on this motion, I would have had to vote against it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition's new tax, which we have been debating this afternoon, has been named, for cosmetic and presentational reasons, a goods and services tax. In fact, it is a value added tax and I will refer to it correctly as a value added tax henceforth. The value added tax which the Opposition is proposing provides not so much a vision as a mirage. The Opposition's proposals contain a motley collection of false assumptions and fraudulent assertions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overwhelming false assumption is that Australia is a high tax country, especially a high income tax country. The fact is that, when looking at total taxation as a proportion of gross domestic product, Turkey is the only country which is unambiguously lower on the entire OECD scale than Australia, and the United States is lying about level with Australia. It is true that Australian governments raise a proportionately higher amount of their total revenue from income tax but, if we look at income tax revenue in isolation, Australia is still bordering on the bottom third of OECD countries. So the assumption that income tax is unsustainably high in Australia is demonstrably false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal fraudulent assertion is that this change in the tax system will boost savings. Indeed, the executive summary in the document which was put out last week asserts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction of a 15 per cent Goods and Services Tax (with specific items zero-rated or exempt) that will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .       . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. boost our national productivity and savings</PARA>
<PARA>That is an unambiguous fib, as Dr Hewson, in a previous mode, clearly acknowledged. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 13 April last year Dr Hewson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 15 per cent across the board consumption tax . . . may only make a marginal effect on saving.</PARA>
<PARA>It has been pointed out that there are other measures in the Opposition's package which purport to boost savings, such as tax concessions on interest earnings, cash deposits and that sort of thing. The only thing one can be certain about with respect to those measures is that there will be public sector dissaving because of the income forgone from the interest rate concessions. Whether these measures do anything other than reorder the existing total pool of savings held by private individuals is suspect. When one puts those two things together, there is at least a strong possibility that those measures will lead to total dissaving rather than enhanced saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other fraudulent assertion is the allegation that this value added tax will get rid of the allegedly damaging effects of payroll tax on the economy. I will deal with that in more detail later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say quite honestly and sincerely that for some time I have had a considerable amount of respect for John Hewson. Therefore, I was both surprised and disappointed at the essentially populist nature of the package which has been presented or, at least, the broad streak of populism which runs through it. I expected better than that from John Hewson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the payroll tax to which I have already referred. Then there is the cheap petrol. Cheap petrol will get cheap cheers, but it sends out an appalling message to the public about the likely future prices of petroleum and will take Australia, again with the United States, right down to the bottom of the OECD table to the extent to which petrol is taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that were not bad enough, we then have this add on. It appears that farmers will be totally exempt from even a value added tax on petrol. Presently, for very good reasons&mdash;justifiably so&mdash;farmers receive a total refund of distillate excise because that is, in almost all cases, an input to agricultural production. The amount of petrol used in agricultural production is negligible. I make this very important distinction between petrol used in agricultural production and petrol used by farmers for private motoring, just like everybody else uses petrol. I speak as someone who still maintains a close association with agriculture, who has been a practising wheat and sheep farmer for more than 20 years, when I say that the amount of petrol used in agricultural production is negligible. This is a rort clearly inserted to buy off potential opposition from the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next bit of populism contained in the Opposition's document is that we should shift public servants from Canberra to Sydney. Can honourable senators envisage any proposition more stupid than packing off public servants from this city to another city which is already bursting at the seams, the social infrastructure of which cannot cope with the population which is already there? Just as a bonus, can honourable senators imagine a bigger repudiation of the National Party's alleged policy of decentralisation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work for the dole&mdash;that is always popular with people who, firstly, believe that the unemployed are work shy; and, secondly, have failed to count the additional cost to the Commonwealth Budget of organising and administering work for the dole schemes. Then there is the doublespeak about immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no fundamental need for the structural change to the taxation system of the type the Opposition is proposing. The transition costs of the change will be high. The ongoing costs in both the public and private sector of administration will also be significant. Just the public sector cost of the value added tax in the United Kingdom administration amounts to 2 per cent of revenue, which is almost four times the cost of administering Australia's present wholesale sales tax system and about double the cost of administering our income tax system. That does not count the costs in the private sector, which I would expect will be at least equal to the public sector cost. That is not significant. But the high transition costs are really the most dangerous element of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition claimed that the CPI effect of its total package would be 4.4 per cent. It did not take long to find out that it had not factored into that 4.4 per cent figure the 25 per cent increase in excise on tobacco which, in the Opposition's own documents, is put at 0.3 per cent. That takes the CPI effect up to 4.7 per cent. The Opposition has not counted the effect of its health policy changes, which will increase the cost of private health insurance, the road transport element, the Federal Airports Corporation and so on. That 4.4 per cent figure was intrinsically unbelievable. When it has been properly costed by Treasury, I anticipate that the figure will be somewhere between 5 and 6 per cent. But let us be generous and say that it will be only 5 per cent. When there is no good reason&mdash;no compelling reason&mdash;for making a structural change of this type, why on earth would any sensible opposition or government want to put into the economy an overnight shock, like a 5 per cent increase in the consumer price index?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not necessarily. It was almost a one-off in New Zealand; and it was introduced at the same time that unemployment rocketed up by four or five percentage points. If a Liberal government plans to deal with the inflationary impact of the value added tax by bumping unemployment up 4 or 5 per cent, members of the Opposition should go out and tell the public that that is their intention. If the Opposition does decide to bump unemployment up another 4 or 5 per cent by running an extremely restrictive monetary policy to contain the inflationary impact, because it has already committed itself to not tightening fiscal policy, that will be its choice. But members of the Opposition should go out and tell the public that that is what they are going to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That happened in New Zealand and the inflationary consequence was more of a pinnacle than a plateau. But, if the Opposition does not do something like that, there is a very real danger that the higher level inflation will be a plateau, not a pinnacle, and will endure for many years. The transition costs will be high&mdash;let there be no mistake about that&mdash;the ongoing administration costs will be significant and the gains will be small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gigantic fraud in this package is the claim that replacing payroll tax with this value added tax will get rid of the alleged damage which payroll tax does to employment and economic activity. In fact, the Opposition is proposing to abolish State payroll taxes and replace them with a Commonwealth payroll tax, via the value added tax, at three times the rate and for about four times, or more than four times, the total revenue. Both payroll taxes and value added taxes are taxes on labour because, with the exception of economic rent, all value added is the direct or indirect consequence of labour. All value, either directly or indirectly, is added by labour once economic rent has been excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to Senator Boswell for giving us not a perfect example but a good enough example of the effect of payroll tax. He said, and I take his word for it, that it costs $120 to have a beast boned out in an abattoir. Payroll tax at 6 per cent therefore means that it costs a bit over an extra $7 in payroll tax. The value added tax which the Opposition is proposing to introduce will have the following effect. The proprietor of an abattoir buys a beast for, say, $500. Senator Boswell says that it costs $120 to get it boned out, so the proprietor of the abattoir will insist on getting at least $120 when he sells it to an exporter or to a butcher&mdash;that is the value added inside the abattoir on which a 15 per cent tax will be applied. So instead of the tax being $7, as it was in Senator Boswell's example, it will be $18. I am sure that Senator Boswell does not realise, any more than the mugs out there in the small business sector&mdash;most of whom, incidentally, are exempt from payroll tax&mdash;realise, that a value added tax is a payroll tax under another name which has almost identical employment and general economic effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add one important qualification to Senator Boswell's example&mdash;and I am being fair and objective about this&mdash;if the abattoir's proprietor then exports the boned out carcass, no value added tax will be levied. But, if he sells it to a domestic butcher, in this example the value added tax will be $18 as against $7 for payroll tax. The same principle will apply for all commodities which have value added to them within Australia and which are sold within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, all those who are the final suppliers of a good or a service will try to pass on to consumers the value added tax that they and all other suppliers and processors throughout the production and marketing chain have paid. They will try to pass that tax on to the consumer and in most cases they will succeed, just as payroll tax is passed on to the consumer now whenever the supplying firm has sufficient market power to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of brief points in the time that I have left. As I said before, income tax collections as a proportion of GDP are not high. It is true that at median or modal levels of income the marginal rates are particularly high, and it is claimed that we have to do something about this. There are two points to be made. Firstly, the evidence as to whether marginal tax rates of that magnitude&mdash;that is, around 38c in the dollar&mdash;are an effective deterrent to effort or to work is inconclusive. But, even if it were conclusive, it is possible to devise a tax system&mdash;revenue neutral&mdash;which significantly reduces, I believe to about 30c in the dollar, the marginal tax rate that would apply at that level. I am having some work done on this and I hope to make that public within the next week or two. I am talking about a rate scale which leaves the existing threshold where it is but which, because of rejigging, significantly reduces at or around the modal or median level of income the marginal tax rate from the present 38c to something like 30c.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>It has been interesting to listen to the debate this afternoon because the Government has really struggled. First, Senator Button could not give one single, solitary alternative to what this Government was going to do, other than offer Australians more of the same. Quite frankly, Australians do not want more of the same. They now have an unemployment rate of nearly one million in this country. They have had unprecedented high interest rates and an unprecedented high bankruptcy rate. They have had it up to their back teeth. They cannot cope with any more. Yet Senator Button, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, has said, `Sorry, you've got to cop it. You've got to cop it sweet and you've got to take some more of the same'. The Opposition is quite clearly offering an alternative. It is offering hope, it is offering vision and it is offering a reduction in taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Maguire's contribution worried me because he kept saying that he wanted things like food exempt; that he wanted to make sure that essential items were exempt. I would have thought that Senator Maguire would know better&mdash;that exemption of essential items like that really would benefit the wealthy more than the poor. It is the wealthy who use more services, not the poor, and it is the wealthy who go to restaurants more often than the poor. In pushing this silly, inane, inaccurate exempt line, Senator Maguire wants to make sure that the people who need the tax reductions do not get them. He wants to make sure that the people on welfare, the low income earners, will be worse off than they are today&mdash;if that is at all possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Maguire wants to make sure that our ability to compensate anybody in the low income areas is reduced. That is absolutely scandalous. He wants to make sure that there are less tax cuts and that there is less incentive for people to work. Quite frankly, I am tired of hearing people saying, `It is not worth my time working overtime'. We are going to make it worth people's time not only to work overtime but also to work longer hours generally because they will reap the benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are reducing the levels of taxation and we are making sure that the tax threshold will be raised from $5,400 to $7,000, with a 16.2 per cent marginal rate applying below $20,700 in place of the current 20 per cent rate. A person earning $10,000, who currently pays $920 annually in tax, would pay $486 in tax. That happens to be a 47 per cent reduction in income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this Government has tried to say that we will give higher tax breaks to those people on higher incomes than to those on lower incomes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh's contribution was interesting, to say the least, considering that Senator Walsh&mdash;himself a former Minister for Finance&mdash;has been a huge advocate of the introduction of a goods and services tax. He now says that it really does not work. But only the other night&mdash;I think it was Monday night, if my memory serves me well&mdash;he appeared on national television saying that he had been an advocate of it and that, yes, it can work. But he said that things like cheap petrol will bring cheap cheers, particularly from farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why Senator Walsh, as a farmer, hates farmers as much as he does. Quite clearly, farmers will benefit from the abolition of the petroleum excise. There is no question about that. An enormous amount of fuel is used in the production process on farms, an enormous amount of fuel is used in getting stock backwards and forwards from farms, and a huge quantity of fuel is used in getting products from point A to point B. That is why people in the bush pay more for their various commodities. How dare he talk about rural and remote Australia not benefiting from an abolition of excise. They simply will; there is no question about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in the north-west of Western Australia, for example, have to pay the huge costs of transportation on top of every product they buy. That puts a significant cost onto products. When the fuel excise is abolished, 26c per litre will come off the cost of transportation of goods to places in remote and rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh said there was no compelling reason for changes of this kind. We have nearly one million people unemployed in this country. If that is not sufficient cause for compelling reasons for change now, there never will be. We must ensure that the aged are looked after and that they have opportunities. I know from personal experience how superannuants have their incomes diminished year in year out by the huge rate of inflation and huge cost burdens that are being imposed on those types of people. Under this Government, they are forced to pay extra for their private health insurance because they know that if they do not pay that private health insurance they will be consigned to the waiting lists. They will not be able to get the doctor, hospital and treatment of their choice at the time of their choice unless they make that additional payment for private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will make sure they do have that type of access; not only to public hospitals but also to private hospitals. Of course, we will make sure that bulkbilling is retained for pensioners, health care cardholders and the disabled so they simply will not be disadvantaged. Once again, it is just not true for this Government to say that people will be disadvantaged under a health policy which the Government and its supporters have largely advocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Government's supporters have come out this week and said that it was about time that people were taken back into the private health insurance system when many of them can afford to pay private health insurance but choose not to because they know that somewhere along the line they might get some medical attention. The problem is that many Australians have not been able to get the medical attention when they have needed it, with their choice of timing, doctor and hospital. It is about time that we made that opportunity available for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, it is also important and significant that rural and remote Australia will benefit largely from this as well. We are making sure that the zone allowance for remote Australia, for example, is increased by 25 per cent. That, too, is significant for these people. That is a huge increase in the allowance for people living in places such as Nullagine in Western Australia. Of course, it is a substantial allowance for people in areas such as the Pilbara and the Kimberley, who have suffered for so long under this Government. There has not been one increase in the zone allowance in the eight or nine years of misery under this Government. The costs have gone up and up with not 1c of compensation. For the first time, there will be compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh made the comment that the abolition of payroll tax would not solve anything. It is a shame that none of his colleagues in the States agree with that sentiment. None of the business people agree with that sentiment either. Surely, it is up to us to make sure that there are incentives for people to get out there and employ more people without all of these taxes on employment&mdash;not only payroll tax but also the training guarantee levy. By bringing in this tax and forcing business to pay yet another tax on employment, this Government in many cases has reduced the amount of dollars being spent on training. But does it care? No, it is just another tax. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an important report because it covers an important organisation, the Australian National Gallery. The Gallery has been going through a difficult time because of a problem relating to its roof. As a result of either architectural or building mistakes, the roof has effectively had to be replaced. The flat nurolite roof has had to be covered with a pitched metal deck. The total cost of this is over $5m. It has massively disrupted the Australian National Gallery, closing various parts of it over the last couple of years while work has been going on. That work is due to be completed next month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have mentioned in this place before, no-one is being sued and no recompense can be sought from anyone involved in what was clearly a mistake and a mess-up. Apart from that, I am concerned that there seems to be a quaint reluctance by the Gallery to say just how much this really is costing. I stress that I have the highest regard for both the board and the Director of the Gallery. The annual report skirts around the subject of the actual cost that the taxpayers are having to face because of this negligence, error or mistake by a builder, architect or someone. It is disappointing that the finger is not pointed at whoever made the disastrous mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gallery has suffered not only the normal downturn that it would expect in a recession with respect to the number of people attending, but the closure of parts of the Gallery and its inability to run what it describes as a `blockbuster' exhibition in the past 12 months has significantly affected its program. The reroofing project began in July 1990. The absence of blockbusters in that period has meant that there has been a massive reduction in the level of income that the Gallery has been able to achieve, although there have been some surprisingly good and exciting displays, particularly the one relating to dance costumes. I am certain that everyone who saw that display was highly impressed by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a decrease in Gallery attendances and a reduced opportunity to generate non-government revenue. This raises the requirement that when one has major expenditure such as that on roof renovations, which the Gallery simply says accounted for a substantial proportion of expenditure on capital works, I would like to see the amount fully reported in the annual report. It is not, and I regret that. I think a much franker approach to the public is justified. In fact, I had to ask not once but several times in Senate Estimates to finally get the right answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first asked in Senate Estimates about the cost of repairing the roof I was told that it was three and a bit million dollars, but a month or so ago I found that the correct answer was over $5m. That is only the up-front cost. On examination, one finds that probably the cost is close to $10m, relating to expenditure on fixing the roof and lost revenue. In the previous year the net surplus of non-government revenue, excluding donations and sponsorship from specific subsidies and grants for the Gallery, totalled about $2.5m. This included revenue from the British Museum <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>exhibition and the Art of Photography exhibition. In the latest year, the sum of $2.5m collapsed to only $150,000, and this year it is expected to be only $380,000. That means a shortfall in the two years of about $4m, and perhaps more, that the National Gallery could have achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the National Gallery on its efforts in trying to raise money from alternative sources, and I wish well the rejuvenated Australian National Gallery Foundation, which is now headed by Sir Robert Cotton, for whom I have the highest regard. I hope that it can make good the shortfall. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>In the case of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, one could say that its annual report is a matter of better late than never. The report did not appear before the Estimates committees were in session. The guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports tell us that the annual report is, if possible, to be tabled in time for use by members of the Senate Estimates committees at hearings attended by representatives of the Department. We are also told that the Government has decided that, should the report not be available in its final form in time, material to be included in it should, unless there is a specific reason, be made available to Senate Estimates committees prior to the hearings. Certainly this report was not ready in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Estimates committees were held a week earlier than normal, but we did not have before us even a draft report. The annual report is a very important document that is used in the Estimates procedure. I hope that the Department can get its act together and at least have, if not the annual report in final form, a document in draft form so that the Estimates procedure can be effected more appropriately and properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department said that the annual report would be available before the end of the Estimates process. When I questioned where the report was, I was told on 10 September that it would be available within a week or so. Five weeks later it still had not arrived. In fact, the report was presented only a day or two before consideration of the Estimates took place in the Committee of the Whole. One of the processes that we have tried to put into place in the Estimates committees by way of reservations is to ensure that the whole of the Estimates process is not repeated in the Committee of the Whole in the chamber. However, if the annual reports do not arrive, honourable senators will be tempted to go in detail into annual reports if they appear after the Estimates process. If the Government wishes to facilitate processes in the chamber and to reduce time spent on these matters, it would be more appropriate if the Department could have its annual report before us at least in draft form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall not have time to mention matters such as therapeutic goods approvals and so on, but I wish to comment on what is said on page 131 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the year, the department prepared, for consultation with the Privacy Commissioner and the wider community, draft policies covering the protection of confidentiality, release practices and data retention for both Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits data. These policies will be finalised in the coming financial year and should satisfy the community's needs for appropriate protection of confidentiality while permitting the data to be used for policy and research purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>I was pleased to read that passage, but at the same time I am somewhat disappointed that it is now eight years since the inception of Medicare and there is still no policy relating to severe restraints on data use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all honourable senators here, the Health Insurance Commission now has all Medicare data since the inception of the system and all pharmaceutical benefits data. Therefore, the Commission is able to identify any individual and any drug prescribed for that individual. One can see the public health benefits of that process, but one can also see the important privacy issues that surround it. However, the Department had not taken account of this factor. The Health Insurance Commission was blithely going on collecting all this data about our personal lives&mdash;much of it sensitive data about various treatments that can be identified by the numbers of services provided and so on&mdash;with no thought of doing anything about the situation until I pressured the Department in Estimates hearings over three or four sessions. As a result, the Department admitted that it needed to develop a privacy policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was told in September 1990 that the Department would complete this policy within six months. However, we are now told in the present annual report that it will not be ready until the end of this financial year. I hope that there will be no more delays in this area because this is a most important issue. The community, honourable senators and members of the other place need to be assured that such data is secure. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Resource Assessment Commission is interesting because it gives clear reasons why the Commission is to provide independent, comprehensive, informed and unbiased information and to advise the Commonwealth Government on complex resource use issues referred to it by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). At 30 June 1990 the Prime Minister had referred to the Commission two resource use issues which were both of national significance. The first related to the inquiry into the options for use of Australia's forest and timber resources; and the second was the inquiry into the use of the Kakadu conservation zone. It was interesting in those two inquiries that the report was ignored and that the Prime Minister listened to Bula instead of to the Resource Assessment Commission inquiry, which I thought was an intriguing state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the other inquiry was the forest and timber resources inquiry. Those two references have involved the payment of some $1.5m to consultants to reach conclusions on those two fact finding missions. I believe that they have not really achieved what the Resource Assessment Commission was meant to achieve: to be independent of interference from the Government. Of course, the vagaries of the Labor Government at the moment, with its on-again off-again appraisal of resources, make it very difficult for people in the resource sector to know where anything is going. When we have a commission such as this to find out what is happening and it is not taken notice of, I believe that the Government is not doing the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAC is not, as it sometimes has been portrayed, an environmental protection agency, any more than it is an agency with a mandate to facilitate resource development. If it were either of those things, it would simply be duplicating the work of other agencies. The real point is that it is a fact finder; it is not an advocate for any cause. One would think that when it finds out the facts it would be taken notice of. The Commission has something like 42 staff. However, it still needed consultants to help with its inquiries. It is quite interesting to note the list of consultants. A consultant from Catalyst Consulting was paid $6,325 for leadership and team work training while another consultant was paid $1,739 to `comment and advise on CV design strategy, seminar and present a paper'. I think that people should read the report to enable them to see clearly what the Resource Assessment Commission is about. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>In moving the motion, I wish to address a few remarks to the report of the National Plantations Advisory Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Integrating forestry and farming: commercial wood production on cleared agricultural land</EMPHASIS>. I was very pleased to read this report. I was especially pleased with the language used in the first part of the report; I found the executive summary most interesting indeed. This is a matter which has been of some personal interest for many years since the advantages of integrated forestry and farming were first brought to my attention when I was lucky enough to visit a property south-east of Hobart&mdash;a property owned by the Downie family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Calvert, quite correctly, has made sure that I identified the correct Downie family because there are a lot of them&mdash;many of them successful farmers in Tasmania. However, this farm demonstrates well the advantages which accrue from successfully integrating farming and timber production. In the report we have a furthering of that argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also highlights some of the disincentives and the things which preclude further expansion of these sorts of enterprises. We are told in the very first paragraph of the report that the Government's objective of fostering a plantation resource on cleared agricultural land is attainable provided that several things occur: for example, provided that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . industrial processing companies are prepared to obtain a significant proportion of their wood from farmers, as well as their own or State resources.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is the key to a lot of successful enterprises. If we are able to ensure before we engage in producing a product that it has a market or can be sold, then it is a heck of a lot easier to have a successful enterprise. The key to this enterprise is that provided the production of integrated farming and tree production can be guaranteed an end market then, of course, it is more likely that such an enterprise will succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that is not the only matter that needs to be addressed. We are told further in the report that there are certain taxation disincentives that need to be removed and that modest incentives are needed to encourage investors. This is apparent in many areas, but I would have thought that this would be something that the Government could follow up fairly easily and quickly. We are also told that there are impediments. Those impediments are mentioned: for example, distortions in the pricing system for wood which should be reduced. This is a matter which has often been denied, yet here we have in black and white an acknowledgment that those distortions do exist and that they should certainly be addressed immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I find it very easy to agree with all the dot points under the heading `Environmental protection' in the executive summary on page ix of the report. I would like to emphasise the second dot point, which states:</PARA>

<PARA>We know that the species pinus radiata is a particularly invasive and aggressive seeder. There are even some ornamental species such as rhododendrons and cotoneasters which are now a problem in our native forests. Therefore, care needs to be taken, regardless of whether we are talking about ornamental gardens or integrating farming and forestry. Apart from the care, I am glad to see that this report encourages the activity to be undertaken. The many advantages which could be derived from the report are only in our national interest.

I believe that this a very positive report. It contains a number of recommendations and I await with interest the Government's response as to whether it does anything about those recommendations. I am advised that the Committee met some 12 times over seven months and undertook extensive investigations of plantations in Australia and overseas. The Chairman of the Committee has stated:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">..the Government's objective of fostering a plantation resource on cleared agricultural land is achievable if Governments at all levels implement new policy measures to facilitate plantation development and if there is a commitment from industry to obtain a significant proportion of wood from farmers as well as from their own and State resources.</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to say that the Committee reached consensus on all but one recommendation, the exception being that the National Farmers Federation is unable to support the recommendation which proposes a rebate for approved expenditures on plantation establishment and maintenance additional to the 100 per cent deductibility provision. The Federation does however recognise the support of all the other Committee members for this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA>The report, of course, brought together a variety of individuals and organisations. That basically is the only recommendation on which there was not general agreement. This is one of the more positive approaches from what I regard as a negative Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Committee, in an attempt to examine dispassionately the viability of plantation forestry and to ensure future timber resources and supplies, has come out with a report that recognises the important role that farmers play and will play in future years in the supply of timber. It recognises the present impediments to investment in timber and suggests that the present taxation disincentives be removed and some incentives put in place. It recognises that environmental protection is important and proposes a code of plantation practice and monitoring of invasion of native forests by exotic species. It suggests a public awareness educational program, to which I say hear, hear! It also recommends an acceleration of forestry research and development. </PARA>

Until we get a decent new attitude in Australia and get incentives into everything by having a vision such as our Fightback campaign whereby we give incentives to people through better tax structures and better attitudes to doing things, we will not get done a lot of the things which are desperately needed to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report suggests that the Committee is convinced that the Government's objective of fostering a farm-based plantations resource is attainable, providing those disincentives are removed and the incentives are such that farmers are encouraged to retain control of their land and there is a prospect of markets for their products in the long run. I hope that the Government looks very seriously at this report and will not do what it has done with a lot of other reports and just shelve it. I hope it does something that will really help in integrating forestry and farming so that we have a good commercial wood production on cleared agricultural land. </PARA>

<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Dairy Corporation on its annual report and the work that it does in trying to enhance the profitable production and marketing of Australian dairy produce. The report notes on page 2:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Using national and international comparisons, Australia was again a significant exporter of manufactured dairy products in 1990/91, exporting a total of 353,000 tonnes of product, valued at just over $700 million. In recent years dairy foods have amounted to over 25 per cent of the country's processed food exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Australia also has one of the world's most cost-efficient dairy industries, serious difficulties continue to be encountered on international markets, mostly resulting from trade restrictions and subsidised exports from northern hemisphere countries. Even so, there has been an increase in this country's dairy export tonnage of 18 per cent in 1990/91 compared to the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA>Recently honourable senators will have read of a major study by the Industry Commission into the Australian dairy industry. One of the main arguments in that report was that Australian consumers would get cheaper milk if controls in the Australian dairy industry were removed. Indeed, it contended that $280m more was paid by consumers for fresh milk and dairy products in 1989-90. It also proposed that further reductions in assistance must take place if the dairy industry were to maximise its contribution to national welfare, adding that the Australian industry had to prepare for increased competition from New Zealand dairy products. This is in addition to recommendations that assistance to the industry should be phased out in the next two to 10 years and that the Commonwealth should phase down maximum market support payments from 20 per cent of average export prices to 5 per cent by 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also found that under current policies excessive resources are retained in the dairy industry and the costs of doing so are borne by the whole community. It found that it would be more appropriate for the dairy industry to bear costs. However, I ask honourable senators whether they honestly believe that the whole community would benefit if in the long run these proposed changes were to result in decreased production, a significant reduction in jobs and the industry unable to compete on world markets. I do not believe that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Industry Commission seems to believe that it is acceptable for Australia to become a dumping ground for European dairy products. It is asking Australian farmers and manufacturers once again to accept as right and proper prices which are based on prices for the world market's dumped products. We have seen this asked of producers in other rural industries. These prices are the result of political decisions in Brussels and Washington. They do not reflect retail prices in the exporting countries where consumers are paying more for their produce than Australia. </PARA>

I am sure that Senator Tate, like me, enjoys the yoghurt and things like that are really starting to come good now. Dairy food exports earn more than $700m each year. The industry's major investments in research, technology and market development will see these export earnings grow. Dairy farm productivity is increasing by 5 per cent per year, as it has for the past decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry's willingness to adapt to change means that it will benefit from even minor reforms in the international trading environment. Already Australians buy premier quality dairy foods at prices as low as anywhere in the world. Australian dairy farmers produce milk at a lower cost than those in Europe, the USA, Canada or Japan, thanks to our pasture-based farming. In fact, few countries can produce quality dairy products as cheaply as Australia can. One thing that I feel is important to note is that more than 100,000 Australians have jobs thanks to the dairy industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>I thank Senator Tate for his indulgence. I too would like to speak to this report because it is a very important report and one that the Australian Dairy Corporation should be very proud of. As Senator Bjelke-Petersen said, the dairy industry is Australia's third largest agricultural industry in terms of wholesale values and the revenue generated is $4 1/2 billion. This represents 2 1/2 times farm gate value. In other words, the dairy industry as a value adding rural industry adds $3 billion to our income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bjelke-Petersen has already said, Australia exports 353,000 tonnes of dairy products valued at $700m dollars. This amounts to about 25 per cent of this country's processed food exports, so it is not an insignificant industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the impact that the IC recommendations may have on this industry. Take the Victorian dairy industry as an example. It produces 61 per cent of all our milk products. If these recommendations are implemented, the price of milk to the producer will be reduced by 12c to 15c per litre for 12 per cent of the milk, and the manufactured milk price will be reduced by 2c to 3c per litre for 88 per cent of the milk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the overall total milk output in Victoria will decline by 8 per cent and the Victorian dairy farm cash returns will reduce by between $15,000 and $20,000 per annum. As can be seen from that, and as the United Dairy Farmers in Victoria estimate, close to two-thirds of farmers will have no cash left to feed their families. That is an indictment. It is something that the Government should take note of when it considers these Industry Commission recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bjelke-Petersen said that we compete very well on the local markets against dumped products. It is a shame when one realises how significant this dumping into Australia is. For example, we were told at a recent briefing by representatives of the dairy industry that imported Dutch edam cheese is selling in Australia for $2.99 a kilogram. The same cheese costs $15 per kilogram in Europe. The cost of the milk alone to produce that cheese in Europe is $A5 a kilogram. So, if we ever needed any evidence of dumping, that is it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that, although the Government has taken countervailing measures to try to combat this dumping in Australia, there is still a problem. Until the Government gets its act together on this matter we will have dairy products, and plenty of other products, competing against our own products in Australia at a dumped price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of the Australian dairy industry flows right through the community. More than 100,000 Australians, as Senator Bjelke-Petersen said, are currently employed in the industry, and 20 per cent of that employment is industry related. This is very important to Australia, given the very depressed nature of our rural sector at the moment. For every 100 jobs in dairy factories an additional 110 jobs are created through the flow-on effect to other regional activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is evident that Australia has the most cost efficient dairy industry in the world and although we produce some of the best dairy products, serious difficulties will continue to occur if the trade restrictions in, and subsidised exports from, the Northern Hemisphere continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recent innovations is the introduction of the Australian dairy mark, which is used to promote Australian dairy products and their natural goodness. It is very pleasing to note that the new Australian dairy mark has now achieved consumer awareness levels of around 80 per cent. I must put in a plug for some of the cheese products that are produced in my own State. There is no better cheese on the market than the Tassie blue cheese, and we all know about King Island brie. Even, you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would be aware of that. </PARA>

<PARA>The Auditor-General's efficiency report No. 13 of 1991-92 on the evaluation and preparation of the Budget is important. It calls for departments and agencies to improve the provision of evaluation of program performance as a basic requirement in their Budget proposal documentation. Certainly that is a call by the National Audit Office that I would strongly endorse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is damning so far as its assessment of the Government's evaluation of its program performance in the preparation of the Budget is concerned. Since 1987 when the Government developed its strategy of performance evaluation&mdash;a strategy that the Opposition agrees with as a general proposition&mdash;there has been, according to the report before us now, only a marginal improvement in general evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even when evaluation studies may have been carried out they were not always available on time for consideration of the Budget. Often they would merely state that evaluation would be undertaken but without any detailed information on the appropriate methods of evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals with various government departments. It is particularly critical of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It says that PMC needed `to be more effective in supporting Department of Finance efforts to upgrade the level of performance information provided by agencies'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate is aware, recent Senate Estimates committee hearings revealed just how little the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet appears to understand the purposes of performance evaluation. Its performance indicator statements in the 1991-92 Budget Papers lacked virtually any substance. They were full of warm, inner glow rhetoric about social justice and the like but they contained very few useful indicators to enable the Parliament to review the Department's performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the printed Budget Papers which provide opportunity for evaluation of program performance. The whole purpose of our Senate Estimates committee procedures is to examine government expenditure proposals contained within the Budget and to comment on these in the light of past program performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet at the Senate Estimates hearings the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet officers were muzzled by the Minister present, who as I recall was Senator Button, from providing any indication of the nature of their advice to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on interest rates or any information about the economic modelling unit that they admitted they were developing within that Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Opposition raised with the officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet just why it was that they needed to develop economic models at all when this new model is being put into Treasury to try to model the coalition's proposed goods and services tax and related proposals, and when there are already very sophisticated modelling devices within Treasury and certain other departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To have, to use the words of the officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the development of a `rudimentary economic modelling system' within that Department seemed to smack yet again of the duplication and overlap that have occurred to a very considerable degree in many departments, but particularly in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of all of that and particularly the muzzling that occurred during the Senate Estimates committee hearings, the Parliament and the Australian taxpayers have no way of judging whether that money, which is their money, has been well spent. That has major implications for the accountability of the Government in its use of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also endorse the Audit Office's recognition of the useful role that the Cabinet Office can play in improving the quality of program performance information by drawing on Department of Finance specialist knowledge. Despite growth in the Cabinet Office over the last several years, it appears to be failing, along with the Department of Finance, in terms of the coordination of performance evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report and information that we have gleaned from Senate Estimates hearings in recent times leads me to the view that the Government has so far refused to acknowledge that, without the provision of forward revenue estimates as part of overall Budget documentation alongside the forward expenditure estimates, it is impossible to evaluate the Government's budgetary situation in any future years. The idea of having Forward Estimates in terms of expenditure, which this Government does, loses a lot of its point if there is not a revenue Forward Estimates basis against which to judge it. Both the New South Wales and Tasmanian State governments have recently adopted the practice of having both forward estimates of expenditure and forward estimates of revenue in their budgets. It is something that the Commonwealth also ought to be looking at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as if the Government does not already calculate forward revenue estimates. The Treasury does for its budgeting purposes but it will not publish them. The Department of Finance admitted during our Estimates hearings that it also has a go at estimating forward revenues. We got a very inconclusive and unsatisfactory answer from Department of Finance officers and Department of the Treasury officers in the Estimates hearings as to why the Department of Finance had to try to second guess the Treasury in building up forward revenue estimates. That is something that I also believe needs to be looked at. They are some points that emerge from the Auditor-General's Report No. 13. In the time available, and given that we are losing altitude a little with our program, I will reserve any further comments for another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the Senate's attention the importance of this report and the importance of an improvement of evaluation techniques within the public financing systems of government. The Government spends vast amounts of money on programs, particularly in the areas of policy advising where it is very difficult&mdash;and I do not underestimate the difficulty&mdash;to get a proper technique whereby one can evaluate whether the work being undertaken by those advisory bodies is good value for money. Indeed, we can try to evaluate the performance of Treasury over the last few years and accept that the Treasury has been the main adviser to government. We can also look at the fact that we have almost a million people unemployed and at least another half a million people underemployed. There has also been a dramatic fall in private investment, private consumption and gross domestic product and a major blow-out in our foreign debt and current account. If that is the outcome of the programs of policy advice by departments such as the Treasury, one would have to express the gravest concern about those performances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the essential problem: how does one evaluate programs within government agencies and departments, particularly where they are of other than a service delivery nature and the measurement problem is much easier and very different? The work that has been done by the Department of Finance in recent years in improving evaluation techniques and evaluation processes is to be commended. The report of the Audit Office is also to be commended in that context because it really points to the fact that there is still a long way to go before we can be satisfied that those techniques and new arrangements are satisfactory. In that context and in that sense, the report bears very careful scrutiny by us all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before lunch, I was talking to the second reading of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill. I had reached the point where I was talking about the deficiencies of Montreal Amendment Protocols Nos. 3 and 4, which the Government will sign as a consequence of the passage of this Bill. I was pointing out that, even though this</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>is a new protocol, it has been around for 16 years. I was saying that there were some major deficiencies with the Montreal Protocols that would be signed for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In outlining their faults, I pointed out the futility of this legislation because at the end of the day it leaves Australia worse off than it is at present. Firstly, one of the disabilities with the Montreal Protocols was that they had an unbreakable liability. There was a ceiling for compensation which could not be exceeded, irrespective of the fault of the carrier. I said that there was no opportunity for carriers to lift their liability on their own behalf as they can under the existing protocols. Indeed, there is no mechanism for the Montreal Protocols to be altered in any way, because they are inflexible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I moved to the point that the figure for compensation was far too low. The figure of 100,000 special drawing rights from the International Monetary Fund that has been adopted by the Government works out at between $170,000 and $180,000. I am astonished that the Government should value human life as cheaply as that. By way of illustration&mdash;I do not wish to canvass the field of damages within Australia today&mdash;in the recent past we have had damages of $3m awarded to a quadriplegic as a consequence of an accident. It is not at all uncommon in cases of injuries to limbs or joints to have compensation payments of many hundreds of thousands of dollars awarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figure of $170,000 to $180,000, the ceiling for the compensation which applies in Montreal Protocol No. 3, is grossly out of line with contemporary Australian damages that can be awarded. It is very interesting to note that, had the protocol been accepted by the airline carriers of the world in 1975, as of right we would have had two review points within that protocol, at a five-year and a 10-year period. On each occasion the SDRs would have been increased by $12,500. Clearly, the intention of the people who drew up the Montreal Protocol in 1971 was to review the protocol and to issue a fresh one at some time, probably 15 years, after it was drawn up. It would depend on whether the drawing up date is taken to be 1971 or 1975. If we take the 1975 figure, 16 years have elapsed. The compensation provisions are, therefore, very clearly dated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that the Government has not done is come up with some supplementary compensatory Act to allow Australian international carriers to add to the benefits specified in the Montreal Protocol. That is the only way in which benefits can be increased under this protocol. If the United States ever signs the protocol&mdash;as I said earlier, that is very much in doubt&mdash;it will have in place on the legislative books a supplementary compensatory Act providing for higher benefits, preceding the signature. The Government here is very wrong to propose this Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill 1991 to the Parliament and to sign the protocols without having put on our statute books supplementary compensatory legislation. At the end of the day I think it is very unlikely that Montreal Protocol No. 3 and Montreal Protocol No. 4 will ever be accepted by the world airlines collectively. The airlines have precisely the same objections to it as I have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one interesting point that I want to comment on. By consigning this Bill into legislation, the Government will actually reduce the benefits that are available today for an Australian passenger or for a passenger flying on an Australian international airline. If the Warsaw Convention and The Hague Protocol are applied under the existing Australian Act which we are amending today, and the gold standard conversion is taken, the liability of the carrier is at least $250,000;  but, when this legislation comes in, the compensation amount will be linked to 100,000 statutory units of the IMF, which is $170,000 to $180,000, as I said earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot emphasise strongly enough the need to have adequate market compensation in this field. If we look back to 1929 when aviation was in its infancy and when the first Warsaw Convention, which is still in place, was applied, we will see that the value then of the gold conversion was $US10,000. If we were to convert that 1929 value of $US10,000 into today's currency figures, we would find it was considerably more than the $170,000 to $180,000 that applies at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, we are turning back the clock because Australians will be disadvantaged. Apart from that, 30 per cent of the travellers coming into and going out of this country will still continue to be covered by the original Warsaw Convention and the modified Warsaw Convention, The Hague Protocol. That means that in most cases those travellers will have higher benefits than a passenger suing under the Montreal Protocol No. 3 that we are proposing to sign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, we do need to try for a new international agreement. The present situation is not satisfactory. We do need some clear and simple convention. We should not be working with a system that goes back 61 years to the dawn of aviation&mdash;not that there are not some very good and very relevant points in the original Warsaw Convention. I believe a new agreement should have strict liability in it. It should have regular review periods and it should be flexible enough to allow carriers to increase the ceiling if they choose to do so. None of those characteristics is in the amended Montreal Protocol No. 3 or Montreal Protocol No. 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the tragedy of the present situation is that by passing the Bill and having Australia become a signatory to Montreal Additional Protocol No. 3 and Montreal Protocol No. 4, we will have to remove ourselves from the earlier Warsaw Convention and The Hague Protocol. At the end of the day there is simply no guarantee that the United States will sign. If the United States does not sign, the other airlines of the world, as a bloc, will not pick it up and we will end up with the worst of all worlds. It is with the greatest of reluctance that we will allow this Bill to pass. We do so on an undertaking from the Government that it will, as a matter of great urgency, move to have some supplementary compensatory Act passed in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The Government has, indeed, given that undertaking very clearly. It was always intending to do that. As Senator MacGibbon would know, the United States is proceeding along similar lines in working on a supplementary package which is specifically provided for under the Montreal Protocol. I guess in that sense&mdash;I think that Senator MacGibbon clarified this&mdash;that it is strictly technically correct to say that the Montreal Protocol sets absolute limits that cannot be broken. The protocol quite clearly provides for a supplementary scheme providing that it is arranged in the way in which the United States is proceeding to do it;  that is, that it act as an insurance supplementary scheme with levies applied for that purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish just to cover a number of the points that Senator MacGibbon has made. I think Senator MacGibbon has severely understated the difficulties of proceeding to break the limits that are set by the Warsaw Convention as amended at The Hague. The evidence is stark and easily available to demonstrate just how difficult that is, particularly for an individual. The test that has to be applied in the case of both&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As is often said, the law, like the Ritz Hotel, is open to all: one can stay there provided one can afford the tariff. It is a very high test, and it goes beyond a test of simple negligence. It is a very tough test indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator MacGibbon knows, the debate about this trade-off between common law actions and a scheme such as that in the Montreal Protocol applies to all areas of compensation&mdash;motor vehicle accidents and all the rest of it. It is a very important and lively debate which I have engaged in many times, the trade-offs being particularly the value of a no-fault scheme where, in order to get rapid and inexpensive redress, the person does not have to establish fault on the part of the driver, or in this case the airline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to break those limits, by taking action for damages, a very high standard of fault is required. In the case of the Warsaw Convention, a claimant has to prove wilful misconduct. In the case of the Warsaw Convention as amended by The Hague Protocol, a claimant has to prove either the intention to cause damage&mdash;and Senator MacGibbon would know full well just how difficult it is to establish intent in a court&mdash;or recklessness with knowledge that damage would probably result from that recklessness. That is an extremely severe test to apply to a civil action and it is a much higher test than simple negligence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give an example to the Senate as to just how difficult, prolonged and expensive it is to establish that test, claims in relation to the infamous flight 007 disaster and the Erebus disaster in New Zealand are still not settled. They are still being litigated years after the event. In the case of the Erebus disaster, 12 years have now elapsed and those claims have still not been settled. So it is not easy to get results by taking this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To refer to a very substantive point that Senator MacGibbon made at the beginning of his contribution to the debate, the Opposition has canvassed a couple of options. One is to simply withdraw the Bill and the other is to amend it. As Senator MacGibbon knows, we have acceded to the Opposition's wishes and have agreed to amend the Bill in line with the concerns the Opposition has raised rather than withdraw the Bill. We make no apology for proceeding with the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the clear intention of Australia to become party to the Montreal Protocols. Indeed, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, has formally and officially and very loudly called for all member states to become signatories to this convention, and I think for good reason. It does offer very significant benefits to people who are aggrieved, providing that&mdash;and I concede this point&mdash;it is supported by some sort of supplementary scheme that would allow the limits to be raised in a manner which does not force upon the person concerned the prospect of years and, perhaps in some cases, decades of painful and expensive litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply reiterate in conclusion that the Government accepts the concerns that Senator MacGibbon has raised in the debate; acknowledges that they are real concerns; commits itself to immediately begin an examination of what kind of supplementary scheme can be put into place in consultation, of course, with the industry; and, in that sense, thanks the Opposition for its indication of support for this legislation. I give an undertaking to the Opposition to report on the progress of that review. I will be proceeding to move in the committee stage, I hope by leave together, all of the amendments that will accommodate the concerns that the Opposition has raised with the existing Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>In the second reading speech to the Senate, I explained that the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill does three things: it amends the principal Act to enable Australian ratification of Montreal Protocols 3 and 4; it applies with immediate effect increased liability limits of 100,000 SDR, that is, approximately $A180,000 for passenger death and injury, to Australia's international airlines; and it converts the Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol Poincare gold franc liability limits to SDRs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has received representations, as I have mentioned, concerning the Bill as originally drafted. Concerns about the Bill have focused on a number of issues, in particular, the unacceptably low liability limits, particularly when compared with non-aircraft civil accident actions, and the lack of standardisation of coverage for all passengers. The Government acknowledges and indeed shares these concerns. However, many of the concerns are criticisms of the international carriers liability regime that are actually embodied in the Warsaw Convention and that Convention as amended by The Hague Protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia to legislate to increase and standardise the liability limits applicable to all passengers travelling to, from and within Australia would effectively require Australia's withdrawal from the international carriers liability regime. Whilst it is undeniable that there are difficulties with the regime, particularly in regard to the liability limits, as Senator MacGibbon has already mentioned, the Government remains committed to the view that the complex issue of liability of international air carriers should continue to be addressed in the multi-lateral context rather than on a piecemeal basis with each country enacting its own laws on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of its shortcomings, the international regime does contain very real benefits to the international passenger, such as not having to prove fault on the part of the airline, the speed of payment of compensation, and the certainty of jurisdiction in which the cases can be heard. The Government, therefore, does not consider, as I have said before, that withdrawal from the Warsaw Convention system would be an option that is realistically available to us. Having said this, however, I must say that the Government acknowledges the major criticisms that are directed to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If passed, the Bill would leave 30 per cent of passengers travelling to and from Australia significantly worse off, as Senator MacGibbon has said, than they currently are. In particular, those provisions of the Bill which convert the Warsaw and Hague gold franc limits to SDRs in effect limit the maximum entitlement of passengers for death or injury to $28,000 or less. Moreover, it has been  argued in some quarters that this would potentially deprive passengers of substantially higher payouts if a court were to convert the gold franc limits using the market price of gold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the amendments which I have moved on behalf of the Government will remove those provisions which purport to fix the Warsaw and Hague liability limits by reference to SDRs. The amendments also remove those provisions which limit the liability of Australia's international carriers to 100,000 SDRs. Qantas will of course continue to apply this limit on a voluntary basis and we will continue to encourage foreign airlines to adopt higher voluntary limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In moving the amendments, the Government wishes to emphasis that it is preserving the status quo. The Government understands that in the short term the existing uncertainty is the quantum of limits under the Warsaw Convention and that convention as amended by The Hague Protocol will persist. However, the Government does not wish to deny passengers any rights or opportunities which they currently may enjoy before the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill in its amended form will enable Australia to ratify the Montreal Protocols, as called upon to do so by ICAO, which the Government is confident will ultimately become the mainstay of the international carriers liability regime. This would result in a standard 100,000 SDR limit applying to all international passengers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Montreal Protocols receive the required number of ratifications and enter into force internationally before Australia is legislatively prepared to ratify the protocols, the carriers liability for carriage between Australia and countries which are party to the Montreal Protocols could become unlimited. As a result, passengers would have to prove fault on the part of the airlines. They may not be able to have a case heard in Australia and compensation, if any, could be a long time coming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government remains very concerned about the low limits placed on the liability of international carriers, even by the Montreal Protocols. One hundred thousand SDRs, which as I have said before is about $A180,000, for passenger death and injury is still low when compared with payouts in non-aircraft civil accident actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, I reiterate in conclusion the commitment the Government has given to examine the feasibility of a supplementary compensation scheme which will enable passengers speedy and certain access to realistic levels of compensation. My colleague the Acting Attorney-General, Senator Tate, supports the immediate commencement of an examination of such a scheme. I also say, in fairness, that I have received representations previously from the Acting Attorney-General on the same issue. However, as honourable senators would recognise from the explanatory memorandum and the supplementary explanatory memorandum, the issues are complex, as Senator MacGibbon has pointed out, and the implications of a supplementary scheme will have to be carefully assessed, but we commit ourselves to carry out that examination promptly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that explanation. In light of what he has said, a couple of points come to mind. I accept his assurance that the Government will proceed with the supplementary compensation scheme. I presume that the Government will legislate for that prior to signing the Montreal Protocols; otherwise I do not see how Qantas can maintain its present higher level under the Hague-Warsaw convention, because that will be null and void. The Government will have to abrogate that agreement in light of signing the Montreal one. That is the first point. My second point is that I would assume that in the supplementary compensation scheme something would be done about property damage in relation to baggage or cargo, because the Montreal convention, as well as having a ridiculously low level of $180,000 for loss of a life, has a limit of $28 per kilo on baggage or freight on an aircraft.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, which the coalition will not be opposing. The Bill implements some of the Government's Budget decisions but there are also important non-Budget changes. As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) pointed out in his second reading speech in the other place, a number of Budget decisions are being enacted by changes to delegated legislation or by changes in administrative arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Budget amendment in this Bill, which will be of great interest to many veterans, is the indexation of the earnings credit. At the moment earnings credit is fixed at $1,000. This Bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act so that the earnings credit maximum is indexed to reflect changes in the consumer price index. The coalition welcomes this measure, as I am sure many veterans will. The amendment takes effect from the start of the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important step along the path of encouraging veterans to earn additional income to supplement their pension where they can and wish to. As an aside, I might mention that in the coalition's recently released Fightback package a specific undertaking was given for an ongoing review by a coalition government of the income and assets test limits applying to pensions, including service pensions, so as to encourage veterans to supplement their pensions without penalty&mdash;and I stress `without penalty'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same package, the coalition also set out details of our proposed deferred pension plan. Under that plan veterans who wished to remain in the work force beyond age 60 and qualified for the service pension and wanted to defer it would receive a bigger pension as a result. For example, a 60-year-old service pensioner who deferred his pension for two years would receive a pension increase of 16 per cent in the fortnightly pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other significant amendments contained in this Bill and pertaining to the Budget concern changes to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Government is extending patient contributions for pharmaceuticals to holders of special treatment entitlement cards and personal treatment entitlement cards. Holders of these cards receive pharmaceuticals under the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The patient contribution itself, which is to be $2.60 per prescription item and indexed according to the CPI, is introduced via an instrument signed by the Minister and which has already been tabled. Importantly, amendments contained in this legislation provide for the payment of a pharmaceutical allowance to veterans to compensate them for the patient contribution. The pharmaceutical allowance is to be paid at the rate of $5.20 per fortnight and will also be indexed to the CPI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In accepting this measure, the coalition has been very concerned to ensure that the Government properly protects chronic users of medication. This is particularly important given that one might expect the disability veteran population to be greater users of medication than those currently obtaining pharmaceuticals under the PBS. One important measure in this regard is the safety net which comes into play after more than 52 prescriptions have been used. After this point all prescriptions are free. The safety net limit has the effect of ensuring that veterans, over the course of 12 months, are not out of pocket. Indeed, if veterans use fewer than 52 prescriptions over the course of 12 months they will be financially better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For heavy users of medication, that is, those veterans who may use a number of prescriptions per week, an advance pharmaceutical allowance will be made available. The Government has met coalition concerns that these veterans should have easy access to advance pharmaceutical allowance. As from 1 January 1992 all veterans and war widows, not just STEC and PTEC holders, will no longer have to satisfy an assets test to qualify for the advance allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, by this legislation war widows and disability pensioners are exempted from the income test for the advance allowance. In this sense, veterans' access to an advance seems to be much better than that for general pensioners covered under the PBS. I have received, as I know a number of other honourable senators have, a great deal of correspondence from veterans on the issue of the patient contribution. Concern has been expressed that extension of a patient contribution to disability pensioners undermines the concept of assistance for veterans being provided on the basis of compensation rather than welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is very aware of this important distinction. In the time that I have been the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs there have been many issues on which the coalition has taken the Government to task for its lack of comprehension of the special standing of veterans. Earlier this year, for instance, it was the coalition, with the support of the Australian Democrats, which overthrew the misguided introduction of entry fees at the Australian War Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of this has been that the War Memorial has had to think more carefully about other means of raising revenue to enhance its activities. I note that one of the recommendations in a recent union review of staffing at the Memorial is to look once again at the introduction of entry fees. I understand that the report is presently in the hands of the Memorial's management group for response. I say now that the Memorial would be very foolish to again suggest the introduction of entry fees, and that such a suggestion will be opposed on every occasion by the coalition. If the Government is not funding the War Memorial appropriately, as has been suggested recently by the Council Chairman, then it is the Government of Australia which must be held accountable by the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year the Government attempted to introduce a new guide to the assessment of rates of veterans pensions which would have dramatically reduced the ability of veterans to successfully appeal for an increase in disability pension. The coalition succeeded then in having the new guide disallowed in the Senate. This rejection by the Parliament has meant that the Department has had to go away and work more closely with the ex-service community to ensure that a more equitable third edition of the guide is produced. I understand, both from the ex-service community and the Department, that good progress is being made and that a new guide may be tabled early in the next session of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Integration legislation introduced by the Government, which is shortly to be debated by the Senate, is being opposed by the coalition. It has been introduced in the absence of detailed information on the nature of negotiations with the States, in the absence of detailed information on the cost implications of the so-called private patient scheme, and in the face of the genuinely held fears of the ex-service community, which has many unresolved concerns with the integration process. So I think it should be clear to the veterans of Australia that, even in opposition, the coalition has done a great deal to ensure that the special standing of veterans is properly recognised and that their hard-won rights and entitlements are not easily given away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has considered very carefully the implications of the patient contribution associated with this Bill. The rationale for a patient contribution is centred on the need to curb overprescribing and oversupply of medication and to encourage sensible drug use throughout the community. In this sense, I think it is important that the soundly based concern of the effect of overuse and oversupply on veterans health be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is too early to make any definitive judgments, initial evidence from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services indicates that there has been a significant reduction in the number of pharmaceuticals dispensed for pensioners, including service pensioners and war widows, as a consequence of legislation which was introduced following last year's Budget. The Government has predicted a long term reduction of around 15 per cent and the evidence to date, although by no means conclusive, at least conforms with this prediction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the coalition's point of view, this can only mean better and more efficient health care for veterans, and that is something we should all support. As I indicated at the start of my speech, many of the changes arising from this year's Budget are being introduced by delegated legislation or revised administrative arrangements. Two of these changes&mdash;the provision of emergency short term home relief for veterans and war widows from January next year and the development of a hostel development scheme&mdash;are important and are welcomed by the Opposition. These changes have flowed directly from the report by Professor Gary Andrews on his consultancy on long term care for veterans and war widows. The Government did not offer the coalition a copy of this important report and it has obtained it only in recent days. We are considering the substance of the report carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another Budget change being implemented by delegated legislation is the extension from 1 December of repatriation treatment benefits to Australian merchant mariners of World War I and World War II. While the coalition welcomes some progress on this front, given that the McGirr report has been in the hands of the Minister since October 1989, I am sure that these same mariners will be disappointed that the Government has not fully embraced the McGirr report and given Australian merchant mariners the same legislative standing as veterans under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there were a number of important issues in the ex-service community which the Government failed to address in the last Budget. I want to draw particular attention to one of these: the 50,000 war widows who are subject to discrimination in comparison with civilian widows. When this issue was raised in the Estimates Committee hearings in April earlier this year, the veteran community was led to believe that it could expect some sort of response to this situation in this year's Budget. Needless to say, for the 50,000 war widows who continue to be the subject of this discrimination, no action was taken. According to the Government, discussions are still continuing at a ministerial level, with a number of options being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that any steps taken to redress this situation may involve considerable expenditure, it is reasonable to expect that any decision will have to occur in a Budget context. Sadly for the affected war widows, this means a wait of at least another nine months. Given that the median age of war widows is around 72 years, any decision taken nine months from now by this Government will, for some, be too little, too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to move to the non-budgetary features of this Bill. The most significant of these are changes to operational areas. The passing of the Veterans' Entitlements Act in 1986 saw the consolidation of a great many pieces of veterans legislation into one Act. As part of this consolidation, operational areas were gathered together from the various disparate acts and regulations. Thus schedule 2 of the VEA sets out, for pension purposes, the various operational areas in which defence personnel have served. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For reasons which to this day are not clear, the drafting of the VEA in 1986 had a number of operational areas covered by the blanket dates of 31 July 1962 up to and including 11 January 1973. For some areas, this was clearly not appropriate but, given that a veteran had to be deemed to have been allotted for service in an operational area rather than merely being in an operational area before qualifying for the service pension, the dates were less important. Of course, two important cases&mdash;the Doessel and Davis cases&mdash;saw the Federal Court interpret `allotted for duty' in such a way that the dates in which an area was truly operational have now become very much more important. Consequently, the Government, in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, moved amendments which modified the operational areas for Borneo, item 6, and Malaysia, item 7. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Bill before us now, further modifications are being sought. Item 5, which relates to the Malayan conflict, is being wound back from the period 31 July 1962 to 11 January 1973 inclusive, to the period 28 May 1963 to 19 April 1967 inclusive. Item 7, relating to the Malaysian conflict, is being amended again. I can only assume that the Department got it wrong last year, presumably acting on advice from Defence. The starting date for Malaysia is being changed from 7 July 1965 to 17 August 1964. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changing of these dates has caused some concern to the coalition and to the ex-service community. On the face of it, they could very easily be read as somehow taking away veterans' entitlements. The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest No. 19</EMPHASIS> of 1991, indicated to the Minister that it would appreciate further information on the intention and effect of the proposed amendments. The Committee is concerned, as I am, that a veteran who does not put in a claim until after 8 November and can show that he was in a legitimate operational area during a period outside the prescribed dates will not be eligible for repatriation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department has indicated to me that, to the best of its knowledge, the dates are accurate and will not prevent veterans access to benefits that are rightfully due to them. I have had a number of people in the ex-service community provide me with instances where they thought the operational areas were not appropriate. I have raised these matters with the Department and on each occasion it has been able to reconcile them satisfactorily, either to the dates as amended or to other items in the schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Opposition has the Department's assurances on  this matter, I think it is vital that the Minister give an assurance to the Senate that should any cases emerge which clearly show the operational dates to be inappropriate, then the Government will move to ensure that such veterans are properly recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also adds a new item to schedule 2. Item 11 will provide that the area comprising Iraq and Kuwait is an operational area for the period 23 February 1991 up to and including 9 June 1991. When this Bill was debated in the House of Representatives, my colleague the honourable member for Farrer, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), raised concerns about the starting date of 23 February 1991. Hostilities commenced in the middle of January and the Leader of the National Party was concerned that the operational dates therefore failed to encompass some Australians who may have been part of the initial invasion whilst on secondment to overseas units. The Minister gave an undertaking to have the dates checked and, if necessary, to move an amendment in the Senate to correct them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jim joined the Department of Agriculture in 1921 and became one of the best known and most loved district agronomists in the State. Jim's greatest claim to fame, apart from his innate humility and kindness, was helping to pioneer wheat growing on the black soil plains, now the real bread basket of Australia. Professor Waterhouse, of the University of Sydney, a wheat variety called Gabo and Jim O'Reilly together changed the fortunes of many north-western farmers. Actually, at that time they were not really farmers; they were graziers. Jim and Gabo came along, and the landowners got off their horses and climbed, often reluctantly, onto their tractors. I happened to be one of those persons in the early 1960s. Jim was the first district agronomist and then regional supervisor, extension, for a huge area of north-western New South Wales, including what we think of today as the prime hard wheat area of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have fond memories of Jim O'Reilly. He used the local pub as his extension office of the Department of Agriculture. He taught many of us how to grow wheat there. He always said nice things about the young farmers who, in those days, were trying to learn how to farm the black soil plains. The black soil plains of north-western New South Wales are rather unique. That is why this wheat variety called Gabo came along. Gabo grew very tall &mdash;approximately five feet high. </PARA>

He said, `You won't have any trouble; it's down but you'll get it off'. And we did get it off. In those days he instilled great confidence into the new wheat growers in the area. He always made us feel better. Even when we had a bad crop in the dry years&mdash;the crop may have been only half as high, very spindly and with very small heads&mdash;he still gave us the confidence to keep going. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The ABC pamphlet <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Travellers Guide to ABC Radio</EMPHASIS> does not contain the statement `by the end of 1992 the country will be completely covered'. There is, however, reference in a 1988 ABC pamphlet <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A New Choice for Country Radio Listeners</EMPHASIS> to the effect that the extension of ABC radio services to regional areas under the Government's Second Regional Radio Network (SRRN) program, would not be completed before 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SRRN program is a Government initiative aimed at providing additional ABC radio services to over four million Australians who live in regional areas which receive only one ABC radio service, or none at all. The program was originally announced in 1985 and is planned to be completed by 1994-95. The majority of SRRN transmitters will broadcast on the FM band and are being installed at existing and new ABC television transmitting sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the commencement of the SRRN program, around 140 radio transmitters, out of a planned total of more than 300, have been installed. When the SRRN program has been completed, the vast majority of Australians will be able to access at least two ABC radio services (ABC Radio National and Regional Radio).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. Remote communities originally received preference in the establishment of additional radio transmitters under the SRRN program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transmitters provided under the SRRN program are now being installed as far as possible in conjunction with a co-ordinated program to upgrade Commonwealth transmitting stations. The provision of FM transmitters under the program is dependent on the availability of suitable broadcast frequencies, which in certain areas is predicated on the clearance of television channels 3, 4 and 5 (Band II).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As stated earlier, the SRRN program is scheduled for completion by 1994-95. There are no unique circumstances which apply to Tasmania in relation to the provision of SRRN facilities. Under the program, some 18 new FM transmitters are scheduled to be installed in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) It is expected that a transmitter to broadcast ABC Radio National to the Launceston region will be established by the end of 1993.</PARA>
