<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Finance. I ask: why did the Minister for Finance delay releasing the October statement of Commonwealth financial transactions, showing a serious deterioration in the Budget figures, until late last Friday night when he had had the statement in his office a week earlier? Is it correct that the Minister held back release of the statement until after the House of Representatives rose because he wanted to avoid being questioned about the Government's deteriorating Budget position?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. When the Minister is getting an answer from the Minister for Finance, will he also confirm that the deficit for the first four months of this fiscal year was $6.9 billion, compared with only $2.8 billion over the same period last year; that Budget outlays have blown out by 9.5 per cent, compared with a budgeted change of only 5.7 per cent; and that revenue has fallen by 3.2 per cent in contrast to a budgeted fall of only 1.2 per cent? Given the fact that the Budget is now quite totally out of date, when will the Minister announce a full review of the Budget figures?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I do have some information on that matter. It is true that outlays for the year to October were 9.5 per cent higher than for the same period in the previous year, compared with the Budget forecast for year on year growth of 5.7 per cent. A number of factors have contributed to the strength of actual outlays in the first four months of this year. They are: the timing of major defence purchases to the cost of $367m; higher outlays on assistance to the unemployed totalling $813m&mdash;however, I make the point that beneficiary numbers are lower than those in the Budget forecast for October; higher outlays on age pensions, sole parent pensions and assistance to the disabled; and some other timing and seasonal influences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CFT reports the level of actual outlays and revenues. It is not used to provide regular updates of revised Budget estimates for months ahead. The effects of the Prime Minister's statement and other Budget decisions of approximately $308m were documented in the October CFT as a matter of record. Of course, I make the point, which we always make about these matters, that there is considerable seasonality in outlays and revenue month by month. The results for an individual month or a few months cannot be extrapolated to estimate the outcome for the year as a whole. At this stage, it is too early to predict any comprehensive revision in Budget estimates.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs been drawn to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gold Coast Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 21 November 1991, in which it is stated that the Gold Coast's only Family Court counselling service will be shut down? Is it a fact that other centres in Queensland with a lesser population than the Gold Coast have permanent Family Court registries with full time counsellors? Was a proposal given to the Government this year that a permanent registry be established on the Gold Coast and, if so, was the proposal accepted and, if it was not, what was the reason for the rejection of the proposal?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention was drawn by Senator Colston to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gold Coast Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article of mid-November, indicating that the Gold Coast's Family Court counselling service would be shut down. So I have seen the article. I understand that there are such registries, such services, provided in Cairns and Townsville, which probably do have lesser populations than the area of the Gold Coast that was serviced by the counselling service provided by the Family Court in that region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that submissions are made&mdash;always at Budget time&mdash;to try to ensure that the fullest range of registry services may be provided by the Family Court in areas other than the capital cities. Certainly, as a matter of principle, I support that type of extension of the services available from the Family Court, and from other voluntary agencies, for the provision of counselling, which is such an important part of an overall strategy to deal with the question of marital strain and breakdown and disruption of family arrangements.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in this instance it was not possible to provide all the funding which the Family Court requested in order to enable a range of services to be provided. I believe that it would not be possible to reconsider the allocation of funds to the Family Court until the next Budget process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. I refer to the so-called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> statement in which the Opposition claims that it will privatise port authorities and promote competition within, as well as between, ports.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has no intention whatsoever of adopting the quite idiotic suggestion that has been made by the Opposition in its port authority section of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> for a number of fundamental reasons; none better than those enunciated by the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Mr Baird, in October last year. I have already pointed out a number of fundamental flaws in the factual base of the Opposition's document in terms of waterfront reform and the Opposition has extended those same errors into the area of the port authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to note a fundamental factual omission in the document which I am made aware of on a daily basis so far as port authorities are concerned. It is mentioned nowhere in the section dealing with port authorities in the Opposition's document.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. It is the fact that the port authorities are under the control of State governments. That poses a fundamental problem and I will be very interested to see how the Opposition proposes to impose the privatisation of assets that are owned by someone else. It is an interesting point that the Opposition has not enunciated so far and it is nowhere in its document. The port authorities are not owned or controlled by the Commonwealth Government. I will be interested to see how the Opposition proposes to dispose of somebody else's assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be particularly interested to see how it will force this change on State governments which are unwilling to adopt this particular method, because the State governments know what a retrograde step it would be. According to the Opposition document, the people who actually own these port authorities will not get a say. The States do not like the suggestion. As I have mentioned, the only coalition State Government&mdash;in New South Wales&mdash;expressly repudiated the privatisation concept in October last year. Mr Baird was reported as saying that far more could be gained for the people of New South Wales from the corporatisation of port authorities rather than privatising them. I agree with that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's waterfront program is encouraging fundamental reform of port authorities in consultation with State governments. One of the means of reform under the program is to improve port authority business orientation by corporatising their structures and operations, as Mr Baird has suggested should be done in New South Wales. Already, these reforms have led to an overall reduction in the work force by 21 per cent with the shedding of 1,470 jobs nationally from port authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, nowhere in its document does the Opposition mention how it proposes to force privatisation of port authorities that are owned by State governments down the throats of State governments that do not want to embrace this particular matter. Perhaps it will adopt the same approach with reluctant State governments as it does with reluctant unionists on the wharves, and use troops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economically, there is no guarantee that privatisation would lead to reductions in costs to waterfront clients. There is a simple, mindset, ideological position that it must have that effect. Mr Baird does not think it will and neither do I. There is absolutely no guarantee that it will lead to these reductions in an area of port authorities where they constitute&mdash;as they do in Australia&mdash;a natural monopoly. The reason is the wide geographical dispersion of our ports and the fact that they are not in a position to actively compete as do ports in other countries that do not have as long a coastline as ours and as widely dispersed ports. The Opposition has totally ignored that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is similarly silent on just how it would promote competition between those widely dispersed ports and how this would benefit any port users, if it involves the replication&mdash;which it probably would&mdash;of already under-utilised port infrastructure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Is the Minister aware of new rules concerning motor vehicles sold in California, home of 3 per cent of the world's cars, which will require at least 2 per cent of new cars to have zero emissions by 1998, a figure which will rise to 10 per cent of state-wide car sales by the year 2003? Given that California is making a radical attempt to control polluting vehicle emissions which will result in the more widespread manufacture and use of electric cars, will the Minister tell the Senate what steps are being taken by both government and industry to ensure that Australia is not left behind by this potential revolution in the car manufacturing industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had my attention drawn to those reports about the Californian initiative to which Senator Sowada refers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, go to Los Angeles. I am advised that the Californians recognise that to some extent they will be shifting rather than solving their pollution problem because the generation of electricity for electric cars will, in itself, be an energy intensive activity, leading to the prospect of smog and greenhouse gases away from the city of Los Angeles itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point to make is that all major car manufacturers of the world are looking at the issue of fuel efficiency&mdash;I believe with very dramatic effects. I have spoken to people who were at the Tokyo Motor Show recently. The fuel efficiency of new models of cars displayed there is just enormous and mind-boggling. To some extent, this is market driven as well as government regulation driven, as people want to buy more fuel efficient cars for obvious and sensible reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point about the Australian industry that here all motor vehicle manufacturers are foreign owned. They produce cars for what is one of the smallest markets in the world. For example, we actually produced last year about 350,000 cars compared with a total world production last year of 35 million. In tackling emission problems, it is slightly onerous to say that one of the smallest motor vehicle manufacturing industries in the world, all of which is foreign owned, should be told by us or by anybody to involve itself in a lot of research and developmental work on emission problems. It is much better for it to collaborate with the international industry than to do it by itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our industry cannot afford the huge costs involved and Australians could not afford to pay for the price of the cars that would result from such work. I am sure that many breakthroughs in fuel efficiency and emission standards will be made in the immediate future and they will be driven by international car companies and global strategies dealing with what is a worldwide problem but one particularly intense in places such as Los Angeles, as the question referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean that we in Australia cannot afford to be concerned about vehicle emissions, particularly greenhouse emissions. An environmental policy that might have to be considered in this country is not lowering the price of petrol but in fact raising the price of leaded petrol to help control some of these problems and reduce the age of the motor vehicle population. That is something which might be considered by an imaginative government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October this year, the Government adopted an interim planning target of stabilising emissions of greenhouse gas not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. This target is based on stabilising emissions on 1988 levels by the year 2000 and attempting to reduce those emissions further by the year 2005.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> entitled `Politicians captive to lobby group infiltrators'. The comments are allegedly those of a former Supreme Court judge, Mr Paul Toose. I am afraid that the confrontationist, adversarial system in which Mr Toose operated for so long as a judge has led him to an unfortunate caricature of those who are in the consumer lobby groups around Australia and, indeed, those who give advice to Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Toose has been hostile to representatives of the community view in regard to the advertising industry, which he is supposed to supervise through the Media Council of Australia. Indeed, not only does Mr Toose apparently want to vet those who might come from community groups and voluntary organisations as advisers and lobbyists to Ministers but also he has through organisations connected with the Media Council of Australia tried to veto&mdash;in fact successfully&mdash;appointments which I wished to make of members representing the public to various code councils in the advertising area regarding alcohol, tobacco, slimming products and therapeutics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I tried to nominate public members Mr Toose's organisation vetoed those appointments. It was done so on shifting grounds of justification, none of which impressed the Trade Practices Commission which reviewed the scheme and released a report in June 1991 on the activity of this body. The TPC made scathing comments about the lack of accessibility and timeliness in the response of the Advertising Standards Council and the Media Council of Australia, which Mr Toose supervises. The need for the former judge to set his own house in order in this respect is very apparent from any cursory reading of the Trade Practices Commission's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the advertising industry is to be governed in the way that it is, largely by way of self-regulation rather than government intervention, it is absolutely essential that people such as Mr Toose, the Media Council of Australia and the Advertising Standards Council&mdash;which are formed by the industry in order to protect its operations&mdash;protect the industry with a lot more sensitivity for the views of the community, particularly consumer groups.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to a draft inter-departmental report prepared by senior officers from the Treasury, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, commissioned by the Prime Minister, which is reported to have highlighted the need for a goods and services tax by identifying Australia's narrow tax base as a key problem, criticised the existing wholesale sales tax for putting exporters at a significant disadvantage and compared Australia's business tax system unfavourably with almost all of our booming Asian neighbours in nearly all respects. Why is the Government pig-headedly refusing to wipe out the unfair and discriminatory wholesale sales tax and replace it with a GST, as is used by nearly all Western developed nations, and as is proposed by Dr Hewson to replace seven anti-business taxes, when its departmental advice is that it should do so?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of points raised in Senator Baume's question. First of all, I think his question is based on a story in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which purports to be based on a draft of a business taxation review conducted by some government departments. Let me say that the review has not yet been finalised. When it is, it will, of course, be presented to the Government. I am certainly not going to comment on reported claims attributed to the story of an unnamed government source about what any reference to Australia's tax base in this draft report does or does not mean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to point out to Senator Baume that the reporter who wrote the story in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> wrote another one in today's paper. In that one he quotes the Treasurer as saying that the case for introducing a consumption tax `has been weakened significantly by a Treasury analysis that shows sales tax has a minimal effect on business'. Mr Kerin is quoted in the article as saying that the analysis showed that the wholesale sales tax adds less than 2 per cent to business costs in virtually all sectors. Of course, that does raise some questions about a consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume also asked what the Government was doing about broadening the tax base and made the point that a goods and services tax represents a broadening of the tax base.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We sure have; that is right. We introduced a capital gains tax, which all honourable senators opposite opposed. We introduced a fringe benefits tax, which all honourable senators opposite opposed. We introduced the assets test on pensions, which all honourable senators opposite opposed in spite of the views of their then President, Mr John Elliott. Those were tax broadening measures. If honourable senators opposite are addicted to tax broadening measures, they might have thought about them some time a little earlier when the Government took these steps to broaden the tax base in Australia. By the way, now, in the so-called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document, they are quite prepared to pick up the benefits of all that tax broadening which they opposed at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume asked me why we will not behave like other governments around the world and introduce a goods and services tax. There are many reasons for that but just let me give him one. The fact of the matter is, as he well knows, that every goods and services tax introduced overseas has been added to time and time again. Also, there is a compensation package the first time a goods and services tax is introduced and there is not one thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this point in terms of the proposed tax scales which would be introduced for income earners as compensation for a goods and services tax: if we look at the table 2.5, which contains tax scales from 1 October 1994, we find that a person on an income of $30,000 a year gets $30.40 extra a week as a result of those tax changes; a person on $70,000 gets $90.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To answer the question, it is necessary to look at what happens now. Obviously, waiting periods have been in the forefront of the minds of those people in the social security lobby now for quite some time because during a recession the claim always is that waiting periods create a great deal of hardship. Although at the moment we have a waiting period of one week, it actually means three weeks because the payment is backdated two weeks. So when people apply for the Jobsearch allowance it is backdated two weeks and they have to wait three. A great many people are inconvenienced and do suffer hardship because of the waiting period. As a result of that, some 20 per cent of applicants now qualify under hardship provisions. The hardship provisions are pretty simple: if one has in the bank less than two weeks of the benefit, which is less than $300, one would qualify. So 20 per cent now get it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am asked by Senator West whether the Government would consider a change to the rules from one week to three weeks, which means an effective waiting period of three weeks to five weeks. Obviously, that would be a pretty shameful thing for any government to do. One in five people applying for Jobsearch allowance are granted hardship. If the wait is three weeks, one has to wonder what would happen when the wait becomes five weeks. Of course, Senator West is right about there being suggestions that the period go to five weeks. People may have heard of a thing called the Fightback package which actually did suggest that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the problem with the Fightback package suggestion, of course, is that it claims savings of $186m. Why? Because it says that the percentage who would transfer to special benefit, which is now 20 per cent with a three-week waiting period, would be 18 per cent if it were a five-week waiting period. What one is talking about, of course, is a dead-set crook set of figures. What one is talking about is an Opposition claim that less than 20 per cent will apply when there is a 200 per cent increase in the time period. The reality is $186m ought to be $113m. There is a $73m hole in that one little item.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the Opposition which ought to have a long think about this. We now have more than half a million people on JSA. One wonders just how much misery this lot want to inflict on us. I would have thought that three weeks was a long time when one is down on one's luck and one does not have a job. Five weeks is an eternity. The savings are just simply crook; they are not there. It is about time people got a bit honest with the Fightback package. If the Opposition wants to fight back, it should stop trying to fight back on the backs of those who are poor, those who are sick and those who are needy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Under standing order 190, I wish to make a personal explanation as I claim to have been misrepresented. In Question Time today, Senator Button, for his own grubby little political purposes or whatever else, made an accusation. He made it at a time when the proceedings were being broadcast and were on television, which Senator Button well knew. He was given this information no doubt by the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia (Senator Collins), who has been smarting ever since he was exposed for the waste of money that he has perpetrated in his Townsville office.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) intimated that I opposed the consumption tax. He also intimated that I opposed it a couple of weeks or a couple of months ago. In both instances, the Leader of the Government in the Senate is quite incorrect. He referred to an article, I assume, which the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia handed to him while I happened to be having a discussion with Senator Button about the matter. The headline is not my statement and it is nothing I have ever said. I have always thought that a properly framed consumption tax, a goods and services tax, would be excellent for the people that I serve, which is particularly the north of Queensland and northern Australian people. Of course, time has proved that to be very true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part of the article that is correct and actually quotes what I said&mdash;not the headline, which is of course not mine, but the journalist's licence, which is not at all accurate in this particular instance&mdash;states:</PARA>

<PARA>That statement was not made a couple of weeks or even a couple of months ago; it was reported on 3 July 1990 when I had been a senator for three days. What I said was as correct then as it is now. I am very pleased to say that, in all of that time, as I said in this article, I have watched the development of a consumption tax proposal very closely to make sure that people&mdash;particularly people in northern Australia&mdash;were not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to say that what has happened, as a result of many trips which Dr Hewson and Mr Reith have made to northern Australia, including north Queensland&mdash;many more than the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) bothers to make&mdash;is that Dr Hewson and Mr Reith have taken on board the concerns that have been expressed in some quarters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an urgent need for this failed Labor Government to study the education policies announced in the Liberal-National Fightback program and to implement those policies. What are the two tests which the Labor Government has failed in education? One is the test of international standards. Australia has slipped away and is no longer providing to Australia's schools, technical and further education institutes and universities the international standards that we need to live up to the professed phrase `the clever country'. The second test the Labor Government has failed is to keep the confidence of the Australian community. The only way to restore these two objectives is to implement the education policies announced in the Liberal and National Fightback policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will summarise the policies that have been announced by referring to five particular matters. Firstly, in a general assessment, there is the increased funding that is represented in the Fightback package for education. The other four points of summary deal with the positive policies for schools, technical and further education, universities and, finally, student benefits. This Fightback package of policies provides $3 billion more for education throughout Australia until the year 2000. There are increases in every area of education provision through the policies announced by Dr Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only will there be additional resources&mdash;an additional $3,000m&mdash;but also there will be lower costs because it has been decided that education services will not incur the goods and services tax. All education services will be zero rated and therefore this tax will not apply to them. At the same time, the wholesale sales tax will be abolished, petrol excise will be abolished and&mdash;a saving to universities&mdash;payroll tax will be abolished. With all these taxes no longer bearing upon education in this country, there will be a decrease in education costs, and those affected will be better off in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Secondly, with regard to schools, the Liberal and National parties have announced 19 new initiatives in the package, which I will itemise in a minute or two. This will include $721m more funding for Australian schools, both government and non-government. Thirdly, with regard to technical and further education, perhaps the Cinderella of Australian education currently, new resources need to be made available. The Liberal and National parties will provide $520m additional funding for TAFE to the year 2000. Fourthly, with regard to universities, there will be $245m more provided for university research; autonomy will be restored to Australia's universities; and Dawkins's centralism will be abolished. We will make it possible for additional students to be enrolled&mdash;that is, additional to the numbers currently or envisaged to be enrolled in the triennial provisions of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Crowley)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Senator Teague, I remind you that you should refer to politicians by their titles. It is Mr Dawkins. Thank you. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will refer to Mr Dawkins this way: Mr Dawkins's centralism will be abolished. The Liberal and National parties will restore genuine autonomy to education institutions, including universities. Fifthly, with regard to student benefits, the Liberal and National parties will retain HECS&mdash;that is, the higher education contribution scheme&mdash;but we will increase the discount for payments that are made up-front; that is, at the beginning of the year of study, we will increase the discount from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. This will mean a saving to an average full time student of $225 per annum. We will provide 200 more postgraduate awards, and the value of each postgraduate award will be increased by $2,000 per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, all Austudy rates of benefit will be increased by 6 per cent, which is parallel to the increase in benefits, to give compensation for the goods and services tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to list the 19 new initiatives for schools that we have set out in the package. Point 1: we will introduce a national standards program to provide systematic and continuing assessment of the quality of learning. Point 2: we will provide for freedom of movement between non-government and government schools to allow maximum parental freedom of choice. Point 3: we will see the mutual recognition of teacher qualifications from State to State. Point 4: we will give greater flexibility to schools in the hiring of teachers and in determining conditions of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point 5: we will allow the acceptance of alternative paths into teaching so that competent persons can be attracted into teaching mid-career and we will not have the stereotype of teachers who have not, in many cases, sufficient experience of the wide world of work. Of course, in breaking those stereotypes by allowing this innovation we will ensure that all alternative entrants are fully educationally qualified to teach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point 6: we will break down regulations and work practices which inhibit schools in making the most effective use of schools in the community and in making contacts with industry. Point 7: we will have an excellence program for languages, other than English, of $5m a year at the school level. Point 8: there will be a schools of choice program of $10m a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point 9: we will have a quality of teaching program of annual awards for outstanding teachers nominated by schools and parents of $10m a year. Point 10: there will be a literacy start program of $5m a year to identify and support best practice initiatives for children with learning difficulties. Point 11: there will be a $2m program for gifted children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point 12: we will abolish Mr Dawkins's so-called new schools policy for non-government schools and abolish all the restrictions for new schools that this represents. Point 13: non-government schools will receive an additional $567m for capital improvement over the years 1993 to 2000. This will provide the choice that another 20 per cent of Australian families wish to have for their children whereby they will have non-government schools in which to enrol, schools on which the present Government has closed the door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point 14: we will increase the recurrent grants to non-government schools and simplify the present 12 levels to six levels, and every school child will benefit. Point 15: we will increase the assistance to isolated children with regard to school allowances, and the assets test on this scheme will be abolished at a cost of $6m. Point 16: an additional $10m per annum will be spent under this scheme to raise the value of the isolated children's boarding allowance. This will be particularly welcome right across the bush. This request has been made to senators and members over many years now as the assistance that has been made available for isolated children has been deteriorating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point 17: the assets test on Austudy will be set aside in cases of extreme economic hardship. I refer particularly to the crisis in rural areas that many families are suffering. Point 18: there will be an increase of 6 per cent in the Austudy rate of payment. Point 19: there will be an increase of 6 per cent in Abstudy payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By these 19 new initiatives for schools we are spending a large part of the additional $3,000m set aside for education in the Fightback package.

It is not at all clear to me what this means, but even a cursory reading of the policy statement would show a significant increase in university funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy statement commits a coalition government to at least maintaining the real level per student funding of higher education as well as spending an additional $245 million on university research to the year 2000. A matching grants programme of $25 million a year will be provided to support basic research in institutions which are successful in obtaining industry research contracts. In addition, the coalition has promised an extra 200 post-graduate research awards plus lifting the value of the awards by $2,000. This represents a substantial net gain to all universities, public or private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the accompanying article on financial assistance to tertiary students Mr Dwyer said it would be "slashed by almost 10 per cent under the proposed GST package". Leaving aside the highly emotive verb chosen, Mr Dwyer chooses not to acknowledge that the bulk of the spending reduction is contained in eliminating waste, curbing fraud and reducing overpayments, priorities with which Mr Dwyer might reasonably be expected to agree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition reiterates its support for student assistance to keep in education those willing and able to continue who would otherwise be forced to withdraw for financial reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, in harmony with the philosophy of the "Fightback" programme to actually increase assistance to those in need, Austudy will be boosted by 6 per cent to compensate for the introduction of the GST. As this will almost certainly be over-compensation, Austudy recipients will have the value of their benefits increased in real terms; for example, the away independent rate would rise by $354.55 from its current $5,905.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dwyer also fails to acknowledge the significance of the increase in the discount rate on HECS for upfront payment which will be increased from 15 to 25 per cent. This will encourage students to pay upfront and reduce their fee by some $225.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite simply, the Liberal and National Party policy will create more university places to accommodate the 30,000 qualified Australians currently unable to enter tertiary institutions, create a genuine student market in which choice will be paramount and in which diversity will be encouraged, and foster the conditions for excellence.</PARA>

I also make the new point that payroll tax, which universities pay, will be no longer required under the package.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are so many areas such as this one that will be affected by the package because the basic principle behind this package is inequity. The main element is reducing the tax which is now raised according to the ability to pay and swapping it for a tax which is levied despite an ability to pay. It is being driven by a very pathetic, outdated philosophy&mdash;one that is not new, one that has been tried overseas and one that has been found failing overseas in a whole range of areas. It is little wonder that already, as I say, this morning we get headlines like `Churches attack GST for selling out the poor'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As an instance of the massive con job that has been perpetrated, let me go to two points that Senator Teague made. He mentioned an extra $3 billion in funding over the next 10 years. Let us look at one area. Let us try to bring some honesty back into this debate in respect of the TAFE area. Senator Teague said that there would be a commitment for extra money from the Fightback package to TAFE. But what he does not mention is that the commitment of funds from the coalition is totally inadequate. Both the Deveson and Finn reports called for TAFE to be put on a growth path between now and the end of the decade. The Opposition has promised half of what is required to implement the Finn report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to what the Opposition is promising, we have already announced an increase in technical and further education funding of over $100m for 1992 alone and we have put a proposal to the States for new funding arrangements for TAFE which will enable us to meet the endeavours and targets of the Finn report on post-compulsory education and training. That is one aspect of the package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about the benefits of this package, let us look at how it will impact on the whole raft of students in the community. Students will now have to pay a tax on books, something they have never before had to pay to the extent to which they will. There will be a 15 per cent tax on books. Those opposite should tell the students, whether in primary school or tertiary institutions, how much more they will have to pay under the package, and that they will be paying an extra 15 per cent in tax on the basic necessities for education. That is where the inequity comes into the Opposition's package. That is where the Opposition is swapping tax levied on the basis of ability to pay for tax levied despite the ability to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's education policy is based on one principle: education for the rich, ignorance for the rest. When we look at the collaboration of Drs Kemp and Hewson in their so-called policy, we see the ideologues who are prepared to sacrifice equity, equality and principle in an effort to raise so-called quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to education, there are two aspects to the package. In one respect the package follows some of the proposals that we have put up already in terms of a national curriculum, national assessment, and so on. In that respect, it can be accepted. The rest is a mishmash of ill-conceived ideology, with no coherence, no cohesiveness. It is interventionist and totally inadequate. It focuses on one part of the education process. It ignores enormously aspects other than those for universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at one of the two major legs of the package relating to education: the voucher system, which is claimed to be one of the major elements of the new Hewson-Kemp policy. It is impractical and inequitable and it will destroy our current system. Here we have a mob of terrorists attacking the education system in this country. A voucher system, as has been proposed by the Opposition, cannot take into account the fact that different courses lead to varying levels of benefit to society as a whole. If the voucher system is fixed&mdash;one of the options&mdash;the education system, as has been developed, will be disrupted enormously. If it is not fixed, the level of funding will not be able to be controlled and there will be a blow-out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any attempt to control the discipline mix&mdash;Senator Teague knows this&mdash;would contradict the purposes of vouchers and would be more intrusive into institutional affairs than are the current arrangements. Senator Teague understands that criticism and the people's concern that the Opposition's system will be more intrusive. Senator Teague understands that the Opposition is caught between either a blow-out to its Budget and a blow-out to institution planning or a blow-out of its policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at this aspect. The Opposition has spent quite a deal of time talking about removal of central control over universities. The Opposition policies will directly imply&mdash;and those opposite know this&mdash;a greater degree of control over the operation of institutions. The institutions know that. I do not have to go into detail at this stage. I do not have time to do that. The institutions know that pretty well. The Opposition's proposal for a highly intrusive centralised system of accreditation of institutions by the Higher Education Council, for instance, is unprecedented in interference with the affairs of the universities and their programs. Those opposite cannot tell me that with this voucher system they will not be forcing amalgamations, when they have criticised us so much over recent years for initiatives in that area. </PARA>

The Opposition's proposal&mdash;it is accepted; Dr Kemp says that fees are a key element of the Opposition's proposals&mdash;is to allow universities to charge by setting course fees as students are admitted over and above the Commonwealth funded loans and to all other students. Under this major element of the Opposition's proposal, conveniently buried on page 48 of supplementary paper No. 4 of the package documents, all students could end up paying fees.

In the United States, when something like this has been tried, it has been found that many people have been denied.

We should also recognise that major achievements have been made over the past eight years. The Opposition talks about schools, about the opportunity for education.

We will not be drawn into detailed comment so early in the debate, particularly on such an important area as education. We have said, however, that we will be requesting the Opposition to consider exempting the basic necessities of life from the 15 per cent goods and services tax. These would include essential foods, clothing, footwear and building materials, so that the low and middle income earners in our community would not be disadvantaged in the long term by price increases on goods they would have to purchase simply to survive from day to day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A commitment to fairness and social justice is central to Democrats policy. Both the GST itself and all other areas of the package will be filtered through this basic premise as we sift through the details and talk to community groups which will be affected by the massive changes proposed by the coalition. Voters will need to assess the package not on the basis of short term gain but in the light of the fundamental social changes shrouded by the fine print and massive handouts contained in this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats support access, diversity and quality at all levels of the education system. We support the key role of the Commonwealth in developing a nationally integrated education policy, focused on preparing Australians and Australia for a very different international economic climate than that of 30 years ago. In an age when we must move as a nation towards improving productivity, national output and the economic base of Australia, now is not the time for piecemeal policy-making devolved to the hands of the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In assessing this matter of public importance, the Democrats are in no doubt that our education system faces a severe lack of community confidence brought about by the policies of the Labor Government. But it is not just its education policies that have brought about this crisis. More and more students, despairing of finding a job&mdash;a situation caused by this Government's economic policies&mdash;are staying in education longer in the hope of putting off the inevitable hardship of not finding a job, and hoping that a qualification will increase their already dim chances of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without commenting directly on the Opposition's education package as outlined in its election manifesto it is, however, timely to assess the Hawke Labor Government's contribution to this sector as the Opposition has suggested in this matter of public importance. As the 1991 academic year closes, it is worth recalling that some 30,000 students missed out on a university place this year. Many universities were plagued by a severe overcrowding crisis, resulting in students being locked out of lectures on some campuses and being issued with lecture tickets on others. While student numbers have increased from 394,000 in 1987 to 535,000 in 1991, universities have not had the resources to cope with these numbers and, as a result, the quality of higher education has suffered badly. In a recent survey, 70 per cent of academics reported that teaching facilities were inadequate for their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, despite the rhetoric and the apparent injection of funds into the tertiary sector, the reality is that at many universities massive budget cuts are the norm, choices for students are reduced and lectures and tutorials are being cut. Just ask the Chief Librarian at the University of Sydney, who must shave $1m from his budget this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy was introduced in 1987, replacing the tertiary education assistance scheme and some other less prominent student funding schemes. Despite amalgamating several diverse funding schemes under one umbrella, the effect of Austudy on students has often been one of great confusion and frustration due to a complex welter of regulations. Often these regulations seem to be created on an ad hoc basis to address particular problems, without any serious attempt at overall coordination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result has been that applicants are required to be aware not only of their own and their parents' assets and income but also of such obscure matters as the difference between their institution's definition of `full time workload' and that of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. This is just a small part of the information required just to apply for Austudy, so it is little wonder that many students have problems.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once over the threshold, students must deal with a complex maze of bureaucratic restrictions and conditions imposed on the allowance which, moreover, may be changed inconsistently from year to year. Consequently, some students find themselves eligible for Austudy one year but not the next, even though their own situation has not varied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast majority of Austudy recipients get far less than the theoretical recipient of full Austudy. They have to be satisfied with between $5 and $30 per week due to the stringencies of the parental income test. Clearly, this amount cannot support anyone, so these students have no choice but to seek work while studying. If they earn more than $4,000 a year, each dollar earned reduces their Austudy entitlement by 50c. All these students are forced to look for work, which will not only cut their study time but also reduce the number of jobs available for non-student members of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy is clearly a mess and needs another overhaul. The paltry amount received by students is, in many cases&mdash;especially for these students living and studying in Sydney&mdash;completely insufficient for their needs. Austudy is still well below the amount received by those on unemployment benefit. Young people who may wish to further their education after school do better, financially, on the dole than in the education system. This inequitable and ludicrous situation must be rectified to ensure that students receive every possible encouragement to continue their studies beyond their school years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are witnessing enormous strains being placed on the TAFE sector as it is required to cope with increasing student numbers and the task of retraining and reskilling the work force. Funding burdens will not lighten over the next decade, especially given the Government's commitment&mdash;as stated in the Finn review&mdash;to bring the funding of TAFE fully under the auspices of the Commonwealth budgetary process. The Government has not successfully resolved this dilemma but, as I have said before in this place, estimates in the vicinity of $5 billion have been suggested by the Commonwealth-State working party on TAFE to meet the expansion needs of the TAFE sector as flagged in the Finn review. Clearly, the Opposition's allocation of $520m to fund expansion of the TAFE sector over the next decade will go nowhere near meeting the funding needs of this sector if the Commonwealth-State working party recommendations are to be believed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in returning to this matter of public importance moved by the Opposition, we need to be mindful of the inherent dangers posed by the wording of it. The word `excellence' raises its head. While I do not think that any member in this place would complain about the need for excellence in education, we need to be mindful as to what this might mean in the minds of members of the Opposition. I will quote briefly from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> this week by David O'Reilly, which discussed the education philosophy propounded by the coalition's shadow education Minister, Dr David Kemp:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kemps Education policy, for example, seems to make a virtue of elitism&mdash;allowing school principals to break out of centralised bureaucratic and union control, set up their schools as independent businesses and hire the best teachers. Kemp would provide more scholarships so education was free for the most talented. But he would allow those who did not make the grade under the government-funded tertiary education selection process to buy extra places in universities by paying fees. This kind of elitism, Kemp and Hewson argue, will produce excellence.</PARA>
<PARA>So here we have it&mdash;excellence is produced by exclusion and limiting access to all but an elite group of students. Where is the equity of access which has been a feature of higher education since the mid-1970s? We need to look no further than New South Wales to obtain some idea of where this policy might lead us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Australian Democrats have already placed on the public record their opposition to any extension of fees to students. We will continue to support an education system which is equitable and open to all. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback! </EMPHASIS>requires careful debate to look beyond the rhetoric; and from that point of view we will give the Opposition's education package most careful consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we bring to the attention of the Senate a subject of great importance. Education is a responsibility that has long been acknowledged as the backbone of any successful progressive society. It is through education of its people that a country can grow, adapt and seize opportunities. Government has certain responsibilities to create an environment where education can flourish through all levels of society and through every stage of a person's life. Without a strong commitment to education we stagnate as a country and as a people. Education needs a commitment from government, whether it be in schooling, TAFE, other vocational training, higher education or&mdash;the neglected fourth sector of the education structure&mdash;adult and community education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We bring this matter to the attention of the Senate in order to urge the Hawke Labor Government to abandon its policies of centralism and mismanagement. The coalition has the policies that will restore dynamic growth to this vital sector of our economy and society. The Fightback program addresses all levels of our education system and seeks to correct the destructive policies of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As are all aspects of education in Australia under the Hawke Government, the university sector is restricted and hampered by rigid centralist policies that prevent constructive growth and leave the universities incapable of meeting the demands that are placed upon them. This has resulted in the standards of our universities deteriorating compared with the world standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, has created a system of higher education which is directed by political and bureaucratic discretion. A direct result of this has been the erosion of university autonomy in Australia, leaving the institutions financially vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research allocation is highly centralised and institutions are heavily restricted as to their course content and student enrolment. In the current system, the central allocation of resources, including those for research, educational profiles as a prerequisite for funding, student quotas, prohibition on admitting Australian undergraduates for fees and the centralised industrial relations framework have all contributed to the decline in our higher education sector. The results of this system have been disastrous for the quality of teaching and research, and the efficient use of resources. This has become more evident every day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently there are almost 30,000 qualified Australians who are excluded from higher education by Government imposed quotas. Incentives arising from Government regulation has resulted in the overenrolment of 14,000 which has put a serious strain on our universities with their massive overcrowding problems. Disruption and demoralisation resulting from centrally forced amalgamation are rife right across the country. A looming academic staff shortage has been estimated to reach 20,000 by the end of the decade. There is increasing frustration arising from the prohibition on institutions accessing otherwise available private funds for higher education. It is easily observed that all of these problems stem from the Governments application of inappropriate centralist policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback program will put our education sector back on track. It particularly addresses the problems that our universities now face. The basic philosophy underlying the coalition's strategy for education is that individuals and institutions should have the freedom to choose their own futures within very broad limitations. With freedom comes responsibility, including financial responsibility. Given that responsibility, institutions should be largely independent of government control or interference. Success or failure should depend on merit, not upon winning bureaucratic favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary objective of the Fightback program's education policy for higher education is a university system of world class standard, providing the diversity of opportunities required to meet the diversity of student need. The key role of universities as Australia's powerhouses of research needs to be strengthened while allowing it to develop the responsiveness necessary to meet the need of international competitiveness. This has not been achieved during the term of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government regulation and imposed uniformity can stifle initiative and diversity, and leads to mediocrity. A competitive framework will allow this to occur. Freedom for institutions, academics and students requires a decisive move away from a centrally administered system to one based on a greatly strengthened student market in which students can choose their university based on their own judgments and institutions have the flexibility to respond to those choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These important issues are addressed in the coalition's Fightback program. The implementation of the policy will have very positive effects for Australian universities. The funding arrangements will provide continuing, and indeed strengthened, incentives to institutional strategic planning to define each institution's mission and its place in the market for students. Diversity of institutions will be encouraged as the diversity of student demand is met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressures towards centralisation on campus imposed by the demand of the Labor Government's national unified system for information and observance of central regulations will be greatly eased. University administrators will have greater control over institutional budgets through fee structures, the funding arrangements for undergraduate and postgraduate students will be unified and the objectionable distinction between full fee paying overseas students and other students will be eliminated. These funding arrangements outlined in the Fightback program will provide a less politicised, more rational allocation of resources. Financial and human resources will have much greater freedom to move within the system in response to the demand of institutions setting their own priorities. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning, when opening the symposium on the Quality of Teaching in Higher Education Institutions, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, demonstrated that he quite obviously did not have a rational grasp of the issues and problems in higher education today and does not understand what <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>the Fightback program will achieve. Like the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Treasurer (Mr Kerin) before him, who are so desperately trying to find a hole in the Fightback program but who resort to taking liberties with the truth instead, Mr Baldwin totally misrepresented the implications for higher education of our education policy. I found this rather ironical, as he was addressing a gathering of scholars who are seekers of truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take a moment to discover the truth of the issues that the Minister raised. He claimed that the introduction of the national awards system means that institutions will lose control of the discipline mix. This is just an indication of his socialist, centralist thinking. What we are really proposing is a market driven system where students take their national awards or vouchers and then vote with their feet. Therefore, the outcome in terms of a discipline mix will be what the students and what the industries want, not what central planners think they should have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Baldwin also claims that the policy would create mega-institutions. I thought that is what we have just completed under the Dawkins national unified system. What this policy will do is assist universities to develop their areas of strength. What will happen under the coalition policies is that certain faculties within universities will blossom as they display excellence and others will wither as their performance is shown to be below standard. This market driven competition will raise the overall standards of our institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister also claims that our policies will affect the socioeconomic mix in universities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister also criticised the variable fee structure, conveniently forgetting that overseas students who are prepared to pay full fees will gain a place in our universities but Australian students who are prepared to pay cannot gain a place.

I want to look at some of the areas where this Government has created a changed situation in education. I think I am, of all the people in this chamber, entitled to call myself reasonably objective about matters relating to education. Everyone knows that I have stood up my own Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) from time to time on major issues. I have been called all things under the sun by him and he has disagreed with me on a number of significant issues. That is what this place is about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I must say about Joe Dawkins as a Minister is that he has made a number of very significant changes&mdash;changes that were long overdue&mdash;in the political and educational system of this country. I will go through some of them if those opposite wish. When we came to government, less than 12 per cent of school leavers went on to university. Australia was near the bottom of OECD countries for participation in higher education. The level is now about 30 per cent. That in itself is a major improvement which would never have occurred under those opposite. It is something that would not have occurred unless Minister Dawkins had sat down and worked out ways in which the terribly low participation rate in higher education could be lifted. He brought that improvement about. Sure, I do not agree with all his methods, but at least he put himself out the front and argued that case in Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, he has also changed the social mix in our universities&mdash;though not as much as I would like; it is still of concern that the middle class send their middle class kids to universities to learn middle class things and then get into middle class jobs. It does seem, for example, that people living in the western suburbs of Sydney tend to miss out compared with children who come from the eastern suburbs or Wahroonga. It is interesting to look at the figures for the days when the conservatives were running education. In 1939, 76 per cent of all university graduates came from private schools, yet roughly 75 per cent of school children went to public schools and 25 per cent went to private schools. So the figures were totally reversed. It was even worse in the prestigious subjects such as medicine.

I do not deny that; I do not support it. I look beyond the statement to the reason. There is not a massive conspiracy in society saying that only members of the middle class go to universities. The reason why a certain strata in Australian society takes advantage of education is that within individual families there is a premium placed on scholarships. Our children grew up in a family where they were respected for doing their homework in primary school and secondary school. That environment within the family meant that children followed on to a successful university career. I do not propose to go on that path much longer.

It is vital that we do that if we are to recover as a nation; it is vital if we are to fulfil our destiny. I want to go to the heart of excellence in education; that is, quite simply, the teaching of mathematics. Most people are quite oblivious to the crucial importance of mathematics in education. It is a subject that most people shy away from&mdash;they are uncomfortable with it. Mathematics is the very core, the fundamental building block of a civilised, industrialised society. Its progeny are the sciences&mdash;pure and applied science, health sciences, technology and engineering. I do not want to get into a sterile, semantic debate about science versus technology, but the place of mathematics, and how well it is taught, is absolutely crucial to our development as a nation. The mastery of this subject and its application will give us the sort of society which we want&mdash;increased living standards, being able to do something for the poor and the needy, developing industry, looking after the environment and the 1,001 things that are essential and pressing upon us.

If we took 1,000 year 12 students and asked them what they know about the Senate&mdash;for example, how many senators are from their State&mdash;90 per cent of them could not tell us that there were 12. If we told them that there were 12 senators and asked them to name three or four, they could not do it. They could not tell us what the functions of the Senate are; they could not even tell us what the Australian Constitution provides&mdash;something that every American high school graduate can do about the US Constitution. I do not think that we are getting value out of the effort we put into the humanities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer again to the need for schools to be able to produce people who are mathematically literate. To be functionally mathematically illiterate is to be as economically and socially constrained as being unable to read or write. How can people below the poverty line, trying to budget the expenses of the family, do that if they do not have basic mathematical skills? A level of competence in mathematics is absolutely essential in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at tertiary education. I believe that the standards for maths and the sciences should be raised as a prerequisite for entry into university. If a person does not have knowledge of those two subject groups, how can he speak the lingua franca of the age? How can he know what is going on around him? How can a legislator see the possibilities of the future if he is denied some insight into the modern environment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will return to the schools for a moment. If schools are going to teach mathematics, the first requirement is good teachers. I find it absurd that there is an egalitarian principle in schools where schoolteachers, irrespective of subject, are paid the same. Mathematics is the hardest of subjects and maths teachers ought to have a loading; they also ought to have some special training. They have to be competent in the subject, otherwise students detect that and have no confidence in them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some decent examination systems need to be introduced for mathematics in this country. Children love adventure; they love challenge; they love being tested. The education system ought to harness that creative enthusiasm. Children need to be tested on their ability to accumulate knowledge and get on top of subjects. Abandoning examinations because they create stress in the students is absolute nonsense. Learning must take place in an air of peace and tranquillity. We cannot have people, such as the empty heads on the other side of the chamber, stirring children up about nuclear ship visits, protesting about social issues and then trying to teach them difficult subjects. There has to be peace and tranquillity in the classroom. At the end of the day, we have to have examinations to find out how good they are. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move on to the tertiary sector. The need for an improvement in mathematics and science is crucial to improving the level of excellence within the Australian academic environment. Senator Aulich said that not many students are enrolling in the science faculties. We find that many science faculties at the universities now have the lowest entry scores&mdash;some of them lower than human movement studies. Part of that is as a result of the policy of this Government of paying for bodies enrolled on courses. It is a body snatching exercise. The science faculties have lowered their standards to attract students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at campuses, we see that mathematics is weakly represented&mdash;those departments are not as strong as they are in many universities overseas. We find that research in pure mathematics is poorly funded. That is one of the great ironies that the socialists sitting opposite ought to ponder. The countries which treat education as an extension of the welfare system, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, are the countries which fund most weakly pure science and pure mathematics research. Yet in the United States, where the capitalist system applies and given the benefits of pure science and pure mathematics research are not so visible instantly, we find that there is no shortage of benefactors to support those activities, both at the corporate and private levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in developing excellence in education we have to provide career paths for people who are prepared to follow difficult subjects, such as mathematics and science. We need an affirmative action program which provides doctoral scholarships, post-doctoral appointments and research appointments. After all, research in pure mathematics is the cheapest of all&mdash;one needs an office, a decent computer and a decent travel grant to go to conferences overseas. All research today requires extensive computing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems before us are enormous. At the end of the day, they stem from a poor education system.

We need a decent training system, which this Government is not giving us and is quite incapable of giving us, with its reduction to the lowest common denominator, to meet the challenges of staying alive nationally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not agree more with the penultimate sentence uttered by Senator MacGibbon about the need for a decent training system. But if we were to rely upon this extraordinary package of the coalition for some blueprint of a decent training system, the poverty of the whole exercise would be exposed for exactly what it is: a market and computer driven approach to social issues&mdash;social issues which Senator MacGibbon has just managed to put, if not completely out of the curriculum, certainly onto the back burner. The reliance on tricks, half truths, subterfuge and sheer wrong-headedness is almost breathtaking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians, particularly women, as we have been told in surveys that have been undertaken, are beginning to see through this deceit. This is not at all surprising when we remember that very many Australian women previously lived in the United Kingdom. Many of them have relatives or friends who are experiencing VAT in New Zealand. I remind honourable senators that even in the United Kingdom the Government was not blatant, harsh and cruel enough to put VAT on basic foodstuffs, children's clothes, public transport fares, electricity and gas bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumably, the matter of public importance before us today does acknowledge the existence of young people. But, looking at the actual documents which have been produced for our edification, dare I say, one would think that the coalition's main concern is with the institutional and instrumental aspects of education. There are simply no measures for young people in the Fightback package. In a document of nearly 700 pages, the only attempt to address the needs of at-risk young people, those who are most in need of consideration in any education policy, is a statement that an Opposition government would work with the States to ensure that young people have appropriate assistance&mdash;no detail, no funding, no real analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are specific policies in the document which undermine the coalition's stated aim and would severely disadvantage at-risk youth. It advocates the abolition of the CES, which would mean the abolition of youth access centres as well as a whole range of other essential services and means of helping disadvantaged youth to gain access to education and training. The coalition intends to abolish the youth group bureau while simultaneously claiming that the Fightback program represents a massive investment in our youth. It seems absolutely extraordinary to me that there is this degree of self-delusion amongst the authors of this document. Homeless and unemployed youth, like everybody else, will have to pay 15 per cent more for everything they buy&mdash;clothing, basic foodstuffs, transport and electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, this Government has a real commitment to youth and is carrying out that commitment. In purely educational terms, as honourable senators have just been reminded, there has been an enormous increase in participation to year 12, a doubling in seven or eight years, a remarkable increase in female participation in upper schooling and post-secondary schooling, and expansion from 12 per cent to 30 per cent, and a 250 per cent increase, in tertiary participation within a very short period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I became aware of these sorts of things at the time my own children were in secondary schooling. At that stage, 20 years ago&mdash;after 20 years of conservative government&mdash;only 17 per cent of children in public schooling were going on to complete their secondary education. There has been an extraordinary revolution in education in this country over the last few years and, of all the achievements of the Hawke Government, this is the achievement of which I am most proud&mdash;the one which will make the greatest difference in the long term to the quality of life chances and the employment of Australians generally and, most importantly, of young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all the effort which has gone into establishing a relatively acceptable system of Federal funding for private schools, this package offers a fast track back to the acrimony and divisiveness of the 1960s. That is one of the issues in which I was very much involved at the time and worked very hard to overcome, which work eventuated in the development of the Schools Commission. Of all those people who came together in the Schools Commission, who would have thought that a reform program would have elements such as the ones with which we have been faced in this extraordinary document? This is a major ideological shift in the focus of Commonwealth education funding away from the public sector and towards non-government schools and private universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As if this were not bad enough, we are told that accountability requirements for non-government schools will be abolished. This Government has a new schools policy: it will ensure that new non-government schools are established in areas where there is a demand for education facilities. The abolition of our new schools policy as advocated by the coalition would mean that any private school anywhere in Australia would receive Federal Government funding&mdash;tiny schools with handfuls of students, huge expansionist schools and struggling medium-sized schools, all battling for the education dollar. No school would be able to plan for the future. Billions of dollars in school facilities would be wasted. Doubling in the capital grants programs, as the Liberals propose, would have a minimal impact on the shocking wastage of school facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of this there would be no accountability. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts will be very interested if this ever comes to pass. The coalition would reduce the existing 12 funding categories down to six with funding linked to government schools' costs. What will this mean? It will mean that, under the Hewson plan, there will be massive funding increases to schools in categories one and two and very small increases in grants to poorer schools. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I had waited until you had finished, Madam Acting Deputy President. I sought leave of the Senate to make a brief statement on the matter that is before this chamber and I made a brief statement. I will not be compromised by any remarks that are made when the Senate has given me leave to make a brief statement. On full consideration of this matter, I believe that a different course of action would have been taken by a Labor senator had all of these facts been known to that senator. I now leave it entirely to Senator Giles to decide whether she wishes to continue with her original request for all of the pages to be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, or take the better path of tabling the pages so that they are available in the way that she wishes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and its Employment and Skills Formation Council touches upon a matter which honourable senators on this side of the chamber have been concerned about for a long time. The present Government has set up a National Board of Employment, Education and Training for which it has not given sufficient authority, sufficient independence or sufficient resources. It is no wonder that when we get a document such as this tabled in the Parliament we are inadequately informed, because the National Board of Employment, Education and Training has been placed in the pocket of this centralist Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition wishes to move towards the abolition of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and bring back a genuinely independent Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission which will be able, with proper resources and with proper access to the whole education community in Australia, to bring independent advice to us when we are in government and not have this farce whereby the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, and his assistant, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, have denied this country an independent coordinating voice of advice about education matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Board has four councils. The four councils are concerned with higher education, technical and further education and skills formation, schools, and research. These four councils have very important functions. We have a compromise of those very important functions because the Board to which they report and through which they gain their secretarial and other support has not been given the resources and independence that it deserves from the Labor Government. The way ahead will come about only with a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, who represents Minister Dawkins, is in the chamber. I was very disappointed with the ill-prepared speech that he gave in the Senate on the matter of public importance this afternoon on education matters. Having heard Senator Bolkus, representing Minister Dawkins, I have got to the point where I am totally dispirited about any possible education reform from this Labor Government. With or without any advice from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, the only way ahead is to see a change of government and to see the full education policies of the Fightback policy package of the Liberal and National parties implemented so that we might get the kind of reforms which will bring back international standards in education for Australia and public confidence in the education provisions of this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The 1990-91 report of the Bureau of Meteorology is the first self-contained annual report of the Bureau since 1973. Between 1974 and 1990 brief reports on Bureau activities were included in the annual reports of the departments of Science and Consumer Affairs, Science and Environment, Science and Technology, Administrative Services, et cetera. It is good to see that such an important area has a report of its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the letter of transmittal in the report the Director of Meteorology, Mr Zillman, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the relocation of the Bureau to the ASETT Portfolio has established the foundation for close and effective interaction with the policy development process in respect of a range of meteorology-related environmental issues such as ozone depletion, the greenhouse effect and global environmental change.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to talk about the achievements of its staff, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bureau of Meteorology is notable for the high percentage of its staff who have spent most of their careers in the geographically dispersed, round-the-clock meteorological operations that underpin the provision of the nation's weather and climate services.</PARA>
<PARA>As a person who has been a farmer all his life, I believe that weather forecasting is very important to the people on the land. Flood forecasting is very important as well. The warnings that the Bureau gives at different times have been very helpful to all of us in the farming sectors, as well as to the shire councils and those who live in country areas&mdash;and not to forget the people who live in city areas. Although people who live in the city are more worried about whether the weekend will be fine and nice so that they can go to the beach or play their sport, the farmers in the country areas are sometimes hoping that it will rain like heck to help them with some of their crop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its goals, the Bureau says that it works towards the reduction of the social and economic impact of natural disasters. We have a natural disaster at the moment in Australia with the drought that is pervading some 60 per cent of New South Wales and causing untold heartbreak and hardship. It is quite interesting that the weather conditions from July 1990 to June 1991 have changed dramatically. We have had floods and droughts in different areas, we have had floods again and we have had more drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Bureau makes note of the El Nino effect. I believe that if it is scientifically factual that the El Nino does have a big effect on our weather, there should be much more research done into it. The Bureau should be applying itself to getting early forewarning of the changes that it brings about. It should be noted that the Drought Policy Review Task Force, which was looking for a national drought policy, made mention in its report that priority should be given to research and the application of remote sensing and geographic information systems. It also said that the Bureau of Meteorology should refine its drought watch service as much as possible to specific geographic locations and that State agricultural extension and advisory services should publicise more widely the existence of this service and the number of private services available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that in its report the Bureau noted that it had put out descriptive articles about the broad scale controls of the Australian climate, including the El Nino southern oscillation phenomenon. These articles were prepared for rural newspapers and farmer-oriented magazines. I congratulate the Bureau on the work it is doing, but it has a lot more work to do to make sure that people in farming areas and people in different enterprises in Australia have earlier warning. That will require more research and more money for research in this very vital area. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal before us today was not able to be tabled until about an hour ago. I would like to bring one matter of importance in this document to the attention of the Senate. In her overview of the 1990-91 financial year, the national convener of the SSAT, Ms Anne Coghlan, was moved to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the salary dollars allocated to the Tribunal were not sufficient to enable us to function satisfactorily and $53,000 had to be transferred from the administrative allocation. This arrangement might have solved the problem in the short term but in the long run is not a satisfactory way to operate. The Tribunal should be given an allocation to allow it to function effectively and properly.</PARA>
<PARA>This appears to me to be a situation which should not be allowed to continue. If administrative money is being shifted to salaries, then the issue ought to be addressed as to whether the Tribunal has sufficient money for salaries or whether other measures ought to be taken to redress this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at 30 June 1991, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal employed 61 full time personnel, including 39 support staff. Twenty-six of these staff were paid at the ASO6 level or above, with an actual average salary of $32,822&mdash;considerably higher than the allocated average salary of $30,852. As is stated in the annual report, this shortfall meant that the SSAT was unable to utilise its average staffing level of 59. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Despite the fact that the number of applications for review lodged at the SSAT increased by 10 per cent&mdash;or 685&mdash;over the previous financial year to a total of 7,334, the Tribunal received no increase in staff resources over that allocated for the previous year. The staffing situation at the SSAT had become so tight that it is claimed on page 14 of the annual report that without the $53,000 transfer&mdash;to which I referred earlier&mdash;from the administrative allocation to salaries and without the use of private agency word processing operators in a number of offices, the Tribunal would not have been able to prepare its decisions in a timely manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of the SSAT should not be forgotten. Its first objective is to provide a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. The SSAT needs to be congratulated for the fact that, despite its staffing allocation problems, it has been able to reduce the average processing time from lodgment to completion from 14.6 weeks in 1989-90 to 10.5 weeks in 1990-91. Similarly, the average length of time for giving written reasons for SSAT decisions dropped from 18.7 days to 10.4 days during the 1990-91 financial year. Finally, the statutory 14 days time limit for the notification of decisions was met in 77.1 per cent of cases, an increase from 57 per cent in 1989-90. We can see that there have been some efficiency improvements, even without increased staff resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The staffing allocation shortfall is particularly concerning when one recognises the major reforms which are being undertaken in the social security system this financial year. I will outline those briefly. For the first time, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal will be reviewing decisions made by the Commonwealth Employment Service. The new plain English social security legislation came into operation on 1 July 1991 and the Tribunal will be the first external body to look closely at, and apply, this new legislation. On 12 November 1991, the disability reform package commenced operation. Invalid pensions and sickness benefits&mdash;now the disability support pension and the sickness allowance&mdash;have always represented a large proportion of the appeals heard by the Tribunal. Again, the inception of new and radically different legislation will present quite a challenge to the SSAT in the 1991-92 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the concerns that have been expressed in the report and given these additional legislative changes and their implications, I call on the Government to address those concerns. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to speak briefly on the annual report of the Australia-Indonesia Institute. It is very important that we note the good work that has been done by the Australia-Indonesia Institute in its last year of operations. As very close neighbours and good friends of the Indonesian people, it is necessary that we do all in our power to extend the close relationships that exist between the Indonesian people and the Australian people. The unfortunate happenings in East Timor of recent weeks should not be allowed to interfere with the generally very good relationships we have with the Indonesian people and the Indonesian institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Institute was established by the Australian Government to foster people-to-people contacts, visits and exchanges between the two countries; to promote all forms of contact in the media, performing and visual arts, the professions, science and technology, business and trade, sport and youth; to promote the Indonesian language and cultural studies in Australia; and to promote the Australian culture and English language studies in Indonesia. Part of the work of the Institute is to create those contacts in all fields, including the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian media have had an unhappy relationship with Indonesia over a period of time and it is good that an attempt is being made to make contact between the Australian media and the Indonesian media much closer. I was fortunate to be on a parliamentary delegation to Indonesia earlier this year. Coincidentally, at the same time a young reporter from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> was also going to Indonesia to investigate the Indonesian society and way of life. I was a bit disappointed that the leader of the delegation, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, would not permit that young reporter from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> to make contact with the delegation whilst we were in Indonesia. I thought it was a rather mean decision by the delegation not to permit that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Nevertheless, the delegation went ahead. We made very close contacts with the Indonesians generally and that reporter also extended his knowledge of Indonesian affairs as a result of the visit. I am not sure from the report&mdash;which we have only just received, and it is very difficult to go through it in the limited time available&mdash;whether that reporter was given assistance by the Australia-Indonesia Institute. I thought he was, but certainly if he was not there under that program, he was there under some other program. In the long term, it can only help to extend the relationships between the two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the Institute's function is to extend cultural ties. I was privileged only a week ago last Friday to be part of a magnificent display of Indonesian culture hosted by Garuda International at a dinner in Cairns celebrating the inaugural visit to Cairns by the airline. I was rather disappointed to find that not one person from the Cairns City Council could make the effort to be at that function. Apparently, the acting deputy chairman of the Council was supposed to be at the meeting, but at the last minute had trouble with planes. No-one representing the Cairns community, as such, was there to receive the warmth of the Indonesians at the opening of that airline. It was a very good function and it certainly helped to foster understanding and cement relations between the ordinary people of Australia and the ordinary people of Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cultural magnificence which we were treated to at that function is just one of the things which this Institute promotes. I think the Institute will go a long way towards helping the relationships between Australia and Indonesia&mdash;something we must make an extra effort to do in these difficult times. That is an important role for the Institute to play. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in speaking to the Australia-Indonesia Institute's annual report because I think it is a very important activity for Australia to be involved in. As Senator Macdonald said, the Institute was established in 1989 to foster people-to-people contacts and visits and exchanges between the two countries in a variety of fields, such as the media, the performing and visual arts, the professions, science and technology, business, trades, sport and youth. It is those people-to-people contacts that are fundamental to building a better understanding between Australia and Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, in this country&mdash;and I believe the reciprocal situation applies in Indonesia&mdash;there is a very poor level of understanding of what the other country is about. It is true that there are many differences. I am tempted to say that there are more differences between Indonesia and Australia than between any other two countries in the world that live alongside each other. There is a distance of about 500 miles from Australia to the nearest Indonesian territory&mdash;less than that if we consider West Irian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The differences between Australia and Indonesia are enormous: for example, the great ethnic difference. The number of different ethnic groups within Indonesia runs into many hundreds or even thousands. There are enormous cultural differences with a range of Asian cultures, and many different religions. The Moslem religion is the predominant religion, but there is a large Christian community as well as all sorts of animists, Buddhists and other Asian religions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest differences that become apparent to the Australian people is with respect to administration. As a consequence of the revolution, when the Indonesian people displaced the Dutch colonial administration, Indonesia has relied very strongly on a military administration of the country, with the armed services, principally the Army, fulfilling the role that in Australia is fulfilled by a civilian Public Service. That leads to difficulties. I am sure that the difficulties in East Timor at present are partly because there is not a regular police force and a civilian public service administering the region. There are these difficulties in our paths, but we are committed and destined to live as neighbours and it is important that we break down the barriers between us. One of the best ways of breaking down those barriers is to invite Indonesians to visit Australia and for Australians to go to Indonesia to see the differences in each country in order to build understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important for Indonesians to visit Australia to build understanding, particularly in the education field. Australia can offer to Indonesians higher degree training at the tertiary level. I think we ought to be making as much effort as we can to make those courses attractive to Indonesians, because people who go to school or university in another country nearly always retain not only a degree of understanding of that country but also a degree of sympathy for it and its values. Given the problems we have had in the international arena, there is a very real case for improving that understanding between the two countries. I have much pleasure in supporting the annual report of the Australia-Indonesia Institute. </PARA>

<PARA>I want to comment briefly on the annual report of the Office of Film and Literature Classification and Film and Literature Board of Review and draw attention to one or two matters that have been raised in it. Classifying films, videos and literature must be a very difficult task for the people involved, because what might be one person's cup of tea or fantasy may be another person's dislike. The report, in its preamble, sets out these general principles applying to the guidelines:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adults should be free to see what they wish provided there is sufficient protection for young people. . . The classification should reflect what a reasonable adult person would consider within the acceptable limits of community standards for that age group. . . The closest attention is paid to the portrayal of violence and, in particular, sexual violence. . . Certain classes of activity, such as child sexual abuse. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I note that Senator Harradine will be speaking to this report. Being a member of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, which dealt with videos and explicit material, he has had a lot more experience in this area than I have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report shows that, of the videos for sale or hire that were studied, 17 per cent were X-rated and, of those, 68 were refused. I think that shows that the literature Board is doing its job reasonably well. Whilst the Film and Literature Classification Board of Review may be doing a great job as watchdog for what is peddled in our community, I am very concerned that the Federal Government, through the Australian Film Finance Corporation and the ABC, saw fit to spend $270,000 of taxpayers' money on partly making an R-rated sex film called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sacred Sex</EMPHASIS>, which has received a fair amount of publicity around the community. I am not here to say whether that should have had an R classification or an X classification, or that it should not be shown in Australia, but I do question that $270,000 of taxpayers' money has been put into this production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The film includes graphic pornographic scenes, sex workshops and orgies and studies none other than the infamous&mdash;now famous&mdash;sex star from America, Annie Sprinkle.

<PARA>It is certainly beyond me. I am disgusted, as are many people around Australia. In fact, I presented a petition here the other day on behalf of Southern Cross Homes in New South Wales, which obviously is aware of the situation. It was signed by some 170 people who are concerned that the Government, through the ABC and the Film Finance Corporation, saw fit to do what it did. I have written to both the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley).

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's the FFC's standard practice. We have no input into the content of the program.</PARA>

<PARA>This thirty-fifth report of the Committee of Privileges is unique in the history of the Committee, in that it describes in general terms the work of the Committee since the passage of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 and the privilege resolutions of the Senate of 25 February 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coincidentally, and I must say unexpectedly so far as the Committee is concerned, this is the twenty-fifth report since the passage of the Act and resolutions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one, and certainly not the Committee, could have expected that the procedures established under the Act and resolutions could have been so exhaustively tested over such a short period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In compiling this report, the Committee has taken the opportunity to draw together the basic documentation relating to privilege in a readily accessible form for those who are interested in, or need to use, these documents. The opportunity has also been taken to put an historical perspective on the operations of the Committee; the report, therefore, contains a brief account of all reports of the Committee since its establishment in 1966. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a number of points in the repor<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>t, the Committee has drawn attention to its views on how the work of the Committee should proceed; the specific points are at paragraphs 16, 19, 21 and 57. If, after honourable senators have had the opportunity to examine the report and have spoken in debate, no reservations are expressed concerning the Committee's operations, the Committee will assume that the Senate concurs in the approach it has taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report reflects the painstaking and greatly appreciated efforts of Anne Lynch, Deputy-Clerk of the Senate and Secretary to the Committee, who has helped us to deliver a report which fulfils many and varied expectations of Committee members past and present.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the Report of the Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Defence Force Reserves</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 17 March 1989 the Minister for Defence referred for inquiry the issue of the structure and capabilities of ADF Reserves. The inquiry attracted a great deal of interest from ADF personnel, defence academics and the general public. By the dissolution of the 35th Parliament in February 1990 more than 120 submissions had been received and four public hearings held.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Terms of Reference were re-referred to the Committee on 13 June 1990 following its re-appointment in the 36th Parliament. The Auditor-General's Report on the Army Reserve was added later through referral by the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During this present Parliament the Committee received a further 130 submissions, totalling some 2,500 pages, and conducted nine public hearings, amassing over 1500 pages of oral evidence. We also travelled extensively to Service establishments around Australia to inspect facilities and discuss issues of concern with both Reserve and Regular members of the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several major events affected this inquiry&mdash;for example, the pilots' strike during the second half of 1989 and the Federal election early in 1990. A further factor was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Force Structure Review</EMPHASIS> undertaken in 1990 and early 1991. The Committee decided to delay the finalisation of its proceedings to take account of the Review's outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the tabling of the Force Structure Review by the Minister for Defence on 30 May 1991, the Committee sought further submissions and held a final public hearing at Canberra on 26 July 1991 to allow for comment on the impact of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Force Structure Review</EMPHASIS> on ADF Reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been a protracted and complex inquiry. Indeed, Mr President, this inquiry has been a mammoth task, involving hundreds of hours of work by the Members of the Committee and the Secretariat. At this point, I would like to acknowledge formally the efforts of my fellow Committee Members and Committee staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to the Committee's assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of ADF Reserve forces&mdash;Naval Reserves contribute only indirectly to readiness. However, the Committee found that Naval Reserves were performing their current roles effectively and that the estimated annual cost of some $17 million was being applied efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding the more than 20 years and $100 million spent in its development, an operational ADF mine countermeasures capability is still at least many years off. That is bad enough. The Force Structure Review, however, reversed a longstanding policy of employing auxiliary minesweepers manned largely by Reserves to complement the minehunting capability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Army Reserves make a major and direct contribution to ADF readiness. The operational roles concerned relate mainly to surveillance, protection and logistics. The Committee found that Army Reserves provide marginally effective surveillance, ineffective vital asset protection, and an ineffective level of logistic support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The broad costs of the ARes include equipment worth some $268m with planned near-term acquisitions of about $100m; facilities worth at least $130m; and recurrent funding of half a billion dollars a year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has no doubt that the military capability being generated currently by the Army Reserve is grossly inefficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ready Reserves will be introduced at the expense of one of Army's only three Regular brigades&mdash;and essentially without any rigorous consideration of 26,000 General Reservists. The Force Structure Review has reduced the Reservists to `third XI status'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of a total of 35,000 personnel in Army's combat forces, some 6,000 Regular and 11,500 General Reserves are allocated to other than priority roles established by Defence policy. In force structure terms, this equates to seven infantry battalions, or about 30 per cent of all such units in the total Army. Of these, some 40 per cent require 90 days or longer to become operationally ready and some 13 per cent require in the order of a year to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of Army Reserve operational readiness is the weak link in the concept of defence-in-depth. ADF ground forces are manifestly unable to secure the bases required for deployed maritime forces. I stress, this is not a reflection on the energy or dedication of Reservists themselves but reflects major deficiencies in Reserve policy development, equipment and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air Force Reservists contribute only indirectly to the performance of many operational roles at an estimated annual cost of some $12m. This is cost effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The RAAF's most serious operational weaknesses are its low aircraft-to-aircrew ratio and the relatively few technical and other personnel to support operations at forward deployment airfields. The Air Force plan to introduce Reserves as Airfield Defence Guards is sound and will now be enabled by the Ready Reserve Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, no serious attempt has been made to extend RAAF operational effectiveness by widening the application of integrated Regular/Reserve force elements. We believe that Air Force should introduce an integrated structure in at least five or six operational squadrons employing a mixture of Reserve and Permanent air and ground personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee came to the firm conclusion that a corporate planning approach is the only way that Reserve force development will be achieved comprehensively and effectively, and recommends that the Department of Defence develop a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Corporate Plan for the Development of ADF Reserve Forces</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That plan should address, among other things: the introduction of an MCM operational minesweeping capability into the Naval Reserve at an equipment cost in the order of $20m, to be offset against the planned replacement of five Reserve patrol boats by Fleet Support Vessels; the restructure of Army's Manoeuvre and Follow On Forces so that the available Regular and Reserve force structure can be applied to priority capability requirements; and the introduction into Air Force of integrated operational squadrons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that additional resources be programmed as follows: an estimated $100m for each of the seven General Reserve infantry brigades to equip them fully; in the order of $2m in the short term rising to $50m a year after 10 years for Army General Reserve operating costs; and an estimated total $50m over ten years to acquire unit equipment for the three Reserve Airfield Defence Guard squadrons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that the Auditor General's Report on the Army Reserve is a very valuable document both in its own right and for the impetus and guidance provided to the processes of calculating and attributing the costs of ADF activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The past record of policy development and implementation for Reserves has been anything but satisfactory. Transparency and regular review should be features of the long-term implementation process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends, therefore, that the Department of Defence publish a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reserves Corporate Plan</EMPHASIS> by the end of 1992, and thereafter report annually to the Parliament on the extent to which key milestones have been met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, the way ahead for Reserves must accommodate uncertain strategic circumstances, severe financial constraints and even increased attention to the structural concerns of productivity, effectiveness and efficiency. However, the Committee considers that the planning environment over the next ten years or so does not present the major problem facing ADF Reserve forces. As this Report so clearly shows, the central challenge is to redress the failure of the force development process to adjust the military capability of Reserves in response to evolving Australian strategic thinking and the Government's defence policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The origins of the Australian defence forces are firmly based in a reserve structure. The great efforts of two world wars were principally mounted by citizen soldiers in all three Services. But with the passing of time there have been changes in global politics which have led to changes within the Australian Defence Force structure. There also has been a move within Australia across a range of governments towards more self-reliance in the Australian defence forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Self-reliance is the goal we are all working for. In reality, it can never be obtained in absolute terms. But, again, it has affected the way the defence forces are put together. These factors over a period of time have led to the development of a professional, full time D<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>efence Force for Australia, supported by reserve forces. Admittedly, the professional numbers are small and for the future we will have to maintain our principal defence capability in the hands of permanent, professional, full time forces. We also need to supplement those forces in whatever ways we can with part time reserve forces. In one sense the historical role has been reversed. We now have the principal role being played by professionals, whereas up to the end of the Second World War the principal role in Australia's defence was provided by civilian forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report presented today has been very long in preparation. I have been advised that it has been the longest time ever taken to present a report from a committee. I do not know whether that is literally true, but it certainly took far longer than anyone on the Committee wanted to take. We had some circumstances operating that were beyond our control. In the very first instance, we had the great airline strike at the end of 1989 which interfered for a period of about four months in the activities of the Committee because we could not hold public hearings, we could not get witnesses to us and we could not get out to see witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly after that, in the early part of 1990, we had a general election in this country and the Parliament did not re-form until after June. It was quite a while before the Committee could get re-established and work on the report. Then we had a report from the Department of Defence, the Force Structure Review Committee, which in one sense pre-empted the findings of this Committee by bringing down a force structure review in March of this year. The Committee decided it was timely to look at the proposals of the Department of Defence because they were entirely within the ambit of the Committee. All of those things led to a very long period of gestation for this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should like to thank the Chairman, Mr Lindsay from the other place, for his chairing of the Committee. There were the difficulties that I have outlined, and his chairing was excellent. He persistently maintained the direction of the Committee to prosecute its inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should like to thank my fellow members of the Committee, the senators and members who formed the Defence Subcommittee, and note for the record that it was a unanimous report. Most reports of the Defence Subcommittee over the years have been unanimous. We have never had any substantial dissent in a report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can think back to 1983, to one report which one or two members put a qualifying sentence in, but basically we try to put party positions behind us and be led by the evidence that is given to an inquiry. That has led to a series of what I believe have been excellent reports over the years from the Committee. We have been able to reach common ground on what we present to the Parliament. That inevitably involves a little bit of personal compromise in that we cannot follow our own individual hobbyhorses, but the essential points, as we see them, are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report proposes a series of constructive and even radical proposals. It is a very coherent document. It is tightly reasoned intellectually right through. We do not pretend for one moment that it is the final answer to the needs of the Defence Force reserves because that is a continuum; it is moving the whole time. As circumstances change, so the defence forces will evolve. But we do believe that our recommendations will correct some of the great deficiencies in capability in the Defence Force. We would welcome the Government implementing those recommendations because we believe that the nation would benefit from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always difficult in looking at defence to look at one section of it. We were restricted to looking at the reserves in all three services. But to look at the reserves and to change the way they are organised inevitably has some influence on the regular forces. We would have liked to make some changes in the regular forces, but that was denied us by reasons of our remit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is written to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Defence of Australia 1987</EMPHASIS>, which is the policy document governing the structure and capabilities of the Australian Defence Force. It was modified in 1990 by ASP90, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Strategic Planning in the 1990s</EMPHASIS>. Our requirement was to write to those documents. I happen to think DOA87 and ASP90 are now very dated documents of limited or no relevance at all to Australia's defence needs, but the important point is that they were our riding instructions for this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that that was a disability for us for the reason that the recommendations we made will lead to improvements in the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force, and those improvements in capabilities will be useful&mdash;indeed, probably vital&mdash;in a whole range of different circumstances. The restriction, at the end of the day, of writing to DOA87 was not a real restraint upon us. I will quote from the terms of inquiry in the opening part of the report. We were required to report on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Reserves' structure and capabilities (including manning and equipment) with respect to the priority tasks set out in DOA87. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was our principal brief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to look at the findings of the Committee as to the current conditions and capabilities in the reserve forces. I will do this very briefly because I do not intend to take much of the time of the Senate tonight. The Committee looked at the Reserve for the Royal Australian Navy. It is a relatively small component of the Navy. The Navy has about 14,000 personnel in the way of permanent members and the RAN Reserve numbers about 1,500. We thought the RAN Reserve was reasonably efficiently organised and doing a worthwhile job. Similarly, the Air Force has around 20,000 to 21,000 personnel, again with a small Reserve component of about 1,500 personnel. We thought the Air Force Reserve was quite efficiently organised and we had no complaint with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of our time was spent on a consideration of the ARes, the Army Reserve. The Army Reserve is a big force. It has 25,000 personnel. Of that 25,000 personnel, 5,000 are involved in training command and about 1,500 in logistics. The Army Reserve provides something like 60 per cent of the combat forces of the Australian Army. It provides a considerable part of logistic support for the Regular Army, as well as providing logistic support for its own operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee found that the capability of the Army Reserve was not what it might have been. I regret that some press reports at the weekend have been a little extravagant, a little flamboyant, and they could well lead people in the reserves to think that we were unjust in our criticism. We were pointing out that the military capability, that is, the ability to use the Reserve in the short term and in accordance with the guidelines for readiness set by the Government, is very low. We are not critical at all of the quality of the people in the Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an ex-reservist myself, and as someone who has relatives and countless friends in the reserves, I have an unbounded admiration for the dedication that reservists give to the Army; for the huge amount of time, particularly as they go up the ladder, that they put into it; and for the sacrifices they make in their family lives and, often, in their careers because, if they are serious about the Reserve, it is very hard to develop a civilian career as the Reserve makes such inroads into their time and resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day the reserves are not as efficient as they might be, simply because the Government has failed to come up with a corporate plan. It has failed to provide the resources so that the Army Reserve can operate at the level that the Government requires of it. That leads me to the heart of our report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying in this report that in DOA87 and in ASP90&mdash;the two policy documents which define the duties and the responsibilities of the Australian Defence Force&mdash;the Government says, `Look, we want the defence forces to be able to do this, this and this, and we want them to do it at certain times'. That is fine. We accept that. But the Government has not given the various branches of the Services&mdash;particularly the reserves&mdash;the resources they need to carry it out. The reserves are short of money and desperately short of equipment. Reserves cannot train if they do not have equipment and, what is more, they cannot fulfil their roles. There are readiness times of 28 days, 90 days, 180 days and up to 360 days for some of the units. Equipment cannot be got to them in that time so they simply cannot fulfil the obligations put upon them by the Government in its policy directives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor has the Government&mdash;and in one sense this is an even bigger sin&mdash;altered the force structure and arranged the disposition of personnel within the reserves to fulfil the role, particularly in the case of the Army, that the Government wants them to perform. Our recommendations certainly involve a recommendation that the Government spend money, principally to rectify the equipment defects from which the reserves are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a realistic estimate in the light of good information as to what we think will be needed to bring the reserves to an adequate level. We make the point that something like half a billion dollars a year, over $500m, is invested in the reserves at the present time and we are getting very little from it. The point to be made is that we only need to go a little bit further to reap a very much greater capability from the reserves. We have been forced to request that as additional funding in our report. We were required, in one of the latter parts of our instructions, to comment on the financial implications of what we were proposing but we were not allowed to go into restructuring the whole of the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would have liked to go into the whole of the defence forces and, particularly, to have cleaned out the huge administrative overheads, particularly in Canberra where, by my estimate, we have something like 132 generals&mdash;that is, one-star, two-star, three-star and four-star generals&mdash;in all three services. It is a structure of comic opera proportions. Every one of those generals has a huge staff. If we could clean that out we could save billions of dollars in the operation of defence and put that money into more effective roles. That was denied us. We were not allowed to go that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early part of my speech I mentioned that one of the reasons for delay was the fact that the Government brought on a Force Structure Review Committee to look at the very things this Committee was looking at. That Committee reported in March this year. It pre-empted the findings of this Committee. It would have been correct for the Government to have held off appointing that Committee until it had received this report. Had that happened, the Government would have got this report six months earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Force Structure Review Committee, with the passing of time, stands increasingly exposed as being very shallow, very superficial and lacking any intellectual content at all. When attending functions in Canberra, it is very interesting to talk with uniformed and civilian members of the Department of Defence and to observe the derision that now is heaped upon the Force Structure Review by people in defence. It simply has no status at all. Without being unkind to the Force Structure Review Committee, it brought an attitude of mind to it that, since all the members were Army members and had worn uniforms all their lives, they knew all about the reserves and did not need to look at what they were proposing in the way of force structure review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the Senate briefly two examples of that. One of the most important Reserve exercises in Australia in the Army has been the integration exercise in 6 Brigade in Queensland where Reserve units have been integrated with Regular units. This was recommended by the Millar inquiry in the 1970s. It took Defence, with its lightning speed, over 10 years to implement it. Initially, when it was trialled in 6 Brigade, there were certainly problems, but those problems have been worked through and overcome. I have no hesitation in saying that 6 Brigade today is a brilliant example of integration. Having built up to that point, the Force Structure Review Committee recommended that it be disbanded and thrown out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Review Committee was entitled to that point of view, but it was not entitled to come to that decision without having the courtesy even to go and talk to the officers and the men and women of 6 Brigade to find out how it was working. There are two regular battalions in 6 Brigade&mdash;6 Battalion RAR and 8/9 Battalion RAR&mdash;linked with a third battalion in the brigade, that being 49 RQR, a reserve infantry battalion. So there is integration at that level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a different sense there is integration within units. The regular artillery unit has a reserve battery. One of the cavalry units, 2/14 QMI, is a reserve unit integrated into the mainly regular cavalry unit. The brigade has been integrated in two ways. This has worked out brilliantly, with the reservists learning a great deal and reaching a much higher standard of military competence through mixing with the regulars, and the regulars learning something from the enthusiasm and the different attitudes of the reservists. But, no, the members of the Force Structure Review Committee knew it all. They did not even go and have a look to see what they were destroying before they destroyed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give another example of how the Review Committee knew everything. I was talking to what I regard as one of the brightest and best infantry officers in the Reserve in Queensland&mdash;a lieutenant who, at the time, had been in the Reserve for seven years. I was talking to this chap and asked, `How long is it since you have been involved in any live firing exercises with mortars?'. He said, `I have never seen or heard a mortar fired'. Mortars are a standard infantry weapon, a standard tool of trade that is as basic as a rifle, yet here was an infantry officer who had never seen a mortar fired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I brought this up in a committee hearing as an example of a lack of resources for the Reserve, the senior officer on the Force Structure Review Committee told me&mdash;and it is all in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that really that Reserve officer must have been far less than conscientious and must have been quite incapable and inadequate in his Reserve duties to have never had that experience. A fact of life is that people do not pick their own actions or chart and develop their own careers in the Services; that is done for them by a higher authority. The point I am making in this case is that resources have been so constrained and restricted for the reserves that many of them have never even had the basics of military life. More importantly, the Force Structure Review Committee never knew that. It never knew the reality of life in the reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Force Structure Review Committee recommended that we move to something called the Ready Reserve. That gets a whole chapter in the report, and I do not propose to go through it. However, we did comment that we thought too high a price was paid in the abolition of two regular battalions and in the loss of a fine brigade in 6 Brigade. We commented that it makes the Army Reserve of even lower priority than the abysmally low priority it has enjoyed up to the present and that it makes it even more a third eleven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point that the Committee briefly referred to was the way that the changes cut out the university regiments. The Force Structure Review Committee recommended that the university regiments be reduced to officer training units. That might seem fine to the unthinking and the uninformed mind; but, while some of the university regiments in Australia have not operated very efficiently, they have a very important role in putting the Australian defence forces before the tertiary student body of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many students join the university regiments not with any intention of being generals, officers or anything like that; they just want the adventure and experience of military training. They are quite happy to be privates&mdash;sappers&mdash;and bombardiers, to serve in a unit for the years they are at university. They get a favourable impression of the defence forces and it is marvellous PR for the defence community. Reducing the university regiments to OCTUs means that they will shrink to about a fifth of their present size and that they will a have very little discernible place on the campus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I touch briefly on the recommendations of the Committee, let me say that one of the generalisations of our recommendations can be encapsulated in a belief in the need for a lot more flexibility in the terms of Reserve service. In the Army, for example, service is restricted to 100 days in any 12 months. We see no reason for that. We propose a range of duty periods for Reserve service and we see no reason why someone cannot serve as a reservist for up to 200 days a year. The importance of that 200-day figure lies in the fact that it is recognised that the effective time of service for a permanent service man or woman is about 220 days a year. We think that there is no reason why reservists cannot become `career reservists' provided they are prepared to take the reduction in income that comes from that and serve for up to 200 days a year. That will give the country great benefits in all three services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also recommended that there be improvements in the conditions of service. We found that one of the faults of the Ready Reserve scheme was that the Government was very lavish with the terms and conditions it offered to buy recruits. For example, we do not see why there should not be some sort of superannuation scheme for the existing reservists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to move briefly through the recommendations of the Committee. The very first paragraph of the final chapter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received an abundance of evidence to show that, over the past 20 years or so, there have been many sound ideas about how the performance and conditions of ADF Reserves could be improved. No attempt has been made by Defence to implement those initiatives in a sustained and cohesive way. Fragmented policies, inadequate priority for the resources available and lack of commitment have been the hallmarks of Reserve development. The Committee is thoroughly convinced that a corporate planning approach must be adopted if ADF Reserve forces are to become an effective and efficient total force component. This is the overriding conclusion of this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>We recommended that the Navy should develop a minesweeping capability for its reservists, which was always part of the Navy plan but was axed in the recent past without any justification. We believe that mine countermeasures are very inadequately dealt with by this country and that the minesweeping function, with simple minesweepers, is a role that is well within the capabilities of reserves. We recommend that there be eight coastal minesweepers in port divisions around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the Army, we recommend that if 6 Brigade does not meet the standards that are required through the Ready Reserve program, it be disbanded and reformed as a Regular brigade. One of the objectives for the Ready Reserve program that the Force Structure Review Committee proposed was that it would improve the readiness and capability of the Australian defence forces. Of course, the scheme that was put in place does not do anything like that. The level of readiness is still precisely the same; it is still 90 days as presently exists for 6 Brigade. So we have no increase in readiness. Capability is decreased because we are going to Reserve soldiers instead of regulars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While discussing the changes to the reservists, let me say that one of our central aims is to reduce readiness times to realistic levels. We do not believe that it is realistic to have Reserve units on 360-day readiness. We can take people straight off the street and train them up as we did for Vietnam and commit them to high intensity land warfare within a 12-month training period. So there is no point in running a Reserve program if a number of units&mdash;as the Army presently has&mdash;are ready at one year's notice. We want to get readiness times down to about 28 days or maybe 90 days at the very most. Our proposals are based on that. If the units are equipped and trained to that degree of readiness, they can reach a higher level of training in the field when they are deployed at short notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee came up with quite a radical proposal for the Royal Australian Air Force, recommending that it introduce reserve flying air crew. For some reason that I have never been able to understand, the RAAF has never accepted the place of reservists as air crew in any effective way. There has been a tradition that pilots who leave the Air Force will never return to again fly as pilots in command of any high performance aircraft. They can get jobs as operations officers in a Reserve squadron on the ground, but they cannot fly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have come up with a way that is quite unashamedly based on the American reserve system of running six or eight reserve squadrons across the spectrum. We think that it could be applied to cover the transport field&mdash;the C130s and Caribous&mdash;and certainly the F18s, and possibly the F111s if we had enough F111 aircrew. We could build squadrons with a cadre of permanent Royal Australian Air Force commanding officers, one or two flight commanders, and the rest could be made up of reservists on two levels of service&mdash;the 200-day per year pilots and the 40-day per year pilots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we accept a slight diminution in readiness of those squadrons from an operational point of view, we believe that they could be brought up to speed, to an operational readiness standard, within a matter of weeks. We estimate the savings from that will run into many of hundreds of millions of dollars each year. There are great savings in that. The reason for doing that is not so much to save money but because the Air Force does not have enough pilots. The great difficulty the RAAF has suffered in recent years has been in having more aircraft than experienced pilots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rule of thumb is that about 2 1/2 to three pilots or crew are needed for aircraft such as the F111s, F18s and the P3s on maritime patrols. In the case of the P3s, for example, where there are 10 aircraft in a squadron, there have never been more than seven trained air crew at any one time in a squadron. To meet any surge and to be able to sustain that surge in a defence emergency is quite beyond us. The real importance of what we are proposing with the RAAF restructuring is that it gets the surge capacity from the reservists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, if I could be so bold as to forecast the Government's response, my anticipation is that the Government will meet this report with absolute silence. I do not think that it will even damn it with faint praise. But, like a good wine, it will live on and get better year by year and more and more intelligent people will read it and put pressure on the Government to lift the capabilities of the Australian defence forces to the level that the Australian public deserve and, given the money that we put into it, we really should have. I commend the report to the Senate and to the public. </PARA>

The ones with whom I had most to do were Dr Gibb, who has gone to private practice; Bronwyn McNaughton, whom I think you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would agree served this Committee with great distinction and great praise; and our present secretary, Mr Frank Tallarita.

Madam Acting Deputy President, I conclude my remarks by thanking you most sincerely for the way in which you have so ably joined with me in making this what I consider to be a very good Committee.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TABLING STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the evening of 11 June 1970 the Australian Senate passed an historic resolution to establish seven Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees and five Estimates Committees. That decision has been described as having `revolutionised the Parliament as a whole' and has had far reaching effects on the Australian system of parliamentary government changing the nature of much parliamentary activity and affecting the way in which executive government carries out its business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee (renamed the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee), one of the seven Committees originally proposed by Senator Lionel Murphy, was formally established on 6 October 1971. In those 20 years, focusing as it does on questions of a legal and constitutional nature, the Committee's work has ranged widely over many areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To a large extent, the Committee's concerns have reflected concerns in the wider community. Important instances of this include the Committee's inquiry into family law and the Family Law Bill, its work on the legal status of children conceived through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), and more recently its inquiry into the cost of legal services and litigation. This inquiry has become known as the `cost of justice inquiry'. The Committee has spent a great deal of its time canvassing issues at public hearings, and sifting through more than 250 written submissions and has released several discussion papers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the tendency to conduct more wide ranging inquiries in recent times, the Committee has also been required to examine legislative proposals such as the Privacy Bill 1986, and the feasibility of a national ID scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the major example of a long and detailed examination of legislation by the Committee has been its involvement with the freedom of information proposals and subsequently, legislation. The Committee canvassed the development of the awareness of FOI, examined the philosophical foundation of the concept of FOI and considered the implications of FOI legislation for a Westminster style of government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems that Committee members are busier than perhaps ever before. There are today more ministers in the Senate than at any other time, leaving fewer backbenchers for appointment to committees. At the same time, the number of committees continues to increase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One trend which has emerged in recent times and which is bound to affect the future work of the Committee is the referral of bills to committees. In the 1990s the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has taken on this extra workload with no accompanying diminution in its general workload of longer term inquiries, but rather the opposite. A major reason for the Committee's success has been the support and dedication it has received from past and present secretaries and secretariat staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has responded to the concerns of the time. In doing so it has demonstrated its versatility and flexibility. Simultaneously it has brought to bear an expertise, narrowly based in the law, yet broadly based in terms of other experience on matters of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is arguably the Senate's most active standing committee and enjoys the enthusiastic support of its members and looks forward to continuing the work done so ably by its past members.</PARA>

<PARA>The effect of the amendments is to delete from the Government's motion the desire of the Government to meet for the fourth week and to provide for the Senate to sit on the two Tuesday mornings in weeks 2 and 3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we take this action at this time is that we have been working&mdash;with the Government, I think I can say, and the Australian Democrats&mdash;on a program that has been monitored on a weekly basis to enable the Senate to dispose of the essential workload of the Government by 13 December. We have sat long hours to achieve that aim. On many nights we have sat until the early hours of the following morning. We have basically been able to maintain that program. Occasionally we might have fallen behind a Bill or two, but in no way have we fallen behind to the extent that it cannot be reasonably easily made up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It therefore seems to us that at the moment there is no reason to justify a further week's sitting. The time will simply be filled up with work which is unnecessary at this time of the year. The Senate has set a program which will enable honourable senators to return to their electorates, to have a clear week in their electorates before Christmas, which seems to be commonsense. We would achieve something that the Senate has not been able to achieve in recent years. For the Government to undermine that program, and the long hours that honourable senators have sat to achieve that program, would be counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have said is that we are happy to extend the sitting hours for the next two weeks to help maintain the schedule which has been set. Therefore, we agree to the two Tuesday mornings being added to the program as previously agreed, but we do not see any basis at this moment for agreeing to a further sitting of one week. We say to the Government, `Let us stick to the program for the next week or two'. I can assure Senator McMullan that we will keep to the undertakings we have previously given but, if the Government falls behind or for some other reason there is a problem, we will address the issue then without unnecessarily locking the Parliament into longer sitting times at this moment. </PARA>

We gave clear undertakings about the work we would complete by 13 December when we said that we would complete that legislation which is essential. It seems to me that some of the Bills before us that we have agreed to complete are not essential because, in any event, they do not need to come into effect before next February. Certainly the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill is one of those that need not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have sat four weeks out of five. If we conclude with the next two, as the Government is now insisting upon, the Senate will have sat for six weeks out of seven with the sort of hours that involves honourable senators getting up at 6 o'clock in the morning and leaving here very late. We did not rise until 1.50 last Friday morning and many then had to catch planes at 6.40 a.m. This sort of behaviour is not sensible any way one looks at it and it is certainly not in the best interests of honourable senators' health. One cannot help but wonder who will be the first person to collapse under this regime that the Government is insisting upon without in any way justifying it. We are not against sitting, but think of the number of days earlier in the year, both in this session and the autumn session, when the Senate virtually had nothing to do and was filling up time so as not to adjourn early. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now faced with a program such as this which is totally unjustified. We have sat late. We were told this morning at the Whips' meeting that the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 would start at 8 p.m.&mdash;it is already 8.10 p.m. and it has not started&mdash;and that we would sit until it was finished. Clearly, looking at the list and the number of amendments, we would be here until dawn tomorrow or later, and tomorrow's session would follow straight on from it. Any government that puts that sort of proposal before the Senate and expects to be taken seriously really needs to go and have another think. It is not responsible management or a reasonable way to expect people to behave. From today we will be sitting a further three weeks, yet the Government wants to sit virtually all night. I support the amendment moved by Senator Hill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with most of the things Senator Hill said. But he left out a vital fact that has led inexorably to this motion. He and Senator Reid would know, because I told them quite explicitly, arising from the discussion at a meeting between Senator Hill, Senator Reid, the Leader and Whip of the Australian Democrats, Senator Jones and me, that that fact would necessarily lead to this motion. We have had a cooperative approach this session. I have appreciated that and I have indicated that in this chamber on previous occasions. It was the shared objective of those six people in a series of meetings that we should seek to finish a week earlier than the Government's original intention. Many will remember that I indicated that the sitting schedule would go to 19 December.

But last week, at that equivalent meeting when I sought an assurance that the essential passage of legislation for the Government&mdash;including the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991&mdash;would be passed by 12 or 13 December, or by that week, I was told that there was no assurance that that part of the program would be passed by that date. I therefore indicated at that meeting, as everybody must have known that I would have no choice but to do, that to enable the legislative program to be completed I would immediately give notice of motion for a further sitting week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing would please me more than to be able to have an agreement that would enable all that legislation to be passed by 12 December. That would be a shared objective of every honourable senator. Not all honourable senators might agree on the outcome of all the Bills, but I am sure they would agree that that would be a desirable objective. But I could not receive from Senator Hill and Senator Reid&mdash;I am sure for very good reasons&mdash;an assurance that the program would be finished by the 12 December. I would have been absolutely negligent had I not accordingly given notice of the extra week to enable the legislative program to be completed. That is self-evident following that statement. That is the missing fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the case that in this Budget session we have had days on which we have been padding out the program to avoid running out of business. There has not been a day this session when that has happened. At the end of last session we agreed&mdash;and the House of Representatives, under pressure from us, arranged&mdash;for legislation to be either introduced or dealt with early in the session by the Senate, and we have had an adequate and comprehensive legislative program every day. I do not want this motion to lead to a breakdown of the cooperative arrangement which we have had. However, the Government has no alternative but to set a sitting timetable which is capable of passing the legislative program. That is our obligation. This is the only timetable that will meet that proper and inevitable objective. It is quite obvious that that is the reason why the motion had to be moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately for Australian veterans, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 continues this Government's tradition of making Budget driven decisions which have a detrimental impact on veterans' benefits. Some of these decisions have been directly related to ensuring that the definitions under which service men and women can claim veterans entitlement are kept as narrow as possible. Others reflect a tightening up in the social security budget that the Government has then seen fit to automatically carry across to veterans' entitlements. This Bill certainly continues that trend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have consistently opposed further inroads being made into veterans' benefits. My predecessor in this area, former Senator Paul McLean, spoke out repeatedly against what he saw as continual undermining of veterans' entitlements. He also often referred to the suspicion that exists between a substantial portion of the veterans community and the Federal Government on this issue. This legislation will do nothing to allay that suspicion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do acknowledge that there are a number of positive measures in this Bill&mdash;they were outlined in the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys)&mdash;which do not require legislation, but which are being introduced by delegated legislation or administrative methods. In particular, I welcome the extension of repatriation benefits to Australian merchant mariners of World War I and World War II. It certainly is high time that this occurred. It has been Australian Democrats policy for quite some time to give full veteran status to those who served in the merchant navy during times of war. Principally through the efforts of former Senator Paul McLean, we have pursued this issue very strongly over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian merchant mariners have always had a legitimate claim to repatriation benefits. It is a national disgrace that it has taken until now&mdash;in fact, it will take until 1992&mdash;to recognise the enormous service given by merchant seamen in the First World War and Second World War. Even so, there is still a need for further extension of entitlements. I trust that the Government, having taken the plunge, will move quickly to extend these entitlements. After all, there is not much point in finally granting benefits to these merchant mariners when there are none left to make use of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Bill is concerned, its most significant measure is that it gives effect to the introduction of a charge for pharmaceuticals under the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The actual charge will be implemented by an instrument under section 91 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, but that is dependent upon this Bill, which establishes the mechanism for paying pharmaceutical allowance as an offset against that charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until now, the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme has provided pharmaceuticals free of charge to holders of personal treatment entitlement cards and specific treatment entitlement cards. With this Bill, the Government proposes to charge those cardholders $2.60 per scrip item with a compensatory pharmaceutical allowance of $2.60 per week and the same advance payments and safety net provisions which now exist for pensioners. This measure will take effect from 1 January. Essentially, these changes mirror the charge which was introduced for pensioners last year under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note that the conditions under which an advance payment can be paid have been relaxed and that the liquid assets test has now been removed. When the prescription fee was introduced for pensioners last year, the Democrats stated that we felt the eligibility criteria for advance payments were far too narrow and I moved amendments in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs to relax them. Those amendments were defeated, so I am now somewhat gratified to see the liquid assets test dumped altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the income test will still apply to service pensioners. This remains a great cause for concern because it is a most ungenerous income test: only $10 per week for singles and $20 per week for couples. It operates to ensure that only the poorest of the poor pensioners and veterans have access to advance payments of the allowance. The Australian Democrats oppose this charge for pensioners and we oppose its introduction for veterans for much the same reasons&mdash;with the added argument that we have long held the view that veterans of conflicts in which Australia has been involved are entitled to receive special treatment in recognition of their service in times of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also indicate in the strongest terms our continuing opposition to the current obsession with applying the user pays concept to the area of health when quite clearly it does not hold up. Anyone who says it does is either ignoring all the available evidence or is choosing to view the issue with his ideological blinkers well and truly on. This charge is yet another example of where cost saving and cost shifting are occurring with little regard for, or knowledge of, the possible consequences or the existing evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The savings to government from the co-payment are estimated at $35m over the next four years. But what will the cost be to veterans and, indeed, to their long term health care? Yes, the cost up front for the veterans is offset; but, as with the charge for pensioners, there are other problems with the charge beyond the issue of offsetting. Despite the claims of some Government members during the second reading debate in the House of Representatives, the evidence about the effect of the charge on pensioners a year down the track is still not in. We do not know the full impact of the charge and it is quite ridiculous to argue that there has been no substantial impact on pensioners simply because they have not been queuing up to make complaints to their members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Ken Harvey from La Trobe University, in a paper written in June of this year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Forces acting upon the Australian Pharmaceutical Market</EMPHASIS>, states that 60 to 70 per cent of pensioners are now paying additional premiums for commonly prescribed drugs which are not covered by the pension increase&mdash;through the pharmaceutical allowance&mdash;or the safety net provisions. Dr Harvey also notes that while the overall CPI fell by 0.2 per cent between the December 1990 quarter and the March 1991 quarter, the cost of pharmaceuticals in that period rose by 14 per cent. This sort of figure is scarcely reassuring and suggests that, as a consequence of the co-payment and the PBS minimum pricing authority, pensioners may be paying more for their pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply do not have the evidence to say with authority that there has been any positive effect on pensioners' consumption patterns or doctors' prescribing habits. It is quite misleading to argue that the prescription charge for pensioners has had no detrimental effect at all and, therefore, it is okay now to pass it on to veterans and slug them too with the same fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the concern that this sort of measure now seems to be the Government's primary strategy for containing costs. Higher patient contributions, co-payments, the minimum pricing policy and the Government PBS education package all tell consumers that it is their responsibility alone. Once again, there is little commitment to look closely at the supply side of the equation and seriously tackle the advertising practices of the pharmaceutical manufacturers or the prescribing patterns of doctors, although I acknowledge the efforts of the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Reference Committee in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, there is more to this matter than the issue of offsetting the charge through the allowance and the safety net provisions. Many of the main concerns remain the same as when the charge was introduced for pensioners last year. I remind the Senate that the original proposal last year did not contain provision for a pharmaceutical allowance or advances; that only came after concerted lobbying from a number of organisations and the referral of the legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. I guess it is at least something that the veterans now do not have to fight for the concessions as pensioners did before them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with the quarantining of the charge and the relaxing of eligibility requirements for advance payments, veterans still have much to be concerned about. Firstly, this Bill furthers the danger of creating a two-tier pension&mdash;and now a veterans' entitlements system&mdash;with a higher rate of income support for those who are fit and well and a lower rate for those who are ill and infirm. Such an approach must reduce the equitableness of the RPBS. Put simply, under this proposal, veterans who are ill will be financially disadvantaged compared with those who enjoy good health, because the latter will not need to spend their additional allowance on pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this Bill is based upon the mistaken assumption that veterans will be in a position to actively protect their own interests and ensure that they are not financially or medically disadvantaged. For example, in order to receive an advance, a person&mdash;or an advocate on that person's behalf&mdash;must make a claim in writing and lodge it with the Department. In many instances, this will rely upon veterans themselves recognising that they are eligible&mdash;in other words, they have kept all the figures up to date&mdash;for that additional advance and that they know how to go through the process of making arrangements to secure the advance. This will be difficult, if not impossible, for those veterans who are frail, confused or isolated in their own home or who do not have access to family or professional support or advice. As was the case with pensioners, the measure relies upon veterans comprehending the nature of the advance and being able to exercise a choice about setting money aside for potential medical needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, this Bill fails to address the problem of multiple scrips being required by veterans at any one time. Fourthly, evidence shows that there may be a reduction in the filling of scrips. While some of this may relate to non-essential medication, some of it undoubtedly will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, what about those veterans with psychiatric problems? We certainly do not have evidence yet about the effects of the charge on pensioners with psychiatric disabilities and, therefore, we cannot say that this is not a problem. Indeed, anecdotal evidence from some community groups suggests that it is a real cause for concern. At the time of the Committee hearings last year, several groups which appeared were worried about people with psychiatric disabilities choosing not to take medication if they had to pay up front for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is difficult to see the rationale behind extending the charge to veterans. I can only assume it is part of the pattern I mentioned at the start of my speech, that it is a kind of automatic extension following on from the decision to introduce it for pensioners. Beyond the notion of, `We did it for pensioners; now let us do it for the veterans', I cannot see that very much thought has gone into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no hint in the Minister's speech about the Government's specific motives in making this extension. The evidence is clear that price signals are not a decisive factor in the supply and consumption of pharmaceuticals. The demand for drugs is essentially beyond the control of market price mechanisms, and it is certainly beyond the control of consumers&mdash;particularly, I might add, when those consumers are frail, elderly, chronically ill, non-ambulant or living in isolated circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, the Australian Democrats do not support the extension of the charge to veterans because we are not convinced that the charge is needed; we are not interested in the market orientated theory that underpins it as it is flying, as it usually does, in the face of the evidence; we do not believe the effects of last year's charge on pensioners have been fully evaluated; and we do not believe that there is adequate protection for the most disadvantaged veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans have every right to be angry about this charge, as indeed pensioners were last year, because it is based not upon genuine concerns for their health and well-being but upon saving the Government money in the short term with little regard for the consequences, particularly the longer term consequences, of the exercise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. I believe it is an important Bill which, through legislation and complemented by administrative measures and various other regulations, achieves what the Government set out to do in the Budget when it brought various of these matters together for action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall for the benefit of the Senate the fact that some important changes, such as the provision from 2 January of emergency short term home relief for veterans and war widows, the choice of in-home respite care and veteran support networks, the expansion of the financial information service for pensioners and the extension from 1 December 1991 of repatriation treatment benefits to Australian merchant mariners of World War I and World War II on the same basis as applies to Australian war veterans, can be implemented through administrative arrangements or delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say that Senator Lees was quite right and, Madam Acting Deputy President, you will have known from representations made to you in your electorate, as would Senator Reid, that the merchant mariners had a good case to put. I am very pleased that the Government has been able to meet their request by making available to them repatriation treatment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, legislation is also required to give effect to certain measures. One would effect changes in the arrangements for payments of advances for pharmaceutical allowance, indexation of pharmaceutical allowance and changes to the operational areas in schedule 2 to the Veterans' Entitlements Act to include the area of Iraq and Kuwait and to specify the periods during which certain areas are to be regarded as being operational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that during the second reading debate Senator Newman asked whether the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) could give a similar undertaking in relation to operational service in Malaya as that given by him to the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), in another place, in relation to operational service in Iraq or Kuwait. I am able to inform the Senate that, if Senator Newman or anyone else can produce details to prove that but for the date specified in this amendment Bill in relation to Malayan service in the areas described in items 5 and 7 of schedule 2 a veteran would have qualified for benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act&mdash;that is, if he or she satisfied the other eligibility criteria required under the Act&mdash;the Minister has indicated that he would be prepared to consider the amendment of the dates for operational service in consultation with the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). As I say, I bring that undertaking to the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, this Bill gives effect to the decision to extend the co-payment arrangements for pharmaceutical benefits under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme from 1 January 1992. Some aspects of this decision do not require amendment of veterans' affairs legislation. The introduction of a patient contribution of $2.60 per prescription item requires an amendment to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme which was established in accordance with section 91 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I understand that the Minister has already signed and arranged for the tabling of the instrument to effect this change to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, legislative amendment is required for the payment of a fortnightly pharmaceutical allowance to offset the patient contribution. I do not know whether Senator Lees, in her contribution to tonight's debate, really gave enough weight to the payment of that allowance, which offsets the patient contribution, because that is what the Bill provides for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these changes are very important. I believe that, despite Senator Lees's misgivings or concern for the lack of really hard evidence, this change can address some of the problems associated with overprescribing and the oversupply of medication and encourage sensible drug use throughout the community. In this case we are addressing the question of the use of drugs by veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also indicate that the Government will be moving certain amendments in the Senate to correct certain provisions relating to eligibility for an advance pharmaceutical allowance under the entitlements Act. I can deal with those in the course of the committee stage. Basically, the amendments are to ensure that the Bill operates correctly in respect of that important matter as far as veterans are concerned. I thank the honourable senators who spoke in support of the Bill and commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>As I foreshadowed, this amendment is required to correct the provisions relating to eligibility for an advance pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. As drafted, the new section 118F included in clause 16 of the Bill does not operate correctly in respect of the income test applicable to the advance pharmaceutical allowance. This amendment would replace section 118F with a revised version, as it were&mdash;I have heard that term before&mdash;to correct the two drafting errors which have been identified. The problems relate to two issues: who the income level applies to, and the income level applicable to a person who is a member of a couple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first problem stems from the fact that a person may satisfy more than one of the eligibility criteria for pharmaceutical allowance. For example, a service pensioner may also be in receipt of a war widow's pension. The intention is, and has always been, that such a person should not be subject to the income test. The income test on the advance pharmaceutical allowance will apply only where the sole reason that person is eligible for the pharmaceutical allowance is that that person is a service pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue relates to the income levels specified in the income test for the advance pharmaceutical allowance. An individual may have ordinary income of $20 per fortnight. The provision as drafted would allow a person who was a member of a couple to have an ordinary income of $40 per fortnight. This should be a total of $40 between the members of the couple, not $40 each. This intention is reflected in the original explanatory memorandum to the Bill and continues the rules applying under the existing income test for the advance pharmaceutical allowance introduced last year. I ask that the Committee consider favourably that amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of Bills that the Senate is now debating, comprising the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1991, the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1991, the Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991, the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991, is an important package. The Bills deal with a range of different issues. There is a significant list of honourable senators on the speakers list for this second reading debate. I am sure that the different speakers will be addressing various aspects of the Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the technical aspects of the taxation Bills are concerned, the Opposition will be led in this debate by my colleague Senator Watson. He will be talking particularly about some of the technical aspects which concern us and various sections of industry. The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill will be addressed by Senator Herron and others. We will be moving some amendments in relation to some of these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) is an important Bill because it gives effect to the announcements in the March industry statement that the tax concessions for research and development be retained as a permanent feature and that provision be made for deductibility of environmental impact study expenditure. There are various other aspects covered by the Bill, including an amendment to give effect to the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) on 13 June to provide relief for small business by deferring the initial payment of company tax in respect of the 1990-91 tax year. The Bill will also give effect to the announcement on 2 August that living away from home allowance paid to offshore oil and gas rig workers will be treated as fringe benefits. There are additional aspects of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) which Senator Watson will elaborate on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill is designed to increase the fringe benefits tax rate from 47 per cent to 48.25 per cent, and the Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991 is to impose a withholding tax jointly and severally on investment bodies and investors where a tax file number is not quoted for certain deferred interest investments made on or after 1 February 1992. The fourth tax Bill, the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2), provides legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and India and Australia and Poland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to comment further on these Bills other than to note that in respect of the last one the Opposition welcomes the conclusion of the agreement with Poland, in particular, and also with India. The agreement with Poland is an indication of Australia's support for that country's moves towards democratic structures and economic reforms. That is a very important move and we wish Poland well in the difficult task ahead in restructuring its economy along the lines of a modern democratic market society. It is very difficult to make the changes that are required in countries like Poland. The task will not be easy and we wish Poland well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address some of the broader aspects of taxation and economic policy. In particular, the proposals put forward by the Opposition in the last couple of weeks to reward and rebuild Australia by the introduction of the most comprehensive and far-reaching package for reform ever produced by any political party in Australia, either in government or in opposition. I will deal with that and some of the comments that have been made, and look specifically at some of the issues that have been raised in relation to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first question that needs to be asked and is being asked is: why did the coalition produce such fundamental proposals for change? Believe me, they are very fundamental proposals indeed. We have introduced such fundamental proposals for change because tinkering at the edges, playing around with incremental change, has done Australia no good&mdash;indeed, it has done Australia a great deal of harm. Governments have been doing that for 15 years now and, in the last eight or nine years in particular, the Hawke Government has turned incremental change and tinkering at the margins into an art form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is the worst recession for 60 years; unemployment approaching one million people; under-employment at least another half a million people; one in every three young persons jobless; savings at record low levels; disastrous collapses in investment and business confidence; a rapidly deteriorating budget position following two years of massive deterioration when we saw a turnaround in the Commonwealth's fiscal position of no less than $13 billion; and our Achilles heel, the balance of payments, showing no signs of sustained improvement&mdash;what improvement there has been is due to the bludgeoning blow of the recession, but even then the improvement has been very limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have seen from the balance of payments figures for October released today, despite the deepest recession that we have had for 60 years, the import figure for October 1991 was higher than the figure one year ago. That is occurring at the same time as we are seeing a very worrying fall in export earnings, coupled with a significant increase in the debt servicing burden which, in the month of October alone, was $1.6 billion. That was the amount required last month to service our foreign liabilities. That debt servicing cost is now running at $17 billion a year and rising, and there is no sign of sustainable recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remain uncompetitive on the world front. We are not paying our way in the world. We must lift our productivity and our competitiveness, otherwise we will continue to slip down the ladder of comparative international living standards in the way that we have done in the last few years. The net result of that is a lower standard of living than we have come to expect&mdash;a lower standard of living for a country like ours with great resources, skills, talents and all the things that we have going for us which we should be utilising to provide a better way of life and, in particular, more jobs and opportunities for our people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's Fightback proposals point the way to a better future for Australians and provide a vision for the future. They provide hope not only for us but also for our children and our grandchildren. It is pleasing that very widely throughout the community, including in the media, it has been noted that it is refreshing for a political party in opposition to have had the courage and the ability to bring forward such important and far-reaching proposals. This is an honest attempt on our part to put forward a coherent, integrated, far-sighted set of proposals for Australians to consider. That is why it has been so well received. That is why I would formally move the second reading amendment which has been circulated in the name of the coalition to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991. Whilst not, of course, declining to give the Bill a second reading, I move:</PARA>

<PARA>The Government has been threatening for months that it would destroy the coalition's goods and services tax and related proposals. Time and again the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that he could not wait for the details so that he could demolish the Opposition. We have been waiting for the great attack to be launched. Indeed, during the last weekend the Prime Minister suggested that the attack would be launched this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today was actually day one. Boy, what a day it has proved to be; it has been a triple whammy. The first was the fact that the Prime Minister, who was so concerned about how he and his Government were going in relation to attacking the package, pleaded for the help of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, Mr Keating. That was a pretty good start to the day. That came out in today's media as a result of what the Prime Minister said at the weekend. But then the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, launched his full-blooded attack on the Opposition's proposals to have a very beneficial and major reform of the health system, for which this country has been crying out for years. Deputy Prime Minister Howe did not like this too much so he held a press conference and AAP reported it. On the wires at 4.09 p.m. today came this blast from Deputy Prime Minister Howe that health costs were going to blow out by $2 billion under the coalition's health policy released this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Less than 1 1/2 hours later, AAP reported something slightly different. It reported that, at a news conference called by Mr Howe to give his first major response to the policy, there was a major embarrassment when he was forced to admit a mistake in the news releases his staff had just issued an hour or so earlier. Those releases had said that, under the coalition, people without private health insurance would have to pay a tax surcharge of $800 a family. He omitted to mention the coalition's policy which said that that applies only to families with an income of $50,000 or single people with an income over $40,000. He also omitted totally to list any of the other major benefits involved in the coalition's health policy. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friend Senator Walters asks: what was his excuse? It was not his fault. He said that he was working on departmental advice, and if there had been an error it was not deliberate. He then went on to say that he was not too sure whether the error affected his claim that the coalition policy would add $2 billion to the cost of health care. I can give the Deputy Prime Minister the answer to that: the answer is that he has made an almighty blunder and that the coalition's policy does not add $2 billion to the cost of health care. Indeed, the net effect of the coalition's policy is that the overall cost of health care will fall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later, the Deputy Prime Minister issued a statement saying that the original releases about the tax surcharge would have been `more complete if they had referred to "some" uninsured people'. What a ripper. My friend and colleague the shadow Minister for health, Dr Bob Woods, put out a press release headed `Howe wrong can you get?'. I do not know the answer to that, just ask Minister Howe how wrong you can get. I am sure my friend Senator Herron will say more about that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second barrel of the great attack today came from no less than the, until recently&mdash;indeed, he still is essentially&mdash;invisible Treasurer, John Kerin. He called a press conference to talk about a few things today. He was going to shoot us down on this package as well. I thought the most significant thing he said was when he was asked what the Government might have to do to come up with a substantial alternative to win back voters. He said, `In government there is always room to repackage what we are doing'. When asked what that meant he said, `Watch this space'. He did not have a clue as to what the Government would do to attack this package. He then went on to say, `The main attack at the end of the day will be political'. That repeats a similar claim he made the other night on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> when he said that he did not think the Government would be able to attack the package on the arithmetic; it would have to attack it on the policies and on the ideology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, I ask the Prime Minister and the Treasurer why it is that almost two weeks after the launch of the most comprehensive package of reform proposals in Australia's history the Government has not been able to come up with one meaningful attack on it. There is an easy answer for that. We will continue to wait, wait and wait if the Government wants us to, but I can tell the Senate why the Government has not attacked this package: to attack a visionary document, a document of hope, a document of opportunity, one has to have vision, to have hope and to provide opportunity. The Government has none of those things. It has no vision; it has no hope; it has no ideas. It is old, tired and tatty. It is dispirited, divided and consumed with personal bitterness. It is infested with distrust and disloyalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that it is now time for a change of government in this country. What does the Prime Minister have in mind for change? As I said earlier, he has in mind enlisting his arch enemy&mdash;the pretender to the throne, the architect who helped him create the deepest, most cruel, most unnecessary recession in 60 years&mdash;to assist the Government in attacking the coalition's Fightback proposals. That is novel and refreshing; that is visionary, I must say!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to some of the criticisms that have been made of some aspects of the coalition's Fightback proposals. In the past couple of days, the Treasurer has claimed that a Treasury analysis has shown that wholesale sales tax has a minimal effect on business. He claims, according to press reports, that the wholesale sales tax adds less than 2 per cent to business costs in virtually all sectors. It is also claimed, I think by the Treasurer, that the Treasury analysis says that the wholesale sales tax cost to exporters is only $810m. He is reported as asking why, in these circumstances, a goods and services tax is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some very obvious responses need to be made to these claims. First, the Government should release all of the details of the Treasury analysis for us to be in a position to make any considered assessment of the Treasurer's claims. If the Treasurer is not prepared to release those details, one can only be highly suspicious of his assertions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the figures quoted by the Treasurer are very much less than those estimated by the Business Council of Australia, other industry associations and Access Economics, using its very sophisticated AEM, developed by Chris Murphy, who was instrumental in the development of the original Treasury model. It would seem likely that the Treasury has not taken full account of the cascading effect on business costs of the wholesale sales tax. This is the underlying reason for the very significant passing on of the cost burden of the wholesale sales tax into other businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, Mr Kerin himself has acknowledged the reasons why the wholesale sales tax is an inequitable and inefficient tax. I refer to his letter of 26 November, just last week, to the chairman of the Caucus economic and industrial relations Committee. I tabled that letter in the Senate last week. Among other things, Mr Kerin states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The services sector is not charged wholesale sales tax on its output, so continuing its input taxation is desirable to ensure some equity with the output taxation of the goods-producing sectors.</PARA>
<PARA>The only conclusion that one can draw from that statement is that the Treasurer is fully aware of the inequity of applying the wholesale sales tax only to goods and not to services; otherwise there would be no reason for him to make the statement that he did in his letter to the Chairman of the Caucus committee last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point is that both the Prime Minister and the former Treasurer, Mr Keating, were ardent advocates of a broad-based consumption tax in 1985, their reasons including that it removed the tax discrimination that exists under a wholesale sales tax between the tax on goods and the lack of tax on services. In that respect, I can do no better than to quote former Treasurer Keating at a luncheon in Adelaide on 13 June 1985. In the speech at that luncheon, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . At present, the tax system contains three major indirect taxes&mdash;customs duty, the excises, and the sales tax levied on manufactured goods at the wholesale level. This structure of indirect taxes is highly discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no logical justification for a tax which discriminates against manufactured goods compared with services, particularly in a society which has seen services replace goods as the dominate field of economic activity.</PARA>
<PARA>There, almost, rests the argument as far as wholesale sales tax versus goods and services tax is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that over the next few months the Government will come out with a major so-called expansion and simplification of the wholesale sales tax and that it will go for a very uniform rate. If it does that, it will still miss a fundamental problem with the wholesale sales tax&mdash;that is, that it does not apply to services. If we want to get our country and our manufactured goods more internationally competitive on the export market and against imports, then we have to remove that discrimination between the taxing of goods and the taxing of services. If we do not, we are just going to load the tax on goods in a much higher way than is equitable or efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are some of the reasons why I believe the statements Mr Kerin has been making on wholesale sales tax are very wrong. Even if his Treasury model figures turned out to be correct&mdash;and that is a very dubious assumption&mdash;it still would not remove the fundamental reason for having a goods and services tax rather than a wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time still available to me, I would like to mention just a couple of other matters. One relates to a very important, and I think valuable, interview this morning on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program. The interviewee was the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, the Most Reverend Peter Hollingworth. I am very pleased to note that in that interview this morning Archbishop Hollingworth said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of faults and anomalies in the tax system. Those things do need to be addressed and I think we can appreciate the effort that the Coalition's gone to providing a comprehensive package and to have done so many months before the likelihood of an election. I think that's good.</PARA>
<PARA>He was then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, should there be a GST?</PARA>
<PARA>He replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I don't think you can answer that simply. There's no reason why you shouldn't tax at the point of consumption. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said that we have to face the fact that there are various aspects of the package, particularly in the area of compensation, where there has to be a lot more debate. I would agree completely with Archbishop Hollingworth on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, in the debate over the days, weeks and months ahead I hope that we will be able to make people more aware than they are at the moment that a goods and services tax of 15 per cent does not increase prices across the board by 15 per cent, because the package of proposals that has been put forward by the coalition includes the abolition of a very wide range of taxes, including payroll tax, petrol excise, wholesale sales tax, the training levy, superannuation lump sum tax and the like, all of which at the moment are direct costs on business. All of those will be removed and the net impact of the goods and services tax, when taken into account with all those other things on the basis of the most sophisticated economic modelling which presently exists in Australia, is that the net consumer price index effect is 4.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even that figure is an overstatement of the real underlying impact. It is accepted by a very wide range of people, including the Treasurer and certainly the former Treasurer, Mr Keating, that the real underlying measure of an inflationary impact&mdash;the best measure&mdash;is the non-farm gross domestic product deflator. Using that measure, the net price impact of the package being proposed by the coalition is not 4.4 per cent but 2.2 per cent. Compensation is being provided to every member of the community either in the form of direct compensation for pensioners, with increases of 8 per cent, or very significant tax reductions for income earners. The overall compensation, in whatever form it comes, far exceeds any likely price impact that will emerge from the imposition of the GST accompanied by the other measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the opportunity to continue this debate over a lengthy period of time. I am sure that at the end of that debate there will be no doubt that the great majority of the Australian population will confirm what they have already said by way of response, that is, that they are very impressed with this package, and that they will see the great benefits to them in a non-inflationary sense and in a way that will provide jobs, growth, hope and opportunity for all Australians. </PARA>

I will be concentrating on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 and the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. While the Government will increase the rate of tax in the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill to 48.25 per cent, the coalition will significantly reduce tax on fringe benefits as part of its Fightback reform package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the Senate's attention to an undertaking given to the Australian people at the last ALP conference that no new taxes would be introduced and no taxes would be increased. Here is a demonstration in this Bill before us today of another break with that commitment. We recall that some time ago there was to be no capital gains tax. So much for the Government's undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, there are no matters of substantive disagreement on this side of the Parliament. I remind the Senate that the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) were subject to detailed scrutiny and comment from the Australian Taxation Office and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) during the referral of these Bills on 15 November to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I refer listeners to this debate to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of that Committee's proceedings for a full exposition of the fine details of that debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity of thanking the Taxation Office personnel and the Parliamentary Secretary for their considered responses. The referral of Bills, particularly taxation Bills, is a useful device in the evaluation of tax legislation. I would also like to take the opportunity of thanking Senator McMullan for his undertakings to bring to the Senate 15 particular issues which were raised at those deliberations and which were not responded to fully on that occasion. We look forward to his speech this evening when I believe all of those matters will be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) is, like so many tax Bills that have come before us, an omnibus technical Bill which contains a number of reforms that were announced by the Government either in the March 1991 industry statement or the 1991-92 Budget. On first appearance, the Bill presents itself as a tidying up Bill covering a vast range of over 29 different topics. Several of these require little or no comment. However, much to my dismay, on investigating the fringe benefits provisions of the living away from home allowance amendments that have been introduced in this Bill, all my comments about the need for simplification of the tax Act&mdash;the need for certainty and the need for a clear understanding of what is required by the taxpayer in a system of self-assessment&mdash;were once again reinforced and I repeat them now. There is a crying need in this country for a set of tax laws that are simple, easy and very explicit. I commend the Government on the simplification of the explanatory memorandum that accompanies this Bill. But this needs to be extended to all taxation legislation and into the body of the taxation Act itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the living away from home allowances paid to off-shore oil and gas rig workers are now to be treated as fringe benefits. The Opposition has many reservations about this amendment as it may well spread across the industrial award system with the consequence that the employer, increasingly, will be responsible for meeting the top tax obligation via a fringe benefits tax regime rather than a PAYE regime. This is contrary to assurances from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment has arisen as a result of a court decision known as Attwood Oceanic v. the Australian Taxation Commissioner. That corporation will no longer have to pay fringe benefits tax on living away from home allowances in respect of operations on oil rigs in Bass Strait. In this case, the payments under the award were, in part, for recognition of, amongst other things, not taking days off. Consequently, the ATO felt that the living away from home allowance should be taxed. Attwood took this decision to the court and was successful. Regrettably, the legislation before us now seeks to overturn that court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Committee hearings I sought assurances that this amendment could be quarantined to the oil and gas workers specifically on the oil rigs in Bass Strait. I was also concerned about the indirect effect of this amendment and the present general outworkings and understanding by the public of fringe benefits. Since then I have been overwhelmed by instances of the fringe benefits tax applying to similar situations. In fact, the Australian Taxation Office auditors are enforcing such and applying penalties to corporations and to instrumentalities even in the government sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Committee proceedings I incorporated a copy of a letter from a council clerk in Queensland concerned about the fringe benefits tax that was payable on camp allowances. Since that hearing, the ATO has responded and claimed that such tax allowances were not subject to fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I venture to suggest that the Commissioner's response was only partly correct. It was correct in terms of the short term personnel who go out there, but not in terms of the norm: those who tend to stay in camps that are established for 21 days or more. Camp allowances are paid to council workers, particularly road workers who need to camp on the job sites. Employees generally spend three or four nights in the camp and then return to their homes for the remaining nights. For this inconvenience, they are paid an award of $10 per day to cover the cost of the extra food they need to bring to feed themselves on the days that they are away from home. The shire council normally provides the workers with a small caravan on site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that has arisen is that the council has received conflicting accounts as to whether it should pay fringe benefits tax on the amount minus the reasonable compensation for increased expenditure necessary since the worker is not at home; whether the payment should be taxed as part of the PAYE tax of the worker; whether it should be regarded as a travelling allowance and be exempt from tax completely; or whether it will be subject to the fringe benefits tax regime. The problem is further complicated by the fact that the ATO does not seem to be able to make up its own mind about the entire matter. Consequently, I would like to table a number of documents outlining this situation. I have sought the leave of the Parliamentary Secretary to table those documents and also to incorporate three other letters in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> relating to the fringe benefits tax, and I now seek the leave of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is understood that the payment by Local Authorities of fringe benefits tax on camp allowance has been raised with you on behalf of the Quilpie Shire Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some time now, this Association has been attempting to remove, or at least minimise, the fringe benefits tax liability on camp allowance. Accompanying this letter are copies of letters that have passed between the Association and the Australian Taxation Office on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Originally, the Association objected to any FBT being paid by Local Authorities on camp allowance. The Tax Office stated that it was payable when the camp allowance was considered as a living away from home allowance. An amount of $2.50 was, however, exempted from FBT on the basis that it represented increased food costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Association then submitted to the Tax Office that the amount of $2.50 was incorrectly calculated as the camp allowance did not attempt to compensate employees for their normal food costs. On that basis, the Association felt that any part of the camp allowance relating to food costs should be exempt from FBT. To date, no reply has been received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other component of the camp allowance relates to the disability of having to live in a camp environment. Although the Association has no details of the case, it is possible that Attwood Oceanics vs Federal Government of Taxation may have some relevance as it dealt with a living away from home allowance based on disabilities and inconvenience.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Fringe Benefits Tax on Camp Allowance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As was indicated in the circular dated 2nd September, 1991, the Association has sought the advice of Taxation Consultants, Deloitte Ross and Tohmatsu in relation to the treatment of camp allowance for taxation purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There appears to be little doubt that, in the case of allowances to be paid for a period in excess of 21 days, the allowance constitutes a living away from home allowance and thus would be subject to fringe benefits taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difficulty arises when individuals are required to remain in camp for a period less than 21 days. It is understood that when an employee is required to remain in camp for a period of time up to 21 days, the allowance is generally treated as a travelling allowance for taxation purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the 21 day rule refers to the period of time the employees are required to remain in a particular location, not the periods from week to week in which they reside in camps. For example, a Council may be engaged on a road construction project for a period of four months and require its employees to live in camp for this period. If Council is working a nine day fortnight, the employees may only remain in camp from Monday to Thursday in the first week returning home on Friday, and spend three days in camp in the second week. In this situation, the period for the purposes of the 21 day rule would be the period the employees are required to remain at the particular camp location, not the periods from week to week in which they reside in camp.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The F.E.D.F.A.'s circular cannot be interpreted as stating that camp allowance should be treated automatically as a living away from home allowance and subject to fringe benefits taxation. Any short term postings of employees to camps would result in the allowance being treated as a travelling allowance and thus not subject to FBT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a Council has not correctly disclosed a living away from home allowance, it is possible to make a voluntary disclosure to the Taxation Office and, in this way, the Council would minimise its exposure to penalties. Failure to make such a voluntary disclosure would expose Councils to substantial penalties. The Commissioner of Taxation has the power to amend fringe benefits tax assessments for a period of up to six years from when the tax became due and payable in order to increase a taxpayer's tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent times, the Commissioner has issued amended assessments to Queensland Government and Statutory Authorities to include camp allowance as a living away from home allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any reduction in the taxation value of a living away from home allowance on account of accommodation and excess food costs is only available if the employee gives to the employer a declaration in an approved form which sets out the particulars of:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the employee's usual place of residence during the allowance period; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) the place at which the employee resided during the allowance period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the declaration must be handed to the employer before the fringe benefits tax return is to be lodged, usually 28th April of each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the declaration is not obtained from every employee, then the Council is liable to full fringe benefits tax on the total cash allowance paid to each employee who fails to supply the declaration and, in addition, the taxable value of any accommodation supplied to the employee will also be liable to fringe benefits tax.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FRINGE BENEFIT TAX:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reference is made to your letter dated 18 October 1991 in which you requested a ruling in regards to the council's liability for payment of Fringe Benefits Tax on Camp Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you would be aware any expression of opinion as to the likely application of the fringe benefit tax law is not binding on the commissioner. When the time comes to assess liability to tax, the law as then enacted and as interpreted by decisions of tribunals, courts and taxation rulings, must be applied to the facts as then established. The following comments on the questions raised in your letter are offered subject to this necessary reservation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are advised, that a camp allowance is taxed at source under the pay as you earn system and included in the assessable income of the employee. While a living away from home allowance is subject to fringe benefits tax, and paid by the employer, and not included in the employees assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Quoting from the award).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A camp allowance is paid under an award to an employee where in the performance of his work it is necessary for that employee to live in a camp provided by the employer either because there are no reasonable transport facilities to enable such an employee to travel to and from his home each day or because such employee is directed by the employer to live in such a camp. Such employee shall be paid a camping allowance of $10.00 for each day (including Saturday and Sunday) he lives in camp.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While a living away from home allowance is defined in paragraph 27 of taxation ruling MT 2030 "It is in the nature of an allowance that it will not ordinarily be a precise measure of artificial expense of the recipient. Rather.. a living away from home allowance is an allowance in the nature of compensation for additional expenses incurred and other disadvantages suffered, by an employee through having to live away from his or her usual place of residence. Broadly, it emphasises that the central considerations are whether an employee has changed his employment location and taken up temporary residence away from his usual place of residence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an employee is simply travelling in the course of performing his employment duties then a travelling/camp allowance will deemed to exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, an allowance paid to an employee will be classed as a living away from home allowance where the employee is one of the class of employees that come within the guide-lines set out in MT 2030. If the employee does not satisfy the tests in MT 2030 then the employee is not receiving a living away from home allowance and is assessable on the allowance received.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The documents include a letter from the Local Government Association of Queensland and letters from the Australian Taxation Office. The letter from the ATO deals only with the short term stays rather than the norm where the camp is established for more than 21 days and when the full impact of the FBT appears to apply. All I can say is that, if taxpayers receive such information under a Taxation Office letterhead, is it any wonder that there is confusion and uncertainty under this system of self-assessment? I look forward to hearing Senator McMullan's comments on this entire issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to refer back to the original Attwood-Oceanic decision. Following the decision, a number of problems arose as a consequence of the gap between the Attwood court hearing decision and the press release No. 68 from the Tax Office, which reaffirmed that living away from home allowances were subject to fringe benefits. During this time a number of companies did not continue to pay fringe benefits tax on the living away from home allowance. This raised a number of problems for both the individual employees and the companies involved. The issue was able to be dealt with during the Bill's referral to the Senate Standing Committee. Senator McMullan was able to assure the coalition that the Taxation Office had no intention of pursuing the individual employees caught unintentionally in this situation. I commend the Taxation Office for its human face in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of what constitutes a living away from home allowance compared with a travelling allowance is far from clear and is proving to be extremely fertile ground for fringe benefits tax auditors from the Australian Taxation Office. The Taxation Office has targeted a number of State government instrumentalities on this point and has no hesitation in imposing significant penalties on any adjustments. Even the Taxation Office itself would have to complete a fringe benefits tax return and the return would disclose separately the number of living away from home allowance benefits provided by the Taxation Office and the total FBT paid in respect of such allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit to the Senate that it would be interesting to note how much the ATO itself pays in fringe benefits tax. Perhaps the tabling of the amount and the working papers could give all taxpayers some assurance that the ATO itself is complying with the law. An interesting question I submit further is: who audits the FBT of the ATO? In the case of construction workers, people appear to have forgotten ruling MT2030FBT, which suggests that in most circumstances allowances received will be regarded as a living away from home allowance provided that the employee can establish that he or she does in fact have a home other than the construction site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further sleeper in the fringe benefits tax area with ammunition here involves the position of taxi fares for employees who are required to work back after normal office hours. The Taxation Office has also focused on this during its FBT audits. The approach of the Taxation Office, I am given to understand, is that, if a taxi fare is provided to an employee for after hours work in excess of one night per week, then all such fares will be subject to fringe benefits tax. This is the case irrespective of the fact that the employer may be providing taxis to employees only in the interests of the employees' safety. I understand that one of the major banks is currently disputing through the courts the FBT status of taxi fares paid on behalf of shift workers. But a whole raft of shift workers get caught up in this scenario. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that, generally, employers would regard such taxi fares as a benefit, hence, I am sure that very few companies would be paying fringe benefits tax on such amounts. One wonders whether the Taxation Office itself is paying fringe benefits on fares provided to its employees working overtime. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will oblige us with an assurance in that area. The Liberal-National Party coalition wishes to condemn in the strongest terms attempts by both the Government and the Tax Office to extend to cash payments, under an award, in the nature of a living away from home allowance, the fringe benefits tax regime rather than apply the PAYE system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) with which the coalition has some concerns. The Opposition will be moving two amendments at the committee stage, one relating to the deductibility of environmental expenditure and the other relating to lottery prizes and winnings and the discrimination that applies to banks. I note that the other amendment that we were to move has now been dealt with, because the Government picked it up&mdash;although it added another 60 days. I thank the Government for its consideration and the benefit that that will give to taxpayers. Naturally, we will not be moving that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also look forward to assurances from the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;despite the fact that we will move our amendment&mdash;that those prizes will not be part of the regime for the purposes of this amendment. However, we will be moving that amendment because we do not believe, despite those assurances, that our principal concern has been fully acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that the Democrats will not be supporting our amendments. Unfortunately, they have certain hang-ups, despite the injustice of the system and the discrimination against the banks. When a party espouses environmental issues as strongly as the Australian Democrats have done, I think its credibility suffers when it cannot recognise and support a justifiable amendment allowing a proper deductibility regime for costs of environmental impact studies that are necessarily incurred under statutes of Commonwealth, State or local governments. Tomorrow may see a change of heart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxation treatment offered by the Australian income tax system can either encourage taxpayers to, or discourage them from, undertaking expenditure on programs to protect the environment. At present, the income tax system unintentionally discourages taxpayers from undertaking certain environmental expenditure. Under the existing law, the costs of studies undertaken to determine the impact a project may have on the environment do not qualify for a deduction. The legislation before us seeks to provide some basis for this, but a very inadequate one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most cases, under government provision the cost can be deducted over 10 years. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An examination of what is done in our neighbouring OECD countries clearly shows that in the majority of those countries expenditure on environmental matters is recognised as an ordinary business expense. The cost of environmental impact studies is written off in far fewer than 10 years. Therefore, the coalition amendment will provide that the environmental impact studies expenses can be deductible in the following circumstances: where the project proceeds, the expenditure is to be written off over three years; where the project does not proceed, expenditure is to be deductible outright. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that if this Government is serious about its commitment to environmental issues it should accept the amendment that we are proposing. In most projects nowadays the law&mdash;either Federal, State or local&mdash;requires an environmental impact study to be undertaken for new projects and the expenditure can, therefore, be regarded as a necessary expense. Comments from industry on the Government's planned 10-year write-off note indicate that this is out of line with the relevant accounting standards which would require full write-off in the year of expenditure. If the Government were to adopt the coalition's amendment of the write-off of expenditure over three years, it would acknowledge the sensitivity of business to environmental expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I leave this topic I would like to commend Senator McMullan for the review of section 82BF which has been described as an anti-avoidance provision. The Opposition is of the view that this could be adequately dealt with under part IVA of the Act or under sections 82KH to 82KLK. I look forward to hearing the Government's comments&mdash;especially those, revealed for the first time during the committee stages of this Bill, on its intention to remove similar specific anti-avoidance measures which appear unnecessary in view of the part IVA general anti-avoidance network as part of the Government's simplification package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment that we raised during the referral stage of the Bill was concerned with the direct lodgment of appeals and the application of review. Under existing law, if a taxpayer is dissatisfied with the Commissioner's decision on an objection, a taxpayer may lodge with the Commissioner a request to refer the decision either to the AAT or to the Federal Court of Australia, and this right of review or appeal is provided for in various taxation laws. Each of these taxation laws sets out the mechanism and the conditions for the lodgment of objections, requests for review and appeals and the Commission's responsibilities and duties relating to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will amend the taxation laws in two ways. Firstly, the application for review and appeals will no longer need to be lodged with the Tax Commissioner for him to refer them to the AAT or to the Federal Court. Taxpayers will now lodge applications for review and appeals directly with the AAT or the Federal Court. I think almost the whole of part V has been wiped out, but there was not much by way of quid pro quo for the taxpayer, or taxpayers' rights; hence our amendment, which the Government, fortunately, has picked up, which will tend to bring this balance back, not unreasonably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there will be one set of generic provisions for objections, reviews and appeals included in the Taxation Administration Act 1953, which is the principal Act. The coalition was concerned about taxpayers' rights in the proposed new legislation, particularly section 14ZY, as this does not place a time limit on the Commissioner within which to make a decision allowing or disallowing an objection. The old legislation, by the way, did not allow this either. However, under the current section 189A, if a taxpayer, having received an objection decision from the Tax Commissioner, advises the Commissioner to refer it to either the Tribunal or the Court, and 60 days have elapsed, and the Commissioner has not complied with the request, then the taxpayer may give notice in writing to the Commissioner requiring the Commissioner to see that the referral is made and the Commissioner shall, within 60 days after receiving the notice, comply with the request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment was not unreasonable, and I thank the Government for adopting it. Now we have virtually a 60-day lapse. Under the present proposed Government system, without this amendment, the Commissioner can take as long as he likes to make a decision on an objection with no time limits. However, we feel it is desirable to have this safeguard in terms of the old time limit set under the old section 189A, and I am pleased to see that the Government has taken our amendment on board and is using the coalition's principle. But, as I say, it will be adding a further 60 days, which is not unreasonable under the circumstances, for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had hoped that the Government would also consider a legislative amendment to include the wording that under such circumstances no further time penalties would be applied to the taxpayer during the ATO's consideration of an objection and that the tax collection would be placed on hold during the same period. However, I believe that these circumstances are covered by what is known as an Australian Taxation Office public practice manual. The Parliamentary Secretary may see fit to table such guidelines. I believe that the tabling of those guidelines would be very reassuring to taxpayers since the Government was not prepared to put that in legislative form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of concern to the coalition is investment related lottery winnings. The banks and other financial institutions felt that they were being discriminated against and that prizes offered as incentives will now be subject to tax. The coalition has no problems with the concept that prizes given instead of interest should be taxed, but this Bill does bring prizes given as an incentive into the taxation network. However, during the referral of the Bill to the committee the Government did argue that, irrespective of whether a prize is given as an incentive or a promotion, it is still the outcome of the investment with the financial institution. The coalition has acceded only partly to this viewpoint, but we are still concerned about this proposal and that is why we are pressing our amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned about a related matter&mdash;lottery prizes that could involve UK premium bonds or other bonds issued from New Zealand which are currently held by Australian residents. I believe that these types of investments, obtained prior to the date of royal assent, should continue to be exempt because the coalition&mdash;the Liberal and National parties&mdash;has never agreed with the concept of retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the second reading debate in the lower House a number of further amendments were introduced. One of the amendments agreed to the principle in my earlier private member's Bill on the realisation of a capital loss for valueless shares which I introduced and had passed in the Senate last month. Under corporations law, shareholders in companies that go into liquidation are unable to dispose of their shares unless there is approval from a court or, in some circumstances, the liquidator. In effect, these obstacles delay the realisation of any capital loss on investment until dissolution of the company. As dissolution may not occur for many years, shareholders with capital gains in the intervening period may pay more capital gains tax than in fairness they should. This inequity is aggravated because our taxation system does not permit the carry-back of losses. My private member's Bill sought to rectify that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has agreed to the amendments before us but has decided to tackle the problem in a slightly different way, although agreeing with the general architecture and the principles of the Bill. The Government's amendment permits the shareholder in a company in liquidation to elect to treat the share as having been disposed of and immediately required for nil consideration; that was part of my architecture. However, its requirement is that the liquidator must first make a written declaration that the liquidator has reasonable grounds to believe that there is no likelihood of the shareholder receiving any distribution in the course of the winding-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the requirement that the liquidator make such declaration may cause such problems. Firstly, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) does not impose a duty on liquidators to make declarations on request by shareholders. Secondly,let us consider a shareholder with a capital gain at December 1991 who holds some worthless shares in a company in liquidation at 30 June 1992. Unless the declaration from the liquidator is made by 30 June 1992, this shareholder will pay tax on the capital gain, being unable to offset the loss on those shares in the company in liquidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the shareholder's deemed disposal and resultant capital loss must be taken in the year of income in which the liquidator's declaration has been made. This may mean that shareholders will have to make the election in the year in which the declaration is made. Otherwise, if they delay in making the election until a later year, they may find that time has run out for amending the tax return for that year in which the liquidator's declaration was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having to request an amendment to an earlier year's tax return is not a mechanism that promotes simplification of the tax system. Therefore, I would encourage the Government to re-examine my Bill and maybe swallow its pride and redraft the section to incorporate the original principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems with my Bill and the Government's Bill is that they do not provide relief to unit holders in a unit trust. Of course that is something of a problem. Further amendments are also introduced dealing with the timing of franking credits for non-mutual life companies. Industry generally supports the amendment to the dividend imputation arrangements to ensure that a franking credit is generated only by the payment of company tax and not by the issue of assessment, and the coalition agrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change should provide some protection for the revenue while reducing compliance costs for most companies in respect of the operation of franking accounts. Unfortunately, the change will not reduce compliance costs for life companies despite the fact that such costs are greater for them than for other corporate taxpayers because of the operation of the special imputation rules, particularly the 80 : 20 formula. In fact, the complexities associated with the franking arrangements for life companies is no doubt the reason for the so-called technical deficiencies in the current Bill which the Government is now seeking to remove. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was noted in the Government's supplementary explanatory memorandum, albeit in a somewhat convoluted manner, it is necessary for reducing franking credits to be recalculated on the basis of the current year's income at the time the assessment is made. In this context, reducing franking debits is a special category of debit designed to reduce the franking credits in accordance with the 80 : 20 formula. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has no concerns in relation to another part of the Bill which provides exemptions for the pay and allowances of members of the defence forces serving in Iraq and Kuwait. However, we do note concerns of some of the servicemen, particularly those resident in Western Australia, that some of the Gulf pay entitlements may not have been fully met. The extension of the research and development activities concession is also welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion&mdash;time seems to have beaten us somewhat&mdash;I thank Senator McMullan for his undertaking given to the Committee hearings on this Bill in relation to the acquisition date for capital ownership costs which are included in the cost base of non-income producing assets that are acquired after 20 August 1991. These costs will not be taken into account. However, in working out a capital loss they will be eligible for indexation. That undertaking from Senator McMullan is along the lines that, if this acquisition date does cause major problems or injustices, the provisions might be amended so that they apply to all post-CGT assets whenever applied. I feel confident that Senator McMullan will uphold this undertaking. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I graduated in medicine 35 years ago from the University of Queensland. For the first half of my professional career I was proud to be a member of a profession which worked without stint for the betterment of the people of Australia. For the second half of that professional career, I have seen increasing government control and deterioration of health standards in this country. I went to the books to see why this has occurred. I am indebted to Mr Race Mathews, a member of the Australian Fabian Society, for a pamphlet he produced in 1989. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This pamphlet updates the health care debate and democratic socialist health care delivery policies of the Whitlam years, in the light of the "Strategies for Renewal" thinking currently being developed by the Australian Fabian Society, in association with Socialist Forum and Pluto Press Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the pamphlet's two parts provides a broad historic overview of the events which culminated in the passage of the Medibank Bills at the 1974 Joint Sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and identifies links with more recent medico-political happenings. The Lyons, Curtin, Chifley and Menzies experiences are reviewed, and conclusions drawn from the successful use of delaying tactics by the medical unions. The way in which Whitlam developed the Alternative National Health Programme, which later became Medibank and, later again, Medicare, is examined, with special reference to the use of questions on notice and expert advice. Acknowledgment is made of the role of inquiries into voluntary health insurance by the Senate and Mr Justice Nimmo, in legitimising Whitlam's critique and conclusions. The politicisation of the open health insurance funds is noted, as is the part played by the health care controversy in the overthrow of Gorton as Prime Minister and the downfall of the McMahon Government.</PARA>
<PARA>We are witnessing today what will occur to this Government because of the failure of the Medicare program instituted by Whitlam 18 years ago. In fact, he spoke in the 1961 Curtin Memorial lecture and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the constitutional position precludes the socialisation of doctors, it permits the socialisation of hospitals&mdash;the best way to achieve a proper national health service is to establish a national hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, socialist principles of collective ownership and equality underlie where we are today. Herein lay the fatal flaw of the Medicare system, based as it was on collectivism. It negated the importance of the individual and believed that the Government was stronger than the market. It ignored reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1973 the proportion of money spent on health care in this country was less than 6 per cent of gross domestic product. In 1976, with the introduction of the Medicare program, the proportion jumped to 7.5 per cent and it has been fairly static since that time. But what has happened to the individual&mdash;to you and I, the patients&mdash;in that last 18 years? The quality of health care has been deteriorating under that regime. Queues have come about. At any one time it is estimated that between 70,000 and 80,000 people are waiting for elective surgery. In my own State there is a four-year wait at some hospitals for hip replacement surgery. The capital investment in public hospitals has deteriorated to less than 3 per cent of recurrent cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did a tour of the Royal Brisbane Hospital the other day and I was ashamed. I could not believe it. I was a resident there in 1957 and the only thing that had changed in some of the wards was the curtains. Instead of being on the floor on wheels, they were hung from the ceiling. I recognised the paint on the walls in some wards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be ashamed to have a relative of mine&mdash;far less myself&mdash;in such surroundings, which are progressively deteriorating because during that period less and less capital expenditure has gone to the States. Has this Government got an answer? Its answer is to decrease the amount of money going to the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private health sector is barely viable. The private insurance funds are unable to keep pace and many of them have dropped out of the private insurance cover field. The number is down to 46 per cent from the 70-odd per cent when this Government came into power. So, increasingly, there is a shift into the public hospital sector. What does the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) want? He wants more of the same. As he said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> tonight, he wants to shift more people across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has developed a two-tiered system of health care. The very thing that he has accused us of has developed in the last 18 years&mdash;that is, private health care is available to those who can afford it, and queues are available to those who cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare levy as a proportion of Commonwealth health expenditure has progressively dropped. It is down to 18 per cent of government expenditure. Yet the poor, simple patients out there believe that by paying their Medicare levy they are entitled to health care. Tell the truth. They do not have a clue; they do not understand it. I am sure the young people in the gallery have no idea that only 18 per cent of health expenditure comes from the Medicare levy. They represent the people who are not in health insurance today because they cannot afford it. The majority of those who have health insurance are taking more out than is being contributed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's answer is rationing. But before doing so, it says, `Let's set up an inquiry'. Already $1.5m has been spent on that inquiry, and what has come out of it? First of all, the Government appointed as chairman of the inquiry a former consultant to the Health Department of Victoria. That person gave a lecture to the Mar Memorial conference. Honourable senators should not think that there was any bias. This former member&mdash;she probably still is a member&mdash;of the Australian Labor Party was appointed as a consultant to Mr Howe's Department on $80,000-odd a year, plus a car, plus superannuation.

This is at a time when the population is increasing at 1.2 per cent per annum; at a time when we have a rapidly ageing population; and at a time when technology is dramatically increasing.

The Minister will remove 5,000. The way to give better health care to people is to take 5,000 out of the system.

Gap insurance will allow the funds to offer different levels of cover up to the AMA schedule level, but they will not be allowed to rebate more than 85 per cent of the fees, leaving the patient to pay a co-payment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is dealing with a series of taxation Bills in a package which includes the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1991. I want to speak on the effect on employment in this country of excessive taxation and the effect of the Fringe Benefits Tax Act, which is rarely appreciated but is really quite considerable. I will make a few introductory remarks about the other pieces of legislation that are before the Senate. Those of us on this side of the chamber have a number of concerns with these Bills which have been outlined by my colleagues Senator Short and Senator Herron, who have spoken previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the good things about this debate is that at least these Bills are being subjected to some debate rather than being subjected to the guillotine after an hour and a half as they were in the other place. It is impossible to justify the use of a guillotine to push legislation through. Those great defenders of human rights in the Australian Labor Party are never concerned about practising human rights and justice in any way at all. They are the most consummate of totalitarian regimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation is one of the tasks, albeit an unpleasant task, that a government has to perform to provide essential services. This Hawke Government has continued to impose on our community a taxation system which is as old and archaic as any system now left in the industrialised world. This Government will not move to a modern system such as a goods and services tax. The Government does not realise that for people to be employed we must have successful business, and to have successful business we must have profitable business. Somehow or other, the barking dogs of the Labor Party think that a profitable business is somehow unclean and unethical. So we have an ever-increasing number of bankruptcies in this country and the ever-increasing level of unemployed swelling the ranks of the CES every morning&mdash;and, of course, we have figures such as the record figures that came down today of the blow-out in the balance of payments&mdash;simply because industry cannot produce anything profitably any more under the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder the business community was very pleased with the Fightback package, which promises to take $20 billion&mdash;I emphasise that figure&mdash;and remove seven different taxes from the tax burden presently on Australian business. Unfortunately, it will be a while yet before we can have an election and get rid of this Government. What we will do is really of little comfort to those people who make up the 50 per cent increase in bankruptcies this year, many of whom have been sent bankrupt by the policies and the inadequate legislation that is coming from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the fringe benefits tax. I voted against that tax when it came in and I am as opposed to it today as I was then. I am opposed to it because it offends a very important principle in our community. Our policy with respect to taxation has always been that those who receive the benefit pay the tax. Because the Labor Party lacked the backbone and because it lacked any courage and principle, it taxed the donors of the benefit rather than the recipients of it. We have this shameful system where we have a fringe benefits tax. </PARA>

In other words, the fringe benefits tax simply has not worked; the smarties have beaten it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area where the fringe benefits tax has really bitten is rural Australia. I speak here with some feeling as a rural producer. The fringe benefits tax has been most unfair for the rural community. It has led to increases in unemployment and a lost situation for a number of rural producers. I emphasise the point that Senator Collins, with his limited perception, has difficulty understanding. The smarties in the city have unofficially lowered their taxable income to moderate rates and transferred the payment for their income to the companies. It is not only the companies that are paying the tax but also, at the end of the day, the shareholders in the company who are paying a tax which really should be paid by the employees. The fringe benefits tax is grossly unfair on those grounds alone. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator VALLENTINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not surprisingly, the media emphasised confrontation outside AIDEX and totally ignored the point of impact conference. Honourable senators opposite might learn something different if they listen to this instead of interjecting all the time. The point of impact parallel conference was held at the ANU at the same time as AIDEX. This conference was held to draw attention to the people at the receiving end of the military equipment being peddled at the National Exhibition Centre. The speakers came from Fiji, Bougainville, East Timor, the Philippines and Sri Lanka&mdash;all countries which have been associated with Australia in recent years through the defence cooperation program or military exports. They spoke of the devastating effects of the military on their society&mdash;of the military coup in Fiji; of the blockade of Bougainville; of Indonesian military repression and the death of one-third of the population of East Timor since 1975, as well as the more recent massacres on which a lot of attention has been focused; of President Aquino's policy of total war in the Philippines; and of the devastation of civil war in Sri Lanka.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not surprised that the media ignored their moving testimonies, preferring to concentrate on the negative side of the campaign against AIDEX and the arms trade. I would like to pay tribute to the Australian Quaker Peace Committee and the Peace Research Centre at the ANU, which organised the point of impact conference, and to Penny Duckworth who worked to prepare for that conference over the last three months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hard for Australians to understand what it is like to live under military rule or to know what a war is like when it is going on around people or directed at them as an ethnic minority or because they are poor and landless. That is outside the recent experience of most Australians. The men in suits at AIDEX admiring the video clips, looking at the models of submarines and missiles or picking up the glossy literature probably have no idea of what it is like to be at the receiving end of their products. Some reports have made out that there were very few offensive weapons on display at AIDEX but it is worth pointing out that wars since Vietnam have been fought more and more on the electronic battlefield and the men who kill often cannot see their targets. Of course, we heard about that during the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Computers and defence electronics are just as lethal as a gun or a cluster bomb on the electronic battlefield. Nor can the front-end offensive capability function without the non-lethal equipment such as boots, tents, blankets, catering packs, mats, Land Rovers, armoured cars and so on. They are all part of the killing machine when contracts are let to the military. They are just as necessary to a war as the bullets and bayonets. It has been argued that equipment is defensive. This ignores the fact that if we invent something such as a radar system or an anti-submarine warfare device, the other side then sets out to invent something to evade it, such as the Stealth bomber or quieter submarines. This encourages the arms trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another international aspect of the protest against AIDEX comes in the form of letters of support from other countries. I will quote from just one of those letters which came from Germany, although other letters from Norway, France, Britain and Germany came to organisers here. I will quote just one paragraph of the letter from this organisation in Germany, the Kampagne `Produzieren fur das Leben', headed `Protest Statement Against "AIDEX 91"'. The final paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We appeal to your government: stop "AIDEX 91" immediately! We support the campaign "Stop AIDEX". In the event that your government allows "AIDEX 91" to take place, we are resolved to take further actions of protest and pressure against your country, for example a boycott of Australian products.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not just Australians who are concerned about this; it is people in other countries as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention Professor Roland Simbulan from the Philippines&mdash;one of the point of impact speakers brought here for the conference last week&mdash;who brought testimonies from 11 cause-oriented coalitions protesting against AIDEX in the Philippines. I will read the names of these organisations to give the Senate an idea of the kinds of groups that have to organise against the level of militarism which is really devastating for the people in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was the Protestant Lawyers League of the Philippines; Promotion of Church People's Rights; Children's Rehabilitation Centre&mdash;many children suffer the devastating impact of militarisation in that country; Medical Action Group, Inc.; Children in War: The Filipino Perspective; Alliance of Advocates for Indigenous Peoples Rights; the Justice and Peace Commission; Repressions and Violations of Peasant Rights in the 90's: Forum for Rural Concerns; the Citizens Disaster Rehabilitation Centre, Inc.; the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates; and the Society of Ex-detainees for Liberation Against Detention and for Amnesty. They are the groups in the Philippines which sent very moving testimonies asking that the Australian Government not support AIDEX. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read just part of one of those testimonies which comes from the Protestant Lawyers League of the Philippines. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the AIDEX `91 will only serve to encourage governments like that of Mrs. Corazon Aquino to increase their military or defense spending on the pretext of upgrading their defense capabilities. In our case, the truth of the matter remains that the "defense capabilities" our government is talking about does not refer to the defense against external aggressors. It is meant to support its anti-insurgency program and prop up its military capability against the local insurgents that had existed for twenty three years now. The tragedy behind these modern and sophisticated arms lies on the fact that most often than not they are procured by governments to pursue military solutions to the internal political and social problems confronting them. Of late, the Philippine government declared a "Total War" policy against the insurgents that led into a phenomenon called "Internal Refugees" when some one million Filipinos were driven out of their towns, villages and homes during and after military offensives. . . harassments, intimidation, arrests and detentions and caused untold death and destruction of lives and properties.</PARA>
<PARA>The story goes on. There are one million internal detainees in the Philippines, and I believe our Government has to take some responsibility for aiding and abetting that situation by providing defence cooperation and training to the Philippines military. A further paragraph of the statement states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For these reasons, the arms exhibition of AIDEX `91 is a shame to humanity for it exhibits and sells instruments of death and destruction and thereby violates the very rights of peoples to life and dignity.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we really have to take this very seriously and acknowledge some responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the portrayal of AIDEX protesters in the last week. AIDEX organisers, the media and the police tell only part of the story. For example, a Channel 7 news report last Wednesday night stated, `Violence was interrupted by a wedding at the gates of AIDEX, and then it was back to business&mdash;scuffles and clashes', et cetera. I was very deeply offended by that news report. It was blatantly untrue. That situation did not occur at AIDEX that day, and I know because I was there. I was there when the wedding took place in the afternoon and there certainly were not scuffles and people did not go back to the business of violence after the wedding, as the voice-over had indicated. When people at Channel 7 were challenged about this, they said they did not have time to fuss with the details. The footage that had been shown as though it had taken place after that ceremony had, in fact, taken place before it and they said that that was a mere detail. They were not concerned about the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been fairly typical of the media representation of what went on out there and, unfortunately, of some of the people who used the media and believed what the police told them without getting the other side of the story. There are always at least two sides to every story. The AIDEX organisers would have us believe that the situation was much worse and that there was a lot of violence outside the gates. They did not bother to listen to the people who were outside exercising their democratic rights to protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir William Keys, former President of the RSL, in which capacity I think he did a good job, was stereotyping the protesters, calling them thugs and accusing them of acting like terrorists. I think that is highly irresponsible for somebody in his position. He was, of course, employed by AIDEX as one of its public relations persons. To have exaggerated in the way he did hardly did its cause a good service, although, as I said, a lot of people believed him and believed the media, and that was grossly unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great cross-section of society formed the 1,000 or so people who were protesting at AIDEX. For example, the Western Australian contingent included three grandmothers, a barrister who is also a m<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>inister of the Uniting Church and who was prepared to stand up for his principles and get arrested twice at the gates of AIDEX, a Catholic community worker, a university lecturer, a mother of four, a mother of someone who had been detained by the authorities in South Africa for many years, and other younger people in full time employment. That is a representative sample of the Western Australian group. There was not one person from the Western Australian group who fitted Sir William Keys's stereotype negative imaging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Monday last week, when I was arrested &mdash;and I was proud to be there with the protesters and proud to be arrested committing civil disobedience at the gates of AIDEX&mdash;I was put in a cell with 13 other women for about five hours. There again, no-one fitted the negative image and stereotyping that Sir William Keys was so keen to portray. That was a random sample of people who were arrested by the police in any old order, thrown into a paddy-wagon and then thrown into a police cell for five hours. All of the inmates of that cell were employed people or people who had just finished university exams. There were professional young women and some older women, as well as another Catholic worker, a nun and another grandmother&mdash;all kinds of people were involved in that protest. To hear Sir William Keys carry on about it, one would think that everybody there was, as he said, a thug acting like a terrorist. It is highly offensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very few of all the protesters there used any verbal violence or physical violence against the police. I do not support either. But open public demonstrations cannot choose the cast, any more than anybody here could choose all the company at a football match. No-one wants to be held responsible for all types of behaviour in any large crowd. We should not be assuming guilt by association. Everyone there was united against AIDEX. They had a strong commitment to being there. I commend all those who were prepared to be out there in difficult circumstances making a strong witness against weapons, a strong witness against the trade in these deadly weapons, as we have heard evidenced by the people in the Philippines and all the other speakers at the point of impact conference begging Australia to desist from trading in these weapons of death, because they know the point of impact and the suffering that is caused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the protesters at the AIDEX gates were camped in very difficult situations. For example, there were no showers, so of course some of them did look scruffy. So what? Let us talk about the real terrorists, the ones who sell the weapons and the ones who use the weapons. They are terrorists. I beg to differ in the strongest possible terms with Sir William Keys for casting all the protesters in a very negative light and daring to call them terrorists and say they were behaving like thugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolve of the protesters was firm and to be appreciated rather than abused, especially when so many people in our society do not seem to care much about anything. The protesters care very deeply about the future of the planet and work towards a better world for future generations everywhere. Some of them were angry and some were alienated youth who feel that in so many ways society is failing them. But, as the Reverend Neville Watson said&mdash;he was one of the protesters; the barrister to whom I referred before and who was arrested twice&mdash;it is better to be angry than apathetic. I agree. Whilst I do not agree with all the tactics of all the protesters, I do applaud their dedication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I doubt whether some of the stereotypical claims of organisers and police are true. I know for a fact one claim is wrong, and that is that faeces was spread on the faces of the demonstrators. I have already referred to that in the Senate earlier today. It was ochre&mdash;o-c-h-r-e; mud&mdash;which was spread on the faces of a few of the protesters for sun protection. A lot of the sun protectors that you get out of tubes and bottles are actually very harsh on sensitive skin. It is very expensive, too, for people who might be on the dole, so a few people had mud smeared on them. There was none of the other stuff around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best kind of non-violent protest, of course, is one where all the protesters agree to abide by certain rules. This did not happen at this site, and perhaps it should have. I would like to mention one of the best protests I have ever been involved with, and I have been involved in quite a few. This was at the Nevada test site in the United States in 1987. There were 3,000 people camped out in the desert and 800 people got arrested in an incident of mass civil disobedience. It was highly organised. Anybody who was wanting to commit civil disobedience had to be prepared to sign a statement that they would not break certain rules which had been agreed to beforehand by a large group of organisers. The rules included such things as no verbal abuse, no physical abuse, no drugs, no alcohol, no running and no unexpected activities. The police had been told in advance that this protest, this mass civil disobedience, this mass commission of trespass, was to take place. They were well prepared for it, as were the protesters. The best kind of non-violent civil disobedience occurs where there is police liaison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was quite a lot of police liaison before the activities outside AIDEX last week. The protesters were very disappointed that the police either seemed to disregard what they had been told in advance or were prepared to follow different orders once the protest got under way. This protest would have been more peaceful had it been organised more like that one in Nevada. But there is, with a minority of groups attending, a resistance to rules even though they have been worked out beforehand by a representative cross-section of participants. So it was not a perfect protest. Hardly anything is perfect in this life. But it certainly made the point that many Australians are strongly opposed to the deadly trade in weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to point out, as I have mentioned, that the individuals did not fit the Sir William Keys stereotype. Neither did the groups. There were church groups there, women's groups, peace groups, people concerned to see foreign aid spent on development rather than on defence cooperation, trade unions, and young people, of course, so there were all kinds of individuals and groups represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, once there was a violent incident the police became the enemy in the minds of some people. The police had a difficult job to do and I regret the injuries which some of them suffered. There was also a very long list of injuries suffered by the protesters, and many statutory declarations have been made against the police who used unnecessary force to remove demonstrators. These claims need to be investigated. A long list of allegations was presented to Senator Tate this afternoon by Senator Spindler and Senator Childs; two of the organisers, Jan and Jacob Grech; and me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most telling and poignant of these statutory declarations was that of Sean Kenan, a community worker in Canberra who has worked for quite a long time with young unemployed people, assisting them to be more positive in their attitudes to life. He has been doing all the kinds of things, that I am sure everybody in this chamber would appreciate and would applaud, in his work with unemployed youth. He was given particularly harsh treatment by the police, who seemed to have singled him out. They knew his name; they knew they wanted to get him, as they said. They threatened that he would be `dead meat', and they used all kinds of violent language against him as he was in the paddy wagon and in the police cells where he was held on his own for many hours. People trying to find where he was were given a different story by the police every time they phoned. They were told he had been released, which was not true. He was threatened with being taken to ward 12B at Woden Valley Hospital, which is the psychiatric ward. He did not end up there, thank goodness, but he did end up at Calvary Hospital. He was very shaken by the experience and he suffered a lot of pain that was deliberately inflicted on him by police officers in the cells. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These allegations need very careful investigation. We have the word of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, that the Ombudsman will conduct a thorough investigation. Obviously there needs to be better training in non-violence on both sides. Each group should refrain from stereotyping the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the confrontations, there were many good moments between police and protesters and between protesters and AIDEX officials. A lot of humanising interaction was necessary and it did happen. But that is not the stuff of which media reports are made. Unfortunately, I have to point out the hypocrisy of the AIDEX promoters. The offer by Sir William Keys in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> last Tuesday, saying that critics were welcome to go on a guided tour of the exhibition centre, was not honoured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was one person who was denied access to the Exhibition Centre&mdash;on the word, evidently, of Mr Bob Day, the Desiko organiser. For some reason or other, he took a personal exception to me and did not want me to be there, despite the fact that I am an elected representative of the people and I am a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade of the Parliament. He decided that it was not appropriate for me to enter his precious exhibition so I was not allowed to go in. The offer by Sir William Keys was dishonoured by the organisers. The following day, which was last Wednesday, Sir William Keys was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> berating Rosemary Follett and other members of the ACT Government for not going in to inspect his precious exhibition, yet still I was denied entry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the media, the organisers and the police telling only part of the story, the protest was very successful. I want to mention a few of the ways in which it was successful. Entry to the site was limited and in some cases possible only when the police cut the fences to get the display material into the grounds. I presume that police officers will be held responsible for repairing the fence which they had to cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that there has been a call for the protesters to remove the ribbons, streamers, balloons and decorations which were placed on the gates of the Natex site by the women's protest last Wednesday. I think that it was Senator Campbell who made this call. He had to admit that it did look very attractive, but he said that the protesters should go out and clean up. I wonder whether he would be so concerned about the war makers cleaning up every last item of their debris after a war. I can hardly imagine that they would go around and pick up every shell, nail and other leftover of war, to say nothing of the bits and pieces of human bodies that are thrown around on a battlefield. Let us get things into perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the protesters maintained a constant witness against this obscene trade fair for its entire duration. It was very important that they did that; that was the main purpose of being there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, exhibitor numbers were way down on predicted figures. There were 200 exhibitors at AIDEX 89. This year, 25 per cent more were expected; that is what the promoters were boasting about. However, there were only 148 stalls, 25 per cent fewer than last time. On the other hand, the protest outside was about twice as large as in 1989. On the outside we had a lot more opposition and on the inside we had a much smaller exhibition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the organisers will surely think twice about staging another exhibition in Australia, despite the bold statements of Mr Bob Day since the event finished. The Australian Capital Territory seems to be out. The ACT Assembly, which voted by a majority not to allow another AIDEX exhibition on ACT territory, is again to be congratulated. If the organisers try to take the exhibition to other cities there will be more protests. They will be bigger and the exhibitors will be put off even more than they were this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a suggestion that Commonwealth land&mdash;for example, Fairbairn air base&mdash;could be used so that the Army could handle crowd control. But this suggestion should be discounted because the Federal Government would be implicated far too much. It has been trying to back-pedal as hard as it could this time to distance itself because of community opposition. For example, the comment by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Bilney, that the Government is neither endorsing nor not endorsing AIDEX is quite ridiculous. He has been listening to the US Navy too much. It was a classic `neither confirm nor deny' statement, which is not good enough for an Australian government Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another victory for the protesters was the point that the police mucked up the arrest procedures. They were made to look foolish by using a common law dictate that arrestees should be bound over for breaches of the peace. The definition of `breach of the peace' is unclear and the police realised that they could not prove that each arrestee had been about to breach the peace. Obviously the charge should have been something more tangible if the police wanted to arrest all of those people. No doubt they will be evaluating the effectiveness or otherwise of their tactics, especially in the areas of legal options and non-violence training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point about the exhibition itself is that some of the stands were not complete. The exhibitors did not manage to get all their information inside the Natex grounds on time. I know that people who went to see models and asked for particular things which had been advertised were told that certain demonstration models were not available and that, unfortunately, all the information that was sought could not be provided because the computer links had not been completed on time for the opening of the exhibition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be interesting to see the figures that the AIDEX promoters come up with in respect of the transactions. This will be very difficult to prove because many of the transactions, many of the deals in these weapons of death, are done over time after the exhibition rather than on the site itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an arrestee, I want to recall how intimidating it was last Monday to be demonstrating within my legal rights as a citizen on a roadway, which is a public place. When I joined the blockade at the secondary gate we were suddenly surrounded by hundreds of police. I believe that about 250 police arrived on buses. Then the tactical response group came trotting up behind in formation. I found myself thinking that this really was a police state. It was a horrible moment. I never expected to feel quite so intimidated by police in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw the operations support group, which is really the correct terminology for the group that people generally refer to as the tactical response group, acting in a very provocative manner on several occasions. For example, on Wednesday afternoon two of the organisers who had decided to make their wedding vows outside the gates of AIDEX were interrupted when the tactical response group came trotting up, again in formation, to disperse the crowd. This was totally unnecessary and absolutely provocative. The police person in charge gave the protesters five minutes to leave the road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People would have left the road. In fact, the side of the road was open. There was quite enough room for traffic to pass by anyway. But, no, the police had to make a big show of force and come in to say, `Five minutes and you have all got to clear the site'. As I said, this was unnecessary. People were pretty hot and thirsty after having been out on the road for a couple of hours. They would have moved along anyway. That was the kind of totally unnecessary provocation which I think the police could have done well not to have indulged in. It certainly has not improved the reputation of police handling of protesters, many of whom were young people who will go away with a very negative image of police management of such an event. I think that is a great shame all around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to pay tribute to fellow Quakers who had a stall inside the exhibition, as they did in 1989, and to Kim Meredith in particular, who organised the roster and got the displays ready. The Quakers were displaying an absolute commitment to total non-violence. Of course, I support that and alternatives to war. It is very important to make that protest right inside the belly of the beast as they were doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the act of resistance to militarism. There is an urgent need for more people to understand the concepts of active resistance, which is very different from passive resistance, and civil disobedience as well as lawful patient lobbying. A lot of that has gone on in the two years since the last AIDEX exhibition in 1989. At least 15,000 signatures have been presented here, for example. Fifty-one parliamentarians from parliaments all around the country were prepared to make a statement opposing AIDEX and calling on the Government to withdraw its support. So a great deal of lawful and patient lobbying went on, as well as the protest at the gates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was promised that the exhibition would be massively disrupted and so it was. If it is stupid enough to allow another exhibition to go ahead, it will again be massively disrupted and even more so&mdash;but I hope in a total spirit of non-violence next time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the spirit of peace and with genuine commitment to the transforming power of love, my hope is that the Australian Government will finally listen to the community concern, expressed in so many ways, and that it will never again promote, endorse or encourage in any way&mdash;not even to the tune of $66,000&mdash;another weapons trade exhibition in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to spend a few minutes outlining the work of a man I had the privilege to meet a few months ago. As people come face to face with the reality of unemployment, they also face total enforced leisure. Where people work in one or several part time jobs, finances may be limited and leisure time lengthy. Some people are tempted to take their limited money to a gambling venue to try to win enough to pay the power bill or another necessity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Radio, television and lifestyle advertising promotes the stimulating urge to spend money, to buy fun, excitement and romance. Some people are particularly susceptible to advertising messages that invite people to participate in a gambling event and `experience the thrill of winning'. But as we all know, one does not always win. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reverend John Tully, a minister of the Uniting Church in Australia, who has been working outside a parish and without a church stipend since 1985, wrote a letter to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in December 1988 suggesting that State governments which license, promote and tax gambling activities ought to invest money in educational programs of the same size and vigour as the tobacco, alcohol and drug programs. The Tribunal initiated an inquiry and released a report in July 1989. It decided not to enforce the placement of educational and health warnings on advertisements. It did, however, state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tribunal is in no doubt that the aim of betting and gambling advertisements on television and radio is to encourage members of the public to use the services of casinos, clubs, lottery commissions, TABs and such like and, in doing so, to part with their money in the hope of a return on their investment. Nor is there any doubt that the betting and gambling industry is a large employer of labour and a large contributor to general revenue. The Tribunal also accepts that compulsive gambling is a severe problem with serious repercussions for the individual and society in general.</PARA>
<PARA>As more people in our society have increased leisure time available to them, it appears that gambling will increase. We are consistently warned of the dangers surrounding the alcoholic and the drug addict, yet no-one warns us of the hazards of compulsive gambling. Just the reverse occurs. We are tempted and encouraged to gamble to the degree where we are considered wowsers if we do not have a bet of sorts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1986 the Salvation Army in Sydney conducted a phone-in seeking response from compulsive gamblers and/or their families. There were 352 callers. A brief analysis of the result is as follows: 75 per cent had lost all their savings; 67 per cent reported family disruption due to gambling; 61 per cent reported outstanding gambling debts&mdash;$20,860 was the average debt and this represents an average 49 weeks income, as revealed by 89 informants; 19 per cent reported criminal involvement due to gambling; and 7 per cent revealed that they had been to prison for gambling related crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reverend John Tully previously worked on his family's farm growing sugarcane, a few vegetable crops and dairying. He later worked as a public servant with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture. With his wife Annette and his three sons he served the church in many areas of New South Wales and the Gold Coast before resigning from parish work in 1984. In 1985 he established the registered charity, New Life Ministry at Street Level Inc. It was with this organisation that I had the privilege of spending some time with John Tully last month when we met numbers of unemployed people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am one of the many people who, like John Tully, are not against gambling or casinos, but I believe that the casualties of the gambling industry must be considered, especially those who cannot afford to gamble. John is a foundation member of the Australian Council on Compulsive Gambling. He is also a foundation member of the National Association of Gambling Studies. These two bodies are able to make the community aware of some of the things that it should know concerning the plight of the families and friends of those who suffer from `pathological gambling', as it has officially been described in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 1980</EMPHASIS> of the American Psychiatric Association. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Neinkemper's claim in relation to work related mesothelioma was first made on 15 August 1990 as a request of retirement invalidity.

I do not propose to ask Telecom to undertake such a task as Telecom is currently enhancing the database with a view to recording details of this nature. It will be some months, however, before Telecom is in a position to provide information in relation to compensation claims by former employees.</PARA>

Receipt of retirement superannuation benefits is a conclusive indicator of age retirement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The science program undertaken on the recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora Australis </EMPHASIS>voyage was reduced because of severe weather conditions and problems with the oceanographic winch at the start of the voyage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. A fault in the calibration of the CTD instrument created an inaccurate depth reading which caused the instrument package (of which the CTD is a part) to ground on the ocean bottom. Approximately 5 metres of cable immediately above the instrument package was damaged and was replaced at the end of the test. Neither the CTD winch nor the instrumentation was damaged as a result of this incident.</PARA>

Although it was not witnessed, it appears the dogs may have killed one seal pup and separated two others from their mothers. These pups unfortunately died despite attempts to reunite them. It is because of concern for the wildlife that dogs are required to be kept tethered at all times when not working. However, while precautions are taken, dogs do occasionally get loose, or wildlife strays into the dog lines. Following this incident the dogs' collars and chains were checked and new clips and collars have been fitted.</PARA>
